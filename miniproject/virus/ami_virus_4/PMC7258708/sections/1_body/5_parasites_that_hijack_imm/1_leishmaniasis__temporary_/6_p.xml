<p id="p0510">Taken together, the innate response (professional APCs) is altered by leishmaniasis infection, leading to polarized adaptive immune responses that support or block persistent infection by 
 <italic>leishmania</italic> organisms. This subverts or supports effective immunity to these parasites, and in patients with persistent infection, the Th2-like/Treg bias may predispose patients infected with 
 <italic>leishmania</italic> species to develop or reactivate lethal secondary superinfections, and the development of HLH-like clinical symptoms.
