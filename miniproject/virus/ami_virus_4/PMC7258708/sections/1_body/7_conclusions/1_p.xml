<p id="p0555">Distinguishing patients with secondary immune deficiency disease caused by a primary infection in an individual with an “intact” immune system from patients with an underlying PIDD is often a challenge. Recognizing primary infections that can cause secondary immunodeficiencies is an important factor in discrimination between these two groups of patients. Clinical immunologists need to always consider whether an acute, serious infection is causing a secondary primary infection in an “immunologically intact” individual, or is the herald of an underlying defect in a genetically defined immunocompromised patient with PIDD. The long term treatment and clinical outcomes of these two different patient populations is linked to understanding how severe primary infections cause disease in these two different settings.</p>
