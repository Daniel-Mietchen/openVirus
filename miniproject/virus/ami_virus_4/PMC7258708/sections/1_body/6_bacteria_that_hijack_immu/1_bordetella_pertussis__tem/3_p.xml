<p id="p0540">Pertussis toxin (PT), uniquely produced by 
 <italic>B. pertussis</italic>, is another secreted toxin expressed by this bacterium. PT ADP ribosylates several heterotrimeric G proteins in mammalian cells, has long been known to disrupt signaling pathways with a wide range of downstream effects,
