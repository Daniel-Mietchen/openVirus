 <italic>B.Â pertussis,</italic> the causative agent of whooping cough, is an infection that can be fatal in infants, but in older children, adolescents, and adults usually causes a chronic cough of varying severity that generally persists long after clearance of the infection. This bacterial infection of the airways is an important cause of infant death world-wide, and continues to be a public health concern even in countries with high vaccination coverage. While estimates of the incidence of new cases of pertussis vary,
