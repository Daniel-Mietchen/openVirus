<p id="p0550">Thus, PT promotes 
 <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection by multiple mechanisms through its effects on innate immunity in the initial stages of disease in naïve individuals. This reduces adaptive immune responses during the initial infection, and promotes re-infection in partially immune individuals. The consequences of these suppressive effects on both the innate and adaptive immune responses induced by 
 <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection can cause secondary infection, typically pneumonia, which is the major cause of fatal outcome from this infection.

 </xref> Infants are at highest risk of all complications related to 
 <italic>B. pertussis</italic> infection but all ages have relatively high rates of secondary complications. Approximately 50% of infants exhibit apnea of greater or lesser duration and a quarter develop pneumonia. Roughly 5% have otitis media and 1% develop seizures. In adults, the most common secondary effect is pneumonia occurring in about 5%.
