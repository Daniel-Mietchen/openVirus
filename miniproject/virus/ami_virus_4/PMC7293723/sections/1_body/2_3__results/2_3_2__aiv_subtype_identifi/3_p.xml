 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows AIV subtypes of 17 samples having HA gene. Most of these were cloacal duck swab samples (14/17 samples). AIV subtypes have been identified including H3N6, H6N6, and H9N2. A predominant subtype was H6N6 with 7/17 samples while only two samples belonged to H9N2. Particularly, the H9N2 strain was isolated only from chicken samples while H3N6 and H6N6 strains were found only in duck samples. Four duck cloacal swabs were containing two subtypes of H3N6 and H6N6.
