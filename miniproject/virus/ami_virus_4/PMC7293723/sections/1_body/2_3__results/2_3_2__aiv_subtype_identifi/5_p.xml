 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the result of the gene sequence for one chicken tracheal sample (coded O89) that was positive with A/H5 by RT-PCR at the first step. Genealogy tree analysis showed that type H5 in the sample was classified as clade 2.3.4.4b (Jiangxi) (Bi et al., 2015). This study strain has the closest similarity nucleotide to A/chicken/-Vietnam/NCVD15A55/2015(H5N6), A/chicken/Jiangxi/NCDZT1126/2014(H5N6)(NCDZT1126), and A/duck/Guangdong/GD01/2014(H5N6) (GD01) (99%, 97%, and 97%, respectively). The study strain O89 contains basic amino acids at the proteolytic cleavage site of the hemagglutinin protein, LRERRRKR/GLF, identical to the typical cleavage site motif of H5 HPAI virus. The residues of this virus including E190, R220, G225, Q226, and G228 (H3 numbering) are known to be associated with AIV receptor specificity [
