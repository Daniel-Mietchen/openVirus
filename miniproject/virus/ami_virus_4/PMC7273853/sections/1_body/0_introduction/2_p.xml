<p>Although various observational studies have analyzed the symptoms of the disease, few studies have reported neurological symptoms, with the exception of headache and vestibular symptoms in observational studies (

The ongoing clinical experience with patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection has revealed a high frequency of olfactory alterations, both in Spain and in other countries, although few data have been published on the subject. While olfactory alterations may be observed in patients with rhinovirus, influenza virus, or parainfluenza virus infection, they are typically explained by nasal obstruction with mucus or direct epithelial damage; in the case of SARS-CoV-2, olfactory alterations present without nasal congestion with mucus. We performed a study of patients presenting olfactory/gustatory alterations in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection in order to contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon.
