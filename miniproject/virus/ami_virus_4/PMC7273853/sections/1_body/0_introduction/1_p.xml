<p>Prior to December 2019, 6 coronaviruses (CoV) had been reported to infect humans: 2 αCoV (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and 4 βCoV (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV). The latter 2 viruses have caused epidemics in Asia and the Middle East. In 2003, SARS-CoV was identified as the cause of severe respiratory symptoms that had appeared for the first time in 2002 in Guangdong province, China; patients presented fever, myalgia, dyspnoea, and lymphocytopaenia, which could lead to pneumonia and death. The virus was spread through the air and close contact with infected individuals. On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization reported the detection of a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) in patients with pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, in the Chinese province of Hubei, subsequently spreading rapidly through China and the rest of the world. The novel virus is classified as a βCoV, and although it displays striking similarities to SARS-CoV, it is genetically and structurally different (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and generates the disease that has been named Covid-19. One important characteristic of the new virus is its high transmission rate (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>); it is more contagious than SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), spreading through respiratory droplets and close contact with patients and infected objects; it can also be spread by asymptomatic infected individuals (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The epidemic reached Spain in February 2020, with over 80 000 confirmed cases currently recorded.
