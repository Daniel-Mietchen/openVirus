<p>We performed a descriptive, cross-sectional, observational study of the clinical characteristics of olfactory/gustatory alterations using a self-administered, anonymous online questionnaire with some open-ended questions (

The questionnaire was accessible through a Google document (docs.google.com) and publicized on social media with the assistance of the Spanish Society of Neurology. Patients implicitly agreed to participate by completing the questionnaire, which was available on an online platform accessible to the target population and the study met the ethical requirements. Individuals who either had a medical diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive test results), or who were under quarantine due to compatible viral symptoms pending testing, were asked to complete the questionnaire. Effectively, patients who participated in the study had been diagnosed by the doctors responsible for care in the pandemic for presenting symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, fever, among others, and being in a contagious environment, for which reason they had been indicated at least fifteen days of quarantine, following the instructions of the health administration, which at that time did not require the conformity of serological studies for the diagnosis. Furthermore, all the included patients presented alterations in taste or smell. Data were recorded in a database between 20 and 24 March 2019. The day before the closure of the data collection period (23 March), official sources reported a total of 35 212 confirmed cases in Spain (Spanish Ministry of Health) and the number of 80,000 cases was exceeded by March 31.
