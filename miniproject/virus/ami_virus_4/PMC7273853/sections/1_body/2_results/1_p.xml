<p>A total of 909 patients completed the questionnaire. At the time they completed the questionnaire, 67 (7.4%) had been tested for the virus and 842 (92.6%) had not. A total of 626 (68.9%) respondents were women and 283 (31.1%) were men; mean age was 34 (range, 16â€“74). All patients reported gustatory or olfactory alterations, with 845 (92.95%) reporting gustatory and 888 (97.7%) reporting olfactory alterations. Simultaneous involvement of both senses was reported in 824 cases (90.65%). Gustatory alterations were classified as ageusia (64.1% of respondents), hypogeusia (28.2%), and dysgeusia (2.4%). Olfactory alterations were classified as anosmia (82.8%), hyposmia (15.6%), and dysosmia (0.9%). Fifty-four percent of the 906 respondents who answered the question (n = 489) did not present concurrent nasal congestion/mucus. The most frequent associated symptoms were myalgia (296 patients; 32.5%), dry cough (199; 21.9%), fever (170; 18.7%), and other symptoms (dyspnoea, headache, odinophagia, gastrointestinal alterations, nasal congestion [19; 2.1%]).
