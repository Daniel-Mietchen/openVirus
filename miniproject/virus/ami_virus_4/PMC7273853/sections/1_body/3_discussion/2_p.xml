<p>It is yet to be determined whether SARS-CoV-2 reaches the CNS, like other viruses. Viruses can enter the CNS by the retrograde neuronal or the haematogenous (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) routes. In the former, a virus infects peripheral neurons and accesses the CNS via their axons (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>); it may enter in the brain via the olfactory nerve olfactory bulb, or through the cribiforme plate (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), through the trigeminal nerve, or through sensory fibers of the vagus nerve (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Therefore, olfactory alterations may indicate spread of the virus to the CNS (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) and the possibility of delayed neurological symptoms. Regarding this point, a recent study drew attention to the high risk of CNS infection due to the greater local expression of ACE2 receptors, highlighting the need for greater understanding of the mechanisms by which the virus interacts with the host's CNS (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).
