<p>Our findings show that olfactory alterations are more frequent in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection than in other viral infections, although the incidence of this symptom is yet to be determined. The sample analyzed corresponds to a young population (mean age of 34.7 years), although this may reflect a selection bias, as the younger population is more familiar with the use of the Internet and social media. No differences were observed between patients who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who were under quarantine. Olfactory alterations could suggest the possibility of the virus entering the CNS as the result of the frequency of nasal congestion. Onset of these symptoms occurs early in the course of the disease, presenting simultaneously with other symptoms in more than half of cases. These sensory deficits are severe: a high percentage of patients reported complete loss of the sense of smell/taste (anosmia/ageusia), which negatively impacts on quality of life. In the majority of cases, olfactory/gustatory alterations were the only manifestation or were accompanied by mild viral symptoms; only 2.1% of patients reported more severe symptoms, such as dyspnoea. Compared against patients who had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, patients under quarantine more frequently presented olfactory/gustatory alterations in isolation (244; 25.6%); this may partly explain the high percentage of patients who had not been tested.</p>
