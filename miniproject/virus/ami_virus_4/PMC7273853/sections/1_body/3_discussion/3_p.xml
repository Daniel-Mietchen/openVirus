<p>Our study is the first to analyse the presence of olfactory alterations secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection; the incidence of this manifestation is probably high, and is only associated with nasal congestion in half of the cases. However, we should emphasize the limitation that the study does not address the frequency of this symptom in the total patient population, as well as the limitations inherent to the methodology used. Furthermore, access to the questionnaire was conditional upon factors related to respondents' access to the Internet and social media, and hospitalized patients with more severe symptoms would not have been able to complete it. Therefore, our sample is probably composed of patients with less severe symptoms. The low number of confirmatory tests and the low possibility that the olfactory alteration was caused by another intercurrent infection are also limitations. Online questionnaires have been used in specific circumstances in which accessing patients represents a challenge (
