<p>Gathering epidemiological data about the spread of COVID-19 and its potential impacts on different demographics and populations is important.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This information can be used to work to better solutions for segregated minorities and for targeted and widely infected populations. The need to understand the pattern of spread is important to allow for better long-term planning on how to manage this pandemic, as well as how to manage potential disease in the future. When looking from the lens of a bioethicist, the potential beneficence to underserved populations as well as the entire global community is immense and unparalleled.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The argument is not whether this potential benefit from a public health outreach, containment and understanding is critical for better preventing disease spread, but simply if this potential benefit outweighs all the other potential risks.
