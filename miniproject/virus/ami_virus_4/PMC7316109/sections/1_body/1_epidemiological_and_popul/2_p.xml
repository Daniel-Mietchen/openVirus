<p>Even in the past couple of weeks, large cities, primarily New York City, have seen a large efflux of the wealthy out of the densely populated core.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A recent surge in articles has highlighted the inequity and lack of justice surrounding the antibody testing, movement and spread of the disease among the wealthy and the more indigent populations in larger cities. This inherently widens the wealth gap that already exists in the USA, but even more importantly helps determine where resources should be allocated, how hospitals should or should not proceed with cases, and where the potential long-term impacts will need more care in the future. All these details are not necessarily immediately realised, but form a broader public health narrative that can be used to curb such vast discrepancies in the future.
