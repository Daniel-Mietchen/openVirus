<p>Healthcare workers form a group of individuals who recognise the potential of COVID-19, the impact it has had, and are still willing to go to work and continue to face the challenge. Although morally understandable, prudence dictates that healthcare personnel at high risk of exposure, regardless of their antibody status, take full precautions with every encounter. Unlike the HIV epidemic, COVID-19 is aerosolised and spreads not by knowingly taking sexual or intravenous risk, but even by unknowingly being exposed. If antibody testing had no impact on the daily workings of a hospital department, did not change an individualâ€™s exposure risk and had no effect on the precautions everyone must take, then why take the test? Is it a risk to the patient simply to take a blood test and confer next to no benefit from this information?</p>
