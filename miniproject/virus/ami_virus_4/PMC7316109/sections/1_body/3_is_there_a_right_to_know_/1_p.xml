<p>Ethically, the central tenets of most of our discussions revolve around the ideas of non-maleficence, beneficence, justice and autonomy. Although autonomy is regarded as important but sometimes justifiably sacrificed for the greater good, does autonomy and the right to know supersede the potential lack of control and lack of knowledge that antibody testing may confer? Although the COVID-19 pandemic is unique, the USA has faced a similar conundrum before in the 1990s. When the HIV epidemic was in full throttle and our understanding limited, mandatory testing was debated, but there were no effective or consistent ways to enforce the difficult logistical and legal problems that arose. Similarly, there are many challenges and potential for stigmatisation that arise with COVID-19 testing as well.</p>
