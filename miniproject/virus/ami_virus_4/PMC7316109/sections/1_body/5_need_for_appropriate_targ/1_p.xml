<p>In these unusual circumstances where every action is magnified by a certain magnitude by the potential for public health benefits, it is important to increase testing. The Centers for Disease Control has continued to expound the need to increase our testing capabilities and suggests that our current testing is not nearly where it needs to be.
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> There is built-up momentum for antibody testing and this will likely have beneficial repercussions regarding opening up businesses, potentially helping allocate healthcare resources, and focus our research on the best treatment modalities, but this is not being realised at this time with the current knowledge of the virus and with the current rate of testing. Within a week, the tests that have been done may be obsolete as the world begins to see reopening as a possibility.
