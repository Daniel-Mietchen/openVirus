<p>With the superfluity of different antibody tests coming into the market with different specificities and sensitivities, the word ‘antibody’ engenders a certain sense of relief or comfort that may not be practical addressing the general population. Although our understanding of vaccinations and immunity to disease is predicated on the idea of IgM antibodies being the first to develop to fight off an infection followed by IgG antibodies remaining longer term, coronavirus may not be something that can be as easily pre-empted as other illnesses that have vaccines and that generate a similar response. With a virus that potentially generates a significant proinflammatory state in a multiorgan system fashion, it is hard to understand the potential for immunity, the risk with repeat infection, the potential for viral mutations and the long-term impact of this situation.
