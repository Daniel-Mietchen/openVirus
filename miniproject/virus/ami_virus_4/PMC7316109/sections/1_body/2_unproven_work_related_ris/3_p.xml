<p>As noted by the Hastings Center, there are many who are falling on either side of the COVID-19 antibody debate. The potential implications of antibodies and whether they confer immunity are being hotly contested and draw similarities to the great vaccine debate and whether the risks of vaccination outweigh the benefits.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> As a society, the moral obligation to work towards an idea of herd immunity is natural, but fraught with so many uncertainties, it is hard to justify parallel discourse. With the growing literature and data suggesting the possibility of mutations, unequal impacts on different people and the potential repercussions of the spike protein for those with IgG immunity already, can society in good faith adopt a moral prerogative to put antibody-positive people in the front line? Or does the uncertainty and possible long-term health consequences mean that these people should be a protected population?
