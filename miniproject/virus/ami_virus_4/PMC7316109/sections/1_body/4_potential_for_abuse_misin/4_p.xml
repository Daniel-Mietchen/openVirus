<p>The rationally irrational response is expected. The higher your risk exposure, the higher your contacts and the more isolated one feels, the more likely it seems that healthcare personnel think they have had COVID-19 or have antibodies. Although anecdotal, many of these personnel are disappointed when they test negative and continue to protect themselves as they had before. But knowing that they have not contracted the disease and that the worst may yet still be coming is a feeling that, although pervasive in the current climate, can weigh on anyone who has to face it daily. In addition, those who do test positive seem fearless. They are the ones willing to go into any room and help out even without an N95 mask on. These cavalier feelings, particularly among younger physicians who feel that they will likely fight off COVID-19 better, are simply unsupported by the literature. But cavalier actions can lead to a slippery slope of consequences.</p>
