<p id="p0100">SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to other coronaviruses in the subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>, a clade of betacoronaviruses formed by the coronavirus that causes SARS (SARS-CoV) and other SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses found in bats. Recombination between coronaviruses are common, and SARS-CoV is believed to be a recombinant between bat sarbecorviruses. Interestingly, the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of a bat coronavirus detected in 2013 (&gt;96% sequence identity), which suggests that the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating in bats for at least several years [
