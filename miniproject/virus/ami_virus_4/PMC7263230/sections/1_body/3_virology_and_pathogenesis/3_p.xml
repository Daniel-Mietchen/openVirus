<p id="p0095">Tang etÂ al. investigated the patterns of molecular divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses by studying the population genetic analyses of 103 genomes of SARS-CoV-2. They showed that SARS-CoV-2 viruses evolved into two major types (L and S types) with the S type being the more ancient version of SARS-CoV-2. L type was shown to be more aggressive than the S type and more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020 possibly due to human intervention [
