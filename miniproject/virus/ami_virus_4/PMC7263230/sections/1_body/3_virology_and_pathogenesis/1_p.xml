<p id="p0085">Coronaviruses (CoVs), are enveloped, non-segmented, positive-sense RNA viruses. They are characterized by club-like spikes that project from their surface and the largest identified RNA genomes, containing approximately 30 kilobase (kb) genome and a unique replication strategy. The strategy of replication of coronaviruses involves a nested set of messenger RNAs with common polyadenylated 3-ends. Only the unique portion of the 5-end is translated. Mutations are common in nature. In addition, coronaviruses are capable of genetic recombination if 2 viruses infect the same cell at the same time [
