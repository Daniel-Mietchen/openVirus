<p id="p0105">ACE2 has been identified as a functional receptor for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection is triggered by binding of the spike protein of the virus to ACE2, which is highly expressed in the heart and lungs. Binding of the S1 unit of the viral S protein to the host ACE2 cellular receptor facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target host cells. Viral S protein priming then requires S protein cleavage of S1 from S2 (and at another S2â€™ site) by the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. The viral S2 subunit then drives fusion of the viral and host cell membranes [
