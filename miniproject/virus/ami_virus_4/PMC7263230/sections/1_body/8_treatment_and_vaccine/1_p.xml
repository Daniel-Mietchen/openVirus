<p id="p0265">There are currently no approved human coronavirus vaccines. Future considerations in development of a vaccine pose a conundrum. Previous novel vaccines towards disease such as dengue, SARS, respiratory syncytial virus have led to a counterproductive and potentially severe reaction known as immune enhancement [

Elderly patients were noted to have a higher titre of Nabs with a stronger innate immunity response-clinical co-relation with disease recovery and severity needs to be further explored [
