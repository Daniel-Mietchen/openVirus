<p id="p0235">To test for SARS-CoV-2, specimen testing (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal aspirates or washes, nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal aspirates, sputum, and serum) is performed using a real time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is not detected by standard respiratory viral panels, including those that test for the previously identified beta coronaviruses. Repeated sampling might be required when initial tests are negative despite suspicious clinical features [
