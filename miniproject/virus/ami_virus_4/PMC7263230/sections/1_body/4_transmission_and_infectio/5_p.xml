<p id="p0140">Xiao etÂ al. demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection and intracellular staining of viral nucleocapsid protein in gastric, duodenal, and rectal epithelia demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infects these gastrointestinal glandular epithelial cells. In their study they noted that more than 20% of patients with SARS-CoV-2, were observed to have viral RNA positive in feces, even after test results for viral RNA in the respiratory tract converted to negative, indicating that the viral gastrointestinal infection and potential fecal-oral transmission can last even after viral clearance in the respiratory tract. This has strong implications in preventing further transmission via the feco-oral route if rRT-PCR result of a fecal sample remains positive [
