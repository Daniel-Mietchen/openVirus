<p id="p0135">SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours, and on surfaces up to days; the median half-life of SARS-CoV-2 was approximately 1.1 h in aerosols, 5.6 h on stainless steel and 6.8 h on plastic; no viable virus was measured on cardboard after 24 h, but virus was still detectable (depending on the inoculum shed) on plastic and stainless steel after 72 h aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible, since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days (depending on the inoculum shed) [
