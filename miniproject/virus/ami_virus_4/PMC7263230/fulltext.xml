The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide crossed the one million mark on April 2, 2020; two million mark on April 15, 2020; three million mark on April 27,2020 and the four million mark on May 9,2020. Despite containment efforts, more than 187 countries have been affected with more than 4, 178,346 cases in the world with maximum being in USA (1, 347,936) followed by 227,436 in Spain and 224, 422 in United Kingdom as of May, 2020. COVID-19 is the latest threat to face mankind cutting across geographical barriers in a rapidly changing landscape. This review provides an update on a rapidly evolving global pandemic.

There was an epidemiological association with a seafood market in Wuhan where there was also a sale of wild animals, which was closed on 1st January 2020.1 Cases were first reported to WHO on 31st Dec 2019 of unknown pneumonia with the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission saying they were monitoring the situation closely. Subsequent information was provided on 11th and 12th of January. The genetic sequence of the 2019-nCoV was reported to the WHO on 12 Jan 2020 and noted to be a &#x003b2; CoV of group 2B with at least 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SARS-CoV and has been named 2019-nCoV by the WHO [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Subsequently, five additional 2019-nCoV sequences were deposited on the GSAID database on 11th January from institutes across China (Chinese CDC, Wuhan Institute of Virology and Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences &#x00026; Peking Union Medical College) and allowed researchers around the world to begin analyzing the new CoV. By 17th January, there were 62 confirmed cases in China and importantly, three exported cases of infected travelers who were diagnosed in Thailand (2) and Japan (1) Within 1 month, this virus spread quickly throughout China during the Chinese New Year &#x02013; a period when there is a high level of human mobility among Chinese people [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide crossed the one million mark on April 2, 2020; the case fatality rate across 204 countries and territories was 5&#x000b7;2%.

Avian coronavirus, initially called infectious bronchitis virus of chickens, mainly infecting domesticated chickens was first isolated in the 1930's followed by two more animal coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in the 1940's [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p id="p0070">Human coronavirus (HCoV) was historically known to cause a large proportion of minor upper respiratory tract infections.

Hamre and Procknow [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], first grew a virus they called 229&#x000a0;E, in tissue cultures from samples obtained from medical students with colds. Almeida and Tyrrell performed electron microscopy on fluids from organ cultures infected with B814 and found particles that resembled the infectious bronchitis virus of chickens. Tyyrell et&#x000a0;al., in the late 1960's, demonstrated above zoonotic viruses and human strains, to be morphologically same and a new genus of viruses of coronavirus was coined [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p id="p0075">In late 2002, SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic appears to have started in Guangdong Province, China. In 2017, Chinese scientists led by Shi Zheng-Li and Cui Jie of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, China traced the source of the outbreak to horseshoe bats with civets acting as an intermediary. SARS was a relatively rare disease; at the end of the epidemic in June 2003, the incidence was 8,422 cases with a case fatality rate (CFR) ranging from from 0% to 50% depending on the age group of the patient. Overall case fatality rate was 9.6%. In the United States, only 8 people had laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV infection during the 2003 outbreak. The World Health Organization declared severe acute respiratory syndrome contained on 5 July 2003 [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p id="p0080">In September 2012 another novel coronavirus emerged in Saudi Arabia, first identified as Novel Coronavirus 2012 and subsequently Human Coronavirus&#x02014;Erasmus Medical Centre (HCoV-EMC) after the Dutch Erasmus Medical Centre which had sequenced the virus. In May 2013, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official designation, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was further adopted by WHO [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. MERS-CoV, also called Camel flu, is believed to be derived from bats with camels being involved in spread to Humans. At the end of 2017, just under 2000 cases were reported with a case fatality rate of 36%. Most cases have occurred in the Arabian Peninsula with a subsequent outbreak in 2015 in South Korea with 184 confirmed cases of infection and 19 deaths. Only two people in the U.S. have ever tested positive for MERS-CoV infection, both in 2014. Potential for periodic outbreaks remains, particularly in the Arabian Peninsula.

They are characterized by club-like spikes that project from their surface and the largest identified RNA genomes, containing approximately 30 kilobase (kb) genome and a unique replication strategy. The strategy of replication of coronaviruses involves a nested set of messenger RNAs with common polyadenylated 3-ends. Only the unique portion of the 5-end is translated. Mutations are common in nature. In addition, coronaviruses are capable of genetic recombination if 2 viruses infect the same cell at the same time [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p id="p0090">The name coronavirus is derived from Latin, corona, meaning crown or wreath.

They showed that SARS-CoV-2 viruses evolved into two major types (L and S types) with the S type being the more ancient version of SARS-CoV-2. L type was shown to be more aggressive than the S type and more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020 possibly due to human intervention [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0100">SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to other coronaviruses in the subgenus <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>, a clade of betacoronaviruses formed by the coronavirus that causes SARS (SARS-CoV) and other SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses found in bats. Recombination between coronaviruses are common, and SARS-CoV is believed to be a recombinant between bat sarbecorviruses. Interestingly, the whole genome of SARS-CoV-2 is highly similar to that of a bat coronavirus detected in 2013 (&#x0003e;96% sequence identity), which suggests that the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating in bats for at least several years [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p id="p0105">ACE2 has been identified as a functional receptor for coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 infection is triggered by binding of the spike protein of the virus to ACE2, which is highly expressed in the heart and lungs. Binding of the S1 unit of the viral S protein to the host ACE2 cellular receptor facilitates viral attachment to the surface of target host cells. Viral S protein priming then requires S protein cleavage of S1 from S2 (and at another S2&#x02019; site) by the host cell serine protease TMPRSS2. The viral S2 subunit then drives fusion of the viral and host cell membranes [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p id="p0110">Additionally, cytokine storm triggered by an imbalanced response by type 1 and type 2&#x000a0;T helper cells and respiratory dysfunction and hypoxemia caused by COVID-19 can result in damage to myocardial cells [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p id="p0115">Pangolins, protected animals that are traded illegally in Asia and elsewhere, have been proposed as a potential amplifying host by some studies (Lam et&#x000a0;al., 2020) [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Transmission and infection</title><p id="p0120">The reproductive number is the number of cases, on average, an infected person will cause during their infectious period.

Early on, many of the patients at the epicenter of the outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread.

A conservative or de-resuscitative fluid strategy with early detection of myocardial involvement through the measurement of troponin and beta-natriuretic peptide concentrations and echocardiography and early use of vasopressors and inotropes are recommended.

Key factors in administering convalescent plasma include concerns that donor plasma must contain an adequate titre of neutralizing antibodies, be administered at the right treatment time point and risk of transmitting potential pathogens must be considered.
