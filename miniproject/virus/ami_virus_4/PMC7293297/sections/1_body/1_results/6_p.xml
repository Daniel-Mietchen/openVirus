<p id="Par8">A more complex strategy should be one where the intensity of the shutdown is adapted on the fly to the severity of the epidemic. Choosing the fraction of the population that is newly tested as virus-positive (blue line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) as the variable controlling the social distancing factor as shown by the orange line in and legend to Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, this adaptive strategy should do better than a fixed lockdown of comparable intensity. Implemented at time 15 days after the first detection of an infected individual, this should lead to a lethality after one year of only 0.013% (gray line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), i.e., one fourth the 0.33% a continuous 2.25 fold lockdown would have led to (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). A disadvantage of this adaptive strategy is that the mortality increases linearly with time also after the first year. However, the total mortality should still not overtake that of the constant lockdown by social distancing factor of 2.25 until after 10 years. We reckon that long before then a vaccine, some other cure, or an improved patient detection and insulation strategy should have been discovered and put in place. The adaptive lockdown could be optimized further in terms of parameters and with respect to any specific epidemic, culture and geographical unit.
