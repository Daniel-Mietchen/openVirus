<p id="Par5">Acceptable strategies should perhaps focus on measures that keep the death toll around 0.03%/year, i.e., well below the natural death rate. Because the terminally ill occupy an intensive care bed for approximately a month with half of them surviving, and assuming a peak of the epidemic lasting 3 months (see below), this corresponds to approximately 2 such beds for every 10 000 inhabitants, close to the actual total intensive care capacities in Northern Europe. The blue line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the computed COVID-19 mortality as a function of the intensity of the lockdown. The lockdown intensity is parameterized by the ‘social distancing factor’ which we define as the factor decrease in infection coefficient (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) brought about by the lockdown measure called by the government of the geographical unit. A 2.5 fold permanent reduction in social interactions (i.e., a social distancing factor of 2.5) should reduce COVID-19 mortality from 3% to this 0.03% (the blue line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, the duration of the epidemic (measured as the half rise time) varies appreciably with the social distance. Around a 2.2 fold increase in social distance the duration of the epidemic is predicted to be the longest (more than half a year, see the gray line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> at social distancing factor of 2.2). This has the benefit of minimizing the challenge on the intensive care unit capacity, but may well increase the economic damage.
