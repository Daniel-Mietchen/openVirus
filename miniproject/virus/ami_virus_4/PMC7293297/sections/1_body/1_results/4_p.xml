<p id="Par6">A full lockdown should reduce the duration of the epidemic to 25 days (0.8 months, see gray line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), with a stronger but short effect on the economy (but see below for an extra strategy that will be needed to prevent re-emergence of the epidemic). On the other hand, a 3-fold decrease in social contact (i.e., implementation of a lockdown with an intensity of a social distancing factor of 3) should already reduce the duration to 40 days (1.3 months, gray line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), with as additional benefit a much reduced lethality (0.008% compared with 0.5 at a 2.2 fold reduction of infection probability; blue line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and much reduced economic damage when compared to the situation of a social distancing factor of 2.2). From this we conclude that a soft lockdown such as corresponding to a 2.2 fold reduction in social interaction could be the worst strategy to follow, that a stronger lockdown is advisable and that that lock down need not be that much stronger (e.g. a social distancing factor of 3 rather than 2.2 should do; see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). It should be noted that in all these cases the herd immunity reached within a year will not suffice to prevent a second wave of epidemic.
