<p id="Par4">For the unmanaged epidemic, 3% of the population is computed to die from COVID-19 infection within 3 months (red line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). A ‘complete shutdown’ at 
 <italic>t</italic> = 15 days into the epidemic (modeled as a permanent reduction of infection probability by a factor of 10 through a ‘social distancing factor’ [see below] of 10) should keep the percentage of deceased individuals down to 0.003% (400 times lower than the natural death rate per year; purple line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In our model simulations, a less complete lockdown increased lethality in a highly nonlinear way (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Dividing the fraction of the population that becomes infected, by the fraction deceased, both as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, we obtained a proportionality constant independent of the intensity of the lockdown, and equal to 27 (which reflects the inverse of the lethality of the disease). Consequently, in order to achieve the 50% herd immunity that should quench this and a subsequent wave of the epidemic, one would have to accept a death rate of 2% over some 5 months. This corresponds to approximateley three times the natural death rate: adjusting the lockdown intensity so as to obtain sufficient herd immunity may thereby be unacceptable ethically.
