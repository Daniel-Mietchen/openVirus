<p id="Par7">A strong lockdown is hardship. Therefore we examined whether such a lockdown could be intermitted with periods with normal social contact, without endangering the success of the strategy. We found (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) that a 55%-on-45%-off schedule for the full lockdown will not suppress the epidemic. In order to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 virus, two thirds of the time society should be locked down, leaving one third for social interactions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and supplementary material Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). This seems an attractive alternative to a permanent lockdown provided a selection of economic activities that require live human-human interactions could be confined to shorter time periods without increasing contact intensity.
