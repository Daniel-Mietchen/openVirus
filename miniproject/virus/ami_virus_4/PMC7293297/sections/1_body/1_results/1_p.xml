<p id="Par3">Using standard systems biology methodology we generated a dynamic model, which should apply to various geographical units after adjustment to the population size. We use the term ‘geographical unit’ for an area where the lockdown intensity is fairly homogeneous. This may be a country, a state, or even a city or village. For each of the processes depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the model uses a chemical reaction equation (describing the conversion that occurs in the process) and a rate equation (describing the rate at which this occurs in terms of a rate ‘constant’ [probability] and concentrations of species (such as infected-non-tested individuals)).
