<p id="Par14">The adaptive strategy does have the disadvantage that it should be maintained until a vaccine, or a much faster detection method of the infections, or another effective way of reducing the infection coefficient, has arrived. Stopping the adaptive control at 180 days after onset, had the effect that the epidemic re-emerged with a half rise at 230 days, i.e., only one and a half month later (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). The adaptive control method is ill-compatible with the extinction strategy however, as in the latter there is no
