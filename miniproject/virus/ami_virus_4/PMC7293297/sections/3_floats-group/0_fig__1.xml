  <title>Systems biology model of the Corona virus epidemics.</title>
  <p>Species are in boxes, reactions (irreversible, mass-action) are indicated by arrows with reaction numbers written alongside. The infection coefficient is a linear function of the numbers of infected-nontested, infected-tested, symptoms-nontested and symptoms-tested, with relative weights 0.508, 0.25, 0.025 and 0.025 respectively divided by a fitted number close to the total population number of the geographical unit, and a social distancing factor of 1 (in case of no lockdown), 10 (used to describe ‘total’ lockdown) or anywhere in between. Model with all parameters values is at 10.15490/fairdomhub.1.model.693.1.</p>
