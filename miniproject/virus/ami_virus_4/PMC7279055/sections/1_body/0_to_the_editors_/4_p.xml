<p>This report underscores the lack of major differences in the clinical features of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and other types of CoV or influenza infections among infants despite limited clinical features reported. COVID-19 infection does not seem more severe than other CoV or influenza infections in this population, possibly as all infect Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 receptors in the upper airways. As influenza,
