<p>Last, this analysis is a first step in understanding the involvement of RNA editing in viral replication, and it could lead to clinically relevant outcomes: (i) If these enzymes are relevant in the host response to coronavirus infection, a deletion polymorphism quite common in the Chinese population, encompassing the end of

 <italic>APOBEC3B</italic> (

  <italic>57</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>58</italic>
 </xref>), could play a role in the spread of the infection. (ii) Because RNA editing and selection act orthogonally in the evolution of the viruses, comparing genomic sites that are edited with those that are mutated could lead to the selection of viral regions potentially exploitable for therapeutic uses.
