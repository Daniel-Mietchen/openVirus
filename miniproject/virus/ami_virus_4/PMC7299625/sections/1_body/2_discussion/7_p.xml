<p>An analysis of mutation outcomes is difficult due to the low numbers of events collected so far, but there are some possibly suggestive trends (data S2). C-to-U changes leading to stop codons are overrepresented in the transcriptomic data but—as expected—disappear in the genomic dataset. This might point—again—to an antiviral role for these editing enzymes. There is also an underrepresentation of C&gt;T missense mutations, but its meaning is difficult to interpret.</p>
