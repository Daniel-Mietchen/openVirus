<p>The functional meaning of RNA editing in SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be understood: In other contexts, editing of the viral genome determines its demise or fuels its evolution. For DNA viruses, the selection is indirect, as genomes evolve to reduce potentially harmful editable sites [e.g., (
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>18</italic>
 </xref>)], but for RNA viruses, this pressure is even stronger, as RNA editing directly affects the genetic information and efficiently edited sites disappear.
