<p>A comparison of the SNV datasets from the transcriptomic and genomic analyses reveals a different weight of A-to-I and C-to-U changes (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2B</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>), with an underrepresentation of A-to-I in the viral genomes. As our analysis underestimates the amount of editing due to the strict parameters used, the underrepresentation of A-to-I changes could be explained by the possibility that A-to-I editing is more effective in restricting viral propagation, thus reducing the number of viral progeny showing evidence of these changes. In contrast, the remnants of less effective C-to-U editing are retained in viral progeny and get fixed during viral adaptation.
