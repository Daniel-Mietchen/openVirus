<p>As in rubella virus, we observe a bias in APOBEC editing toward the positive-sense strand. This bias and the low editing frequencies might be indicative of the dynamics of the virus, from transcription to selection of viable genomes. It is reasonable to assume that sites edited on the negative-sense strand will result in a mid-level editing frequency, as not all negative-sense transcripts will be edited (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). On the other hand, editing of the positive-sense strand can occur upon entry of the viral genome, thus yielding high-frequency editing (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>), or after viral genome replication, resulting in low-frequency editing (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). The lack of a sizable fraction of highly edited C&gt;T SNVs suggests that APOBEC editing occurs late in the viral life cycle (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5C</xref>). Yet, because they occur earlier, G&gt;A SNVs should be closer in number to C&gt;T SNVs and with higher levels of editing, which is not what we observe (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A to C</xref>). The overrepresentation of C&gt;T SNVs could be due to an imbalance toward positive-sense transcripts, as these are continuously generated from the negative-sense ones (and double-stranded hybrid RNAs are lost). However, the editing frequencies of G&gt;A SNVs should be much higher, as G&gt;A SNVs are generated upstream to the C&gt;T ones. A more fitting explanation is that editing of the negative-sense transcripts results in loss of the edited transcript (
 <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5D</xref>), possibly because editing triggers nonsense-mediated decay (
