<p>Our data source—metagenomic sequencing—raises the question whether the low-level editing we observe (~1%) reflects the actual levels of editing of viral transcripts within human cells. Aside from a small fraction of cellular transcripts edited at high frequency, most ADAR-edited sites in the human transcriptome (typically inside Alu sequences) present editing levels of ~1% (

  <italic>42</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>51</italic>
 </xref>). It has been shown that a fraction of the cellular transcripts are hyperedited by ADARs (

  <italic>52</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>54</italic>
 </xref>). While we were unable to observe hyperedited reads in the metagenomic samples, it is possible that hyperedited transcripts fail to be packaged into the virus.
