<p>With regard to APOBEC-mediated RNA editing, its detection in the viral transcriptomes is already indicative, as this type of editing is almost undetectable in human tissues (

APOBECs have been proved effective against many viral species in experimental conditions, yet, until now, their mutational activity in clinical settings has been shown only in a handful of viral infections (
