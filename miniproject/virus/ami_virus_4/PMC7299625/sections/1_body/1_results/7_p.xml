<p>A&gt;G and T&gt;C changes are evenly represented with respect to SNV frequency (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>), the number of unique SNVs (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>), and their distribution across the viral genome (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>). As ADARs target dsRNA, this suggests that dsRNA encompasses the entire genome. While dsRNA in human transcripts is often driven by inverted repeats, the most likely source of dsRNA in the viral transcripts is replication, where both positive and negative strands are present and can result in wide regions of dsRNA.
