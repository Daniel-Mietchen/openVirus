<p>The SNV frequency and number of transversions are compatible with the mutation rates observed in coronaviruses [10
 <sup>–6/−7</sup>; (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>39</italic>
 </xref>)] and commonly associated to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). RdRps are error prone and are considered the main source of mutations in RNA viruses. However, the coronavirus 
 <italic>nsp14-ExoN</italic> gene provides a form of error correction (
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>40</italic>
 </xref>), which is probably the reason mutation rates in coronaviruses are lower than those observed in RNA viruses with smaller genomes. The mutational spectrum in SARS quasispecies presents a very weak bias toward U-to-G. Inactivation of nsp14-ExoN error correction reveals the mutational spectrum of the RdRp, which is quite different from the pattern we observe (i.e., main changes are C-to-A, followed by U-to-C, G-to-U, A-to-C, and U-to-G) (
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>41</italic>
 </xref>). Hence, we would consider that SNVs deriving from RdRp errors represent a marginal fraction of the SNVs in the SARS-CoV-2 samples.
