<p>We then aligned available genomes from SARS-CoV-2, Middle-East respiratory syndromeâ€“related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV to test whether RNA editing could be responsible for some of the mutations acquired through evolution. The genomic alignments reveal that a substantial fraction of the mutations in all strains could derive from enzymatic deaminations (
