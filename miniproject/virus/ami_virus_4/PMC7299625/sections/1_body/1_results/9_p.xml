<p>As APOBEC deaminases preferentially target cytosines within specific sequence contexts, we analyzed the nucleotide context of A-to-I and C-to-U SNVs in the viral genome (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). A slight depletion of G bases in position −1 is present at A-to-I edited positions. This depletion is not as strong as the signal previously reported in human transcripts (

  <italic>44</italic>
 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>47</italic>
 </xref>). The low editing frequencies we observe resembles the editing present on human transcripts containing Alu sequences, which were found in a limited number in those early datasets. There is no evidence of a sequence context preference if we use a larger dataset such as REDIportal (
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>48</italic>
 </xref>), which includes &gt;1.5 M sites in Alu repeats (fig. S3).
