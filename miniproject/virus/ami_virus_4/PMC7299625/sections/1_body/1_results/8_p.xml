<p>Unlike A-to-I changes, C-to-U changes are biased toward the positive-sense strand (

Because ADARs and APOBECs selectively target dsRNA and ssRNA, this distribution could arise from the presence at all times of RNA in a dynamic equilibrium between double-strandedness—when negative-sense RNA is being transcribed—and single-strandedness—when nascent RNA is released. Although some areas seem to bear fewer SNVs, these reduced SNV frequencies might be related to lower sequencing depth in those regions.
