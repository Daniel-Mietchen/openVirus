<p>C&gt;T and G&gt;A SNVs are the second main group of changes and could derive from APOBEC-mediated C-to-U deamination. Unlike A-to-I editing, C-to-U editing is a relatively rare phenomenon in the human transcriptome (

 </xref>), where C&gt;T changes represent the predominant SNV type. The observation that only A-to-I editing is present in RNA viruses that infect nonvertebrate animals, where RNA-targeting APOBECs are not present (
