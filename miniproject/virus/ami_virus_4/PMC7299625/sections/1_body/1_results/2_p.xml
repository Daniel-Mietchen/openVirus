<p>While the weight of each SNV type varies across samples (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), a bias toward transitions is always present, which is even more evident when all mutational data are pooled (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). This pattern holds true even when only SNVs recurring in more samples are considered (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>).
