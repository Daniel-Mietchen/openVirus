<p>To assess whether RNA editing could be involved in human host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections, we started from publicly available RNA sequencing datasets from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) obtained from patients diagnosed with COVID-19. While transcriptomic data for all samples could be aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, the quality of the sequencing varied and only eight samples had coverage and error rates suitable for the identification of potentially edited sites (data S1). We called single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) on these eight samples (

 </xref>–
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>37</italic>
 </xref>) and JACUSA (
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>38</italic>
 </xref>) using the following thresholds: reads supporting the SNV ≥4, allelic fraction ≥0.5%, coverage ≥20, quality of the reads &gt;25, base quality &gt;35 (fig. S1A). The two pipelines gave comparable results with ~50% of the SNV positions called by both (figs. S1B and S2). We identified 910 SNVs common to REDItools 2 and JACUSA, ranging from 24 to 238 SNVs per sample (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and data S3). Given the thresholds used to call the SNV, samples with lower sequencing depths displayed lower numbers of SNVs.
