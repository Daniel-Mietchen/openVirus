<p>Mutations common to the datasets generated by REDItools 2 and JACUSA were considered (
 <italic>n</italic> = 910; fig. S2 and data S3). The threshold we used to filter the SNVs is based on minimum coverage (20 reads), number of supporting reads (at least four mutated reads), allelic fraction (0.5%), quality of the mapped reads (&gt;25), and base quality (&gt;35). In the dataset, there were only six SNVs with allelic fractions in the range of 30 to 85% (C&gt;T, 1; T&gt;C, 3; G&gt;T, 2). Because there were no SNVs with higher allelic fractions, we presume that all samples originated from the same viral strain.
