<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of enveloped viruses with non-segmented positive sense RNA belonging to the family Coronaviridae and the order Nidovirales. On the basis of phylogenetic clustering, they are classified into three different genera: alpha, beta and gamma. While alpha and beta types have mammalian hosts, gamma type CoVs have avian hosts. Alpha- and beta-CoVs are widely distributed in humans and other mammals including bats and cause mild respiratory infections
