<p>Quality control programme implemented by NIV, Pune, for the VRDLs revealed 100 per cent concordance between the testing at VRDLs and NIV for negative samples. For borderline positive samples (Ct values between 33 and 35 cycles), concordance was low. This emphasized the need to continue reconfirmation of all positive samples at NIV, Pune. This has also indicated that 
 <italic>E</italic> gene screening assay may not be sufficient to declare positivity. Further confirmatory tests as currently done by NIV, Pune, are required for confirming true positivity. To enhance the robustness of testing, it is essential to equip the SARS-CoV-2 testing VRDLs with additional confirmatory assays.
