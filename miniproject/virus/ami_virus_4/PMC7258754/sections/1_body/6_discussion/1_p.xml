<p>Global epidemics due to emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases have become common over the past two decades, with the major reason being increased trade and travel, leading to movement of people across borders. A recent example is the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 in Hubei province of China which has spread to more than 70 countries within a two-month time. During the initial period, virus sequences were unknown, there were no known sources for acquiring positive controls and the virus isolates were not available. In view of this, the challenge to develop diagnostics for a new disease with a pandemic potential initially seemed unsurmountable. However, once the virus sequences were made available in public domain and source of positive controls and probes could be identified, India immediately established a network of testing laboratories for the new SARS-CoV-2 virus very swiftly. Starting with availability of validated diagnosis at the ICMR-NIV, Pune, testing capacity was further upscaled to another 13 DHR/ICMR VRDLs. The apex laboratory standardized the testing protocols within one week, and the VRDLs initiated testing within two weeks of release of laboratory protocols by the WHO. In addition, 35 laboratories fully equipped in terms of availability of adequate infrastructure and trained staff for SARS-CoV-2 testing were kept on a standby. An impressive model wherein the VRDLs have closely worked with the field surveillance programme of GoI (IDSP) has been operationalized during this public health crisis. However, this model worked well only in some States, but there were gaps in other states. Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh clearly leveraged the capacity of existing VRDLs. The sample transport mechanisms from IDSP to VRDLs at these places were also good. The number of tests conducted by VRDLs in these States depicted the effective screening of suspect cases implemented at nearby airports, IDSP and State health programmes. However, in cities such as Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai, despite the presence of a testing facility, the number of suspect cases referred was low. Liasoning between VRDLs and IDSP needs to be further strengthened in such areas.</p>
