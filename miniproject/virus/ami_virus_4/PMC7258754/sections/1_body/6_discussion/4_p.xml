<p>The threat of a potential pandemic due to SARS-CoV-2 has brought out the strength of the judiciously established network of VRDLs in India and also the capability of this network to rapidly adapt in times of any public health emergency, with appropriate quality checks. This already operational platform was able to switch gears to provide countrywide diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 within a month after discovery of this novel virus. VRDLs offer a robust platform for early detection of emerging/re-emerging viral infections in all parts of India, facilitating early containment and prevention of larger epidemics.</p>
