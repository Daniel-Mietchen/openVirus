 <italic>Expansion of testing capabilities and selection of testing laboratories for SARS-CoV-2</italic>: Following the increase in the load of screening samples from suspected cases with symptoms and travel history to China or asymptomatic persons with travel history to Wuhan after January 15, 2020, it was decided that strategically located VRDLs needed to start testing for SARS-CoV-2 in addition to the apex laboratory at NIV, Pune. VRDLs were chosen based on their location in cities with international airports receiving travellers from China, the capability of the VRDLs to perform real-time PCR assays and their involvement in the ongoing testing for influenza viruses within the network. A total of 13 VRDLs across 11 States were selected for SARS-CoV-2 testing. After February 29, 2020, based on the upsurge in the number of suspect cases, primarily due to outbreaks reported from countries other than China (Iran, South Korea, Italy and Japan), the number of testing laboratories was scaled up to a total of 31 laboratories. It is eventually proposed to involve all 106 VRDLs in COVID-19 testing or sample collection and transportation. The distribution of COVID-19 testing (operational and new) laboratories in India is depicted in Figure
