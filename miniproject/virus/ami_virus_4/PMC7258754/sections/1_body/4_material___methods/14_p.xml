<p>Before initiating testing of clinical specimens from suspected cases of SARS-CoV-2, each VRDL shared results from the rRT-PCR runs performed with positive and negative controls with the apex laboratory (NIV, Pune). After satisfactory performance of the laboratories, independent testing was initiated in the designated catchment areas. Frontline screening rRT-PCR test targeting SARS-CoV-2-specific 
 <italic>E</italic> gene was performed. Initial support was also provided to NCDC, New Delhi, for initiation of SARS-CoV-2 testing. Thereafter, NCDC, Delhi, initiated independent testing; however, results were shared with ICMR on a daily basis.
