 <italic>VRDLs as State nodal centres for coordination of sample collection and shipment</italic>: In the last week of January 2020, the DHR/ICMR provided directives on sample collection and transport to all the 106 VRDLs currently under the network. Video conferences were held with VRDLs where the directives were explained and issues regarding sample collection and shipment were discussed. From each State or Union Territory, one VRDL was designated as the nodal centre for coordination of collection and shipment of samples to testing laboratories. On collection of sample(s) from any suspected case, the hospital or nearest VRDL was expected to contact the designated nodal centre for that State. The role of the nodal centre was to enable timely and proper transport of the collected samples from the VRDLs to the designated testing laboratory.
