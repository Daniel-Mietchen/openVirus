 <italic>Laboratory organization for SARS-CoV-2 testing in India</italic>: The Department of Health Research (DHR)/ICMR initiated establishment of a network of public health laboratories to enhance capacity for diagnosis and detection of viruses of public health importance in the Indian setting in 2013. Over the years, this network has been expanded, and currently, a total of 106 VRDLs have been established throughout the country (Fig.

In addition, a subset of these also have capabilities to perform cell culture and virus cultivation. All established VRDLs are equipped to perform testing for viral aetiologies at least under Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) conditions. Further, 10 VRDLs are in various stages of operationalization of a BSL-3 facility for detection of high-risk pathogens
