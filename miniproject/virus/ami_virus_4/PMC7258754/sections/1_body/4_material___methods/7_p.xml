 <italic>Diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2</italic>: Following release of the first sequence results of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by China
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, candidate diagnostic real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays were designed and made available in the public domain for researchers
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. The first-line screening assay targeted the SARS-CoV-2-specific 
 <italic>E</italic> gene. Confirmatory assays targeted the '
 <italic>RdRp</italic> gene', '
 <italic>N</italic> gene' and '
 <italic>ORF-1b</italic>'. Positive control materials for these assays were obtained from Charit√©, Berlin, via EVAg
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Known copy numbers of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed RNA standard were used as the positive controls for the rRT-PCR assays. Detection of RNAse 
 <italic>P</italic> gene was used as an internal positive control to monitor sample quality, RNA extraction and detection of PCR inhibitors. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, which is the apex laboratory for viral diagnosis and research in India, optimized the conventional and real-time PCR assays targeting different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 and initiated testing of suspected cases.
