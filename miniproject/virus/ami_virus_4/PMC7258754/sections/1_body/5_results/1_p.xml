 <italic>Testing of suspected cases and contacts</italic>: Based on the inclusion criteria, as on February 29, 2020, a total of 1,369 individuals including suspected cases and contacts were tested at the designated laboratories. The testing VRDLs as well as NIV, Pune, had evaluated a varying number of samples from suspected cases/contacts as follows: NIV, Pune (n=343); All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi (n=16); NIV Field Unit, Bangaluru (n=152); NIV Field Unit, Kerala (n=435); National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Kolkata (n=42); Kasturba Hospital for Infectious Diseases, Mumbai (n=49); Sawai Man Singh Hospital, Jaipur (n=68); King George's Medical University, Lucknow (n=54); Gandhi Medical College, Secunderabad (n=93); King Institute of Preventive Medicine and Research, Chennai (n=52); Indira Gandhi Government Medical College &amp; Hospital, Nagpur (n=21); Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Bengaluru (n=26); Gauhati Medical College, Guwahati (n=6); and B.J. Medical College, Ahmedabad (n=12). Repeat testing of suspect cases was also done at VRDLs (numbers excluded). Eleven VRDLs initiated independent testing between February 1 and 3, 2020. Two VRDLs at Ahmedabad and Guwahati were added from February 8, 2020 as per need. Time taken by all VRDLs from receipt of reagents to initiation of independent testing ranged between 24-36 h. The turnaround time for testing was 12-24 h depending on the number of samples tested. Results were communicated to the State IDSP and/or the referring contact point. Initial numbers referred to the testing network were high due to increased number of travellers returning from affected countries. However, this number declined after travel restrictions were imposed. As the VRDLs established testing for SARS-CoV-2, the number of samples referred to NIV dropped.
