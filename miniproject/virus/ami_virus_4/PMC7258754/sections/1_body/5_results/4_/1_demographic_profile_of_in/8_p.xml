<p>The VRDLs also shared 13 samples which were borderline positives and showed amplification at late Ct values (range: 33-37 cycles) for confirmation. These included seven follow up samples collected from the three laboratory-confirmed positive cases which were also tested positive for the 
 <italic>E</italic> gene at the testing VRDL. Testing results were concordant for five of seven follow up samples. The remaining six samples which showed borderline positivity with the screening qPCR at the testing VRDLs were found to be negative with the confirmatory qPCR assays performed at NIV, Pune.
