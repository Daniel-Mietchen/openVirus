 <italic>Inventory control</italic>: Inventory control posed several challenges. Primers and probes were ordered by the NIV, Pune, once the laboratory protocols were shared by the WHO on January 15, 2020. Since nature of spread of the disease was unknown, testing reagents were stockpiled for only 5000 tests initially. NIV initiated testing from January 21, 2020. However, in view of upsurge in global cases and deaths, the testing capacity was upscaled to another 13 laboratories and inventory at NIV was scaled up to 25,000 tests by February 1, 2020. Following further upsurge in global cases and deaths by February 25, 2020, the inventory was upscaled to 70,000 tests. Daily situational analysis of inventory at the apex and testing laboratories was undertaken to ensure optimum supplies and avoid exhaustion of reagents at the apex and testing laboratories.
