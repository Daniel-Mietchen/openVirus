    "Currently, pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the biggest threat to all human beings globally. Till June 8, 2020, it has infected 6,931,000 people and caused 400,857 deaths worldwide. The first case was identified in a patient with influenza-like symptoms along with severe acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and now it has spread in more than 200 countries. Since there is no approved cure for this disease until now, there is a lot of mass fear, apprehensions, and questions globally regarding (i) genetic origin and history of the novel coronavirus, (ii) what are the first-line therapies for those who contract this disease, and (iii) what could be the potential vaccine targets. In this short review, we have tried to address these queries in the simplest manner and compiled the history of previous coronaviruses, recent developments in the COVID-19 research, potential future therapeutics, and possible targets to cure the disease."
