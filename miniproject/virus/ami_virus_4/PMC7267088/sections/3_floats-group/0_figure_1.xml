  <p>The effect of climate on virulence of enveloped viruses. In cold climate, enveloped viruses are viable for several hours, while the low humidity of cold climate aids exhaled virus‐laden aerosols turn to tiny solid residues that can remain suspended in air for several hours and might travel within air flow. In mild and humid climate, most of the virus‐laden aerosols precipitate faster since the evaporation is slower. Also, a relatively shorter viability compared to cold climate is expected in mild temperature. Hot and dry climate, although aids faster formation of solid residues, but high temperature destabilizes the enveloped viruses and shortens their viable period.</p>
