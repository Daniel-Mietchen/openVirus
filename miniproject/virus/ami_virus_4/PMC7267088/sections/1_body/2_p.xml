<p>The environment as transient reservoir of virus is particularly studied to estimate the virulence of viruses outside the host. For instance, both SARS‐CoV‐2 and influenza virus keep their virulence on different materials from hours to days at ambient temperature.

 <sup>]</sup> Also, the viability of influenza virus in the microdroplets of mucus (1 µL) was preserved by low relative humidity at room temperature.

 <sup>]</sup> From the epidemiological point of view, it has been shown that a decline in absolute humidity is linked to the onset of influenza epidemics in the continental United States.
