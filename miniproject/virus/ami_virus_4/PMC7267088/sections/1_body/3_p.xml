<p>Viruses as third side of this triangle were also studied in the context of the environment. Viruses that are protected by a lipid membrane, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumo virus, and influenza, have a peak during the winter months. In contrast, the cause of common cold, rhinoviruses, do not have an envelope, and no particular seasonal pattern was observed. Adenoviruses also lack an envelope and does not show a peak during winter time. Of course, this does not mean that SARS‐CoV‐2 as an enveloped virus will do so, since its seasonal effect is not recorded yet, although it seems to spread more rapidly in colder climate.
