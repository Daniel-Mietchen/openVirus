 <p>The virulence of enveloped viruses such as SARS‐CoV‐2 and influenza has been studied from different perspectives, although the interplay of climate and virus‐laden particles has not been assessed thus far. In this essay, evidence to show how the manmade local climate or natural and seasonal climate might affect the virulence of exhaled virus‐laden aerosols is presented.
