<p id="Par15">It is noted that the duration of 
 <italic>f</italic> phase is much longer than the duration of the exponential growth incorporated in Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>. Indeed, we find that most countries have a short time span of exponential growth which is deviated in a matter of a few days. Thereby the parameters associated with Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref> resulting in the comparisons shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, and those of Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref> resulting in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> are not interpreting the same range of data. More precisely, 
 <italic>f</italic> phase is all data up to the maximum in the number of new cases, while the exponential growth in the data only lasts a few days. After the 
 <italic>f</italic> phase, the number of new cases gradually decreases (corresponding to the start of the 
 <italic>s</italic> phase), and following the form of Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref> becomes zero in the 
 <italic>p</italic> phase.
