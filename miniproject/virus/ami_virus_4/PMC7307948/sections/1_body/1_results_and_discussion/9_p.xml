<p id="Par16">Furthermore, the number of new cases is calculated from the total number of cases as discussed previously. Thereby, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> further shows a comparison between the latter data and calculations from the derivative of Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref> using the same fit parameters. The reasonable agreement obtained from the latter comparison further shows that Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref> is adequate for data interpretation. Similarly, fits to the total of number of cases for Italy, Spain, France, and the USA, together with the reproduction of the number of new cases from data and from derivative of Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref> are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows similar data for Russian, Germany, the UK and Brazil. The agreement is again reasonable. We note that for certain countries such as Italy, France, Germany, Russia and UK, the agreement is excellent both on the total number of cases and the number of new cases.
