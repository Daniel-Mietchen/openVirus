<p id="Par6">This letter seeks to interpret the available data using a simple model making use of physically meaningful parameters. In particular, with respect to the several periods for an epidemic, the presented analysis focuses on the first period, before the so-called herd immunity period. In the herd immunity and in the absence of a vaccine, the virus stops expanding when 60% of a population is contaminated [

 <sup>5</sup>, this factor gives about 7.5 million contaminated cases. This number of cases is equivalent to 12% of the French population. Recently, another study stated that this number was about 5.7% on average and about 12% in the region Ile-de-France [

In the first period of the epidemic—sometimes described as the first “wave”—the number of new cases shows characteristic features: the initial exponential growth is followed by a maximum and then a decrease. The shape of this curve depends on various factors such as the basic reproduction number associated with the epidemic, environmental conditions or the behavior of the infected population, among others. Later the epidemic can evolve following different scenarios, which can be a steady and low background of new cases, or a second wave; the latter showing characteristics similar to those of the first wave. The available data and the model presented in this work are for the first period of the epidemic.
