<p id="Par16">I believe this entirely war-driven rhetoric brings more harm than good to public health and public health policies. The harm stems from the targeted and intentional distraction of public attention from the issues of critical importance by searching instead for a scapegoat. Attacking scientists who need time and resources to find solutions is less risky than accepting responsibility for not providing needed time and resources. Pointing at the enemy is easier than revealing and understanding the complexity, inequalities, interdependence, and ethical challenges of any decision we make, especially in rapidly changing situations full of uncertainties.</p>
