<p id="Par15">During the pandemic, medical personnel, nurses, public health practitioners, and first responders are considered to be “on the front line” or “battling diseases head on.” By framing the pandemic in military terms, officials are communicating the gravity of this public health crisis, calling for personal sacrifice, and justifying interventions required to control the spread infection. Yet, this flawed parallel also increases fear, anxiety, and panic and is likely to have lasting consequences. When the war references are applied to pandemics, the appeal to human emotions can be easily abused by shifting public attentions from thoughtful and comprehensive strategies of balancing risks and the needs for keeping communities functioning to impulsive reactions. Over decades this journal and many others have shown examples of effective public health communication strategies for bringing public attention to important issues, mobilizing resources, and advocating for public health policy reform. This pandemic is a reminder that the solutions we are seeking for one problem should not create future problems.</p>
