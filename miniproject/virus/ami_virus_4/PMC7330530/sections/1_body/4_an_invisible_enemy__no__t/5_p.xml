<p id="Par10">Many common infections, such as influenza (flu), salmonellosis, and rotaviral infections, manifest themselves by seasonal outbreaks. Flu is notorious for reminding us with remarkable consistency that humans are part of a complex evolutionary process. In this process, resilient species are not those better at 
 <italic>fighting against</italic> others but rather those who are better at 
 <italic>living with</italic> others. The concept of tolerating an infection, an evolutionary-ingrained strategy, is not new. Steady worldwide growth in life expectancy and quality of life has been achieved by reducing exposure to pathogens, improving nutrition, and implementing vaccination programs. Seasonal infections are the consistent reminders of ongoing evolution. The human genetic makeup reflects a process in which selection of specific Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) types amounts to a footprint of thousands of years of building evolutionary-based tolerance—that protects humans. We are who we are because of the centuries of evolution and several decades of active boosting of immune responses with vaccines. Well-designed vaccination strategies offer well-controlled boosts for humans’ immune systems-and these drive future health responses to seasonal outbreaks. By understanding the seasonal disease patterns, we learn how to make vaccination strategies efficient: when and whom to vaccinate and how to measure the success and failures. By anticipating seasonal reoccurrence of COVID, we should find ways to protect the public and provide services our communities deserve.
