<p id="Par6">The theory of miasmas popular in the 1800s accepted the notion that a poisonous vapor or mist made up of 
 <italic>particles</italic> from decomposing material could cause disease. In the early twentieth century the miasma theory was replaced by the germ theory, further verifying the cause of infection—not particles, but germs. In the last two hundred years, scientists provided ample evidence for real disease-causing agents—bacteria, protozoa, viruses—and the role of humans in unleashing multiple routes of transmission.
