<p id="Par2">Yet, one recurrent topic keeps puzzling me: the rhetoric for responding to pandemics is equated with an unexpected war against an invisible enemy. Below I take up each element of this rhetoric separately: the 
 <italic>invisible enemy</italic>, and the 
 <italic>unexpected war</italic> to dissect their worth. I argue that this entire concept brings to public health and public health policy more harm than help. I call for keeping the role of public health professional clear: to protect public health using proven scientific evidence and best practices and to serve to community at large.
