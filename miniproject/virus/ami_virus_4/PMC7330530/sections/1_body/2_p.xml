<p id="Par3">By instilling that a cause of infection is invisible, we are implicitly rejecting the science. By presenting a virus as an enemy we impede responsibility humans bear for driving patterns of disease. We refuse to accept that the virus—a cause of infection—is a part of the environment, which we, humans, are altering to suit our needs. By insisting that the pandemic was not expected, we deny the warning signs and the facts that limited preparedness efforts had transformed initial outbreaks into a massive pandemic. Most importantly, by focusing on the ‘war on a virus,’ we deemphasize the role of evolution—and our role in shaping the evolution-inspired tolerance to infection.</p>
