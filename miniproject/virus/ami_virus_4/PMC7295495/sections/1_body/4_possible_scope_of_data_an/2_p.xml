<p id="p0160">In future modeling the processes of COVID-19 can contribute to improving our understanding in this disease. This models and approaches will provide real time decisions to shape the research on this disease. Data analysis can be useful in fighting this issue. In future, data analytics can be applied in COVID-19 particularly in the following domains:
 <list list-type="simple" id="olist0015">
  <list-item id="o0030">
   <label>1.</label>
   <p id="p0165">To predict how the virus spreads that is the transmission possibility. To provide information about possible zones that may have clusters of the virus. This will identify possible risky zones and people may avoid these areas.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0035">
   <label>2.</label>
   <p id="p0170">To develop a system that will continuously observe the conditions of a suspected person, and to automatically predict whether he/she has COVID-19 or not. This kind of warning system can help to detect cases of COVID-19 and reduce the number of undetected cases. For this, the symptoms of previous patients have to be stored in a repository. For example, the images of CT scans of normal people and coronavirus affected patients can be stored for training the system, while any new patient's CT scan image can be compared with the training images to find the similarity score. The main features of these patients can be found out from the application of machine learning. With the increase in the number of patient data, the training dataset will increase making the system's prediction work better.</p>

  <list-item id="o0040">
   <label>3.</label>
   <p id="p0175">To find the basic reproductive number of this virus.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0045">
   <label>4.</label>
   <p id="p0180">To find the effect on pregnancy of different stages on COVID-19 patients and their newborns.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0050">
   <label>5.</label>
   <p id="p0185">To find the effect of this virus on patients having heart disease, lungs problem, kidney disease, liver disease, cancers and other diseases.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0055">
   <label>6.</label>
   <p id="p0190">To find the effect of isolation or quarantine on the spread of this coronavirus. For example, we can analyze the data of China, where the spread of this disease has slowed down after applying strict quarantine measures.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0060">
   <label>7.</label>
   <p id="p0195">To find the effect of travel ban and school closure on the spreading of the virus.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="o0065">
   <label>8.</label>
   <p id="p0200">To predict the effect of different vaccinations and treatments on COVID-19 patients. This prediction can be done by analyzing datasets of other viral diseases that have vaccination/treatment attributes.</p>
