<p id="p0210">COVID-19 has become a pandemic across the globe since its first official appearance in China in December 2019. As of June 04, 2020, the disease is now in 213 countries and territories, with the USA having the highest confirmed cases of the world. Since early March 2020, the situation in China has improved due to a number of steps taken including strict quarantine measures and travel bans. Currently there is no effective treatment for COVID-19, the existing treatments are only for the symptoms. Hence, investigation into the pathogenesis of this infection is important for finding its appropriate treatment. It is shown here that the current increase in the number of confirmed cases over time can be modelled by polynomial regression of degree 2. However, new models have to be developed to reliably predict the future number of confirmed cases considering continuation and relaxation of lockdowns and other aspects. It is also shown in this work, that MLP, XGBoost and LR can reliably classify COVID-19 patients found in a dataset of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil. However, the effectiveness of the classifiers should be validated on a more reliable and larger dataset. With the use of machine learning and with the availability of data on important features, automatic predictions can be made on the possibility of a suspected person to have COVID-19. In future it is believed that different types of coronavirus outbreaks will continue originating from animals for example bats. Hence continuous research is required in the investigation of current and any future coronaviruses.</p>
