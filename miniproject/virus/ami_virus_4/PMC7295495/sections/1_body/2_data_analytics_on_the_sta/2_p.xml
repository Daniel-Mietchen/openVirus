<p id="p0070">The situation of this COVID-19 is changing very frequently. The work in Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] discusses about a number of datasets related to this virus. The authors in Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] also provide some visualization of this epidemic up to February 16, 2020. In this work, we analyze the dataset of June 04, 2020 provided by the Johns Hopkins University available in Kaggle repository [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This dataset has 35775 records as of June 04, 2020. The attributes of the dataset are Province/State, Country/Region, Latitude, Longitude, Date, Confirmed Cases, Deaths, and Recovered cases. We present data visualizations in terms of tables, bar charts, pie charts and other graphs. According to this dataset, 213 countries have confirmed cases of 6,632,985, death cases of 391,136, active cases of 3,371,886 and recovered cases of 2,869,963 by COVID-19 as of June 04, 2020. The death rate can be obtained in two ways. When the number of deaths is divided by the number of confirmed cases then death rate is 5.90%, however when number of deaths is divided by the number of closed cases (death + recovered) then death rate is 11.99%. For the rest of this paper, death rate will only be considered in terms of number of deaths over number of confirmed cases.
