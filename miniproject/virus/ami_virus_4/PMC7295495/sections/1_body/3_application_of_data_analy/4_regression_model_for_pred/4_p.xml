<p id="p0130">Different test and training portions are considered. Similar to the literature [
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], both linear regression and polynomial regression of different orders are compared in terms of coefficient of determination or R-squared value (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup>) which is statistically measure closeness of the data points to the fitted regression line, and adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> which adjusts the statistical measure based on the number of input variables. The difference between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> and adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> is that the value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> does not decrease with the increase of input variables that have low impact on output, while adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> penalizes for the addition of input variables that are uncorrelated with the outcome variable. Hence, adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> is a better metric than 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> for practical use case scenarios and for fairly comparing different models. Experiments are performed in Python language to compare the different models in modelling the number of confirmed cases in the world. It is observed from the experiment that the highest value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> and adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> are obtained for polynomial regression of degree 2. For a test size of 20% and a training size of 80% of the data samples, polynomial regression of degree 2 exhibits 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> of 0.8228 and adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> of 0.986. An adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> of 0.986 means that 98.60% of the variance in the confirmed cases can be explained from this regression model. In other words, this polynomial regression model has 98.60% accurately estimated the confirmed cases in the world up to June 04, 2020. The values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> for polynomial regression of degree 3 to 5, and linear regression are lower than 0.50 and thus unacceptable. 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows the values of the metric 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup>, adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup>, and parameters 
 <italic>a</italic>, 
 <italic>b</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic> for polynomial regression of degree 2 for test sizes of 20% as well as 10%. It can be seen that the value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> is significantly higher for a test size of 20%, while adjusted 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sup> is slightly higher for a test size of 10%. 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> presents the values of 
 <italic>a</italic>, 
 <italic>b</italic> and 
 <italic>c</italic> along with their values of t-statistics (denoted as t-stat) which is the ratio of a parameter divided by its standard error. 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref> shows the actual and predicted confirmed cases for polynomial regression of order 2 for test size of 20%. In this figure, x-axis indicates the number of days 0 indicates January 22, 2020 and y-axis represents the number of confirmed cases. From the dashed line which represents the predicted values one can predict the confirmed infection cases for a future day. For example, if the curve is extended for 30 more days, we can estimate what will be number of cases after 1 month assuming the increase in number follows the current pattern. 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> presents the predicted confirmed cases for future days with respect to June 4, 2020, the last day of the dataset. The predicted values are calculated using the model for polynomial regression of degree 2 shown in equation 
 <xref rid="fd2" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref>, and the values of the parameters of the model (test size 20%) given in
