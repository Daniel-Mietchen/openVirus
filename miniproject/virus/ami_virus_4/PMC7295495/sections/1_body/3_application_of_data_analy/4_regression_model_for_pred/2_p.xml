<p id="p0120">For the case of predicting a continuous quantity output regression is used, whereas classification is suitable for predicting a discrete class label output. Hence for modelling the number of confirmed cases over time and predicting the future evolution, regression is considered. There are a number of regressors in machine learning, in this paper, two widely used algorithms named linear regression and polynomial algorithms are considered. Linear regression is popular for simple algorithm and for a having well-known features. Linear regression finds an equation that ensures the smallest difference among the observed sample values and the corresponding fitted sample values. Polynomial regression is a special form of regression where the relationship between independent and dependent variable are modelled as a polynomial of n-th degree in the independent variable. The regression prediction can be evaluated by a number of metrics, but we will consider one of the popular metrics known as coefficient of determination or R-squared value (
