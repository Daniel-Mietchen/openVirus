 <xref rid="sec4.1" ref-type="sec">4.1</xref> that are for classifiers and for cross validation are considered. In this case a 20 fold cross validation is performed to split the dataset into training and testing portions. These performance of the classifiers are measures in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) termed as AUC value, testing accuracy. 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> shows the performance comparison of these algorithms. It can be seen that MLP has the highest testing accuracy value of 93.13%, while LR and XGBoost have the testing accuracy values of 92.12% and 91.57%, respectively. This means that the MLP can 93.13% accurately classify a negative (normal) case as normal and a positive (infected) case as infected. In other words, any classification test with MLP for this dataset has 93.13% probability to be correct. 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> also shows that MLP has the highest AUC value 96.70%. This means that the classifier can successfully separate the positive and negative classes of the COVID-19 suspected patients with 96.70% probability. In addition, MLP has the highest values of precision, recall and F1 score, all being 93%. Note that the 93% recall value of MLP means that the classifier identifies patients having the disease at 93% accuracy. In other words, if a patient is diagnosed as negative (normal) there is only 7% chance that the test is inaccurate. Both XGBoost and LR have precision, recall and F1 score values equal to or greater than 92%. Hence, among the classifiers considered, MLP, XGBoost and LR are good choices for classifying this specific dataset and thus predict COVID-19 patients reliably.
