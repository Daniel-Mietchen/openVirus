<p id="p0135">In the following machine learning algorithms are used for automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Currently there is a lack of acceptable datasets that could be used for prediction of COVID-19 in patients. One dataset is recently uploaded at [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] which contains 5644 samples with 111 attributes provided by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil. This dataset contains anonymized data samples collected by RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital. In a recent preprint paper [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], some results are provided on the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients using a subset of the dataset in Ref. [
