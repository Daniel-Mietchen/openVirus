<p id="p0140">First of all, preprocessing is done to process and standardize null values and categorical data. The attributes that have more than 99.80% null values in positive samples are dropped as these attributes are unlikely to predict positive cases. The records with mostly null values are also removed. This way the processed dataset has 1091 records and 61 columns. The target feature is converted to make positive samples or virus infected patients as ‘1’ and negative samples or normal persons as ‘0’. Next, feature selection is performed using the steps shown in 
 <xref rid="enun_Algorithm_1" ref-type="statement">Algorithm 1</xref> of Section 
 <xref rid="sec4.1" ref-type="sec">4.1</xref>. This provides us the ranking of all the features. The most 10 influential features are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> . It can be seen that ‘Serum Glucose’ has the best ranking (rank 1) and thus is the most influential attribute among all the attributes in the dataset. The second and third best attributes are ‘Respiratory Syncytial Virus’ and ‘Influenza A’, respectively.
