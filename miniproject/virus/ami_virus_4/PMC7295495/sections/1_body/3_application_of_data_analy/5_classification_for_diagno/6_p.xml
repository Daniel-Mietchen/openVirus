<p id="p0155">The performance of the classifiers in our work are better than that of the work in Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in terms of recall, AUC value and testing accuracy. For example, the highest value of AUC value in Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] is 84.70% compared to our highest AUC value of 96.70%, and the highest F1 score in Refs. [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] is 78.10% compared to our highest F1 score of 93%. The difference in the results of [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and our work are due the fact that the work in Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] considers only 245 suspected patients and 15 attributes. On the other hand, our work considers 1091 probable patients and 61 attributes after preprocessing. Moreover, the work in Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] uses the holdout method with 30% testing data and 70% training data. On the other hand, our work considers cross validation method for splitting the testing and training data samples.
