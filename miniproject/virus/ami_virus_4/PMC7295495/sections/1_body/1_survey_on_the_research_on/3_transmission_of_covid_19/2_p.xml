<p id="p0045">This section focuses on the transmission dynamics and reproductive number of COVID-19. There is a relation among the species of coronaviruses, geographical distributions of coronaviruses, bat species and reservoir hosts [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China, work-related transmission has been an important factor, and the infection may have spread greatly among health care workers, transport workers, services and sales workers [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The transmission of COVID-19 is estimated by the collection and analyzation of spatiotemporal data [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this regard, the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is estimated using the individual case reports of 140 infected persons. With the consideration of case reports, the estimates of the epidemiology parameters, human travel data and infection data, the basic reproductive number is found to be in between 4.7 and 6.6 [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There may be underreporting cases of coronavirus during the period of January 1-15, 2020 [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The cumulative incidence of 5502 cases in China is estimated with a confidence interval of 95% [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The epidemic of COVID-19 may spread due to some untraced exposures other than the exposure in seafood marker in China [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some patients do not show symptoms, while others have different types of symptoms [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Some patients have different symptoms such as pneumonia with problem identified in CT scan, acute respiratory distress syndrome, RNAaemia, etc. [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There may be undetected internationally imported cases too [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A transmission model in Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] estimated the basic reproductive number to be 3.11.
