 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As of April 2020, some of the main potential post-infection therapies known as favipiravir (antiviral against influenza), remdesivir (antiviral), lopinavir/ritonavir (antiviral) and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (antiparasitic and antirheumatic) â€“ are in the final stage of human testing [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The development of vaccine against COVID-19 started just after the publication of genetic sequence of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 on January 11, 2020. The first vaccine candidate started clinical trial on human on March 16, 2020. As of April 8, 2020, there are 78 confirmed active vaccine candidates of which 5 are into clinical development stage. Three of these are mRNA-1273, Ad5-nCoV and INO-4800 developed by Moderna, CanSino Biologicals, and Inovio, respectively. The remaining two LV-SMENP-DC and pathogen-specific aAPC are developed by Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute [
