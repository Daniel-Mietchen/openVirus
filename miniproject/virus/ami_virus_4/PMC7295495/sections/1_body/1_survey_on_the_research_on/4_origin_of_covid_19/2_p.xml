<p id="p0050">This section focuses on the time origin and genetic diversity of COVID-19. The increasing genetic diversity of this disease is indicated by phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood mapping analyses of the genome sequences [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The SARS and MERS diseases are caused by the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogens, respectively. SARS outbreak in 2002–2003 caused more than 8000 cases with 774 deaths in 37 countries. On the other hand, MERS outbreak in 2012 caused 2494 cases with 858 deaths in 27 countries over the world [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are infectious disease zoonotic in origin that means these are spread from animal to human. Bats are regarded as the animal host source, while palm civets and camels are the intermediate means between bats and animals for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. Similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 may be originated from bats, but the intermediate carrier between bats to humans is yet to be cleared [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The concepts of the pathology and pathogenesis used for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are now applied to find the characteristics of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. COVID-19 is a class of β-coronavirus genus, having a 79.0% and a 51.8% nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This virus has 96% similarity when compared with a bat coronavirus in terms of genome [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. COVID-19 is a recombinant virus which may be a homologous recombination of a bat coronavirus and another coronavirus whose origin is not known [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, COVID-19 has some genetic similarity with bat coronavirus and codon usage bias with snake or snake's translation machinery [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Four structural proteins are essential for the formation of coronavirus during virion assembly [
