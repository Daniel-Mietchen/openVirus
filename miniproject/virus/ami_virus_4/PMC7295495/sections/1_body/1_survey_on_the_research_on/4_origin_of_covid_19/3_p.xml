<p id="p0055">The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes non-structural proteins as well as structural proteins. The non-structural proteins are 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, papain-like protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The structural protein is spike glycoprotein. There are also accessory proteins [

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is found that the codon usage pattern of SARS-COV-2 is unique. When the codon usage of different viruses including SARS-CoV are taken into consideration, the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 is very much different from that of humans. For the case of SARS-CoV-2, the codons are replaced by ones with lower human-preference. Because of this unique codon usage pattern, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 was probably formed by evolving in an uncommon intermediate host for a long time. The codon biases are generated due to the evolution of genome composition [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. When whole genome level is taken into consideration, SARS-CoV-2 has 79.5% similarity to SARS-CoV and 96% similarity to the bat coronavirus (RaTG13) [
