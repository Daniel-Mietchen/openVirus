 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] evaluates the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 for the case of nine pregnant women and possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission of this virus. The data related to clinical records, lab tests, and chest CT scans of those women are studied. According to the study [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], as of February 4, 2020, seven patients had fever, four had cough, three had myalgia, two had sore throat, two had malaise, two had fetal distress, five had lymphopenia, three had increased aminotransferase concentrations, and no one died. Furthermore, the study reports that no neonatal asphyxia was observed in 9 newborn babies. Results of these nine patients indicate that COVID-19 may not cause intrauterine fetal infections at pregnancy. However, the small sample size of nine patients is not good enough to come to a definite conclusion. The interaction between the human innate immune system and COVID-19 is studied in Ref. [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to understand the virus induced inflammation of lung tissues. The results show that the infection can be controlled by humoral immunity, targeted immunotherapy can be useful [
