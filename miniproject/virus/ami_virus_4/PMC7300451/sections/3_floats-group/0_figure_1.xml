  <p>Potential pathways of aggravation of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection by ADE. Initially, the spike protein of SARS‐CoV‐2 binds through the RBD to angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell surface for virus invasion. After some days, humoral responses develop against the virus, eliminating infection through allosteric and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). After a second infection with the same SARS‐CoV‐2 strain virus destruction may occur, if the NAb titer is high enough. However, in case of a low NAb titer, ADE may be observed following binding of the SARS‐CoV‐2/antibody complex to ACE2, internalization of the complex and IgG induced stimulation. In addition, immunized patients may be re‐infected with a different SARS‐CoV‐2 strain, such as a RBD‐mutated strain. In this context, already existing Abs could bind with reduced affinity to mutated RBD, inducing low levels of SARS‐CoV‐2/antibody complexes, following by internalization through the ACE2 receptor and ADE . On the other hand, immunized patients re‐infected by an RBD‐mutated strain may present sufficient Ab blockade of the heterotypic SARS‐CoV‐2 strain. In this case, SARS‐CoV‐2 covered by Abs may connect to Fcγ receptors II (FcγRII) on the surface of B cells or other professional antigen‐presenting cells (APCs). This receptor mediates SARS‐CoV‐2 invasion into immune cells, further spreading viral infection into all organs and ADE.</p>
