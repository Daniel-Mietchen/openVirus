<p>Dengue viruses (DENV) are members of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family and present four serotypes (DENV‐1, DENV‐2, DENV‐3, and DENV‐4) (
 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>). They are capable of causing classic dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and are the leading cause of child death in some countries (

Basically, after inoculation by the mosquito, local dendritic cells and macrophages are infected, followed by virus entry into the bloodstream and infection of other blood cells. This context results in leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in laboratory tests of patients (

This humoral response produces protective serotype‐specific antibodies. These antibodies cross‐react, but do not neutralize other virus subtypes, failing to offer protective immunity against them (
