<p>The phenomenon, in which preexisting non‐neutralizing antibodies lead to enhanced infection, is termed ADE. Beyond studies with patients suggesting this phenomenon in DENV infection, highlighting those described above with newborn infants and children (

 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>), studies in vitro and with animal model also suggest ADE upon secondary DENV infections. Growth curves of DENV in vitro with peripheral blood leukocytes from non‐immunized and immunized animals indicated that preexisting antibodies play a role in ADE (
