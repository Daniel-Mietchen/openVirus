<p>IgG antibodies against the specific DENV serotype could cross the placenta and enter into the blood to fetuses, resulting in a detrimental immune response against other serotypes after the birth. In fact, children with passive immunity from immunized mothers tend to present DHF during their first DENV infection (

Similar to natural infection and passive‐acquired immunity, vaccines against one specific serotype produce cross‐reactive non‐neutralizing antibodies against other serotypes, predisposing the enhanced illness in secondary heterotypic infection (
