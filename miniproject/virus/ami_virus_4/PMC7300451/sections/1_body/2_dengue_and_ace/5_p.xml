<p>In DENV‐ADE, non‐NAbs bind DENV, and this complex is recognized and internalized by Fcγ receptor (FcγR)‐bearing cells, resulting in increased virus load and possibly enhanced illness. In fact, FcγRIIA‐expressing BHK cells cultured with sera from patients after secondary infection presented 10‐fold higher virus titers compared to cells without this receptor (
