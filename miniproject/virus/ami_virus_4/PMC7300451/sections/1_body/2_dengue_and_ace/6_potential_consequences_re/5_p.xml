<p>A possible mechanism for viral entry based on the ADE mechanism has been postulated (
 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>). NAbs recognizing the RBD of the S protein of the MERS coronavirus bind to the Fc receptor and allow virus entry. The NAb‐Fc receptor complex would mimic the cell surface virus receptor and promote virus entry pathways into IgG Fc receptor‐expressing cells (

If this was confirmed for SARS‐CoV‐2, the aim to block virus entry by neutralizing antibodies against S protein domains could have the opposite of the desired effect. Instead of blocking virus entry, cell infection would be facilitated, and the spectrum of infected cell types possibly extended. Such a mechanism needs to be considered for therapeutic antibody and vaccine design (
