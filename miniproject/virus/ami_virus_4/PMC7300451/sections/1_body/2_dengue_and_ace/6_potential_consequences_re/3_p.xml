<p>Spike (S) proteins of SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 are binding with the receptor‐binding domain (RBD) to the enzymatic domain of angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell surface. The S protein is then hydrolyzed by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and can enter the host cell. Data from the two SARS‐CoV outbreaks in 2003 and 2004 indicate that infectivity and disease severity are positively correlated with RBD/ACE2 binding affinity (
