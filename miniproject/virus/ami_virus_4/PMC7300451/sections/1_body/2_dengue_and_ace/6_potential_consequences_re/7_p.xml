<p>In line with such mechanism, cell entry of SARS‐CoV spike‐pseudo‐typed lentiviral particles was facilitated in cell lines expressing FcγRII, but not ACE2, in the presence of anti‐spike antisera from mice immunized with inactivated SARS‐CoV or S‐protein (

 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>). All animals actively vaccinated with Ankara virus encoding full‐length SARS‐CoV S protein developed anti‐spike Nabs. Both, active vaccination or passive vaccination with an anti‐spike antibody, but not mock immunization, induced severe lung injury after SARS‐CoV infection. The authors also show elevated titer of IgG NAbs in deceased SARS‐CoV patients compared to recovered patients.
