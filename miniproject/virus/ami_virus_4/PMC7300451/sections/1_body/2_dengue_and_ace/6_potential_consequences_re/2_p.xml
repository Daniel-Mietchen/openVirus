<p>Coronaviruses belong to the 
 <italic>Coronavirida</italic> family (
 <italic>Orthocornavirinae</italic> subfamily) and are RNA viruses like the dengue virus. Specific for Coronaviridae is their “corona” of spikes (S) that has the function of docking to specific receptors on the host cell and inducing the entry and thereafter the replication of the virus. Coronaviruses can be grouped into at least seven strains (
 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>) with SARS‐CoV‐2 as the latest member of this family. Most of these strains induce common cold, but three (SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV, SARS‐CoV‐2) may induce more severe disease courses.
