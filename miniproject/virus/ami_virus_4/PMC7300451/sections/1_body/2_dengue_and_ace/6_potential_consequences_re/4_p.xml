<p>Wrapp and co‐workers (
 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>) conclude from results using biolayer interferometry that vaccines or neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) developed against SARS‐CoV may not be appropriate for SARS‐CoV‐2. Walls and co‐workers (
 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>) in contrast demonstrated in a cell culture model that NAbs derived from SARS‐CoV immunized mice prevented SARS‐CoV‐2 pseudovirus entry. Even though, mutations at critical sites of the RBD domain could lead to an increasing binding affinity to ACE2 (
 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>) and/or CD147, and already existing NAbs in seropositive individuals could bind with reduced affinity to the RBD domain. However, at this stage, the relevance of ADE in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection is speculative (
