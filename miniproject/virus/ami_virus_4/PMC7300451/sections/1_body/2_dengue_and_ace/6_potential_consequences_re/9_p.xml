<p>While the probability of SARS‐CoV or MERS‐CoV recovered for a second infection was extremely low because of low prevalence of SARS‐CoV with roughly 8,000 cases worldwide (

 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>) and MERS‐CoV with ~2,000 cases, such a possibility is real in the case of SARS‐CoV‐2. Concurrently, our search did not yield any reliable epidemiological and clinical studies on CoV‐related ADE in humans; however, in case of secondary infection with a mutated virus, ADE cases might be observed (
 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>). The authors of this article suggest that the concentration of severe cases of COVID‐19 in certain geographic areas results from ADE responses induced by antibodies developed against similar epitopes of local viruses. This interpretation conflicts with experimental results from Ou et al.(
 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>), who found that antisera from recovered SARS or COVID‐19 patients had only limited cross neutralization effects of 293/hACE2 cells' infection with SARS‐CoV S or SARS‐CoV‐2 S pseudovirons.
