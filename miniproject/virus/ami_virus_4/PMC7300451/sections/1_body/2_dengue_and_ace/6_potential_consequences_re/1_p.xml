<p>The critical question is, whether ADE is relevant in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and COVID‐19. Would morbidity and mortality increase in individuals with immunity against one SARS‐CoV‐2 strain when becoming infected a second time with the same or another virus strain? Could individuals vaccinated with an active vaccine, who had been previously “naïve” to SARS‐CoV‐2 develop ADE when infected? There are epidemiologic similarities between dengue fever and SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. For both, fatalities substantially increase in adults &gt;65 years of age (at least during the primary infection), and for most infected the disease course is asymptomatic or displays only mild symptoms so that the number of infected is generally underestimated.</p>
