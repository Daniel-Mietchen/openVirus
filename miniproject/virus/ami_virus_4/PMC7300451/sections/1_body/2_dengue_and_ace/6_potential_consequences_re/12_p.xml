<p>Are there indications that ADE might be relevant in the SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic? By nature, at this time point, trustworthy proofs for ADE playing clinically a role are not available and might be expected earliest in fall of 2020. Even so, the potential threat of ADE has to be investigated more closely, particularly in view of the vast number of recovered individuals who have already developed immunity. Thus, ADE is of relevance for the strategies for vaccine development and therapeutic agents. For example, ADE can play a role in individuals with immunity and NAbs against strain A if the next infection is by RBD mutated strain B. Antistrain A NAbs may not neutralize strain B, or antibody titers are too low for sufficient neutralization, or NAbs have efficient neutralizing capabilities, but cell entry occurs via FcγRII into APCs or B cells (
