<p>Flow and image cytometry are an important part of this endeavor. Quantitative flow cytometry assays for primary cells and cell culture experiments for testing mechanisms of antisera, NAbs and virus attachment and entry have been already applied for different coronaviruses (

Such studies have already started and are urgently needed for a deeper understanding of the underlying immune responses and early identification of patients with severe disease course, following up therapeutic interventions. They are important for decision‐making, which part of the population would profit from active vaccination and which would be at risk to develop ADE. Sorting of RB‐specific memory B cells for the production of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (
