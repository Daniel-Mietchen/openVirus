<p>New protocols need to be developed and experiments performed applying best practices for performing carefully reproducible flow cytometry under safety conditions (

 <xref rid="cytoa24047-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref>). In the past, virus size and limitations of staining were a limiting problem for most flow cytometers. In view of that, an alternative method was the coupling of fluorescence emitting reporter coding to virus particles for experiments on virus infection in cell culture (
