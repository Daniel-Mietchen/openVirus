<p>In the last decade, dengue fever outbreaks had a comparable number of infected, several tens of millions. Most of them recovered and presented an adaptive immunity against the virus. Here, we will briefly discuss effects when individuals with an anti‐dengue antibody (Ab) are re‐infected by the dengue virus and relate the findings with the present SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic. Our incentive is to discuss features in antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) already known for dengue and discuss them in regards of perspectives of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections.</p>
