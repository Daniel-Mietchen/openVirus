  </boxed-text>SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic and recurrent dengue epidemics in tropical countries are a global health threat. Both virus‐caused infections may only reveal light symptoms, but also cause severe diseases. As known for Dengue infections, Antibody‐Dependent Enhancement (ADE) can occur during a second infection with a different virus strain: Preexisting antibodies do not neutralize but enhance infection, possibly by triggering FcgR‐mediated virus uptake. Thus, previous coronavirus infections or infections with different SARS‐CoV‐2 strains could promote ADE and aggravate COVID‐19.
