<p id="para0001">THE coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed hospital systems and placed extraordinary demands on healthcare providers worldwide. The fast-spreading and sustained nature of the pandemic has resulted in a critical shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). This may have contributed to significant numbers of healthcare workers in Italy and Spain testing positive for the disease.

 </xref> Although the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus primarily is transmitted through close contact and droplets, airborne transmission has been observed in the healthcare setting. Procedures associated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can result in aerosolization of the virus and create the potential for this type of transmission.

 </xref> A systematic review of published studies from the 2002 to 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic concluded that intubation poses the highest risk of aerosol generation and viral transmission.

 </xref> However, exposure to chest compressions correlated strongly with exposure to intubation in that study, making it difficult to attribute the exposure to chest compressions alone. The need to protect and preserve the healthcare workforce has generated critical evaluations and revisions of hospital resuscitation policies for COVID-19 patients. These revisions have ranged from early discussions of goals of care
