<p id="para0018">CPR in COVID-19 patients is a resource-intensive procedure that requires a disproportionate number of healthcare personnel and the use of scarce PPE. Procedures associated with CPR generate aerosols, which can result in airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A study from Wuhan, China, which investigated outcomes after CPR in COVID-19 patients, found that only 1 of 136 patients (0.7%) survived for at least 30 days with a favorable neurologic outcome. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that healthcare providers accounted for up to 11% of reported cases of COVID-19 in some US states.

 </xref> The risk of exposure to healthcare workers, coupled with dismal outcomes after CPR, have prompted hospital systems worldwide to critically evaluate their policies for resuscitating COVID-19 patients. The Italian Scientific Society of Anesthesiologists addressed this ethical dilemma by recommending that health- care resources be directed to favor “greatest life expectancy.”
