<p id="para0020">As a result, ethical guidelines have recommended a nuanced, utilitarian approach in which CPR is provided to patients who request it when resources are available and healthcare workers can be protected adequately. The principle of utility justifies delaying CPR until healthcare workers have donned appropriate PPE, interrupting CPR during intubation, and minimizing the number of healthcare workers in the room.

 </xref> Donning PPE and securing the airway may delay CPR by up to 10 minutes. Delaying CPR is associated with increased mortality, with each minute resulting in a 5.5% decline in the survival rate.

 </xref> However, prioritizing the safety of healthcare workers enables them to treat a greater number of future patients and increases the long-term benefits to society. Utilitarian ethics also may be applied to the allocation of resources during an infectious pandemic. In the context of resuscitation, these include PPE, ventilators, ECMO circuits, and healthcare personnel. When any of these resources is scarce, the consensus among ethical guidelines published during this pandemic is that they are allocated to patients with the best prognosis based on available data.
