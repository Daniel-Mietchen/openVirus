<p id="para0019">The ethics supporting the general provision of CPR in cardiac arrest are based on giving each patient the opportunity to survive. Among the competing ethical principles of autonomy, utility, and justice, autonomy is prioritized in the United States. The principle of autonomy has supported the use of CPR even in patients in whom medical professionals have deemed the procedure to be futile.

 </xref> Some US hospitals have considered an extreme policy in which autonomy is completely overridden and patients with COVID-19 are universally denied mechanical ventilation and resuscitation.

 </xref> This approach is problematic because emerging data from the pandemic suggest that up to one-third of mechanically ventilated patients survive to discharge.

 </xref> Despite the high overall mortality after CPR, a universal do-not-resuscitate (DNR) approach may deny potentially life-saving interventions to patients with reversible causes of cardiopulmonary arrest, such as arrhythmias. Universal DNR policies also have the effect of eroding public trust in the healthcare system and may discourage patients from consenting to DNR orders when these are in line with their wishes.
