 </xref> The authors’ group conducts scenario-based CPR training to improve competence with their algorithm (Video 1). The authors also recommend the placement of all equipment necessary to manage CPR in these patients in a central location that is accessible to the clinical team and dedicated to COVID-19 patients to avoid transmission to non-COVID-19 patients.
