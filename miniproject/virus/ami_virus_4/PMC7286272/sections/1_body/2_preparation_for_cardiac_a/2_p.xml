<p id="para0004">In patients at risk for clinical deterioration, it is the authors’ practice to preemptively place invasive lines with extensions allowing for laboratory draws and medication delivery from outside the room (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> ). Similarly, infusion pumps can be coupled with microbore extension tubing to allow for titration of sedative and vasoactive medications remotely (
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref> ). Commercially available microbore extension tubing has priming volumes ranging from 0.5 mL to 2.0 mL for each 5-foot segment. The authors connect three 5-foot microbore tubing segments in a series, each with 1 mL of priming volume, to facilitate remote management of infusions. Some ventilators, such as the Hamilton G5 (Hamilton Medical AG, Bonaduz, Switzerland), allow the console to be separated by up to 10 feet from the ventilator. The authors use this separation to place the console in the hallway outside the patient's room, allowing for remote ventilator management (
