<p id="para0002">Interim resuscitation guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA), in collaboration with 5 professional societies, including the American Society of Anesthesiologists, recommend a discussion of the goals of care on arrival to the hospital, mandatory use of PPE for all rescue personnel, and limited personnel in the room and use of mechanical compression devices when available to reduce provider exposure to SARS-CoV-2.

 </xref> For intubated patients, the guidelines recommend maintaining mechanical ventilation with a high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter to reduce aerosolization.

 </xref> As of May 2020, there were no published resuscitation procedures following these guidelines with widely available equipment in the intensive care unit (ICU). The authors herein propose a model of CPR in the ICU using a mechanical compression system designed to minimize infectious exposure and conserve PPE.
