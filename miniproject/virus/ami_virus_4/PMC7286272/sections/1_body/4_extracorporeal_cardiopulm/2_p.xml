<p id="para0017">However, the role of ECMO after CPR (E-CPR) in patients with COVID-19 is unclear, and there is little guidance from the literature regarding this practice. As of May 26, 2020, the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization registry contained 10 reports of COVID-19 patients who underwent E-CPR, but their outcomes were not reported.

 </xref> The decision to initiate E-CPR should be made while considering the availability of ECMO resources and the risk of infectious exposure to personnel involved in cannulation and subsequent bedside management.
