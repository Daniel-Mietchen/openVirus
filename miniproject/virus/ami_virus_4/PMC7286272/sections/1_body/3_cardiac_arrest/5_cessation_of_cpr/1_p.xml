<p id="para0014">Cessation of CPR occurs after ROSC, initiation of ECMO, or when additional resuscitation is deemed futile. Some authors have recommended cessation of CPR at 30 minutes, after careful consideration of the possible etiologies of cardiac arrest.

 </xref> Reversible causes, such as hypoxemia and acidosis, should be treated before discontinuing CPR. Hemodynamic decompensation after ROSC is achieved should prompt evaluation for hemorrhage and tension pneumothorax, which can result from rib fractures in patients who may be on therapeutic anticoagulation. Because of the high incidence of prothrombotic coagulopathy in COVID-19 patients, thromboembolic events may contribute disproportionately to cardiopulmonary arrest.

 </xref> Alteplase administration therefore should be considered when pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction is the suspected etiology of cardiac arrest in COVID-19 patients.
