To overcome this, the authors have used hospital-based mobile phones and the video conferencing application Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) to facilitate secure, real-time communication during CPR. The authors’ group has used video conferencing during CPR to coordinate periodic pulse checks, relay physical findings to the external team, and call for necessary equipment to be delivered to the room.
