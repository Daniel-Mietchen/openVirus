 </xref> In the authors’ protocol, once the airway is adequately secured and the mechanical compression device is appropriately placed and activated, the respiratory therapist exits the room, leaving the proceduralist and 1 additional team member in the room. While the team member manages the compression device and periodically checks the pulse, the proceduralist can establish arterial or central venous access as necessary, perform point-of-care ultrasound examinations, and convey clinical information to the external team. For patients who are mechanically ventilated before cardiac arrest, only 2 team members may be required to enter the patient's room. When the authors’ ICU staffing is optimal, a team leader, recorder, respiratory therapist, pharmacist, and a resource ICU nurse are present outside the room. The team leader integrates clinical, hemodynamic, and laboratory information to direct resuscitative efforts. The recorder keeps time and records interventions, the respiratory therapist manages the ventilator, the pharmacist prepares medications, and the resource ICU nurse can administer medications and mobilize necessary supplies. When ICU staffing is strained, these roles are consolidated further. For example, the team leader can manage the ventilator, and the resource ICU nurse can both prepare and inject medications.
