<p id="para0010">In spontaneously breathing patients, preoxygenation with 100% oxygen for 3- to- 5 minutes delays oxygen desaturation. AHA guidelines for CPR in COVID-19 patients recommend preoxygenation with either bag-mask devices equipped with HEPA filters or passive oxygenation using nonrebreather face masks.

 </xref> One study found that during bag-mask use, leakage of air from the sides of the mask actually may increase when a HEPA filter is attached to the front of the mask.

 </xref> It is the authorsâ€™ practice to passively preoxygenate patients using nonrebreather face masks to reduce the risk of infectious exposure from mask leak.
