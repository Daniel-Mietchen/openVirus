 </xref> However, there is little guidance from the literature on how to perform CPR in patients who are positioned prone. A review of 23 cases in which CPR was performed on predominantly spine surgery patients in the prone position found that a variety of “thoracic spine compression” techniques were effective in generating cardiac output.

 </xref> One study found that performing CPR with the patient in the prone position produced higher mean arterial pressure readings than those for patients in the supine position.

 </xref> The interim AHA guidelines recommend performing CPR without turning the patient to the supine position in COVID-19 patients who have an established airway. Defibrillator pads should be placed in the anterior-posterior position, whereas compressions should be performed over the T7- to- T10 vertebral bodies.

 </xref> The adequacy of chest compressions can be monitored with arterial line pressure or continuous end-tidal capnography if these monitors are available. Prone patients without an advanced airway should be placed in a supine position to facilitate intubation.
