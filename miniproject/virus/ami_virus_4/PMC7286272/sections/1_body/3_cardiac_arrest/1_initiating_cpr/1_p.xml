<p id="para0006">The authorsâ€™ protocol calls for the activation of a designated CPR team when a patient experiences deteriorating hemodynamics or cardiac arrest. For patients who are not intubated or who lack vascular access, 3- to- 4 team members enter the room to carry out resuscitative efforts, including a clinician with expertise in airway management and the placement of invasive lines (proceduralist), the patient's primary nurse, an assisting nurse, and the patient's primary respiratory therapist to help with intubation and set up of the ventilator connection. This design of a minimized personnel team is consistent with published recommendations.
