<p id="para0008">After the team enters the room, the authors recommend that team members rapidly evaluate the patient for treatable causes of cardiac arrest. Mechanisms of cardiac arrest specific to COVID-19 patients include hypoxemia from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiogenic shock from viral myocarditis, vasoplegic shock from sepsis, thrombotic complications, and arrhythmias from drug interactions.

 </xref> Decreased frequency of radiologic imaging to reduce exposure may delay diagnosis of pneumothorax and mainstem intubation in these patients. Pneumothorax is uncommon and may result from the prolonged use of higher positive end-expiratory pressure and driving pressures to ventilate fibrotic lungs in end-stage COVID-19 ARDS.

 </xref> Both needle decompression and chest tube placement for pneumothorax can result in air leak into the room and viral aerosolization. Trauma surgery guidelines recommend the placement of a 12- or 14-Fr percutaneous tube and attachment to a closed drainage system with an inline viral filter to reduce infectious exposure.
