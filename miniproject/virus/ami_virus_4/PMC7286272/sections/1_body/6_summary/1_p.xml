<p id="para0022">CPR in COVID-19 patients presents a unique challenge to healthcare systems because it requires extensive preparation and planning and leveraging available resources and trained personnel. All hospitalized patients suspected to have COVID-19 should be engaged in a discussion regarding the goals of care and any existing advanced directives. Hospital systems should develop a plan for resuscitating COVID-19 patients that protects healthcare workers because a robust healthcare workforce is essential to combatting pandemic illnesses. It is essential that all healthcare providers don appropriate PPE before attempting CPR, even if it delays care. Tracheal intubation carries the greatest risk of viral aerosolization and strategies to reduce infectious exposure should be used throughout the process. Reliable communication is critical when CPR is coordinated from outside the patient's room. Telehealth modalities, which include some combination of voice and video transmission, have been used worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic to maximize communication while minimizing infectious exposure.</p>
