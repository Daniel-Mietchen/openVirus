<p>The median incubation period of this adenovirus infection was 5.2 days; this period is similar to the literature-reported value of 5.6 days [
 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; for 95% of patients, the median incubation period was fewer than 7 days. Beginning on November 10, we isolated all new patients and then prevented them from contacting susceptible people. Therefore, most susceptible individuals who were infected before November 10 experienced disease onset during the following 7 days. From November 17, the number of new patients each day decreased rapidly, thus indicating that strict isolation was beneficial for rapid control of the epidemic. The generation time of an epidemic reflects not only a virusâ€™s epidemiological characteristics but also the frequency of contact among people. The median generation time for this epidemic was 7.3 days, the period of which is longer than the median generation time for a typical influenza A (H1N1) outbreak (2.7 days) [
 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The median symptom duration for patients under treatment was 6 days, the period of which was shorter than the hospitalization duration (9 days). This difference is because the patients stayed in the hospital for several days after recovery to ensure complete viral clearance.
