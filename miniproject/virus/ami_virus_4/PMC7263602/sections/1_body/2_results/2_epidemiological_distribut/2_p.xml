<p>A total of 375 patients were involved in this outbreak. Among them, 99 patients were laboratory confirmed, and 276 patients were clinically diagnosed. A total of 266 patients were treated in the isolated treatment area, and 109 patients were hospitalized. Chest CT examinations showed that 32 patients had an intrapulmonary infection or effusion. Overall, the involved patients included 17 trainers and 358 trainees; the numbers of involved patients consisting of trainers and trainees corresponded to attack rates of 12.6% and 42.9%, respectively. Fisher’s exact test showed that the attack rates for these two groups were significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001). The attack rates for the first, second, and third district teams were 38.2%, 32.6%, and 44.9%, respectively. A chi-square test showed that the attack rates among the three groups were significantly different (χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 10.05, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.01). Trainer and trainee ages are shown in
