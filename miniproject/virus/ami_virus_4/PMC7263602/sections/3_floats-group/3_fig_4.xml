  <title>Cumulative probability distributions of the incubation period, generation time, symptom duration, and hospitalization duration.</title>
  <p>Legend: A. Cumulative probability distribution function of the incubation period. The blue area indicates 1000 cumulative probability distribution function curves with lognormal distribution drawn by the bootstrap method; the point and interval estimations were obtained from the lognormal distribution. B. Cumulative probability distribution function of the generation time. The blue area represents the interval estimate of the Weibull distribution. C. Survival curves of symptom duration and hospitalization duration.</p>
