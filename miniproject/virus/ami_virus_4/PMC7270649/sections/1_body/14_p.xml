<p id="par0075">The major challenge to anesthesiologists is the care for patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. All anesthesiology services should have well defined flows and processes for the care of these patients and to protect professionals involved. Although, in times of pandemic all patients may pose a risk of being virus carriers, a dedicated operation room is recommended for the care of critical patients, mainly if negative pressure rooms, ideal for these scenarios, are not possible. As the entire routine of the surgical block will be changed, if there are suspected or confirmed patients, appropriate training, systematic checking, accessible checklists and dedicated areas for gowning and ungowning should be implemented.
