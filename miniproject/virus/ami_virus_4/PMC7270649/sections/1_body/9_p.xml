<p id="par0050">There still are no specific recommendations for mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 patients. The recommendations are the same protective pulmonary measures used for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), such as tidal volume ≤ 6 mL/kg of predicted weight, respiratory rate ≤ 35/min, plateau pressure ≤ 30 cmH
 <sub>2</sub>O and PEEP ≥ 5 cmH
 <sub>2</sub>O.

 <sub>2</sub> between 55 and 80 mmHg, with SpO
 <sub>2</sub> between 88 and 95% and permissive hypercapnia. There is no recommendation for a specific ventilation mode, putting the patient in the prone position is recommended, but use of ECMO still presents conflicting data.
