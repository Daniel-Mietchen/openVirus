<p id="par0120">Health professionals will be greatly affected by this pandemic, and this has been observed in previous scenarios. There already were over 100 health professionals infected in a single institution and in quarantine due to COVID-19. Telemedicine can contribute to minimizing the risk, and the current sanitary crisis can contribute to speeding up the adoption of video consultations in our environment. Many American hospitals already have telemedicine triage systems at emergency rooms, which can be performed by physicians and other professionals in quarantine, leaving other professionals to care for critical patients.
