<p id="par0105">Using HEPA (
 <italic>high efficiency particulate air</italic>) type filters between facial masks and the Y respiratory circuit is recommended, in addition to another filter between the expiratory limb and the anesthesia machine.

 </xref> Tracheal intubation, preferably with a video laryngoscope, is the technique of choice to control airways, and more experienced anesthesiologists should perform the intubation. All circuit extensors should be placed before intubation to avoid unnecessary disconnections. Pre-oxygenation should be performed with an appropriate seal between the patient's face and the mask, and intubation should be fast sequence to avoid positive pressure ventilation under a facial mask. Patients should be intubated to a deep plane and with an appropriate neuromuscular blockade to avoid coughing.

 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> During extubation, care should be taken to avid coughing and spread of aerosols. Anti-emetics to minimize risk of vomiting and consequent coughing during anesthetic recovery is recommended. Intravenous lidocaine immediately before extubation can also contribute to minimizing the occurrence of coughing.

 </xref> Oropharyngeal suction should be performed with a rigid suction tube to avoid contamination of part of the face by the flexible suction tube. Post-anesthesia recovery should be done in the operation room, and if transportation of the intubated patient to the intensive care unit is required, closed circuit ventilation should be used and unnecessary disconnections avoided.
