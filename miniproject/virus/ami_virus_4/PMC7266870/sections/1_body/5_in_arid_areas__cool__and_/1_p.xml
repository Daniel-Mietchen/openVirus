<p>Contrasting with the high humidity areas, RHs of Iran, Iraq, India, the midwestern United States, and other arid areas in the middle and low latitudes are usually lower than 20%. Although the midday temperatures in these areas are usually &gt;20°C (or even &gt; 30°C), the night temperature may below 10°C (especially at high altitudes), which may facilitate the spread of the virus. The influenza virus can survive for more than 24 h in the environment of 23–25% RH and 7–8°C (

A recent report indicated that inhalation of dry air (20% RH, compared with 50% RH) impairs mucociliary clearance, the innate antiviral defense against influenza virus infections (
