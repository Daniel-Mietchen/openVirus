<p>Another reason for the opposite conclusions drawn from different researchers may be the weak correlations between temperature and humidity and SARS-CoV-2 propagation. For example, correlation coefficients acquired from the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, USA, were as low as 0.25–0.4 (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The correlation coefficient between average temperature and COVID-19 pandemic in Jakarta, Indonesia, was only 0.392 (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The high level of virus shedding and long viral persistence in aerosols may be main reasons. High levels of the virus in throat swabs have been observed in COVID-19 patients [either symptomatic or asymptomatic; (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)]. It is worth noticing that the peak viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was more than 1,000 times higher than SARS-CoV-1, and active SARS-CoV-2 replication in upper respiratory tract tissues has been found, where SARS-CoV-1 is not thought to replicate at this site (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The half-lives of SARS (SARS-CoV-1) and SARS-CoV-2 were almost the same in aerosols with averages of about 1.1–1.2 h (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), which is, however, about two times the half-life of influenza viruses [31.6 min; (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)]. Thus, for SARS-CoV-2, 1-h half-life might be enough long for an effective transmission, where temperature or humidity only exerts a week influence to the viral persistence.
