<p>Various reports have drawn contradictory conclusions even when using the similar meteorological data and epidemic data collected in cities in China from January to April 2020. For example, Liu et al. (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) analyzed meteorological data of 30 cities in China and suggested that low temperature, mild diurnal temperatures, and low humidity likely aid the transmission of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Shi et al. (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) also suggested that the incidence of COVID-19 decreases with an increase in temperature. Qi et al. (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) further showed that both temperature and humidity were negative associated with COVID-19. Using the similar meteorological data of 122 cities in China, however, Xie and Zhu (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) found no evidence to support that theory that the number of COVID-19 cases would reduce when the weather became warmer. They even showed a positive correlation between temperature and COVID-19 cases in that 1°C rise in the mean temperature (when &lt;3°C) was associated with a 4.9% increase in the daily confirmed cases. Also, with meteorological data in China, Yao et al. (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) demonstrated that neither ambient temperature nor ultraviolet radiation has a significant impact on the transmission ability of SARS-CoV-2. For countries outside of China, there are also a large number of contradictory reports. Bashir et al. (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) found that average temperature, minimum temperature, and air quality were significantly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in New York, USA, although the correlations were complex. In Jakarta, Indonesia, Tosepu et al. (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) demonstrated that the average temperature was indicated to be significantly correlated with the COVID-19 pandemic. In the city of Barcelona, Spain, Tobíasa and Molina (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) further indicated that a 1°C increase of max temperature reduced a decrease in the incidence rate by 7.5% on the same day. However, also in Spain, Briz-Redóna and Serrano-Arocab (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) found no significant relationship between COVID-19 cases and the temperatures. In addition, Jahangiri et al. (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) indicated that the transmission rate of the COVID-19 exhibited a low sensibility to the changes in the ambient temperature in Iran.
