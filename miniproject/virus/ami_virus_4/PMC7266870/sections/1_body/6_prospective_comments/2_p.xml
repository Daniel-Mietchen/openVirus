<p>Most of the current studies have been based on the correlation analysis between the meteorological data and the epidemic data. However, direct studies with SARS-CoV-2 under different environmental conditions are still lacking. The environment variables determining the viral persistence and spread of SARS-like coronaviruses through aerial habitats are still less understood. Besides the studies of epidemiology, biological sciences and medical sciences, the contributions of environmental research are urgently warranted for controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally.</p>
