<p>Given that the pressure of saturation vapors is correlated with the temperature exponentially, both water vapor levels and temperatures influence RH. Therefore, either temperature or RH has effects on evaporation, thus influencing size of the droplets (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The survival time of influenza virus in aerosol is prolonged at low RH, which may result in a low viral dose required for an efficient trans-infection. A large number of studies have suggested that both size distribution of droplets and the dynamic of the virus emitted through coughing are affected by air humidity (
