<p>It is suggested that, at a high humidity, such as humidity &gt;70%, viruses survive under moist conditions in the droplets under physiological contents of salts; at moderate humidity (40â€“60%), salts are concentrated due to the evaporation that deactivates the viruses; and, at low humidity, humidity &lt;30%, salts crystallize out of solution, which may keep the virus active (

It is also proposed that, under dry but cool indoor environments, such as in winter, low humidity allows viral aerosols persist for a longer time in air because of their smaller sizes, thus increasing the spread of the virus. In warm areas, however, the relatively-low temperature and near-saturation humidity during the rainy season facilitate the spread of the virus via large aerosol particles (

A recent study reported that a COVID-19 patient had transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to eight healthy contacts through bathing at a bath center, implying that the cluster spread of the virus could still arise in a condition of warm (hot) and near-saturation humidity (
