<p id="para40">A main issue is the low specificity: 36% specificity means that the majority (64%) of people with suspected disease waiting a day or more in isolation for laboratory confirmation have other diseases. They are exposed to patients with Ebola virus disease and their diagnostic work-up is delayed. Clinical workflows have to ensure that the low specificity of the case definition does not lead to collateral deaths resulting from delayed diagnostic work-up and treatment of other infectious diseases. By contrast, 36% specificity of a clinical and epidemiological diagnosis is comparably high, implying that every third suspect is confirmed by laboratory testing. This proportion is probably higher than in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The 36% estimate is consistent with our own experience during the west African outbreak of Ebola virus disease: early during the epidemic in Guéckédou, Guinea, we confirmed Ebola virus disease by RT-PCR testing in 57% of 2178 patients with suspected disease and 50% of 563 individuals who died in communities; at a late stage of the epidemic in Coyah, Guinea, we confirmed 35% of 813 patients and 2% of 3823 community deaths.

 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Just these two studies underline that the performance of the case definition depends on a number of variables, including the transmission dynamics of an outbreak, the incidence of other infectious diseases with similar clinical characteristics as Ebola virus disease, such as malaria, typhoid, or arboviral infections, and its discriminative power in important subgroups, such as paediatric patients and pregnant women. The estimates of Caleo and colleagues represent an average for an Ebola virus disease outbreak in Africa and are primarily valid in this setting.
