 </xref> report on the diagnostic usefulness of the WHO case definition for Ebola virus disease. Rapid identification of individuals potentially carrying an infection is among the most important concerns in the event of a major outbreak of an infectious disease. A valid case definition is key for the outbreak response, guiding diagnostic testing of individuals, based on which adequate medical management and transmission control measures are implemented. Any case definition has to be easily applicable by health-care workers, sufficiently discriminative, and acceptable for the affected communities. It needs to strike a delicate balance between high sensitivity (not to miss individuals requiring treatment and potentially spreading the disease) and high specificity (not to overburden health-care systems and the limited laboratory capacity needed to confirm a clinical suspicion). This task is challenging given that case definitions rely solely on clinical signs and risk factors reported by individuals.
