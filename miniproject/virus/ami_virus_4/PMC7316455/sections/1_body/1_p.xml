<p id="para20">The west African Ebola virus disease epidemic and the latest outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have demonstrated the potential devastating consequences of the disease for affected societies. WHO has played a central part in responding to these epidemics and has advocated for the use of the WHO case definition for identifying patients with suspected, probable, or confirmed Ebola virus disease.

 </xref> Although Ebola virus disease is a viral haemorrhagic fever, only a small proportion of patients presents with bleeding. To emphasise this fact, WHO has included the term Ebola virus disease in the 10th edition of the International Classification of Diseases, whereas the use of the misleading term Ebola haemorrhagic fever was discouraged. Major clinical signs and symptoms of Ebola virus disease are also observed in a wide range of infectious diseases in Africa, including malaria and typhoid. Therefore, it might take weeks before an Ebola virus disease epidemic in Africa is recognised. The features that raised the alarm have rarely been symptoms, but mainly epidemiological peculiarities such as high case fatality rate, transmission of the disease to family members and caregivers, and nosocomial spread associated with death of health-care workers.

 </xref> In light of these challenges, it is important to evaluate and, if possible, improve the accuracy of the WHO case definition to detect patients with Ebola virus disease.
