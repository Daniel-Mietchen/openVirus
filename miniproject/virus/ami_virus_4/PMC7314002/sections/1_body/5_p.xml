<p>Thirdly, the efficacy of the antibody response is in question, as a recent case series demonstrated that seroconversion was not followed by an abrupt decline of the viral load in sputum, while antibody titers did not correlate with the clinical course of patients (Wölfel 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Another report also demonstrated that the increase in antibody titers was not always accompanied by clearance of viral RNA from the respiratory tract, especially in critical cases, prompting the authors to suggest that the antibody response may not be sufficient for virus clearance (Zhao 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Furthermore, antibody production appears to vary depending on individual factors, as it has been found to be significantly higher in middle-aged and elderly individuals compared to young populations and is also positively correlated with CRP levels (Wu 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). This begs the question whether all recovered patients will be able to produce an adequate antibody response.
