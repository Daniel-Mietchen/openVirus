<p>In conclusion, the development of effective herd immunity may be difficult in the case of SARS-CoV-2, since the various factors that make up herd immunity may be difficult to be achieved concomitantly in all geographical areas and locations. It will be long before the percentage of immune individuals will reach 50–66% of the population (Kwok

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>), while the duration of immunity may not be sufficiently significant, if it mirrors that of SARS-CoV (MO

 <italic>et al</italic>.

 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). Finally, the development of mutant strains to which immunity has not yet been developed can lead to the emergence of new epidemics (Biswas

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>; Wang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). As long-term natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is uncertain, herd immunity may depend on effective vaccination even more. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine is of paramount importance, not only for the control of the current outbreak, but also for the prevention of future outbreaks.
