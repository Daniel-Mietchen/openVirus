<p>Firstly, regarding the percentage of immune individuals, calculations about the current pandemic suggest that the minimum threshold capable of providing herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is at least 50–66.66% (Kwok

Even if these numbers are grossly underestimated, it will be long before an adequate percentage of the population of the world or any given region become immune to SARS-CoV-2 to a degree that can confer herd immunity to susceptible individuals.
