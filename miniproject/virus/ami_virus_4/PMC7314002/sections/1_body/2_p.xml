<p>Furthermore, the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected population differs not only between countries but also between regions of the same country. For example, in Italy, which is among the most heavily affected countries, the distribution of spread within the country varies extensively, with a notable gradient from the North to the South of Italy (La Maestra, Abbondandolo and De Flora

This implies that, even if the percentage of recovered population in some regions eventually reaches the level needed for herd immunity, the spread of the virus will not necessarily be controlled, and the epidemic may reemerge soon after restriction measures are lifted. In addition, countries which had less infections and therefore a diminished number of immune individuals, will take longer to achieve herd immunity, provided the transmission of COVID-19 chronically continues.
