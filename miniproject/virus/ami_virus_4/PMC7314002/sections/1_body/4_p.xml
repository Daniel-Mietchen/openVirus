<p>The duration of effective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 will determine at large the pandemic and post-pandemic transmission of the virus. This is more clearly demonstrated using in silico models of transmission: in the case that immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is transient, the virus will likely enter into regular circulation over the next five years with biennial or annual outbreaks; only in the case that the immunity is permanent will regular circulation of the virus be prevented. Therefore, there is an urgent need for longitudinal serological studies in order to determine the extent and duration of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 (Kissler
