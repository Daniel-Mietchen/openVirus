<p>Finally, the stability of viral epitopes is of significant concern, as the development of mutant SARS-CoV-2 strains is already being reported (Wang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">2020</xref>). The lethality of COVID-19 is such that it may permit the development of mutant strains. At the time of writing, reports demonstrate that COVID-19 appears to have an overall fatality rate that approximates that of the seasonal flu, rather than the significantly higher fatality rate of infections by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In contrast to viruses with high fatality rate, which infect the host and rapidly lead to death, infections with low fatality rates enable the host to mount an immune response, leading to selection pressure for mutant viruses. As a consequence, the increasing number of individuals recovered from COVID-19 may not be able to provide effective herd immunity during subsequent post-pandemic waves of infection by mutant variants (Biswas 
 <italic>et al</italic>.
