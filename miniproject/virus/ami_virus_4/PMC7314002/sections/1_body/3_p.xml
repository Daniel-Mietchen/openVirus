<p>Secondly, the duration of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is currently unknown. Information from follow-up studies of patients recovered from other coronaviruses may provide a background regarding the possible long-term immune response of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cohort studies of recovered SARS-CoV patients found that SARS-CoV-specific antibody titers decline over time. Mo 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that, while IgG titers were declining, they were still detectable in all 18 patients at two years, and retained their neutralizing capabilities in 17/18 patients (MO

 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) reported that antibody titers were undetectable in 21/23 patients at six years post-infection, while SARS-CoV antigen-specific memory B-cell response was undetectable in all 23 patients. However, memory T-cell responses were still detectable in 14/23 patients. Rokni, Ghasemi and Tavakoli 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">(2020</xref>) reported that T-cell responses persist for more than ten years in patients recovered from SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, even though their protective efficacy is unknown. If similar long-term immunity responses are observed in SARS-CoV-2, it is possible that, while IgG titers and memory B-cells may decline, memory T-cells may remain; however, it is uncertain whether they will be able to mount an adequate immune response.
