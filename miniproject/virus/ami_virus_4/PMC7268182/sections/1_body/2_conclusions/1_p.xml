<p id="Par24">Patients with COVID-19 commonly have neurologic manifestations. The data/literature on this continues to evolve. On one hand, there are very commonly reported neurologic diagnoses of anosmia, encephalopathy, and stroke, and at the same time, there have been only a few isolated case reports of acute necrotizing encephalopathy and AIDP. We have to keep in mind that the current information that we have about the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 is in the context of purposefully avoiding advanced neurodiagnostic procedures like magnetic resonance imaging, lumbar puncture, electromyography, and nerve conduction studies to reduce the risk of cross-infection within the hospital. A prospective, observational study with a larger number of patients that includes more specific neuro-imaging and other diagnostic tests is warranted for more conclusive evidence.</p>
