<p id="Par6">Coronaviruses cause multiple systemic infections affecting various organ systems, but primarily affect the respiratory system. They tend to mutate and adapt quickly to cross the species barrier, which occurred with SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing epidemics and pandemics. Infection with these viruses in humans often leads to severe clinical symptoms with high mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. All three of these novel viruses (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, and MERS-CoV) originate from zoonotic transmission. These are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA corona viruses in the betacoronoviride family. Studies had demonstrated that the clinical course of SARS and MERS was highly similar and SARS and MERS may have similar pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 also shows some similarities to that of MERS-CoV. The postulated common pathophysiologic mechanisms include dysregulation of cytokines/chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, and autoimmunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. MERS-CoV infects cells by binding to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor, and SARS-CoV acts via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor [
