<p id="Par14">Poyiadji et al. reported the first presumptive case of COVID-19-associated acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy is a rare encephalopathy and one of the remote complications of influenza and other viral infections. This has been presumed to be due to intracranial cytokine storm, which results in the bloodâ€“brain barrier breakdown, without direct viral invasion or para-infectious demyelination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Accumulating evidence suggests that a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].
