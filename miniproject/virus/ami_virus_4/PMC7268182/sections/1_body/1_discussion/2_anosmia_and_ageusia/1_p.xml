<p id="Par9">Losses of smell and taste have been strongly linked to COVID-19 infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. So far, there have been numerous publications about the association of loss of smell and taste with COVID-19 infection. Post-viral anosmia is one of the leading causes of loss of sense of smell in adults. This post-viral loss of smell is thought to be secondary to initial congestion of the nose, which leads to loss of fine hair like endings of the olfactory receptor cells causing them to be ineffective in picking up odor molecules from the nose. SARS-CoV-2 also appears to be highly concentrated in the nostrils of affected patients causing inflammation of the olfactory nerves and structural damage to the receptors and thereby causing anosmia [
