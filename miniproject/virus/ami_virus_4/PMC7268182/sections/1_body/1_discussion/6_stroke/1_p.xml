<p id="Par16">Patients with severe infection were more likely to develop neurologic manifestations, especially acute cerebrovascular disease. Patients with severe infection had higher D-dimer levels than that of patients with the non-severe infection, which may be the reason why patients with severe infection are more likely to develop the cerebrovascular disease. Apart from the elevated d-dimer causing a state of altered coagulation cascade, there is also a theory that there is a vasculitis type of picture created secondary to intracranial cytokine storm versus the infection by the virus itself which are believed to be the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms behind stroke/cerebrovascular accident [

Also, the virus can get into brain tissue from capillary endothelium by brain–blood barrier disruption and cause neuronal damage without much inflammation (Fig.
