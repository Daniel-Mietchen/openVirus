<p id="Par11">Researchers have reported that many human cell types express ACE2, including lung, heart, kidney, intestine, and brain tissue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There are at least a couple of ways that the virus could invade the central nervous system—it might circulate through the blood and then attack ACE2 receptors in the endothelia that line blood capillaries in the brain, breaching the blood–brain barrier and invading neurons through that route (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A breached blood–brain barrier could also cause brain swelling, compressing the brain stem there by affecting respiration. Apart from these two mechanisms, it has also been demonstrated that some coronaviruses can spread by synaptic transfer from chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors in lung to the medullary cardiorespiratory center [
