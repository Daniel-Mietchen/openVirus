<p id="Par10">There have been a fair number of reports suggesting SARS-CoV-2 infecting the neurons, raising questions about the direct effects of the virus on the brain that play a role in patients’ deaths. Some of the respiratory symptoms due to the disease might actually be secondary to respiratory center involvement controlled by the nervous system. According to Yan-Chao Li, et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], SARS-CoV-2 infects nerve cells, particularly the neurons in the medulla oblongata, which serves as the control center for the heart and the lungs. The damage to this area could contribute to the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19. Autopsy results of patients with COVID-19 showed that the brain tissue near brainstem was hyperemic and edematous with neuronal degeneration [

By contrast, there have been a few case reports which mention no penetrance of virus into the central nervous system as evidenced by the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF and that the CNS effects are secondary to elevated inflammatory markers as CSF analyses during the acute stage showed pleocytosis with increased IL-8 and TNF-α concentrations [
