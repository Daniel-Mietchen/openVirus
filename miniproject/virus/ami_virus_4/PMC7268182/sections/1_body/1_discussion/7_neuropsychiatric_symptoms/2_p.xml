<p id="Par18">These neuropsychiatric manifestations have been attributed to viral infection per se and also secondary to the host immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Direct viral infiltration of the central nervous system can trigger a neuro-inflammatory reaction leading to microglial activation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], which in turn triggering demyelinating processes is one of the primary etiologies for encephalopathy. In the absence of direct viral infiltration, peripheral hypercytokinaemia causing an imbalance of neurotransmitters within the central nervous system has been implicated in neuropsychiatric manifestations. The state of hypercytokinaemia triggers a neuro-inflammatory response causing disruption of the bloodâ€“brain barrier, leading to peripheral immune cell transmigration into the central nervous system and, in turn, causing imbalances in neurotransmission [
