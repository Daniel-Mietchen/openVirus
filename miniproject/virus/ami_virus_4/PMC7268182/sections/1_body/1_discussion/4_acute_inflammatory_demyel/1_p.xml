Reportedly, the patient initially presented with signs of the autoimmune neuropathy after returning from Wuhan, China and later tested positive for the COVID-19. Considering the temporal association, it was speculated that SARS-CoV-2 infection might have been responsible for the development of AIDP. Following this, a case series from Italy, published by Toscano et al., reported five cases of AIDP that started after the onset of COVID-19 disease [
