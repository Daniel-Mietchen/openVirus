<p>We conducted a search of the PubMed/MEDLINE databases for articles relevant to topical agents with virucidal activity against coronaviruses. Search terms included are alcohol, peridex, iodine, chlorhexidine, topical, mouthwash, virus, coronavirus, and COVID‚Äê19. To focus the search, we concentrated on articles that focused either on in vitro studies or studies examining their utilization on mucosal surfaces. We supplemented the searches by reviewing references from each relevant manuscript. The selection of data was determined subjectively to be synthesized into this review. Institutional review board approval was not required for this study.</p>
