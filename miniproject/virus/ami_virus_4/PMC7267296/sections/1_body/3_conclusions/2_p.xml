<p>Though no topical therapies have been studied to specifically reduce the viral load and potential aerosolization of SARS‐CoV‐2 during upper airway mucosal surgery, PVP‐I solutions have demonstrated effective virucidal activity against related coronaviruses in numerous studies. They are relatively safe to use in the upper airway, require very brief application times, and may potentially reduce the risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 aerosolization and transmission during upper airway mucosal surgery.</p>
