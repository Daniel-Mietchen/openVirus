<p>We do, however, still have an obligation to perform urgent and emergent cases for life‐threatening situations or diseases, such as cancer, where failure to act will lead to high morbidity. Indeed, it is known that patients with cancer are susceptible to infection. Early data from China have shown that among patients with COVID‐19, there is an approximately 3‐fold higher proportion of patients with cancer than the incidence of cancer in the general population.

In this review, we aimed to review the literature discussing topical agents that are safe to use as oral rinses and that may have virucidal activity against SARS‐CoV‐2.
