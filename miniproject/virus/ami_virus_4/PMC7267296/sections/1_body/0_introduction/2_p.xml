<p>As the COVID‐19 pandemic caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) continues to escalate globally, we are faced with developing methods to provide care to our patients while also keeping them our coworkers and ourselves safe. Health care workers are at increased risk of exposure to the virus, and there is mounting evidence that otolaryngologists are among the highest at risk. This is likely due to a high viral load of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the upper aerodigestive tract and because of the direct contact that practitioners have with the mucosa during both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.
