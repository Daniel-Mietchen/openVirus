<p>From a safety perspective, it has been tolerated for use in the upper airway as has been demonstrated in numerous human studies. In the oral cavity and oropharynx it has been used safely at a range of doses from 1% to 10% for oropharyngeal infection prophylaxis, mucositis, and prevention of ventilator‐associated pneumonia.

 </xref> Other studies have examined the effect of PVP‐I in varying concentrations from 0.5% to 5% on the sinonasal mucosa without detrimental effect to the nasal epithelium; however, one recent in vitro study found that iodine preparations of 5% to 10% demonstrated ciliotoxicity.
