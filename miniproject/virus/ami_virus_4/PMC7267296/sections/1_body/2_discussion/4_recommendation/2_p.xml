<p>On the basis of this review, the authors believe that the topical application of PVP‐I is safe and may help to reduce the viral load, and the potential aerosolization, of SARS‐CoV‐2. Until confirmatory studies are conducted, our institutional consensus is to dilute commonly available PVP‐I (typically 7.5%) 1:3 with saline to achieve a less than 2% concentration and bulb syringe the solution into the oral/nasal cavity, after intubation, but immediately prior to head and neck procedures that require instrumentation of the upper airway mucosa during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We suggest leaving the solution in for approximately 1 minute before irrigating with saline and suctioning it out to reduce residual absorption and limit tissue staining – though the optimal concentration and application time, if any, are currently unknown. This procedure is applied to both COVID‐19‐positive adult patients and to patients with unknown status unless they have a contraindication to topical iodine (allergy/anaphylaxis, labile thyroid disease, contact dermatitis, pregnancy/nursing, active radioiodine therapy). This concentration is over 8 times the lowest PVP‐I concentration found to be effective in vitro to eliminate related coronaviruses but still likely a safe concentration for one‐time use based upon past studies described. Due to a paucity of supporting literature, no recommendation can be made for the use of chlorhexidine‐based rinses.</p>
