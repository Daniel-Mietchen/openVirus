<p>Many of the mammal‐ and avian‐associated coronaviruses are well known to cause gastroenteritis in their host species.

 </xref> The long list includes agricultural and domestic examples such as poultry, swine, bovine, equine, canine, and feline hosts. Other examples of affected animals include rabbits, mink, ferrets, and dromedaries. Despite the latter, there is little evidence to support cross‐over of these infections to humans with some exception. For example, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a coronavirus of poultry that causes a respiratory disease typically in its natural host. Given human contact in commercial production facilities, serological studies were conducted to determine if exposure and hence IBV infection in humans could occur.

 </xref> Reactive sera were only found among those individuals who closely worked with poultry, albeit in low titers, but there were no purported human illnesses attributed including gastrointestinal. Furthermore, there is no good evidence at this time to prove that other animal enteric coronaviruses cause human disease. The latter is rather remarkable given the potential human contact with such viruses in animal husbandry in the least.
