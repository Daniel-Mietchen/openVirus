<p>For purposes of hospital infection control and general prevention elsewhere, the above findings suggest that some patients remain infectious by at least that route for a longer period of time than is commonly thought. In experimental settings, SARS‐CoV can survive in stool samples for 3 hours to 4 days, and the viability is greater when the sample has an alkaline pH.

 </xref> In contrast, virus can remain viable for up to 1 week at room temperature in respiratory secretions and up to 4 weeks when refrigerated.

 </xref> These findings are relevant to one outbreak in which it was believed that a sewer back‐up facilitated some spread.

 </xref> Although reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction positive, culture‐negative sewage was found in such a context, the inoculation of sewage with live virus showed that viability could be found for 2 days when stored at room temperature but up to 14 days when refrigerated.

 </xref> All such assessments must be viewed with caution since even spiked samples of stool, urine, blood, and respiratory secretions may not yield fully positive amplification tests.
