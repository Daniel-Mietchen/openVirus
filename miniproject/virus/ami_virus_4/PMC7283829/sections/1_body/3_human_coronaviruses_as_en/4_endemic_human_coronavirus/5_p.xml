<p>The diversity of the endemic coronavirus group so understood at this time also raises the question as to whether any specific one may be more pathogenic than another, and whether any one may be more likely to cause gastrointestinal symptoms. For OC43, several studies had found enteric coronaviruses with some antigenic relationship.
