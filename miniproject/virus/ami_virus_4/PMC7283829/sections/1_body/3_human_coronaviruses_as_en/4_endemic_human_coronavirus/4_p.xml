<p>Nevertheless, there are mitigating findings from others which would be taken together to counter the above data and that might lead one to conclude that these endemic coronaviruses are not veritable enteric pathogens.

 </xref> In some studies, the detection of coronavirus in stools was commonly associated with the finding of another but commonly recognized viral enteric pathogen.

 </xref> The latter seriously raises the issue of the validity of the assays and of the need to have some form of confirmatory test. The latter would be applicable to the detection of coronaviruses let alone any other pathogen purely detected by real‐time amplification processes.
