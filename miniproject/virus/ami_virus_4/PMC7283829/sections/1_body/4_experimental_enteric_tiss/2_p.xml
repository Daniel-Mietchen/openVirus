<p>The historic problem with finding endemic human coronaviruses from clinical specimens in the laboratory was the purported inability to detect the virus in tissue culture. We now recognize that only particular cell lines are permissive to infection and furthermore that only particular cell lines yield a visible cytopathic effect in tissue culture. In permissive cell lines that do not show cytopathic effects, viable virus growth can be demonstrated by passage, molecular techniques, and histopathology. Both SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV can replicate in a variety of cell lines including many that are not of gastrointestinal origin.
