<p>As for other human coronaviruses, SARS‐CoV‐2 can be found in both respiratory and stool (and urine and blood) patient samples.

 </xref> Thus, the potential patient sample source for transmission is likely to be more than simply respiratory. The enteric reservoir is further supported by symptoms of enteritis or abdominal complaint in some patients.

 </xref> Thus far, however, the majority of reports have depended on nucleic acid amplification techniques to define virus presence, and yet it is abundantly clear from past observations for coronaviruses, and other viruses generally, that viral genome presence does not equate consistently with live and hence infectious virus. The above is further complicated by several reservations in the use and verity of nonculture test methods and by variations in the quality of the clinical samples that are acquired.
