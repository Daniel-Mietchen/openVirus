<p>Emerging data for COVID‐19 have already corroborated or added to this concept sufficiently to cause some concern.

 </xref> The “incubation period” is typically less than 1 week, but any such calculation is bound by a confidence interval of earlier or later presentation. Lauer et al
 <xref rid="jmv26066-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">

 </xref> have estimated that the late 97.5% confidence outlier can be as long as 15 to 16 days. Extending their calculation to a higher percentile of confidence leads to an estimate that nearly one in 100 patients will have an incubation longer than 14 days. The actual practice seems to corroborate the latter. Wang et al

 </xref> using data from travelers abroad that have returned from China, found a 97.5% confidence interval extending to 11.1 days, but a 99% confidence extending to possibly 17 to 32 days depending on the method of evaluation. The latter is also consistent with the transmission dynamics shown by Li et al.

 </xref> Qiu et al
 <xref rid="jmv26066-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">
  <sup>17</sup>
 </xref> projected an incubation period of up to 32 days. Thus, while the majority of patients become ill in less than 2 weeks, outliers to this belief will inevitably occur when the population being affected is quite large as is occurring worldwide in several countries. These outliers therefore have the potential to promote viral transmission when it may not seem likely. A role for both respiratory and enteric reservoirs in this transmission could have relevance for prevention and control.
