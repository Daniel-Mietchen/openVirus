<p>Typically, the “incubation period” is used to refer to the time from contact to the time of first clinical illness manifestation. As for SARS and MERS, and now documented for patients with COVID‐19, some patients have been shown to harbor the virus in a relatively asymptomatic state.

 </xref> report that many of their patients were relatively asymptomatic. In the asymptomatic state, therefore, the typical application of “incubation period” takes on another dimension, that is, a time from exposure to the time of first positive diagnostic sample in the asymptomatic state. The latter will again have the potential to complicate control measures. These concerns may very well explain why some have proposed that SARS‐CoV‐2 could be transmitted during the incubation period in a presymptomatic state.
