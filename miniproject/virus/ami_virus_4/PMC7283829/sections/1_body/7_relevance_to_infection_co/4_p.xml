<p>Whereas infection control practices are groomed for many circumstances on the basis of likelihoods or risk management, we are finding that the presence of, persistence of, and resilience of the human coronaviruses is somewhat beyond initial and some past expectations. Accordingly, we may need to rethink detection and protection timings for the purposes of infection control especially in circumstances where spread is lesser tolerated.

 </xref> There is no doubt that the currently and commonly implemented infection control practices make a significant impact on the spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. The implementation of infection control measures both for basic and respiratory techniques will have an impact to control COVID‐2. Beyond such mitigation, there remains some skepticism about the immediacy and extent of full suppression of virus spread both in the community and health care facilities. To improve on the latter, the role of enteric disease in the overall aspects of an effective infection control program, as well as other new considerations, should be taken into context for possible revisions to culture timing, samples taken, incubation period, length of illness, quarantine, and definitions of infected patients. In this regard, it would be prudent to garner more data.

 </xref> The lessons from the history of human coronavirus infection otherwise should continue to be compared with COVID‐19 infection as the pandemic continues to unfold.
