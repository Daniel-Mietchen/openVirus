<p>All human coronaviruses can be found in stool samples, but the role of the endemic coronaviruses in diarrheal disease, while suggestive, requires further corroboration. Nevertheless, all human coronaviruses have been variably associated with symptoms of gastroenteritis. Coronaviruses can be cultured from enteric specimens, but most detection is accomplished with genetic amplification technologies. Excretion of viral RNA in stool can extend for a prolonged period.

 </xref> Culture‐positive stool samples have been found to exceed a 14 day period after onset of infection. Virus can also be cultured from patients during the late incubation period. Relatively asymptomatic patients may excrete virus. Both viable and nonviable virus can be found in the immediate environment of the patient, the health care worker, and less often the public. As we are finding now early with COVID‐19 infections, many of these past realizations are repeating themselves (Table
