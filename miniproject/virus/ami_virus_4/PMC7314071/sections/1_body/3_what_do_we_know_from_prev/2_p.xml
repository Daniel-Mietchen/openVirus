<p>SARS-CoV might manifest as hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.
 <sup>19,20</sup> Data obtained in a rabbit model suggest that coronavirus can induce cardiomyopathy, resulting in dilated cardiac chambers and systolic impairment.
 <sup>21</sup> Reversible cardiomegaly with no clinical evidence of heart failure was also reported in a small group of humans.
 <sup>22</sup> Some of the clinical manifestations, such as sinus tachycardia
 <sup>22</sup> or persistent abnormalities of lipid (68%) and glucose metabolism (60%), as well as cardiovascular abnormalities (40%) at 12-year follow-up, appear to persist beyond the acute phase of infection.
