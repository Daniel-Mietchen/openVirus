<p>In the reports of severe COVID-19 cases, data on cardiac examinations are often missing. However, a report by Inciardi 
 <italic>et al.</italic>,
 <sup>12</sup> describing the case of an otherwise healthy 53-year-old white woman with cardiac involvement, lists numerous diagnostic anomalies. Remarkably, cardiac pathology developed 1 week after recovering from influenza-like symptoms. Moreover, there are reported cases of sudden cardiac death in non-hospitalized COVID-19-positive individuals with only mild symptoms.
