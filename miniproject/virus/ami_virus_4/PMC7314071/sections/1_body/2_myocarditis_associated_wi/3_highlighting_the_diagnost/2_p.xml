<p>In summary there is currently insufficient data available to describe the presentation of clinically mild COVID-associated myocarditis or even to predict its long-term outcome. With regard to consultations with non-specific symptoms in sports medicine outpatient clinics, the differential diagnosis of a past COVID-19 infection and/or a COVID-19-associated myocarditis should be taken into consideration, perhaps even retrospectively, where appropriate. The COVID-19 outbreak and its cardiovascular involvement support the need for further research to fill the currently large gaps of knowledge, particularly with regard to immediate and long-term cardiovascular implications of viral infections in athletes.</p>
