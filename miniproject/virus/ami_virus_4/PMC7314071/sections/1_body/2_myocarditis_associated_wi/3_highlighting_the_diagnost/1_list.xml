  <p>COVID-19-associated cardiac injury and its long-term consequences in athletes could be significantly underestimated if the assessment of cardiac injury is defined merely by the presence of elevated troponins.

  <p>The assessment of suspected myocarditis in athletes, especially those with mild or no symptoms, can be difficult. Even in cases of a variety of abnormal diagnostic results, myocarditis cannot always be diagnosed with certainty. For example, alterations in the ECG can also be explained by long-term training adaptation.
   <sup>16</sup> Similarly, elevated cardiac biomarkers such as troponin or creatine kinase may also be explained by acute exercise.

  <p>Typical presentation of athletes with suspected myocarditis in the outpatient setting differs from that commonly observed in a hospital setting, specifically regarding the significantly greater frequency of milder disease severity. Athletes are usually highly sensitive to subtle changes in their physical condition or performance. This includes symptoms such as prolonged time to recover, fatigue, or peripheral muscle soreness. The symptoms of COVID-19 are often non-specific, too.

  <p>The difficulty in interpretation of such non-specific symptoms in combination with an unclear diagnosis results from the variety of possible differential diagnoses such as mild myocarditis, COVID-19 without cardiac involvement, or sport-associated symptoms such as fatigue and muscle pain.</p>
