<p>The cardiovascular effects and long-term consequences of COVID-19 are currently unclear. The question of eligibility for sport and the point of return to sport following both asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 with or without suspected involvement of the myocardium is currently becoming more and more important in leisure as well as in competitive sports. Fortunately, from previous studies and registries of acute myocarditis, it has been known that athletes with a complete recovery have a very good prognosis. Nevertheless, to optimize counselling and treatment of athletes in the future, prospective data collection on the current corona pandemic is urgently needed. To this end, the non-evidence-based recommendations for a return to sports presented herein might serve as a first guideline.</p>
