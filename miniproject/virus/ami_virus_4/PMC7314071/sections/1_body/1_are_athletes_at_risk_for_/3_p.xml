<p>Keep in mind that myocarditis is one of the leading causes of sport-associated sudden cardiac death in the group of athletes under 35 years of age.
 <sup>11</sup> The clinical presentation of myocarditis in general shows a wide and heterogenic spectrum of symptoms. Athletes frequently present with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, reduced performance, muscle soreness, or increased resting heart rate, which can often be misinterpreted in the context of other differential diagnoses (e.g. training-related exhaustion/overtraining, depression, or psychosomatic disorders). Thus, athletes are often not subjected to a COVID-19 test (e.g. nasopharyngeal swab), so that the diagnosis of a COVID-19 infection and a potential COVID-19-associated myocardial involvement or myocarditis cannot be made. In this case, further diagnostic or therapeutic measures can be delayed or even completely neglected.
