<p>Current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has grown into a pandemic crisis of major health and economic importance. An infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is known to cause severe respiratory symptoms up to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but also often involves the cardiovascular system,
 <sup>1,2</sup> which is associated with increased mortality.
 <sup>3</sup> The highest mortality rates were observed in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease and co-existing elevated cardiac troponin levels.
 <sup>4</sup> In particular, elevated serum levels of cardiac troponin and inflammatory biomarkers (i.e. interleukin-6 and serum ferritin) were characteristic for cases with severe illness and non-survivors.
 <sup>4â€“8</sup> This high inflammatory burden in COVID-19, described as a hyperinflammatory response, is considered to be co-responsible for development of ARDS, vascular inflammation, myocarditis, and myocarditis-related cardiac events, e.g. arrhythmias.
 <sup>6,7</sup> However, many individuals have only mild or no symptoms despite being infected.
