<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) officially reported on the first cluster of cases in China on 31 December 2019, although in reality cases had presented in Wuhan in November. The initial epicentre in Europe was Northern Italy which reported its first case on 20 February and the virus subsequently spread rapidly across the continent, with the first case reported in the UK on 28 February. This provides a narrow window of opportunity for countries at earlier stages of the pandemic to learn from countries ahead of the curve. It is in this context that we recommend a review by Fang and colleagues from Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China on their experiences in containing the pandemic. Shenzhen is a city of 12.5 million souls and reported its first case of COVID-19 on 16 January in a visitor from Wuhan. With the implementation of specific measures within the city, their last case of an infected individual was found on 20 February. Based on the lessons learned in the SARS epidemic in 2003, they outline the specific measures that allowed them locally control this highly infective virus in their city within 35â€‰days.</p>
