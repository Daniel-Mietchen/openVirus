<p>On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organizaton (WHO) declared the coronavirus disease COVID-19 outbreak to have evolved to a pandemic, once more emphasizing the need for preventive and curative treatments. In this COVID-19 pandemic, time pressure is extreme, and the race to find a cure and effective prevention is on. Science must be swift, and conclusions must be drawn from the limited knowledge at hand, acting on everything that has been learned from previous outbreaks that may bear similar characteristics.

  <p>Translational perspective</p>
  <p>We hypothesize that the immune system facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell, while the virus is bound to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This causes extracellular ACE2 deficiency, which disrupts immune regulatory mechanisms. Since angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) appears to facilitate entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell and also aggravates the disrupting mechanism of angiotensin II (AngII), AT1R antagonists seem to be the ideal candidate for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. AT1R antagonists counterbalance the negative consequences of AngII and may prevent cellular uptake of the virus without interfering with ACE2 function. AT1R antagonists are widely available, cheap, and safe. Therefore, we propose to consider using AT1R antagonists in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
 </boxed-text>Human coronaviruses cause âˆ¼30% of upper respiratory tract infections but are rarely lethal. Occasionally, however, some strains emerge that are life-threatening, having caused past epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), as well as the current emerging SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Because SARS-CoV-2 enters the cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), targeting ACE2 to prevent such binding seems an obvious strategy to combat infection. However, ACE2 performs its functions outside the cell and was found to enter the cell only via angiotensin II (AngII) type 1 receptor (AT1R)-induced endocytosis, after which ACE2 is destroyed. Since ACE2 plays an important role in maintaining key biological processes, the deficiency of this enzyme may have severe consequences.
