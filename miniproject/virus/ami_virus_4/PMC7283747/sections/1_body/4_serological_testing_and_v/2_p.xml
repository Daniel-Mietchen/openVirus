<p>The identification of viral epitopes that stimulate the production of antibodies that serve as markers of an immune response to CoV‐2 infection are necessary for the development of serologic testing and vaccines. Currently numerous serologic tests using antibodies against specified antigens are commercially available, but most have not been adequately validated. At best, tests reflect an immune response without necessarily indicating host immunity.

 </xref> The availability of conserved epitopes also allows the structure‐based design of a SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine. However, not all antibodies prevent viral infection, despite targeting virus specific epitopes. For example, antibodies raised against SARS CoV‐1 cross‐react with the CoV‐2 viral epitopes, but do not prevent CoV‐2 binding to ACE‐1 receptors; these antibodies may provide some clinical protection or attenuate the disease without actually preventing infection.

 </xref>. A cocktail of viral epitopes to stimulate a robust neutralizing immunologic response has been recommended to address this phenomenon.
