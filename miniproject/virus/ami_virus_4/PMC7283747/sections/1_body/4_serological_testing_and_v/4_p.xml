<p>Nevertheless, potential impediments to vaccine development, noted during the SARS, remain potentially problematic. For example, concerns about vaccine‐mediated immune enhancement were raised during the vaccine development for SARS. Anecdotal reports of individuals developing more severe disease after exposure in individuals vaccinated against SARS CoV‐1 raised concerns about vaccine safety and efficacy.

 </xref> Animal models demonstrated an analogous effect. Prior immunization with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐associated coronavirus (SARS‐Cove) nucleocapsid protein caused severe pneumonia in mice infected with SARS‐CoV.

 </xref> Demonstrations of safety and efficacy of vaccines against CoV‐2 are crucial, but take time. In the meantime, other forms of prevention (social distancing, protective device use) will limit transmission rates, and ultimately morbidity and mortality.
