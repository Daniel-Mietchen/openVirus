<p>Because of the genome's homology with the coronavirus that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS‐CoV‐1) in China in 2002 to 2003, this virus was renamed SARS‐CoV‐2. Coronaviruses are known to be the causative agent for the “common cold,” accounting for up to 30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults. Coronaviruses, like other RNA viruses, mutate frequently and evolve in vast animal reservoirs. The overwhelming majority of coronaviruses pose no threat to humans, but recombination events, natural selection and genetic drift permit particularly virulent coronaviruses to jump to human hosts and to subsequently acquire the capacity for efficient person to person spread.
