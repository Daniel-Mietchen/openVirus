<p>SARS CoV‐2, the virus which causes COVID19, is similar to, but not identical with the SARS‐CoV‐1 virus, which caused the SARS epidemic originating in China in 2002 to 2003. Full‐length genome sequences obtained from infected Chinese patients in 2019 showed 79.6% sequence homology to SARS‐CoV‐1.

 </xref> SARS‐CoV‐2 is more closely related to two bat‐derived severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)‐like coronaviruses, bat‐SL‐CoVZC45 and bat‐SL‐CoVZXC21, collected in 2018 in Zhoushan, eastern China(with 88% identity), and a strain isolated from pangolins (99% identity) than to SARS‐CoV‐1, suggesting SARS‐CoV‐2 should be considered a new human‐infecting coronavirus, rather than re‐emergence of SARS‐CoV‐1.

 </xref> Transmission is believed to have occurred from a bat‐CoV to an intermediate host after which the virus jumped to human hosts at live animal markets.
