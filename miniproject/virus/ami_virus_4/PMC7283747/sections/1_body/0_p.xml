<p>In early December 2019, Li Wenliang, a physician from Wuhan, a large metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, reported in a group chat that he noticed a series of patients showing signs of a severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS‐like illness which was subsequently reported to the WHO Country Office in China on December 31, 2019. On January 12, Chinese scientists published the genome of the virus, and the World Health Organization (WHO) asked a team in Berlin to use that information to develop a diagnostic test to identify active infection, which was developed and shared 4 days later. On January 30, 2020, the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The first case of the disease due to local person to person spread in the United States was confirmed in mid‐February 2020. On March 11, WHO declared COVID‐19 a pandemic.</p>
