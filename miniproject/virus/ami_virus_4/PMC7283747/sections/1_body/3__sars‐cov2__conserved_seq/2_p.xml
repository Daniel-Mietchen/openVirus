<p>While the viral genome continues to evolve since entering the human population, sequences critical to human transmission will likely remain preserved. All coronaviruses exhibit a spike on its surface, which gives it the appearance of a crown (ie, Corona in Latin) on electron micrographs, mediates binding to host cell receptors, determines viral host range and tissue tropism, and induces host immune response. SARS‐CoV2, like SARS‐CoV‐1, gain entry into human cells via the angiotensin 1 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, expressed on human lung and other tissues.

 </xref> This receptor mediates the effects of angiotensin, which affects vasoconstriction and hypertension in the lungs, heart, kidneys and intestines. An identical ACE receptor is also found in some animals; this permit cross‐species infection.
