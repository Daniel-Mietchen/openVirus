<p>The spike or S protein, expressed on the surface of coronaviruses plays an important role in the first step of viral infection by binding to the host ACE‐2 receptor, and initiating virus‐host membrane fusion. The amino acid sequences of the protein, particularly its receptor‐binding domains (RBDs) are highly conserved, since they are necessary to propagate the infection in person to person spread. The amino acid sequence of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike (S) protein, particularly its RBD, serves as an antigen for the immune system, which could be used in the development of serologic tests and vaccines. So‐called “escape mutants,” viruses with amino acid alterations just flanking but not disrupting the RBD could potentially compromise durable immunity and the effectiveness of vaccines against SARS‐CoVs.

 </xref> The clinical significance of escape mutations in coronaviruses is uncertain. In general, immune responses to coronavirus infections confer prolonged immunity. Neutralizing antibodies to SARS CoV‐1, that prevent viral infection by preventing binding of the S protein to the host cell receptor, have been detected in patients with SARS almost 20 years after recovering from disease suggesting that patients retain protection over long periods after mounting an immune response.
