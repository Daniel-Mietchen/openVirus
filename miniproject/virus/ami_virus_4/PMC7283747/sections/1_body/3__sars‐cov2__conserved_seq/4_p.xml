<p>While the genetic sequences critical to transmission are preserved, noncritical viral sequences have undergone genetic drift. Compared to CoV‐2 sequences isolated in January in China, strains from other parts of the world exhibited genetic sequences which distinguish European from Asian SARS CoV‐2 coronavirus strains.

 </xref> Differences between viral strains has permitted evaluations of the effectiveness of public health interventions. For example, analyses of different strains showed that predominance of COVID‐19 cases in the New York City area resulted largely from infected patients who flew in from Europe, rather than Asia. Consequently, barring US entry to recent visitors to China on January 31st, and from European countries on March 11th was largely ineffective in preventing the COVID outbreak in the United States.
