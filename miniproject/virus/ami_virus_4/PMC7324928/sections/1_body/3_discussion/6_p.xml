 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since then the number of cases drastically decreased, but the surveillance was effective only until 2014. The Maldives is a large archipelago of 1,190 islands, spread out over an area of 298 square kilometers with an estimated population around 530,000 inhabitants, making long-term implementation of individual and collective vector-control strategies, and epidemiologic surveillance challenging. The situation on the Maldives might be viewed best from the ‘one-health perspective’ proposed in 2018 by Carla Mavian and colleagues [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Their size and the lack of resources induce more trade, facilitating the importation of vectors and introduction and establishment of viruses [

Moreover, the unstable geological structure exposes the island chains to natural storms, hurricanes and cyclones, which can result in mass destruction and an abundant vegetation, which complicates vector-control strategies. Certain ecosystems could be more subject to large and recurrent arboviral outbreaks, as seen with dengue in the Fiji Islands [
