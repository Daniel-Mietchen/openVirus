<p id="p0085">Unusually strong rainfall in the second half of 2006 in the Maldives probably led to suitable conditions for expansion of mosquito populations and different CHIKV strains could have been introduced from neighboring areas enduring epidemics at that time. Curiously, in 2007, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was identified as the predominant vector of CHIKV in Mal√©, whereas 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was identified as the main vector found on other islands. Importantly, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was the main vector for the new variant from the East/Central and South African (ECSA) CHIKV lineage which emerged in the Indian Ocean in 2006. A study analyzing the evolutionary relationships of CHIKV in South and Southeast Asian regions after 2005 found that the Sri Lankan and Singapore CHIKV strains, including one strain imported from the Maldives in 2006, were evolutionarily more closely related to the Indian isolates of the ECSA lineage than to the Indian Ocean Islands (IOL)-ESCA strains [
