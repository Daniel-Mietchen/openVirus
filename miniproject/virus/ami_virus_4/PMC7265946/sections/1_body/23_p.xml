<p>A: There are plenty of indication that we are at the beginning of the pandemic. Many countries have yet to see widespread community transmission, for example, but I think that this is coming. It is a particular concern in populations living in crowded conditions, whether in informal urban developments or in refugee camps. It is going to be very difficult to implement social distancing in any meaningful way in those settings and as a result people living there are going to be more exposed to infection. Some of those people may also be malnourished or have other risk factors. So, I think that just as in the H1N1 epidemic, the poorest are going to be hit hardest.</p>
