<p>A: Perhaps. With regard to the broad cost-benefit calculation, people have been conditioned by prior emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Not that the cost of those outbreaks was negligible. The cost to the global economy of the SARS outbreak has been estimated to have been around US$ 40 billion, for example. However, that will pale in comparison to the economic cost of the COVID-19 pandemic. UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) estimated a loss of US$1 trillion to the global economy in 2020 alone. That level of economic loss may change attitudes. So, certainly investment in vaccines should be prioritised. I think we have to think of pandemic preparedness as part of our national security policy â€“ because that is what is now being threatened by this disease.</p>
