<p>A: I read a book called 
 <italic>Level 4: virus hunters</italic> of the CDC just after college. That book had a huge impact on me. I went to medical school wanting to develop a 360Â° view of the different challenges pandemics present and to develop the skills needed to respond to them. I ended up specializing in infectious diseases as well as emergency medicine and critical care.
