<p>A: There is plenty of evidence that preventing contact between people reduces infection rates. However, keeping people from working entails social and economic costs that can negatively affect population health. Economic shutdowns and the rising unemployment and shortages they entail have been predicted in numerous tabletop exercises. Those exercises have also predicted knock-on health effects of such measures, including increases in deaths from cancer, cardiovascular disease, stroke, mental illness and substance abuse â€“ the combined burden of which may be greater than the morbidity and mortality associated with the virus itself. Right now, one of the things that keeps me up at night is the tipping point at which the benefits of social distancing are outweighed by the costs. I believe that, on balance, it is probably a mistake to shut people away long term. However, it is clear that vulnerable populations, such as older people living in nursing homes should be shielded from everyday life to minimize their chances of infection.</p>
