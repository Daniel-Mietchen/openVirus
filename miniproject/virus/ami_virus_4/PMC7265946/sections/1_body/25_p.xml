<p>A: I don’t think we have enough granularity to know what the numbers will be, but H1N1 infected about 20% of the world’s population within a year and that had population immunity pushing back. We don’t have population immunity to SARS-CoV-2 so we can assume that without effective confinement, between 30 to 50% of the global population will get this over the next year or so. It’s important to remember that most of the COVID-19 cases are going to be mild. I still don’t think we have a good grasp of the case fatality ratio so will hold off on projecting deaths. Also, we need to remember that there may be breakthroughs in terms of antiviral medicines and eventually a vaccine.</p>
