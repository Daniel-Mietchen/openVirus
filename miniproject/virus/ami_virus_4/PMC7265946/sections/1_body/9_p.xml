<p>A: In the initial stages, I think people were looking at SARS-CoV-2 as something that could be containable and would not have efficient human-to-human transmission, based on observations of the way coronaviruses tend to behave. The four common human coronaviruses display good transmissibility but do not cause serious illness in most patients, while the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, can cause serious illness and have case fatality rates of around 15% and 30% respectively, but they are not very transmissible. Because SARS-CoV-2 looked similar to MERS in some respects, policymakers may have felt SARS-CoV-2 was containable in China. They were wrong. What we – by which I mean the global health community – should have been doing since at least 2003 is developing vaccines against coronavirus-related diseases. Without wanting to understate the size of the challenge, it seems to me there has been ample time to develop such vaccines, some of which may have provided cross-protection against the new coronavirus. Had we done that work we would probably be in a stronger position today.</p>
