<p id="p0045">One method for overcoming road blocks has been to through the use of new technology platforms to expedite vaccine development 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Vaccines licensed in humans have traditionally been live attenuated viruses (e.g. Measles, mumps, rubella), inactivated viruses (e.g. inactivated polio vaccine) protein or polysaccharide conjugated subunit vaccines (protein: acellular pertussis, hepatitis B; polysaccharide conjugated: pneumococcus, meningococcus), and virus-like particles. Over the last decade, a range of new technology platforms have been developed and include vaccines composed of nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) and viral vectors and recombinant proteins.
