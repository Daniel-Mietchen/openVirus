<p id="p0060">Nucleic acid vaccines utilize antigen-encoding plasmid DNA or RNA, messenger RNA (mRNA) or viral replicons. The nucleic acid, once taken up by a cell will initiate protein synthesis, to which a humoral and cell-mediated immune response is expected to occur, similar to natural infection. Such vaccines have been trialled for veterinary infectious diseases and demonstrated immunogenicity, for example, for foot and mouth disease, deer powassan virus and rabies virus

 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Phase I trials in humans are underway for nucleic acid vaccines against Ebola, influenza and Zika virus 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. The benefit of a nucleic acid platform is the ease with which it allows antigen manipulation and the speed of production, as manufacturing can be synthetic and entirely cell free so circumventing the need for BSL2 laboratories. The disadvantages are that nucleic acid, especially mRNA, are fragile and require an uninterrupted cold-chain process for transport and storage 
 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Phase I clinical trials have been conducted on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV DNA vaccine candidates. A recombinant SARS DNA vaccine candidate coding for the SARS-CoV N protein genome, developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) was investigated in 10 adults 
 <xref rid="b0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. A MERS-CoV DNA vaccine (GLS-5300), developed by GeneOne Life Science/Inovio and coding for the full length S protein genome, had a higher number of participants (n=75) 
 <xref rid="b0270" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref> Both showed acceptable safety profiles and induced humoral and cellular responses; the MERS-CoV DNA vaccine has advanced into a phase 2 clinical trial 
 <xref rid="b0275" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. The only other SARS vaccine to have entered a Phase I trial is an inactivated vaccine (ISCV) produced by Sinovac Biotech 
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. There were no reports of human studies in which vaccinated subjects were challenged by the natural virus.
