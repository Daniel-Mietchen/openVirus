<p id="p0095">Vaccine efficacy in under-represented and vulnerable populations also remains an issue. A majority of vaccine trials have focused on healthy people between the ages of 18-65 years, excluding the elderly, pregnant women and children. Given the disproportionate mortality rate in people over the age of 60, the elderly need to be considered in vaccine trials to ensure safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data is collected and are prioritised to receive COVID-19 vaccines in outbreak situations. Pregnancy has not been shown to be a risk factor for disease severity and the disease burden is low in children. However, much is still unknown, especially the role of inducing an adaptive auto-inflammatory response such as Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome Temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS). There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the immunopathogenesis of COVID-19 to give guidance to the immunological assessment of vaccine responses.</p>
