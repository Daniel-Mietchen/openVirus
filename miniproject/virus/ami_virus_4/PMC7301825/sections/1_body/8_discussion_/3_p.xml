<p id="p0085">There have been international collaborative efforts to expedite vaccine development and production. The prior establishment of CEPI has been an integral existing platform that has supported the rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines without having to establish new mechanisms with attendant costs. CEPI is supporting the nine COVID-19 vaccine candidates briefly presented here. Since its formation it has established measures to finance early development of vaccines, up to phase 3 clinical trials. However, it does not have a role in the manufacturing or deployment of vaccines and a consortium of public and philanthropic funders will be required for complete preparedness for vaccine manufacture and delivery.</p>
