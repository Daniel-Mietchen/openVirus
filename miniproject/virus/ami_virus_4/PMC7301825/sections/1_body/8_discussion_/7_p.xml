<p id="p0105">As we have alluded to, the development of a vaccine that shows efficacy in clinical trials is only the beginning of a process to manufacture, deploy and monitor the effectiveness of a new vaccine. The challenges ahead are numerous. As an example, in 2016 as part of the Global Poliovirus Eradication Initiative (GPEI), 155 countries were planned to synchronously shift from trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) to bivalent vaccine (bOPV)

This switch was to be coordinated with concurrent inclusion of at least 1 dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) into routine immunization schedules in 126 OPV using countries. Significant difficulties have been encountered with vaccine manufacturing and supply chains resulting in interruptions and delays in multiple countries 
 <xref rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. This experience will certainly inform and improve a potential global COVID-19 vaccine deployment, but should influence a level of caution with respect to our expectations even were an effective vaccine developed.
