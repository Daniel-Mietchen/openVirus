<p id="p0080">The rapid progression of new vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2 into pre-clinical and clinical studies is encouraging. Several phase 1 trial results have recently been released. Ad5-CoV vaccine, conducted in 108 participants showed reasonable safety or tolerability profile and has now progressed to phase II. Humoral and cell mediated responses were seen in participants, albeit less in those with pre-existing Ad5 vector immunity

 <xref rid="b0385" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. It is an open question of whether these candidates will display the necessary efficacy and safety profile in humans to progress further into phase 3 trials and subsequently licensure and use to control COVID-19 transmission. In a review of 11 epidemic infectious diseases, only 1 out of 11 (21 preclinical vaccine candidates) have been shown to go through to end of phase 2a trials, at the estimated cost of USD $319-469 million (range $137 million to $1.1 billion) 
 <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. In the current climate, some vaccine developers are have shown willingness to start or progress later phase trial preparations even before definitive results of earlier phase trials are available
