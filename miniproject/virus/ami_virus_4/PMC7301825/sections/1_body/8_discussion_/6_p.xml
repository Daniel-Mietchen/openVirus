<p id="p0100">There has never been a more rapid pace to vaccine development. The pandemic situation has been a challenge and a trigger to reconsidering the usual approaches to regulatory assessment and licensing processes. Vaccine companies are showing willingness to commit to scaled-up production prior to definitive phase 3 trial results 
 <xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. The implementation of high quality, aligned surveillance for COVID-19 across multiple regions concurrently with vaccine deployment is critical both for evaluating the real-world effectiveness of a new vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but also for monitoring its safety in so-call ‘post-marketing’ surveillance. The association of rotavirus vaccines with intussusception in children was only detected following licensure and deployment of these vaccines

 <xref rid="b0415" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref>., the experience of the Philippines with a novel Dengue vaccine should also promote a degree of caution with respect to vaccine safety during their population usage even if they appear safe in phase 1, 2 and 3 studies. 
 <xref rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0425" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref> There will be considerable uncertainties regarding the safety of vaccines for COVID-19 given the new vaccine platforms used without prior licensed examples, deployment to population subgroups not included in trials of that particular candidate), additional uncertainty arising from novel adjuvants in quite a number of candidates.
