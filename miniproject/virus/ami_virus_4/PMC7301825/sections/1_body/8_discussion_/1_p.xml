<p id="p0075">Even if sustained immunity is attained after infection by SARS-CoV2, estimates are that 60-70% of a population would need to be immune to achieve herd immunity against SARS-CoV2 
 <xref rid="b0350" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. The safest and most controlled way for effective and sustainable prevention of COVID-19 in a population is to have an efficacious and safe vaccine and the majority of the population successfully vaccinated. In addition, the vaccine should also be readily mass-produced inexpensively, and be easily transportable with minimal cold chain requirements to have global utility. Immunity after primary COVID-19 infection seems to protect against re-infection in primate models and is likely to occur in humans 
 <xref rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>; whether this can be mimicked in vaccines and for how long immunity may last is still uncertain. Following SARS-CoV infection, IgG and Neutralising Ab was detectable for 1 to 3 years following infection which suggests that vaccine-induced protection is unlikely to be long-lasting and may require re-immunization
