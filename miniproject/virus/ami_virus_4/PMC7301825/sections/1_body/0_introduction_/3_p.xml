<p id="p0015">The case fatality rate (death amongst persons with disease) is consistently reported to be age dependent, with a higher percentage in elderly (aged &gt;70 years) cases dying, although other factors are also associated with intensive care admission and mortality

 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> including sex (male&gt;female), hypertension, obesity and diabetes. The reported case fatality rates [CFR] have been between 0.82% and 9.64%, with variability in CFR likely due to the testing frequency and access as well as other health system capacity factors in different locations 
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The infection fatality rate (IFT; death amongst all people infected â€“ asymptomatic and not tested) is a better estimate of population mortality and is modelled to be between 0.1% to 0.41%
