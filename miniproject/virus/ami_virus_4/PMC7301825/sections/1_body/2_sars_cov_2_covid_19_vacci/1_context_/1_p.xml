<p id="p0040">Developing and scaling-up mass production of a vaccine rapidly in a global pandemic setting is challenging as it requires many activities to be well-coordinated and occurring in parallel, in contrast to the usual decade long, sequential process with pre-clinical testing, phased clinical trials, planned production and distribution. These challenges result in an aggregation of invested resources and elevated financial risk 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In outbreaks, delay in vaccine distribution can result in considerable mortality and morbidity as illustrated by the 2013/2014 West African Ebola epidemic which killed more than 11,000 people 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and resulted in economic and social burden costing over 53 billion dollars 
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Tragically, a vaccine had been in development and was later shown to be effective in the prevention of Ebola and may have contributed to controlling the outbreak

 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Unfortunately, the SARS 2003 epidemic ended before vaccine development was complete. Disappointingly, funding agencies then reallocated funds that had been committed to vaccine development, leaving manufacturers with financial loss and setting back other vaccine development programs 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In 2017, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) was formed to address these past failures with a mission to develop a coordinated response to emerging infectious disease threats to ensure vaccine development and early deployment in response to epidemics
