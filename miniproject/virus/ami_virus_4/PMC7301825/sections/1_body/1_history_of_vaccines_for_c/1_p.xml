<p id="p0030">Coronaviruses have a large (30+ kb) single-stranded positive sense RNA genome encased by a helical nucleocapsid (N) and an outer envelope comprised of matrix protein (M), envelope protein (E) and spike proteins (S) 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The S protein, which naturally occurs in a trimeric form, contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) responsible for binding onto the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and entry into the cell (
