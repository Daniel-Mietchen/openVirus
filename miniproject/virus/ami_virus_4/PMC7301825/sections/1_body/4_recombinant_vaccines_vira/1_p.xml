<p id="p0050">Viral vector technology involves the delivery of one or more genes that encode a target antigen within an unrelated, engineered virus. The viral vector can be replication competent (live attenuated) or replication deficient. For HIV, Ebola, Zika and Chikungunya, vaccines using viral vectors including adenovirus (Ad), measles virus (MV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), alphaviruses, poxviruses and herpesviruses allowing for insertion of 5 kb or more of the transgene have shown ability to stimulate cellular and humoral immunity

Concerns with this platform are with the likely slower speed of vaccine manufacturing in an outbreak setting given the need for biosafety level 2 (BSL2) laboratories, and possible pre-existing immunity in vaccine recipients to viral vectors such as Ad5 and MV decreasing the effectiveness of the vaccine. Approaches such as the selection of low human prevalence adenoviral serotypes (Ad26 or Ad35) have been used to circumvent such an issue
