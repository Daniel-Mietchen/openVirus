<p id="p0055">A MERS-CoV vaccine (MVA-MERS-S_DF1) using modified vaccinia virus Ankara and expressing the spike (S) protein of MERS-CoV was evaluated in an open label, phase 1 trial on 26 individuals aged 18-55. It showed a favourable safety profile without any severe adverse effects but induced only a relatively limited humoral and T-cell response to the MERS CoV

Results of the phase 1 clinical trial for an alternate vaccine, ChAdOx1 MERS vaccine that uses a replication deficient simian adenoviral vector expressing the spike (S) protein in 24 individuals aged 18-50 years showed that a single dose was able to elicit both humoral and cellular responses against MERS CoV. The majority of solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) reported by participants were mild or moderate and all were self-limiting, and there were no serious AEs related to vaccine administration, which supports progression into phase 1b and 2 trials
