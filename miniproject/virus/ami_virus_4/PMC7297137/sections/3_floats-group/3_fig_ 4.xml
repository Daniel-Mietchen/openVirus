  <p>Infection mechanism and tissue distribution of ACE2 receptors in humans. 
   <bold>1</bold> The mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 intracellular entry involves the viral Spike (S) protein C-terminal domain containing a receptor-binding region that binds to the extracellular domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Cleavage of the S protein by the host transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is a crucial step for the membrane fusion and viral internalization by endocytosis with ACE2. 
   <bold>2</bold> Different organs participate in COVID-19 due to the wide range expression of the primary SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2. ACE2 is particularly expressed on the type II alveolar epithelial cells, heart, and brain. The different distribution of ACE2 in organs and tissue is significantly correlated to the clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection
