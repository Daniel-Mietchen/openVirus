<p id="Par44">In severe cases, elderly and subjects with underlying disorders (i.e., hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) could develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction, leading to the death (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020a</xref>). Molecular-based approaches are the first line of methods to confirm SARS-CoV-2-suspected infection. Specifically, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV-2 in sputum, throat swabs, and secretions of the lower respiratory tract samples (Lippi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>). Although nucleic acid testing is the gold standard technique for laboratory diagnosis, other methods such as virus antigen or serological antibody testing are also valuable assays (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>; Meyer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2014</xref>). A positive test for SARS-CoV-2 generally confirms the diagnosis of COVID-19, although false-positive tests are possible. If initial testing is negative but the suspicion for COVID-19 remains, the WHO recommends resampling and testing from multiple respiratory tract sites(World Health Organization Coronavirus Disease 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">(COVID-19)</xref>). Imaging findings of chest computed tomography (CT) in patients with COVID-19 most commonly demonstrate ground-glass opacification with or without consolidative abnormalities, consistent with viral pneumonia. Other studies have suggested that chest CT abnormalities are more likely to be bilateral, have a peripheral distribution, and involve the lower lobes. Chest CT may be helpful in making the diagnosis, but no finding can completely rule in or rule out the possibility of COVID-19. Negative RT-PCR tests on oropharyngeal swabs despite CT findings suggestive of viral pneumonia have been reported in some patients who ultimately tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Serologic tests should be able to identify patients who have either current or previous infection but a negative PCR test (Lim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>; Ling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2020</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that the development of antibody response to infection can be host dependent and take time; in the case of SARS-CoV-2, the majority of patients seroconvert between 7 and 11â€‰days post-exposure to the virus, although some patients may develop antibodies sooner (Patel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2020</xref>). As a result of this natural delay, antibody-detecting tests for SARS-CoV-2 are not useful for the diagnosis of an acute illness but might be important for understanding the diffusion of Sars-CoV-2 in symptomatic or pauci-symptomatic patients.
