<p id="Par42">Infection is transmitted from human to human and through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are considered to be the main transmission routes. Recent reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the urine and stool of laboratory confirmed patients, implying a risk of fecalâ€“oral transmission (General Office of National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2020</xref>). COVID-19 patients are the main source of infection, and severe patients are considered to be more contagious than mild ones. Asymptomatically infected persons or patients in incubation, without signs or symptoms of respiratory infection, proven to shed infectious virus, may also be potential sources of infection (Bai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>; Pan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>; Rothe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2020</xref>). These features may explain the sudden epidemic spreading of the virus.
