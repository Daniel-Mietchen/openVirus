<p id="Par43">The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms varies from asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic forms to clinical conditions, characterized by severe respiratory failure, that necessitates mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit, to multiorgan and systemic manifestations, characterized by sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (Lupia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2020</xref>). Pneumonia appears to be the most frequent manifestation of infection, with fever, cough, dyspnea, and bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging revealing invasive lesions in both lungs (Yang and Jin, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2020</xref>). Other common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, and olfactory and gustative disorders (Guan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020a</xref>; Guan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020b</xref>). In addition, a part of patients manifested gastrointestinal symptoms, with diarrhea and vomiting, and in some patients, they may be presenting complaint (Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>; Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>). Whether upper respiratory symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were rare, fever and cough represented the main symptoms, suggesting the differences in viral tropism as compared with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and influenza virus (Assiri et al.
