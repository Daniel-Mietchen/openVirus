<p id="Par38">The first cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Central Italy, in Rome. The subjects were tourists from Wuhan who had traveled in Lombardy, a Northern region of Italy. The first autochthonous diagnosed case, in the Italian territory, was reported on the February 20, 2020, in a 38-year-old man from the city of Codogno (Lombardy) with no travel history to known areas of viral infection or relation to a probable or confirmed COVID-19 case. After the case in Codogno, other people in Lombardy with flu-like symptoms were found positive for SARS-CoV-2, including medical staff. Thereafter, the Italian COVID-19 epidemic has been mainly characterized by a local transmission. Since the beginning of the epidemic, several preventive measures to favor “social distancing” were undertaken, initially at the local level and finally at the national level with a lockdown of the entire territory on March 11, 2020 (Italian Ministry of Health Covid-19

Geographical spread of the COVID-19 has been heterogeneous with a substantial gradient at the latitude levels with the highest spread in the Northern regions and the lowest in the Southern regions and in the main Islands. The region of Lombardy has the highest number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 and appears to be the epicenter of the Italian outbreak, unlike regions like Molise, Basilicata, and Sardinia, where the SARS-CoV-2 circulation has been encompassed (Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and National Institute of Statistics

Around 35% of reported COVID-19 cases had at least one diagnosed comorbidity reported: cardiovascular, respiratory, diabetes, immune system deficit, metabolic, cancer, and renal comorbidities (Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) and National Institute of Statistics
