<p id="Par48">In addition to functional receptor role, physiologically, ACE2 is an important modulator of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which systemically regulates, via distinct hormones, the cardiovascular and immune systems and is involved in heart function and in the development of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Briefly, the pro-renin is cleaved in the kidneys, and then, the activated renin is released into the blood stream where it in turn activates angiotensinogen, which is converted into angiotensin I and finally into angiotensin II (AngII). Specific angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACEs), mainly expressed on renal and pulmonary epithelium, facilitate this activation cascade. ACE2 is a well-characterized negative regulator of the RAAS system as it converts AngII into the vasodilatory fragment Ang 1â€“7, which simultaneously decreases the AngII concentration to facilitate the antihypertensive effect (Keidar et al.
