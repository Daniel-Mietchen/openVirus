<p id="Par56">In the past 20Â years, it has been proposed that viruses of the CoVs family may be implicated in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease. In 2005, the New Haven coronavirus (HCoV-NH) has been found in the respiratory secretions of 8 of 11 children with Kawasaki disease versus 22 controls tested (Esper et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>). Skepticism on this association was expressed by a group from Japan, who did a retrospective study on nasopharyngeal swabs from 19 children with Kawasaki disease and 208 controls with respiratory tract infections. HCoV-NH RNA was found only in 5 of 208 controls versus 0 of 19 children with Kawasaki disease (Ebihara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2005</xref>; Esper et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>; Turnier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2015</xref>). Another Japanese group explored, by serological tests, the association between HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E and Kawasaki disease. No difference in HCoV-NL63 antibody positivity between patients and controls was detected, whereas a higher HCoV-229E antibody positivity was reported in patients with Kawasaki disease (Shirato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2014</xref>). This data suggests that the CoVs family could represent one of the triggers of Kawasaki disease. In the study of Verdoni 
 <italic>and colleagues</italic>, the presence of the virus was confirmed by the antibodies research versus SARS-CoV-2 in 8 of 10 patients affected by Kawasaki disease. In the remaining two patients, the researchers speculated that confounding factors, such as the serological test performed after an infusion of high-dose immunoglobulins, played a role (Verdoni et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2020</xref>). Only 2 of 10 patients presented a naso-oropharyngeal swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the positivity of IgG antibodies. These findings suggest a late onset of the disease compared with the primary infection. This could be the reason why, in the past, no active viral infection could be demonstrated in this disease (Verdoni et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2020</xref>). All these results and considerations could support the hypothesis that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for a Kawasaki-like disease in susceptible patients. Since patients diagnosed with Kawasaki-like disease after the viral spreading revealed a severe course, including KDSS and MAS, requiring adjunctive steroid treatment, genetic studies, in larger groups, should be done in order to investigate the susceptibility of patients developing this disease to the triggering effect of SARS-CoV-2.
