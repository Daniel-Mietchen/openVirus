<p id="Par55">However, as observed in adults, also in children, the respiratory tract seems not to be the only system susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (Xiao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2020</xref>), and the tissue damage during COVID-19 is mostly mediated by the host innate immunity and by a cytokine storm (D’Antiga

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2020</xref>). Kawasaki disease is an acute and typically self-limiting vasculitis, which almost exclusively interest children (Kawasaki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1974</xref>). Patients with Kawasaki disease, during the acute phase, might have instability at hemodynamic level, a condition known as Kawasaki disease shock syndrome (KDSS) (Kanegaye et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2009</xref>). Other patients with Kawasaki disease might present macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2015</xref>). The cause of Kawasaki disease remains unknown although the most accredited hypothesis supports an aberrant response of the immune system to one or more unidentified pathogens in genetically predisposed patients (Rowley 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2018</xref>; Shulman and Rowley 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2015</xref>). In Japan, during three epidemics in 1979, 1982, and 1986, the highest Kawasaki disease incidence was reported in January, suggesting that factors, during winter months, could trigger Kawasaki disease. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy, as reported by Verdoni 
 <italic>and colleagues</italic>, a high number of Kawasaki-like disease cases (features of patients with Kawasaki disease diagnosed during the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to differ from canonical cohort of Kawasaki patients) occurred after the first case of COVID-19 diagnosed in Bergamo, with a monthly incidence at least 30 times greater than the monthly incidence of the previous 5 years (Verdoni et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2020</xref>).
