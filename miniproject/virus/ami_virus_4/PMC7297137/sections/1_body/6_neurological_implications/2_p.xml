<p id="Par51">Several COVID-19 patients showed secondary mild neurological symptoms, including headache, dizziness, and neuralgia, whereas some severe cases showed neurological complications such as encephalopathy and acute cerebrovascular diseases (Ahmad and Rathore 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). Along this context, besides other primary neurological manifestations such as seizures, increasing evidence indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can cause meningitis and encephalitis. Several reports documented encephalitis without cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) virus detection in COVID-19 patients (Bernard-Valnet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>; Dogan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>; Duong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>; Ye et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2020</xref>). Poyiadji 
 <italic>and colleagues</italic> reported the first US presumptive case of COVID-19-associated acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy (Poyiadji et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2020</xref>), a rare encephalopathy previously associated with Influenza A virus (IAV) and potentially related to damaging effects of the virus-induced cytokine storm on BBB and brain parenchyma (Bailey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). The MRI brain of this SARS-CoV-2-positive 50-year-old female patient with a 3-day history of cough, fever, and altered mental status showed hemorrhagic rim resulting in lesions within the bilateral thalami, medial temporal lobes, and sub-insular brain regions. CSF samples resulted negative for bacteria and herpesviruses, but no investigation was performed either for IAV or SARS-CoV-2 presence. Bernard-Valnet 
 <italic>and colleagues</italic> described two patients who developed a meningoencephalitis few days after a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. At first, their symptoms were the classic ones of COVID-19 patients, including mild respiratory symptoms. Then, they developed severe neuropsychological symptoms, compatible with viral meningoencephalitis. However, no viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, were detected in their CSF samples (Bernard-Valnet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). Another case was reported in Iran, where a hospitalized 79-year-old male, with history of fever and cough and positive for SARS-CoV-2, entered in a semi-conscious state probably due to a massive intracerebral hemorrhage in the right hemisphere with intraventricular and subarachnoid extension, as revealed with computed tomography scan. The authors did not report results from CSF analysis, but just hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may directly invades the CNS via the olfactory receptors of cranial nerve I in the nasal cavity cell membrane (Sharifi-Razavi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2020</xref>). Dogan 
 <italic>and colleagues</italic> documented 6 cases of SARS-COV2-related autoimmune meningoencephalitis among the 29 most severely affected COVID-19 patients (intubated) of the 332 ones admitted to their center. Despite CSF samples did not show the occurrence of active CNS infection, including SARS-CoV-2, clinical tests evidenced increased levels of acute-inflammation (high ferritin, fibrinogen, CRP, and IL-6 in sera) and bilateral cerebral inflammation compatible with meningoencephalitis on MRI (Dogan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>).
