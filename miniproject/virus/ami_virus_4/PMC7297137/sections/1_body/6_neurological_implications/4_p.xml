 <italic>and colleagues</italic> (Duong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>), also reported a case of SARS-CoV2 encephalitis (first CSF analysis negative for herpesviruses and other microbes, subsequent CSF analysis positive for SARS-COV2) in a US 41-year-old woman with some comorbidities (type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity) whose nasopharyngeal swab on hospital admission was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and negative for influenza A and B viruses. This woman presented fever, headache, and new seizure onset and experienced no respiratory distress nor potential virus-induced abnormalities in other organs. Neurologically, she had hallucination and disorientation, followed by lethargic status but gradually improved after hydrochlorine treatment up to showing no neurologic symptoms within by day 12 of hospitalization (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020b</xref>).
