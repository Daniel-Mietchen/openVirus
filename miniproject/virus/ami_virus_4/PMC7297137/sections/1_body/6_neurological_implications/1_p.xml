<p id="Par50">A growing body of clinical findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 gain entry into the central nervous system (CNS) (Mao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>), but the exact route of access has yet to be demonstrated. According to similarity with other coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV and studies in animal model of infection (Netland et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2008</xref>), CNS invasion was postulated to occur mainly by trans-synaptic transfer of virus particles, starting from infection in the peripheral nerve endings such as the olfactory ones (Butowt and Bilinska 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). Along this line, peripheral neuronal manifestations, as the loss of smell and taste, are frequently experienced by COVID-19 individuals (Baig et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Mao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020</xref>). The expression of ACE2 on the surface on neurons and glial cells (Hamming et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) as well as the priming proteases TMPRSS2 and furin, all required for virus attach and entry in host cells (Hoffmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>; Lashley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2008</xref>) makes them suitable targets for virus infection. However, recent findings from a postmortem study (Paniz-Mondolfi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2020</xref>) support the hypothesis that the virus could also exploit the hematogenous route, since SARS-CoV-2 was found in neurons and capillary endothelial cells of the frontal lobe of a patient death for SARS-CoV2-associated ARDS. It is known that endothelial cells of blood vessels, including the cerebral ones, express ACE2. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 could infect those cells in the cerebral blood vessels, leading to increased permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and in turn promoting pathogen invasion into the brain. A similar effect may be exerted indirectly by the virus-induced inflammatory cytokine storms, leading to brain edema and intracranial hypertension. Finally, the virus might also exploit a macrophage-mediated Trojan-horse mechanism (Santiago-Tirado and Doering 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2017</xref>) or the lymphatic route to reach the brain, as well as other organs.
