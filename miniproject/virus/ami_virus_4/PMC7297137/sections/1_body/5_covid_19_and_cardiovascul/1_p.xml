<p id="Par49">ACE2, located also on the cell surface of cardiac systems, may help to understand those patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 that presented cardiovascular symptoms (myocardial injury, cardiac chest pain, fulminant heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiac death), in addition to the typical respiratory symptoms during COVID-19 (Long et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2020</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The mechanism for the SARS-CoV-2 intracellular entry involves the viral S protein C-terminal domain containing a receptor-binding region that binds to the extracellular domain of ACE2 (Di Gennaro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). Cleavage of the S protein by the host transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), to generate the S1 and S2 subunits, is a crucial step for the membrane fusion and viral internalization by endocytosis with ACE2 (Hoffmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Interestingly, the interaction between S protein with the extracellular domain of ACE2, which triggers the endocytosis of the complex, is remarkably increased in patients suffering from hypertension or coronary heart disease (Svenningsen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2017</xref>; Zheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2016</xref>). ACE2 internalization by SARS-CoV-2 results in the loss of ACE2 at the cell surface and removes a key pathway for the cell to degrade ANG II and generate the cardiovascular-protective Ang-(1–7). Certainly, an increase in the overall ratio of ANG II/Ang-(1–7), following ACE2 internalization, may exacerbate the pulmonary tissue damage, initially caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Guan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020a</xref>; Guan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020b</xref>; Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>; Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2020a</xref>; Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2020b</xref>; Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2020c</xref>). Moreover, the down-regulation of ACE2 on the surface of infected cells might secondary imply an excessive response of the immune system and, then, the progression and the worsening of the disease in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. Lung and heart damage is due precisely by an overreaction of the immune system associated with a pronounced cytokine storm resulting into vascular inflammation, plaque instability, myocardial inflammation, and hypercoagulable state [(Levi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2004</xref>; Prabhu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2004</xref>); Yang et al. 2020]. Clinical features include the dysregulation of T helper cells of type 1 and 2 and levels extremely elevated of IL-6 and ferritin (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>; Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2020a</xref>; Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2020b</xref>; Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2020c</xref>), which are also well-known markers for sepsis. The cardiovascular system involvement, during severe COVID-19, is unquestioned although the specific mechanisms remain to be explored. One proposed mode of action is related to a direct infection of cardiomyocytes (CMCs) by SARS-CoV-2 during the critical phase that leads to the myocarditis development (Zheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2020</xref>). A second assumption is that an over-activated immune system is predominantly contributing to SARS-CoV-2-induced heart damage. Following to cardiac ischemia as an effect of pneumonia and ARDS (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020a</xref>; Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020b</xref>; Guan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020a</xref>; Guan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020b</xref>), CMC damage induces a range of pro-inflammatory mechanisms, which in turn escape control and further promote loss of CMCs (Mehta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2020</xref>). Consequently, a secondary induced cardiac injury seems to be plausible. However, this scenario is strongly supported by previous studies investigating the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 or MERS-CoV-associated epidemic in 2012 (World Health Organization (WHO) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2020</xref>), where acute myocarditis and heart failure have also been reported (Alhogbani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). Considering the multiple effects on the heart, it can be assumed that previous cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) could lead to worse progression of COVID-19 and to an increased risk of mortality (Long et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2020</xref>). Interestingly, the increased mortality rate in patients with preexisting or new cardiac injuries is concomitant with high levels of troponin T (TnT) serum, a common cardiac damage biomarker. To support this hypothesis, the study of Guo 
 <italic>and colleagues</italic> reported that CVD patients, without significantly raised TnT serum levels, presented only a slightly increased mortality compared to patients without CVDs (Guo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>). Therefore, although TnT levels should always be monitored in the case of cardiac damage caused by comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular but also pulmonary dysfunctions, cancer, nephrological and cerebrovascular disorders) or severe disease progression, these levels should be critically interpreted since some medications and interventions can cause an upregulation of TnT (Cardiology Magazine 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>; Harvell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016</xref>). Together with the inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and ferritin, TnT may be used to predict the outcome of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and help to reduce COVID-19 mortality (Poe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2015</xref>; Rivara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2012</xref>).
