 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2020</xref>), transmission from children could be an important contributor to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as with other respiratory viruses. However, the relative importance of children in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still unclear, in particular whether asymptomatic children, those with low viral loads and perhaps with prolonged viral shedding play an important role. Few studies describe children as index cases in familial clusters (

 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Zhen-Dong et al., 2020</xref>) and clearly children more often have asymptomatic infections when compared with adults (

 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Bi et al., 2020</xref>). It is of urgent importance in modelling the pandemic to undertake careful surveillance, including asymptomatic children and rates of infection based on serology, to better characterize infection in children and their role in transmission networks.
