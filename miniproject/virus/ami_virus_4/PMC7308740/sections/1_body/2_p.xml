<p id="par0015">COVID-19 mortality is strongly age-dependent, and Africa has a comparably younger population than other continents (
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Mougeni et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, children might be an important target for interventions aimed at reducing transmission in countries with young populations, especially since access through school immunisation may be more straightforward than accessing adults. Although, the priority for COVID-19 vaccination would logically be for those at highest risk of infection, such as healthcare workers, and those at highest risk of severe disease, such as older adults, vaccination of children may be another important group for their own protection and to support herd immunity.
