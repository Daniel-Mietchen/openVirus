<p id="p0035">Many favor the theory that diverse infectious agents (including coronavirus) can trigger a “final common pathway” of immune dysregulation causing KD in a genetically susceptible individual. However, the idea that a genetically predisposed individual who is immunologically susceptible to multiple infections could be triggered only once (since KD rarely recurs) does not fit with our present understanding of human immunology. This hypothesis would also predict that KD could occur at any age, whereas the age distribution of KD is quite classic for a disease caused by a single ubiquitous infectious agent. One also cannot explain the occurrence of well-documented epidemics and outbreaks of KD with geographic wave-like spread of illness (
