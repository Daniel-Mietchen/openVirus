<p id="p0040">MIS-C cases have appeared during periods of high prevalence of COVID-19 in an individual country, and also appear to decrease following a decline in COVID-19 cases (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It is hoped that when the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is finally overcome, potentially by vaccination, MIS-C will no longer be a clinical issue. Although the etiologic agent of KD presently remains unclear, research studies support a ubiquitous RNA virus, different from presently known human viruses, that forms intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in tissues from patients with KD (

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We have identified a protein epitope of the putative agent recognized by the antibody response in KD patients, with substantial progress in developing the first-ever serologic assay for KD (

 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which presently should include MIS-C. In the meantime, research is urgently needed to identify the pathogenesis of MIS-C, which is currently unknown but bears similarities to the cytokine storm observed in adult patients with COVID-19 during their second week of illness(20).
