<p id="p0025">For patients in whom MIS-C and KD are being considered, some clinical and laboratory features of the two conditions may help in discerning the correct diagnosis. Abdominal pain significant enough to prompt advanced imaging and surgical consultation occurs rarely in KD (
 <xref rid="bib10a" ref-type="bibr">10a</xref>) but is characteristic of MIS-C. Lymphopenia is a typical finding in MIS-C and is reported rarely in KD; the more severe the lymphopenia, the more likely the diagnosis is MIS-C. Although NT-pro-BNP is a biomarker of potential value in KD and some patients have been reported to have levels as high as 7,000 pg/mL (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the extent of the elevation in KD generally is lower than in MIS-C, for which values in excess of 10,000 pg/mL often are reported; the higher the NT-pro-BNP level, the more likely the diagnosis is MIS-C. Myocardial dysfunction as assessed by echocardiography is common in MIS-C and is rare in KD..
