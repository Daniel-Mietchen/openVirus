<p id="p0030">Some investigators have proposed that MIS-C, while having very different epidemiologic and some different laboratory features compared with KD, could provide etiologic clues that KD may result from infection with a coronavirus (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table</xref> outlines some differing features of KD and coronavirus infections that make an etiologic relationship unlikely. Moreover, if SARS-CoV-2 or a closely related virus was a KD etiologic agent, one would expect the epidemiology of MIS-C and KD to be similar. Of note, MIS-C cases have not been observed in China (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) or Japan, countries with the highest prevalence of KD in the world, which surely should have been expected if there was an etiologic relationship between KD and MIS-C.
