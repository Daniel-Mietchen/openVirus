<p id="p0015">Because of a concern that MIS-C might potentially encompass a wider range of clinical features than those observed in the reported cases, the CDC developed a broad case definition. Unfortunately, the case definition as it currently stands is problematic, because patients with many infectious and inflammatory conditions of childhood that are not MIS-C fulfill the case definition. This includes patients with acute COVID-19 infection (eg, acute infection with fever, rash, diarrhea, and a minimally elevated C-reactive protein level), classic KD (e.g., a child with KD who has rash as one of the diagnostic features and mild hepatitis or diarrhea), other viral infections (e.g. one of many that could cause fever, rash, cough, and an increase in neutrophils in peripheral blood), systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (e.g., fever, rash, an increase in neutrophils in peripheral blood, elevated acute phase reactants), and so on. Moreover, on my recent clinical service, I noted an increase in patient transfers from referring hospitals of children with low grade fever for one day, rash, and mild abdominal discomfort, for evaluation for possible MIS-C. These children arrived appearing well, with completely normal blood pressure and heart rate and minimally elevated acute phase reactants. Presumably, all the media publicity about MIS-C is raising concern among practitioners about missing this diagnosis, potentially resulting in an increase in hospital admissions for routine minor childhood illnesses, and a likely inflated number of reported cases. Moreover, a rapid or presumptive diagnosis of MIS-C, which remains uncommon, also has the potential to result in premature diagnostic closure in children who fulfill the broad case definition but in reality have a potentially life-threatening, non-MIS-C illness.</p>
