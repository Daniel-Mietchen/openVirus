<p>Ironically, COVID has achieved, what was the ultimate goal of most humanists that the “world should be one.” When John Lennon wrote the best-selling single of his solo career “Imagine” and sang “Imagine all the people, Sharing all the world… And the world will live as one,” it never imagined that this way it could happen: the world is one as there is a single-point focus for the person on the streets to the caregivers to the academicians to the global leaders and nothing in recent times has so completely occupied the mental and physical framework of billions of human beings on earth as the present predicament. And with collective effort we should overcome this scourge and until then would be what Robert Frost most appropriately said “We dance round in a ring and suppose, But the Secret sits in the middle and knows.”</p>
