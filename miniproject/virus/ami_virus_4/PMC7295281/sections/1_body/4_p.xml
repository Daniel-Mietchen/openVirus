<p> As it would appeal to common sense, patients on immunomodulators for preexisting diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autoimmune hepatitis should be prone to both infection with SARS-CoV2 as well as a more severe COVID course. Yet, this again remains a conjecture and the real-world data which is emerging does not provide strong support to this. An international registry has been established for IBD patients with COVID. 
 <xref rid="OR_3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> As per this registry as of April 22, a total of 704 COVID-19 cases from 38 countries have been reported. The observed overall case fatality rate in patients with IBD is approximately 4% which is similar to patients without any disease. Interestingly, the case fatality rate was 8% for patients on 5-ASA/sulfasalazine, 12% for patients on steroids, 4% for those on budesonide, and 1 to 3% for those on biologicals. The last update from this registry also suggest that many IBD patients with symptom flares may actually have COVID-19, so this is something to keep in our differential with our patients during this pandemic.
