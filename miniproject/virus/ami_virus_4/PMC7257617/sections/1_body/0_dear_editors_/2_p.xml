<p>In their letter, the authors assume that the greater burden of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) in adults may be related to the absence in the population of prior immunity to Sars-CoV-2, as occurred in fully susceptible population during previous viral epidemics. In particular, Shanks 
 <italic>et al</italic>. report that measles mortality rate in a fully susceptible population during the 1846 measles epidemic was higher in adults and in children under 2 years of age [

 <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, Plotkin 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that case–fatality ratio is still high in children under one year of age, lower in children aged one to nine years, whereas it rises again in teenagers and adults [
 <xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Reported data suggest that greater morbidity and mortality in adults is not a unique feature of first-contact measles epidemics.
