<p>As regards West Nile virus infection [
 <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], Severe Fever with Trombocytopenia Syndrome [
 <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Plasmodium falciparum malaria [
 <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], several factors such as pathogen features, transmission dynamics and population characteristics could be potential confounders; therefore, we think that those diseases could be not comparable to COVID-19. Moreover, Rutledge 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Li H 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] described a higher mortality rate in adults, but data were collected over several years and we are not sure that the population can be considered fully susceptible over time.
