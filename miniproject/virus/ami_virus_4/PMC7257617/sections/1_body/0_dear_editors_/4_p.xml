<p>Furthermore, Sars-CoV-2 viral genome is 75 to 80% identical to the SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently, Grifoni 
 <italic>et al</italic>. analysed adaptive immunity to Sars-CoV-2 and detected SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4+ T cells in ∼40–60% of unexposed individuals, suggesting a cross-reactive T cell recognition between circulating “common cold” coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In view of these overall considerations, we can speculate that Sars-CoV-2 infection may not have spread in a fully susceptible population. This hypothesis may be also confirmed by a previous study by Fedson which reported that the different age-related mortality during 1918 influenza pandemic could be related to previously exposures to the H1N1-like viruses, suggesting a fundamental role of “antigenic imprinting” on individual response [
