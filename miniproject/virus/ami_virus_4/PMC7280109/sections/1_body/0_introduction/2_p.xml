<p id="p0035">The 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic>, from 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> sub-genus, was first isolated in the city of Wuhan (China), in December 2019, from a patients’ cluster presenting a not recognizable acute pneumonia, whose affected had the only common denominator the visit at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (Wuhan, China) (

 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">JHU, 2020</xref>). The 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family, enveloped RNA single-stranded viruses of positive polarity (e.g., species of human 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic>, HCoV), are generally responsible of a wide range of common flus and infections of the upper respiratory tract. H–CoV are involved in severe pathologies, such as bronchitis, bronchilotis, pneumoniae, mainly affecting neonates, children, old people and immunocompromised patients (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Geller et al., 2012</xref>). The transmission of disease connected to SARS-CoV-2 infections is associated to the contact with infected persons through the emission of droplets (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2005a</xref>). Although there are no scientific evidences regarding the transmission of the new 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> through water, wastewater, food or other matrices, it can be hypothesised that the virus is inactivated more rapidly than non-enveloped (therefore, less virulent) viruses, holding the same route of transmission (e.g., 
 <italic>Adenovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Norovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Rotavirus</italic>, Hepatitis A virus). High temperatures, low or high pH values, sunlight, and the most common disinfection agents represent an essential tool able to inactivate the virus. Based on the experimental data available today, it is not clear how long the virus is capable of surviving on inanimate surfaces, neither in the environment.
