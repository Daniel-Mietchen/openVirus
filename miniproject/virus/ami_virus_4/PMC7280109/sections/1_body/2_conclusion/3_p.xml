<p id="p0110">Certainly, a prolonged exposure to contaminated environmental sources, such as the exploitation of air pollutants (e.g., PM
 <sub>10</sub>), the extended contact with aerosols produced from wastewater and surface water plants treatment, the inadequate detergency processes of food and surfaces, may potentially lead to an augmented transmission risk, also in non immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, the proper employment, from employees of health system, water, and waste treatment plants, and industries in general, of the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), especially masks equipped with filters, along the production chain, the low survival of SARS-CoV-2 in environmental conditions, and the adequate application of disinfection treatments foreseen by national and international guidelines, allow to suppose that the risk linked to the transmission of the virus may result low.
