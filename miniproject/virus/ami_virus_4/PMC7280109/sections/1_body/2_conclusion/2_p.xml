<p id="p0105">COVID-19 airborne transmission has not been yet demonstrated; fecal shedding has been reported from some patients, although the viability of the virus has been evidenced at low levels. Furthermore, based on the studies on surface water, wastewater, sludge and bio-solid waste, the survival of SARS-CoV-2 would result very low with temperatures higher than 20 °C, and the inactivation rate of 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> is usually higher than other examined viruses. The same consideration could be made for the risk coming from potentially contaminated food, for which 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> persistance was reported for not more than 72 h of storage at 4 °C. On inanimate surfaces, strains of 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> genus are capable to surviving up to nine days, but result extremely labile, being inactivated with really low concentrations of disinfectants.
