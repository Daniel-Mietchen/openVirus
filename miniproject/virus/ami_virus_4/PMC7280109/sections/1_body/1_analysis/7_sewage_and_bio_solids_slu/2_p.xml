<p id="p0090">SARS-CoV strains are generally able to survive up to 96 h in human biological specimens, such as faeces, sputum, and serum, but result a lot less stable in urine (
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Duan et al., 2003</xref>), probably depending on the inhibiting pH values, and the presence of urea. The faecal excretions of SARS-CoV in the past decade represented a strong concern with respects to the security measures to be applied in order to assess the waste collection in the territory. Nevertheless, as of April 2020, no cases of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 infections transmitted via sewages or sludge were reported. Some studies performed on similar viruses such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), evaluating the persistance of the virus in such waste categories, for the time needed to consider the pathogen as a risk for human health, demonstrated that the risk is to be considered highly improbable. Moreover, it is difficult for the virus to survive to processing treatments to which waste is usually subject (
