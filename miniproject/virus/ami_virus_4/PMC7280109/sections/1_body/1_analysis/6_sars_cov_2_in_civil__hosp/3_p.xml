<p id="p0085">In 2005, in China, Wang et al. 2020a, 2020b published the results of researches conducted to verify the presence of SARS-CoV in wastewater coming from two hospitals receiving patients affected with SARS. The outcomes reported that, following disinfection protocols (using chlorine), SARS-CoV RNA resulted still detectable from sewages from one of the hospitals involved in the monitoring. The study demonstrated that the virus is able to survive up to 2 days at 20 °C, and the inactivated viral RNA was isolated up to 8 days) (
