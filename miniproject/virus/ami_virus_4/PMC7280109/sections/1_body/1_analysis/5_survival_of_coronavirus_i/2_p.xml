<p id="p0060">The risk of respiratory syndromes onset and the potential environmental transmission indicates the need to collect more detailed information concerning the survival of species of 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> genus in water environments. The survival of surrogate species of 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic>, Human 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> 229E (HCoV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), and 
 <italic>Poliovirus</italic> 1 (PV-1), was analyzed in filtered and unfiltered tap water, and in wastewater. The evaluation on filtered tap water (beyond unfiltered samples) resulted functional to the reduction of the influence coming from the bacteria and the organic matter present in the wastewater effluent, that may inhibit the replication of the viruses under analysis (
