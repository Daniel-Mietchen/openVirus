<p id="p0065">Results were presented in a study conducted in 2008. The inactivation of 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> in water results strongly depending on the temperature, the levels of organic matter, and the presence of antagonists germs, such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp., etc. (generally isolated from wastewater). To reach inactivation rates of 99,9% (T
 <sub>99.9</sub>) viral load in tap water, at 23 °C, 10 days are needed; at 4 °C, the viral surrogate of SARS-CoV-2 is capable of surviving up to 588 days, considering projected values (
