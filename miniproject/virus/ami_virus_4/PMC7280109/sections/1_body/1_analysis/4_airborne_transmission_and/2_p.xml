<p id="p0050">COVID-19 airborne spread has recently been reported by on-field studies conducted at Wuhan Hospitals: RNA of SARS-COV-2 RNA was retrieved in air samples collected in the hospitals wards and outside hospital buildings, in lower quantities in the outdoor samples, compared to indoor (

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Setti et al., 2020b</xref>). Based on available outcomes, air should be considered a major route of transmission, especially considering certain aerosol-generating procedures performed in health care facilities. The potential airborne diffusion of the virus, enhancing the importance of adopting isolation measures, has been also evaluated by two recent studies conducted at two hospitals in Wuhan (China), in at-risk hospital wards and in public areas (

The persistance of SARS-CoV-2 in the air was evidenced in Wuhan Hospital wards along the COVID-19 outbreak (from 1 to 113 copies/m
 <sup>3</sup>), although the virus was not detected following the reduction of affected patients and the application of more rigorous disinfecting procedures; public spaces outside Wuhan hospitals reported the airborn presence of the virus when high number people were present (
