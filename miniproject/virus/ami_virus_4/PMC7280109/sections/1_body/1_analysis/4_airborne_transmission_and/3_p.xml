<p id="p0055">Based on the studies regarding the viruses spreading in the population, the available literature often linked the incidence of viral infections cases with the concentrations of atmospheric polluting particulate matter (e.g., PM
 <sub>10</sub> e PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>) (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Sedlmaier et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, the atmospheric particulate act as a carrier, for the majority of chemical and biological contaminants, viruses included. A preliminary study, describing the possible relation, in Italy, between the COVID-19 diffusion and the exceeding of PM
 <sub>10</sub> limit values, has been released in early 2020 (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Setti et al., 2020a</xref>). The research aimed to evaluate the potential correlation between the atmospheric particulate pollution and the virus shedding. Following the collection of PM
 <sub>10</sub> values in several italian cities (data available from Italian Regional Agencies for Health Protection, ARPA), and the identification of events of law limit values exceedings (50 μg/m
 <sup>3</sup>), data were associated to the numbers of COVID-19 affected population, reported by Italian Civil Protection authority: the hypothesis was confirmed by the registration of the highest number of Italian outbreaks in Po Valley (i.e., Pianura Padana), where the highest levels of pollution are reported yearly. The researchers therefore hypothesised a potential boosting effect of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, thanks to the vehiculation through the PM
 <sub>10</sub> (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Setti et al., 2020a</xref>). The hypothesis was confirmed by a research conducted by the same working group in Northern Italy, reporting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA (using RT-PCR, detecting 
 <italic>E</italic>, 
 <italic>N</italic>, and 
 <italic>RdRP</italic> genes) in over the 30% of the 34 PM
 <sub>10</sub> specimens of airborne PM
 <sub>10</sub> sampled in the industrial area around the city of Bergamo (Italy) (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Setti et al., 2020c</xref>). The atmospheric persistence of SARS-CoV-2, whose quantity still need to be deeply investigated, would amplify the risk of contracting COVID-19, making necessary periodic air monitoring, to assess the transmission risk of the virus in the most exposed environments.
