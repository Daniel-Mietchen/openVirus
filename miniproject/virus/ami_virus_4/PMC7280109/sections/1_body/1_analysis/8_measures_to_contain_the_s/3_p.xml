<p id="p0100">It can be hypothesised that the treatment plants collecting hospital wastewater are receiving sewage containing high concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 and, whether the virus inactivation treatments result inadequate, the risk of detecting high viral loads in the environment could come up (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Casanova et al., 2009</xref>). As already premised, 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> strains are usually less resistant to disinfection treatments, compared to other organisms which can be found in wastewater, such as 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> phage or human virus, such as 
 <italic>Poliovirus</italic>, which, are commonly employed as surrogates for the evaluation of the efficacy of viruses inactivation (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Gundy et al., 2009</xref>). Survival of 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> strains is generally function of the temperature, showing a higher persistance at low temperatures: it may be therefore supposed that the persistance of SARS-CoV-2 in surface water and wastewater in the warm seasons may be highly reduced. In general, secondary treatments may result crucial for the logarithmic reduction of the virus (more than 90%) (

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>) despite the variability in the collected data supports the need to employ the preventive application of chemical disinfection protocols (e.g., chlorination), and the aid of UV light. The efficacy of chlorination, highly oxidating treatment, additionally depends on the presence, in the matrix that has to be treated, of peculiar substances such as the ammonia, which, reacting with sodium hypochlorite, brings to the formation of chloroammines, active principles less effective virucides than free chlorine. Available researches propose the chlorination of wastewater with a 10 mg/L dosage of sodium hypochlorite, with a 30 min time of contact, and a residual chlorine value &gt; 0.4 mg/L: the suggested disinfection methods resulted efficient to inactivate 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> strains up to 5 log (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2005a</xref>). As for the disinfection using UV light, the health authorities did not specify viral inactivation protocols yet, considering that the lower inactivation efficacy of UV light, compared to the also cheaper chlorination (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, 2020</xref>). As for the treatment of surfaces in industrial facilities (e.g., food companies, or the water, wastewater, and waste treatment plants), considering the evidences of the pathogenic viruses persistence on such inanimated matrices (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kampf et al., 2020</xref>), several researches showed the removal efficacy of the virus, by testing different biocidal products. The virus is successfully eliminated from surfaces using 65–70% ethanol (or isopropanol), 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, with a time of contact of 1 min; further virucidal agents such as benzalkonium chloride (up to 0.2%) or chlorhexidine digluconate based products (0.02%) were demonstrated less active in the virus inactivation (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Kampf et al., 2020</xref>). European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) published a list of the most effective biocides for SARS-CoV-2 disinfection (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">European Chemicals Agency, 2020</xref>). World Health Organization (WHO) and the U. S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommended low environmental impact biocides, such as phenolic compounds, hydrogen peroxide, hydroalcoholic formulates, holding high efficacy towards the new 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic>, indicating the high susceptibility of the pathogen to the disinfecting agents used to inactivate enveloped viruses (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020c</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020</xref>). For example, the biocide 2-phenylphenol, at a 0.2% concentration, is capable of breaking the viral membranes and denaturing the virus proteins (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Blow et al., 2004</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide was demonstrate extremely active in the inactivation of a wide range of viruses, comprised SARS-CoV-2 surrogates (e.g., Human Coronavirus 229E, H–CoV-229E; Trasmissible GatroEnreritis Virus, TGEV), holding a die-off capability &gt; 4 log

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 2005</xref>), additionally showing a low registered toxicity (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Omidbakhsh and Sattar, 2006</xref>). Hydrogen Peroxide Vapourized (HPV) was demonstrated inactivating &gt; 4 log
 <sub>10</sub> viral titres of SARS-CoV-2 surrogates (feline 
 <italic>Calicivirus</italic>, FCV; human 
 <italic>Adenovirus</italic>-1, hADV-1; Trasmissible Gatroenreritis Virus, TGEV; etc.), at low percentages of the active principle (1400 ppm), reporting low toxicity on cells (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Goyal et al., 2014</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide and 2-phenylphenol are generally employed also for food sanitation, and for surfaces disinfection, therefore representing valid alternatives to sodium hypochlorite.
