<p id="p0010">Acute hepatitis is not usually an indication for liver biopsy. There are, however, at least three reasons why pathologists sometimes receive liver biopsy samples from patients with acute hepatitis. First, there may be doubt about the clinical diagnosis, or even a mistaken working diagnosis. Second, a diagnosis of hepatitis may be well established but the clinician needs information on the stage of the disease or its severity. Third, the patient may have received a liver transplant and the pathologist is being asked to help decide if symptoms or biochemical abnormalities are due to recurrent (or new) viral hepatitis or to some other cause such as rejection. For all these reasons, a knowledge of the pathology of acute hepatitis is essential. There is a further reason, no less important than the others: without a knowledge of acute hepatitis, the pathologist cannot hope to understand chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, together the cause of most liver disease in the world. This chapter describes acute viral hepatitis and its immediate sequelae in the immunocompetent patient. The specific problems of diagnosing hepatitis in an immunosuppressed patient after transplantation are reviewed in
