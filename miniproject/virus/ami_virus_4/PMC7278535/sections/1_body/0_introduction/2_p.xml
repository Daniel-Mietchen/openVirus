While several other candidates have been extensively investigated in recent years, none has so far been established as a definite cause of viral hepatitis, and most episodes of acute and chronic hepatitis can be attributed to one of the viruses listed, to autoimmune hepatitis (
 <bold>Ch. 9</bold>) or to a hepatotoxic agent (
 <bold>Ch. 8</bold>). An exception to this statement is fulminant hepatitis, the cause of which cannot currently be established in a substantial minority of patients,
