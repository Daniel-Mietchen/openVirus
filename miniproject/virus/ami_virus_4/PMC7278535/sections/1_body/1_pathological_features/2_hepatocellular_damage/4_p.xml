<p id="p0045">Cholestasis in the form of bile thrombi in canaliculi is common in acute hepatitis but rare in chronic hepatitis, which is diagnostically helpful. It is a result of damage to the bile-secretory apparatus of the hepatocytes, but may also result from interference with bile flow at the level of the portal tracts.
