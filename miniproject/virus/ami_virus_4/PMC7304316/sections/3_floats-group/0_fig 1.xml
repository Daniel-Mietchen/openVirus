  <p>Protection against lethal polymicrobial-community-mediated sepsis by vaccination with an avirulent yeast strain. Mice were vaccinated intraperitoneally with avirulent (live attenuated) 
   <named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida dubliniensis</named-content> (
   <italic>Cd</italic>) followed by a lethal challenge with 
   <named-content content-type="genus-species">Candida albicans</named-content>
   <italic>and</italic>
   <named-content content-type="genus-species">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content> (
   <italic>Ca</italic>/
   <italic>Sa</italic>) intraperitoneally 14 days later. Survival data are shown for 8 independent experiments performed with groups of 10 mice each. The inset shows sepsis scoring during the observation period after lethal challenge. Animals were monitored daily using a modified mouse clinical assessment score for sepsis (M-CASS) scoring system that included fur aspect, posture, activity, and chest and eyelid movement. Animals with a combined daily score of 8+ were humanely euthanized. Data were statistically analyzed using the Mantel-Cox log rank test (survival curves) and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni 
   <italic>post hoc</italic> tests (sepsis scoring) (****, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001). SEM, standard errors of the means.
