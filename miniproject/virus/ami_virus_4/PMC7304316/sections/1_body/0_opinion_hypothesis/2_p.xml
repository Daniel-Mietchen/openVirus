<p>The general concept that the trained innate immunity induced by live attenuated vaccines can limit pathological inflammation is novel but not without precedent. At least 6 clinical trials have been initiated in Europe, Australia, and the United States to test vaccination with 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Mycobacterium bovis</named-content> BCG (live attenuated tuberculosis [TB] vaccine) or placebo in high-risk health care workers to determine whether beneficial trained innate responses against COVID-19 can be elicited (

In these trials, the proposed trained innate response is one of immune enhancement that could possibly reduce viral levels and/or sequelae associated with COVID-19, similar to what has been reported for other viral infections (

In contrast, we propose that the trained innate response includes induction of the MDSCs that can inhibit/reduce the severe lung inflammation/sepsis associated with COVID-19. In either regard, on the basis of data from prior BCG trials in infants, the vaccine-induced trained innate cells remain in the circulation for roughly 1 year (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Hence, if these innate responses are indeed induced in the current clinical trials, recipients should benefit throughout the acute crisis period of the current COVID-19 pandemic until a conventional vaccine is available or antiviral therapies become more accessible. One caveat concerning BCG vaccination is seroconversion, which is the basis for the TB diagnostic test currently used in the United States. Hence, BCG vaccination is not conducted in the United States. We therefore are proposing the use of the live attenuated MMR vaccine, which has also been found to be associated with beneficial NSE in human populations.
