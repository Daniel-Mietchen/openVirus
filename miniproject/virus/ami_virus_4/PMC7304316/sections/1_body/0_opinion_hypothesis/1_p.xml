<p>There is mounting evidence that the use of live attenuated vaccines commonly administered during childhood also provides beneficial nonspecific effects (NSE), including reduced mortality and hospitalization due to unrelated infections (

In this Commentary, we outline a rationale to support the use of live attenuated vaccines, such as MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), as a preventive measure against the pathological inflammation and sepsis associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). We emphasize this is strictly a preventive measure against the worst inflammatory sequelae of COVID-19 for those exposed/infected and does not represent an antiviral therapy or vaccine against COVID-19 in any manner. It has been proposed that live attenuated vaccines induce nonspecific effects representing “trained innate immunity” by “training” leukocyte precursors in the bone marrow to function more effectively against broader infectious insults (
