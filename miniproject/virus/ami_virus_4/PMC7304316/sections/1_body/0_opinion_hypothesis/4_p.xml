<p>Looking historically at other viral respiratory epidemics and pandemics of seasonal influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), one of the more interesting observations is the drastic difference in mortality rates between children and adults (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Children are highly susceptible to flu; the CDC estimates that since 2010, the number of flu-related hospitalizations among children younger than 5â€‰years of age has ranged from 7,000 to 26,000 in the United States, with approximately 600 deaths in the past 5 years (

This is likely due to differences in progression, pathogenesis, and cause of mortality between influenza virus and coronavirus infections. With seasonal flu, mortality is in large part the result of secondary infections, including those by bacterial pneumonia, and of exacerbations of underlying chronic conditions (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). With SARS and MERS, mortality is the result of severe pulmonary inflammation and sepsis induced by the virus resulting in eventual organ failure (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). We hypothesize that one reason that children are protected against viral infections that induce sepsis is their more recent and more frequent exposures to live attenuated vaccines (MMR, rotovirus, smallpox, chickenpox, BCG) that can also induce the trained suppressive MDSCs that limit inflammation and sepsis.
