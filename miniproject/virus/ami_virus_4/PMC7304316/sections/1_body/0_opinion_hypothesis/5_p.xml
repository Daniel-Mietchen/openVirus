<p>As a response to this hypothesis along with the supportive rationale and considerable observational data supporting the hypothesis, we have proposed a randomized clinical trial to be performed with MMR in New Orleans for high-risk health care workers and first responders. In addition, we have been awarded a Fast Grant (as part of Emergent Ventures at the Mercatus Center, George Mason University) to investigate the level of efficacy of MMR versus that of BCG in a nonhuman primate model of COVID-19 infection. If our hypothesis is correct, MMR (booster) vaccination in adults represents a “low-risk–high-reward” preventive measure to save lives during a critical period of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
