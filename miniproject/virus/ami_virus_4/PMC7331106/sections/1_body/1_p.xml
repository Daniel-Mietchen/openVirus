<p>The COVID-19 pandemic raised serious alarms regarding the worldâ€™s preparedness to deal with such pandemics. Concerns about poorer countries and their ability to adequately respond to such biohazards are significant. The African continent, with its history of slavery, colonialism and exploited resources, makes it extremely vulnerable to threats of this nature. Although not entirely new to Africa, viral epidemics have affected the continent in recent years with Ebola and HIV among them, albeit with different modes of transmission. There is also concern about the extent that climate change, which is largely human-induced, is putting more countries, especially in Africa, at risk for the transmission of climate-sensitive infectious diseases. This is a sad irony, considering that Africa contributes minimally to global climate change but is likely to be hardest hit by its effects.</p>
