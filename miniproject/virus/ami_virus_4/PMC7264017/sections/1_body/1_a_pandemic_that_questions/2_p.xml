<p id="para0002">Criticality studies deal with the risk of supply disruption and the vulnerability of a system to this risk and usually concern rare geological resources (
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">Graedel and Reck, 2015</xref>). The pandemics revealed the criticality of global supply chains could also concern usual commodities. Indeed, the first lockdown imposed in China in February revealed the dependency of the world economy to Chinese production as supply shortages related to metals, textiles, plastics, car parts, electronics, medicine and other goods for which China is the main world exporter occurred. After mid-March, many countries around the world imposed lockdown measures and production output went down in these countries reducing the demand on the parts produced in China. Health commodities experience an opposite trend with an increasing demand in all countries, especially Western countries where the absence of mask wearing habits and the lack of preparedness led to important mismatches between the supply and the demand for masks, medical gowns, disinfectant products, chemical products necessary for PCR tests and breathing apparatus. Critical studies are thus necessary to identify for all types of commodities the current vulnerabilities of supply chains, proposed more resilient ones and design more sustainable trade-off between local and global supply chains.
