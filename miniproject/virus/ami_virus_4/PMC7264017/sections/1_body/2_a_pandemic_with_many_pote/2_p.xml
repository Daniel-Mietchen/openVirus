    <bold>In industrial and service sectors</bold>, currently work-in-progress stocks in industries or service sectors cannot reach the market increasing storage costs and the risk of physical loss and obsolescence inventories. This issue is particularly important for companies producing perishable products such as restaurants and companies not using just-on-time logistics organization.

    <bold>In the agriculture sector</bold>, the current system is strongly dependent on temporary workers for the harvest of crops. With lockdown measures, the impossibility for these workers to access agricultural fields can result in food losses whereas the disruption of global supply chain may lead to the starvation of the many developing countries dependent on imports for their food supply.

    <bold>In the energy sector,</bold> reduction of commuting and industrial activities endorsed by lockdown measures may reduce overall energy consumption. On the other hand, the increase in the time spent at home is associated with an increase in the demand of electricity, gas and heat of households for space cooling/heating and household appliances. Besides, with telework suddenly becoming the norm, the pressure on internet connections and data centers increased and so did the associated energy consumption. The carbon content of electricity mix for each country will be determinant to evaluate the effect associated with the increase of these indoor activities.

    <bold>In the transportation sector</bold>, passenger transportation almost stopped during the lockdown, but home delivery of goods and food products increased so that the overall effect on air pollution remain unclear. Besides, even after the end of lockdown measures, social distancing will remain the norm favoring personal cars over collective means of transportation.

    <bold>In the waste management sector</bold>, reduction in industrial activities may lead to a diminution of industrial wastes. However, household wastes may increase due to increased home cooking and an increased demand of home delivery. In addition to household behavioral changes, movements from main residence to secondary residences observed in countries such as France before the enforcement of lockdown measures by authorities may add pressure to rural waste management capacities. Finally, the disposable nature of masks and medical gowns raise the issue of hazardous waste management capacities. Developing countries are particularly at risk as the absence of proper waste management of these hazardous waste may further spread the virus.

    <bold>Regarding material stocks</bold>, it should be noted that contrary to earthquakes, floods, volcanoes eruption, and other natural disasters, the pandemic did not destroy any capital assets but only slowed down human flows and the processing of materials within the economy. In other words, capacity utilization of capital assets remains low as long as social distancing measures are in place but may come back to normal level at the end of the sanitary crisis. However, if the loss of income and consequent unemployment induced by the pandemics further contract the demand, the sanitary crisis may degenerate in an economic crisis leading to the obsolescence of capital assets and a degradation of the material stocks.

    <bold>Regarding social innovation</bold>, the disruption of global supply chain has put in the frontline Fab lab and 3D printing for the local fabrication of masks and other health commodities and the use of substitution materials: cloth face mask made from pillowcases or 100% cotton t-shirts, and snorkeling masks turned into ventilators for hospitals (CDC,

    <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">Nicholson et al., 2020</xref>). The economic viability of these productions in normal economic conditions is nonetheless doubtful and require investigation. The same can be claimed for telework whose large deployment during the sanitary crisis is a unique social experience, especially in countries like Japan where the pre-crisis use of telework is inexistent. The pandemics is a unique opportunity to better capture the strengths and weaknesses of these new organizations to see how they could contribute to the sustainability of our societies in normal conditions.
