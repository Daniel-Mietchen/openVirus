<p id="par0065">This current outbreak has highlighted that: 1) CoV diversity is much more complex that realized pre-2002, 2) CoV reservoirs are diverse, not geographically constrained globally and some have the potential for rapid and distant global transit like bats and birds 3) Some CoV found in animal reservoirs are similar to known human epidemic strains, 4) genetic and antigenic diversity may make broad-spectrum therapeutics difficult to design and 5) broad-spectrum therapies effective against currently known CoV as well as those that may emerge in the future are desperately needed. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is the global public health emergency we have been predicting and preparing for since the advent of SARS-CoV yet still we are not adequately prepared.</p>
