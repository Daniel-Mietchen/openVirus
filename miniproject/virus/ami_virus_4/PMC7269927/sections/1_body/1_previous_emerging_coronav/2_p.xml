<p id="par0035">With the recognition of the potential for CoV emergence from wild animal reservoirs came the realization that we lacked a deep understanding of CoV diversity as well as animal reservoir ecology. Coupled with the advent of deep sequencing technology as SARS-CoV was emerging, various metagenomic surveys have drastically changed our understanding of the CoV sequence diversity, geospatial distribution, and animal reservoir diversity. These surveys have found CoV sequences in bats in the North and South America, Europe, Asia, Australiasia and Africa [
