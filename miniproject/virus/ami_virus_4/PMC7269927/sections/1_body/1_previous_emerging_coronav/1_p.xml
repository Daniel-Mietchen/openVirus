A new paradigm for human coronavirology was born with the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) in November 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. The epidemic strain of SARS-CoV, is believed to have emerged from a bat reservoir through a civet intermediate host in live animal markets and then spilled over into humans [

This notion of CoV emergence was further solidified with discovery of the novel highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012, which also likely emerged from an ancestral bat-CoV but through a camel intermediate host which continues to seed human MERS-CoV infections to this day [

 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Given the diversity and prevalence of CoV circulating among wild birds and mammals, it is not surprising that the potential for emerging CoV to cause severe disease outbreaks and epidemics is not limited to humans. In the past century, three porcine CoV have emerged. First in the 1970s with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), in 2012 with porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and in 2019 with severe acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV), which together have killed millions of piglets world-wide [

 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Like SARS-CoV, SADS-CoV is believed to have emerged from Chinese horseshoe bats [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Now, with the current emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the paradigm of CoV as a family with emergence potential and a consistent ability for spillover into new species to cause diseases never before seen has truly been solidified. Thus, while attempting to control the global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, we must prepare for the continual emergence of new coronavirus in the future.
