<p>Nursing homes for older adults in Italy have become high-risk locations for their residents, who, in addition to old age, have multiple comorbidities; the nursing home setting has witnessed a large number of deaths by COVID-19. The province of Bergamo, for example, recorded more than 600 deaths in 20 days (out of a total of 6,400 available beds), and 40% of the professionals working in these asylums were on sick leave or in isolation

Although not all deaths can be attributed to COVID-19 owing to the lack of diagnostic confirmation, the high number of deaths and the illness of professionals makes this association probable. On March 8, by means of a decree, without any prior scientific evidence, the political leaders of the Lombardy region appealed to those responsible for nursing homes for older adults to admit patients with less severe forms of COVID-19; the motive was to create space in hospitals and ICUs

 </xref>. As expected, most nursing homes did not respond to the call, fearing the spread of the virus to other older adults in these settings, but some did. The consequences of this decision have recently begun to be discussed in the Italian press, and the real impact needs to be evaluated. However, it is certain that older adults, especially the most weakened and confined in institutions such as nursing homes, are the most vulnerable and therefore, must be the most protected, even avoiding contact with their families to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
