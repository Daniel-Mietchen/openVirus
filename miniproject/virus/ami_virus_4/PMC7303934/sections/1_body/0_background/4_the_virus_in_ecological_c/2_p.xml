<p id="Par12">Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 arises from the intersection of biology with human behavior, culture, and the abiotic environment. The natural host for SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be bats. Most coronaviruses are found in regions with high diversity of bats, showing that coronaviruses have the capability to inhabit various species of bats, with high prevalence of host — an important evolutionary factor in emerging infectious disease [
