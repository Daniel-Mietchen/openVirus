<p id="Par11">Crucial features of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 are the central pathogenic stressors in the COVID-19 experience. Coronaviruses comprise an enveloped, single positive-strand RNA virus with spikes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] that are essential for viral entry into cells and that enable replication of the single strand RNA via RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase in the infected cytoplasm of the cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. At least eight strains of SARS-CoV-2 circulate around the world, giving clues to complex transmission patterns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For example, the L-type became more prevalent than the S-type strain of SARS-COV-2 after being declared the global pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 virus perhaps evolved and may create different outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Most COVID-19 cases are mild or asymptomatic; those individuals with no symptoms, however, can transmit the virus, a key feature of the biology of SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The peak of viral load concentration is estimated at approximately Day 5 of symptom onset with viral shedding through respiratory droplets or fecal matter. That those infected with SARS-CoV-2 might be contagious from a few days before symptoms begin to approximately 20â€‰days after symptoms appear [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] drives the primary preventive strategy of physical isolation as an attempt to stop or slow community transmission.
