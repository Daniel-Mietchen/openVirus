<p id="Par10">The peculiar, intersectional social and biological historical circumstances that bring virus and human together are crucial aspects of explaining viral infection in the context of these other dimensions. One especially well-suited paradigm for thinking about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 in this manner is the Critical Medical Ecology model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Distinct from other ways of integrative thinking (perhaps the Biopsychosocial Model, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or the Social Ecological Model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]), Critical Medical Ecology is a multidimensional, multilevel way of viewing pandemics comprehensively, rooted simultaneously in microbiology and in anthropology, with shared priority for the processes of evolution, context, unintended/unexpected consequences, stressors, homeostasis, adaptation, and power relationships — the main components of ecology, with attention to power dynamics that have widespread consequence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The spread and impact of SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19 differentially impacts cities; in fact, the nodes of the pandemic are cities, which can be viewed as similarly evolving, reacting, and adapting as entities like pathogens and humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The Critical Medical Ecology model — with its emphasis on multileveled factors from cell to society and experiences across sociocultural, biological, abiotic, and health care domains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) — is well-suited to, therefore, help conceptualize (as an 
 <italic>explanatory</italic> model) or to help plan for (as a 
 <italic>programmatic</italic> model) the factors, domains, and processes that surround SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, and urban areas.
