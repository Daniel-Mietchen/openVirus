<p id="Par15">While cities typically serve (or are perceived as serving) as resource-rich economic, transportation, and cultural hubs, the challenges of public health, medical care, and disease in urban areas are accentuated in the global COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of a cure or vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, isolation, quarantine, limiting community interaction, providing personal protective equipment for front-line providers, and social-physical distancing are the primary strategies available to interrupt or attenuate viral transmission [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and genomic analysis of the virus from different regions of the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] show that travelers from affected areas are the first points of contact for spreading infection before community transmission ensues. Viral transmission is further enabled in cities by the complex interaction of high population density, a heterogenous population, mass public transit systems such as buses and subways, unequal exposure to risk and virus, and also a higher rate of nosocomial transmission through over-crowded hospitals and healthcare facilities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The current “shelter in place” orders issued by governments are an almost unimaginable premise in metropolitan cities in that essential services supply chains (e.g., food, protective gear) can be disrupted or manipulated by differential purchasing power in the face of urban inequality, especially exacerbating the vulnerability of marginalized groups (including people living with disabilities, immigrants, and homeless) who frequently are not able to adhere to preventative guidelines [
