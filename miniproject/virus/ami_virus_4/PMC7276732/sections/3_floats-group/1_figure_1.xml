  <p>Differences in viral distribution among EDs and the general population. Comparison of the distribution of viruses within patients at pediatric hospitals and among a cohort of children and teenagers tested regularly irrespective of symptoms. The median age associated with specimens was the same for the hospital and cohort (4 y). We restricted the analysis to samples testing positive for a single respiratory virus at PedsED (258) and to samples taken from the children/teenagers cohort (257) within the same time period: October 2016 to April 2018. The pie chart on the right represents data from the pediatric hospitals rescaled by the likelihood of seeking care for a specific virus (Table 
   <xref rid="irv12753-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>), following the Bayes mapping reported in Methods. We did not consider RSV positivity in either dataset because children in the cohort did not include young infants, who are most subject to severe RSV infections. To estimate the relative proportion of viruses, we can disregard the numerator of the scaling factor and use
