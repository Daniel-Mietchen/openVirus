<p>Estimates of the seasonal average number of viral respiratory infections per individual were obtained by summing the weekly prevalence of new viral events in the cold/flu season (from October through April of both seasons: May through September were excluded due to limited participation of the cohort in specimen collection during summer months). We used the number of tests performed each week as the denominator, which accounted for missing weekly swabs among cohort participants.
