<p>Analysis of longitudinal data was conducted using the total number of positive samples, as well as the number of infection events. We defined an infection (or viral) event as a group of consecutive weekly specimens from a given individual that were positive for the same virus (allowing for a one‐week gap to account for false negatives and temporary low shedding). Medically attended illness (MA), sick days (HOME), and medicine uptake (MEDS) were defined as episodes in which the participants reported seeking care, staying home, or taking medicines for any respiratory symptoms, independent of the etiology. Medically attended ILI (MA ∩ ILI) was defined as episodes in which the participants reported seeking care with symptoms compatible with the US ILI definition. Fever was a self‐reported symptom, and no threshold was specified. Medically attended illnesses, sick days, and medicine uptake associated with a viral event were identified within −3/+7 days from any positive test date during an event in order to account for incubation time. We performed the analysis twice, including and excluding co‐infections, defined as samples testing positive for multiple respiratory viruses.</p>
