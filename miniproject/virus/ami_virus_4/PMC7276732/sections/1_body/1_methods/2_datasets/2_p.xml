<p>We used data from multiple datasets: a longitudinal cohort of NYC residents, a cross‐sectional sample of patients seeking care at three NYC pediatric hospitals, and respiratory surveillance data published by the NYC DOHMH. The longitudinal data were used to (a) quantify the impact of respiratory infection in the population in terms of number of infections, healthcare seeking behavior, and symptoms and (b) to evaluate medically attended cases as indicator of disease burden. Cross‐sectional (pediatric) hospital data were used for comparison with virus prevalence in the longitudinal cohort (children and teenager) population. The DOHMH surveillance data were used for comparison with the syndromic and viral data from the cohort.</p>
