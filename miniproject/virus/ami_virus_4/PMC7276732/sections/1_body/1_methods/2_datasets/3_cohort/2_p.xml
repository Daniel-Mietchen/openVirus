The study period spanned two years from October 2016 to April 2018 with some individuals enrolled for a single cold and flu season (October‐April) and others for the entire study period. Participants (or their guardians, if minors) had to provide informed consent after reading a detailed description of the study (CUMC IRB AAAQ4358). Nasopharyngeal swab specimens were collected weekly from each enrolled individual and tested for respiratory viruses. Further, participants completed daily self‐reports rating nine respiratory illness‐related symptoms (fever, chills, muscle pain, watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, cough, chest pain), which were recorded on a Likert scale (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The daily report also requested information on whether participants had sought medical attention, stayed home, or taken cold/flu‐related medications (both over‐the‐counter and antibiotics, that are not available in NYC without prescription) as a consequence of their listed symptoms. The longitudinal cohort was obtained using convenience sampling.
