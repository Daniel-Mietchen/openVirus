<p>All clinical laboratories that perform influenza testing on NYC residents and a large sample of NYC laboratory facilities licensed to perform influenza testing report results electronically to the DOHMH. These laboratories provide weekly data on the number of influenza tests requested, positive results by influenza type (when available), as well as data on RSV. Beginning with the 2017‚Äê2018 season, three NYC laboratories also provide the DOHMH test results for other respiratory viruses: adenovirus, coronavirus, HMPV, rhinovirus/enterovirus, and parainfluenza.

 </xref> All EDs in NYC report the weekly total number of ILI. We used DOHMH ILI and viral data and positivity data during the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 cold/flu seasons for comparison with the cohort data.
