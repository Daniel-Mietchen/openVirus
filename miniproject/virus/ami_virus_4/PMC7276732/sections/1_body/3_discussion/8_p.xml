<p>Data from our cohort showed that within a cold/flu season (October through April) individuals presented with 3‐4 respiratory viral infections on average. (Note, 24% of cohort samples were from children, 9% from teenagers, and the rest from adults below 65 years of age.) Among the many pathogens that cause respiratory symptoms, some (like influenza and HMPV) have been shown to be responsible for more severe infections.

 </xref> Our observations here support the hypothesis that the distribution of viral prevalence derived from healthcare‐based data is skewed toward more severe pathogens, possibly leading to mis‐estimation of the prevalence of infections in the broader population. The findings, validated through scaling using Bayes' theorem, showed that viruses producing more severe symptoms (influenza, HMPV) were overrepresented in the pediatric ED, whereas others, like coronavirus, were substantially underestimated in prevalence. Further, the substantive difference in prevalence among different types of parainfluenza between hospital and cohort suggests a milder symptom profile for PIV4, which is further corroborated by its reported high rate of seroprevalence in children and young adults despite less frequent isolation.
