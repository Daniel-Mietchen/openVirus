<p>Further, the exclusive use of ILI may not be appropriate for capturing medical visits for respiratory illnesses (any cause of disease). In fact, more than half of the medically attended respiratory illnesses reported within the cohort did not satisfy the definition of ILI, mostly because fever was not recorded in cases presenting with other severe symptoms (like cough, chest pain, and sore throat). This misalignment with ILI criteria may be partially due to self‐reporting of symptoms (fever was not necessarily measured) and to the definition of ILI that was specifically designed to capture the signal of influenza. The predictive power of MA‐ILI for influenza was in fact higher than for unspecified respiratory viral infections. We showed in a previous publication

 </xref> that systemic symptoms (such as fever, chest pain, and muscle pain) are twice more common in influenza and HMPV than the other respiratory viruses. However, a substantial number of severe influenza cases with atypical manifestations or which are simply not classifiable as ILI have been previously documented,
