 </xref> More interestingly, if medically attended ILI is used to estimate respiratory viral infection within the broader population, we find that 95% of infections (and 79% of flu cases) would be unobserved. This result was not only due to the preponderance of asymptomatic infections: Among subjects who tested positive for any virus and developed respiratory symptoms classifiable as ILI, 64% still did not seek medical attention. These observations of limited sensitivity and PPV (positive predicted value) serve as a warning against using ILI in isolation as a proxy index for respiratory virus or influenza prevalence in the population.
