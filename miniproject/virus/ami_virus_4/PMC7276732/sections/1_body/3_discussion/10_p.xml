<p>Clearly, healthcare‐based surveillance is the primary feasible approach for monitoring the prevalence of respiratory viruses regularly and in real time. It also consistently provides critical data supporting infectious disease forecasting efforts, especially for influenza.

 </xref> However, active longitudinal sampling for respiratory virus infections and care‐seeking behaviors could be used to document important supplementary information largely missed by standard surveillance. This alternate sampling provides a unique picture of respiratory virus prevalence in the community and demonstrates that most respiratory virus infections are not documented as ILI, that rates of seeking clinical care vary by virus, and that many infected individuals seeking care do not meet the definition of ILI. Furthermore, the longitudinal approach can be useful for quantifying potential inappropriate population behavior during respiratory illness (eg, antibiotic uptake without medical consultation).
