<p>One of the major limitations of this study is the sample size: Larger longitudinal studies would be required to characterize with greater confidence the likelihood of seeking medical care for individual viruses. Indeed, better estimates could be obtained with a larger sample size by distinguishing among different age‐groups that show different healthcare‐seeking behaviors

 </xref> Moreover, as a consequence of the convenience sampling employed here, groups more at risk for serious complications (infants, elders, and immunocompromised) were not represented in our cohort. The fact that some individuals were connected (children attending the same daycare and their family, adults working in the same environment) is another potential bias, as some infections may have been directly transmitted among individuals. Another important limitation is the method used to identify infections: In assessing the potential association between medically attended infections and viral positivity, we considered tests performed within the week, possibly missing some positive results due to the short duration of some respiratory infections. Moreover, we could not account for viruses not included in the viral panel assay.
