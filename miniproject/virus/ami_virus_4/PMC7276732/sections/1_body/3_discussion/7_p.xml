<p>The longitudinal sampling approach used here also provides the opportunity to investigate the burden of asymptomatic infections, which standard respiratory surveillance does not document. The preponderance of asymptomatic infections is often overlooked because they do not constitute a direct burden for society; however, these infections likely represent an indirect burden by boosting population‚Äêscale transmission rates (ie, there are additional, asymptomatic contagious persons), helping maintain pathogens within communities, and spawning symptomatic infections (ie, through transmission to individuals who experience more severe outcomes). Further, public health measures such as vaccination, school closure, crowd gathering control, and isolation of infected individuals can only be fully and accurately evaluated following quantification of the total extent of respiratory infection and the role of asymptomatic spreaders.</p>
