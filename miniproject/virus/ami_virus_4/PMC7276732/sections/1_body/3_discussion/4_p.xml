<p>Medically attended ILI has been largely used as a proxy for respiratory infections and most frequently for influenza infections alone. Here, we showed that medically attended ILI is a noisy indicator for the burden of respiratory viruses and for influenza in isolation. In our longitudinal cohort, the majority of ILI events would have gone undetected as most people simply did not seek medical help. Moreover, during weeks in which participants sought care for ILI, 32% tested negative for respiratory viral infection and 82% tested negative for influenza. Among those 32% testing negative, ILI symptoms could have been due to different pathogens (bacteria or viruses not included in the RVP) or to infections manifesting for too few days to be captured by our weekly testing.</p>
