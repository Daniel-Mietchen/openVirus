Estimates of healthcare seeking behavior are typically obtained via telephone or Internet‐based surveys and have been used to develop probabilistic models that transform counts of laboratory confirmed cases to population‐level estimates of prevalence.

However, telephone and Internet survey‐based estimates of healthcare seeking behavior are subject to several limitations. First, the surveys are non‐specific: Self‐reported ILI is often used to estimate the burden of influenza. Second, participants in the surveys are typically asked retrospectively to report respiratory illnesses experienced within the last year, a long time‐span for memory recall that can yield misreporting.
