<p>To estimate the total impact of respiratory illness on the population, multiplicator models based on telephone and web surveys have been used, such as during the 2009 influenza pandemic.

 </xref> In New York City (NYC), a survey conducted by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) estimated that each Emergency Department‐attended ILI corresponds to roughly 60 illnesses in the (adult) community.

 </xref> Both survey‐ and web‐based approaches have some important limitations. First, they overlook asymptomatic and mild infections, which are important from an epidemiological vantage. Second, despite being nonspecific, self‐reported ILI is often inappropriately interpreted as an indicator of influenza infection. Third, healthcare‐seeking behavior for respiratory illness is highly variable and is dependent on healthcare policy, socioeconomic background, severity of symptoms possibly related to virus type, and the influence of media and community.
