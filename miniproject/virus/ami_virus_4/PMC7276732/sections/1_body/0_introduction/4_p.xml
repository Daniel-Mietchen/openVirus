<p>Presently, respiratory surveillance in the United States is performed at local scales, is healthcare‐based, and is typically syndromic or viral.

 </xref> Syndromic surveillance was established mainly to capture influenza activity through data collection on patients seeking care for respiratory symptoms within select facilities. Patient complaints classifiable as influenza‐like illness (ILI, formally defined in the United States as fever plus sore throat and/or cough) are documented regardless of laboratory diagnosis. ILI is a convenient measure and is routinely used to capture seasonal influenza trends in many countries. However, it has been shown that syndromic diagnosis alone cannot establish the etiology of respiratory manifestations because many respiratory viral infections present with similar symptoms.

 </xref> Hence, many influenza surveillance systems and predictive models supplement syndromic surveillance with laboratory‐confirmed diagnosis performed on patient specimens, that is, viral surveillance.

 </xref> However, the number of specimens collected for laboratory assay and reported to public health officials make up a very small subset of the total cases, and many collaborating laboratories test exclusively for influenza.
