<p>Here, we used a longitudinal study approach to estimate the burden of viral respiratory infections at the population level and to evaluate the typical indicators used by surveillance systems. This analysis is part of a broader study intending to document the prevalence and impact of viral respiratory infections on the NYC population. In a previously published analysis, we showed that more than two‐thirds of respiratory infections are asymptomatic and healthy individuals typically experience multiple infections per year, with children and their caretakers presenting more infections per years than other adults.

 </xref> Here, on one hand, we were interested in measuring the viral agents captured by ILI (influenza‐like illness) and how well medically attended ILI reflects the burden of viral respiratory infections, of influenza alone, and more generally of respiratory disease in the broader population. On the other hand, by using a very unique dataset, we endeavored to quantify the prevalence of respiratory viral infections and illnesses among the general population and to capture healthcare seeking behavior.
