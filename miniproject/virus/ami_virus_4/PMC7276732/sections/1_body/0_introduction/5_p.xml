<p>Syndromic and viral surveillance only draw upon medically attended cases and are neither designed to capture mild or asymptomatic respiratory infections nor to represent the large part of the population that chooses not to seek care. Reports on syndromic and viral surveillance have to be interpreted as ratios (eg, the number of patients with classifiable ILI among total visits within reporting facilities; the number of virus positive specimens among all specimens tested) and thus do not give a broad estimate of prevalence of disease or infections in the general population. In contrast, serology can be performed to assess rates of antibody production in the broader population against a particular virus. However, serological studies are retrospective, and thus unsuitable for estimating prevalence in a timely manner, and indirect, and thus not optimal for viruses eliciting short‚Äêlived immunity.
