<p>Respiratory infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally and impose a high burden on economic productivity and medical and public health systems (hospitalizations, visits, therapeutics). A variety of viruses and bacteria regularly generate respiratory infections in humans, and specific pharmacological interventions are limited to vaccines, antivirals and antibiotics for a small subset of these pathogens. New and improved vaccines and therapeutics for many common respiratory viruses—respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV)—are currently under evaluation or development; however, because many infected persons do not seek clinical care, the true burden of each of these viruses is not known. This circumstance complicates predictive quantification of the cost effectiveness of each intervention and its ability to control targeted pathogens in the broader population.</p>
