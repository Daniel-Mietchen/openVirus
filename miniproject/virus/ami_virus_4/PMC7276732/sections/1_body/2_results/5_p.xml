<p>Table 
 <xref rid="irv12753-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows that only a small fraction of the cohort self‐reporting ILI sought medical care: 71% of 159 ILI episodes went unattended. Table 
 <xref rid="irv12753-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> also presents the error we would commit in using medically attended ILI (MA‐ILI) as a proxy for viral respiratory infections: Only 2/3 of MA‐ILI were associated with a positive test for (any) respiratory virus within the same week. When restricting to influenza infections, we found that influenza only accounted for 18% of medically attended ILI. Conversely, among cohort participants testing positive for respiratory virus, only 5% of 562 cases both reported seeking medical attention and had symptoms classifiable as ILI. This percentage increases to 36% when conditioning to infections associated with an ILI. Moreover, medically attended ILI did not account for all medically attended respiratory illness: In 54% of 99 medically attended cases, the respiratory symptoms were severe enough to seek care, yet not classifiable as ILI (mostly due to the absence of fever).
