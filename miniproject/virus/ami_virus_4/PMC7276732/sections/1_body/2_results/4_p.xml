 <xref rid="irv12753-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> (see 
 <xref rid="irv12753-sec-0002" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>), we obtained more similarly aligned relative distributions of virus types between the cohort and hospital settings (Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12753-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Figure 
 <xref rid="irv12753-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> for analysis including co‐infections). The relative prevalence of type 4 PIV among all PIV differed significantly between the cohort (where PIV4 was the dominant type with 11 counts among 27 PIV events total excluding co‐infections) and hospital data (where PIV4 accounted for only 6 of 48 PIV‐positive test results excluding co‐infections).
