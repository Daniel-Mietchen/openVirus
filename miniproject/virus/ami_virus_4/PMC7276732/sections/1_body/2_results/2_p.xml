Depending on the virus, 4%‐20% of infections resulted in an individual seeking medical attention (MA), 7%‐44% were associated with one or more sick days, and 24%‐59% were associated with medicine intake (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12753-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="irv12753-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>) within −3/+7 days of testing positive
 <italic>.</italic> Similar results were obtained when including co‐infections (Table 
 <xref rid="irv12753-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>). HRV was associated with the most medical visits, due to its high prevalence, but influenza and HMPV were most likely to result in medical care and sick days (chi‐squared test comparing influenza and HMPV to other respiratory viruses

 <italic>.</italic> There were 39 reports of participants taking antibiotics (irrespective of associated RVP results); however, this use of antibiotics was associated with a reported medical consultation in only 22 instances and 16 patients reported taking antibiotics for only 1 or 2 days. Further, participants tested positive for a respiratory virus in 17 of the 39 instances (44%) of reported antibiotic intake.
