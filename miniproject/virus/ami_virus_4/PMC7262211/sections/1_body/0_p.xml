   <bold>The known:</bold> Corticosteroid therapy did not improve clinical outcomes for patients with SARS or MERS, and the WHO recommends against treating patients with COVID‐19 with corticosteroids, although medical societies in China recommend their prudent use.
  </p>
  <p>
   <bold>The new:</bold> Corticosteroid therapy is widely employed to treat patients with COVID‐19 in Wuhu, China, but we found no evidence of clinical benefit for those without acute respiratory distress syndrome. Virus clearance may be slower in people with chronic HBV infections.
  </p>
  <p>
   <bold>The implications:</bold> The value of corticosteroid therapy for patients with COVID‐19 should be reconsidered, and the effect of other infections on viral clearance investigated.
