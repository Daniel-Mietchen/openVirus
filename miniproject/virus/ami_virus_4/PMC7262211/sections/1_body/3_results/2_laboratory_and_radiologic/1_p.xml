C‐reactive protein (CRP) concentration exceeded 10 mg/L in 20 patients (reference range, &lt; 3.0 mg/L), while procalcitonin levels were within the normal range (0.1–0.5 ng/mL) in 29 patients. In six patients, alanine aminotransferase levels were elevated (≥ 40 U/L), as was lactate dehydrogenase in five patients (≥ 225 U/L). The creatine kinase level was elevated in two patients (≥ 175 U/L); while cardiac troponin levels were normal in all patients (reference range &lt; 0.5 ng/mL) (
