<p>Our observational study was undertaken in the Second People's Hospital of Wuhu and Yijishan Hospital, the two designated hospitals for patients with COVID‐19 in Wuhu, Anhui province, about 500 km from Wuhan. The two tertiary teaching hospitals (4000 beds total) are the only units authorised to admit infectious patients with COVID‐19 in Wuhu. We reviewed the records of patients admitted to the hospitals with the diagnosis of COVID‐19 during 24 January – 24 February 2020. Laboratory confirmation of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection was made by the local Centre for Disease Control, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) as reported previously.
