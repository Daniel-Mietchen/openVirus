<p>Our sample size was small, and the patients included in our study were relatively young (median age, 39 years) and had mild disease, limiting the generalisability of our findings to patients without ARDS, the main threat and real challenge in clinical practice. Our small sample size and the observational nature of our study also means that many confounders may have influenced our results. Despite these limitations, our study provides early findings in the context of a rapidly evolving situation.</p>
