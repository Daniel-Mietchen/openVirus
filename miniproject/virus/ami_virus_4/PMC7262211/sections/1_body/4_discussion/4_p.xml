<p>Evidence for the efficacy of drugs used for treating patients with COVID‐19 is derived from research in patients with SARS, MERS, or influenza, and from laboratory studies.
 <xref rid="mja250577-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> The small sample in our observational study precludes us from drawing firm conclusions about these treatments. A recent retrospective observational study that compared treating patients with COVID‐19 with umifenovir and interferon alfa inhalation, lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon alfa inhalation, or interferon alfa inhalation alone did not find any statistically significant differences in virus clearance time or duration of symptoms.
