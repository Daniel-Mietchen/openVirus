<p>Patients with COVID‐19 are often treated with a corticosteroid despite the lack of clinical evidence for the efficacy of such treatment. In our study, 11 of 31 patients received corticosteroid treatment, a proportion similar to that reported by an earlier study.
 <xref rid="mja250577-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> Systematic use of corticosteroid treatment is even higher in critically ill patients with COVID‐19, as many as 70% of these patients receiving it.
 <xref rid="mja250577-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> In our study, patients treated with a corticosteroid had more clinical symptoms, a higher inflammation index, and more abnormalities on chest CT, indicating that its use was related to the severity of symptoms on presentation. This practice is consistent with that reported by another study, in which 33% of patients with symptoms of COVID‐19 for more than 10 days had received a corticosteroid, but only 17% of those who had had symptoms for fewer than 10 days.
