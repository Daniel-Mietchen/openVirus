 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>], supporting the hypothesis that clinically evident CoVID-19 is less frequent and milder in the paediatric population [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The data presented here, collected within the context of an organized surveillance programme, corroborate previous observations and underline the need to understand better the clinical spectrum of CoVID-19 in the paediatric population.
