<p id="p0010">The Lombardy Region (10 million inhabitants) in Northern Italy has recently been involved in the largest CoVID-19 (coronavirus infectious disease-2019) outbreak outside China. Indeed, since Thursday, 20 February, when the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was recorded in our region, up to 15 March, 13 272 CoVID-19 cases have been registered. Among those, 24% (3220/13 272) have been detected at our Regional Reference Laboratory (Molecular Virology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Pavia, Italy). The Lombardy Region policy to combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 includes the screening of all symptomatic suspected cases and their contacts, according to the World Health Organization case definitions. The nasal swabs from all suspected cases were collected during the medical examination and the strategy for sampling in adults and children has been the same.</p>
