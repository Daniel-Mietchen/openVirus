<p id="p0035">Indeed, all other viral respiratory infections are mostly concentrated in the paediatric population. CoVID-19 affects children and young adults less severely than the middle-aged or aged population, which contrasts with experience from previous viral pandemics, including influenza A. Furthermore, other respiratory viral infections, including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, measles, picornaviruses and other coronaviruses, tend to cause more severe disease in the paediatric population. A common explanation for this phenomenon is the lack of pre-existing immunity to most of these viral families, with subsequent maturation of the immunological repertoire after each subsequent exposure to viral pathogens. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, lack of antecedent immunity to viral pathogens does not appear to be detrimental for severe disease. Recently, an age-dependent expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2), has been demonstrated in the nasal epithelium [
