  <title>Discussion</title>
  <p>The adapted MIS successfully influenced the reduction of social contacts within the Health Center Nis. The need for the arrival of children and their parents to receive appropriate health certificates for the school enrolment is reduced. The therapy of chronic patients has been prolonged for 6 months via an electronic prescription. An online service for the communication between patients and the chosen physicians is provided. Possible social contacts and exposure to the viral environment of patients are reduced by making appointments in extended slots and at determined physical locations. Patients are notified per SMS or email about the availability of chosen and physician on duty. The social distancing of patients and physicians is also established by sending laboratory analyses per email or SMS. Keeping the central registry for COVID-19 is enabled throughout the country.</p>
