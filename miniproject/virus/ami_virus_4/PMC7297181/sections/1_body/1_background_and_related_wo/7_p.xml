<p id="par0090">Due to the exponential growth of the COVID-19 disease it is crucial to develop triage protocols in order to identify and isolate patients suspected of having the COVID-19 infection in COVID-19 temporarily hospitals or special departments in existing health institutions for the isolation of patients. In this way the disruption of normal medical care would be mitigated. A successful protocol for triage during a pandemic requires a more detailed planning, which involves a constant data collection: about the patient (demographic and medical data), data about availability of healthcare resources [

Based on the results, during first 16 days of use symptomatic patient triage dispositions were as follows: 193 emergent (24 %), 193 urgent (24 %), 99 nonurgent (12 %), 329 self-care (40 %) and sensitivity for detecting emergency-level care was 87.5 %. According to the research findings the integration of patient self-triage tools into electronic health record (EHR) systems has a great potential in improving the triage efficiency and preventing unnecessary visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.
