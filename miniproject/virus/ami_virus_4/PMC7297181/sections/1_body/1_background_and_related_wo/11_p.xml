The researchers emphasized the importance of new generation of information technologies, such as internet of things (IoT), mobile Internet, cloud computing, big data, 5â€¯G, microelectronics, and artificial intelligence in order to build smart healthcare. Furthermore, Big Data Computational Epidemiology is a new and exciting multidisciplinary area that uses computational models and big data for identifying and controlling the spatiotemporal spread of disease through populations (e.g. the H1N1 influenza) [
