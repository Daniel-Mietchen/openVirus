<p id="par0095">The estimate of effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic was conducted [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan were used and adapted in presence of school and workplace closures as well as the general reduction in mixing in the community. Using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model the authors simulated the ongoing trajectory of the epidemic. They fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters and investigated the age distribution of cases. Lifting of the control measures, such as allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way was also simulated. The effects of returning to work at the beginning of March or April were investigated. Based on the results, physical distancing measures showed to be most effective if staggered return to work happened at the beginning of April, which reduced the average number of cases by more than 92 %. The authors summed up that if restrictions maintained until April, they would delay the peak of epidemic. Sudden lifting of measures could provoke an earlier secondary peak. Such a scenario can be avoided by relaxing the measures gradually.
