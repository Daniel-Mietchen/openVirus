<p id="par0125">The city of Nis is the second largest city by land area and population in Serbia and represents the second huge center of disease in RS during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is only one health center in Nis which besides the central facility has 63 branches on the territory of Nis district. The HCN is the largest primary healthcare institution in RS and in the Balkans as per the number of patients who gravitate towards it (about half a million). More than 10 years MIS MEDIS.NET is intensively used in the HCN (since 2009 to date). The adaptation and extension of MIS MEDIS.NET in response to the pandemic is done especially for the needs of the HCN. During the adaptation of MEDIS.NET the data from the HCN database were used. That immense amount of structured data enabled the identification and division of several groups of patients who were most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic (

 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">2</xref> ), as well as the development of additional software modules, which help healthcare workers to proactively act in the suppression of pandemic. Before the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic MIS MEDIS.NET did not have specifically developed software functionalities (modules, subsystems) which would help healthcare workers and patients to combat seasonal and exceptional pandemics.
