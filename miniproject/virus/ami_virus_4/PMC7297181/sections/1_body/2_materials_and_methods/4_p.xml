<p id="par0130">The algorithm of triage of patients for the care of patients in critical conditions during the flu pandemic which utilizes Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] was used for this research. This triage algorithm has 4 main components: inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, minimum qualifications for survival and a prioritization tool. Guidance for making triage decisions during the first days to weeks of the influenza pandemic, if the critical care system becomes overloaded, was provided by the algorithm. The triage algorithm for the needs of the COVID-19 pandemic was adapted and implemented in the 
 <italic>Module for Smart Patients Triage (MSPT)</italic> in MIS MEDIS.NET as a questionnaire. The Box 2 contains detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria in the triage protocol for critical care during the influenza pandemic [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Two items were added in the inclusion criteria section before the existing item A in the Box 2. These items are 
 <italic>1 - Contact with COVID-19 positive person</italic>, 
 <italic>2 - COVID-19 positive test</italic>. The item 
 <italic>Kidney failure</italic> was added in the exclusion criteria section under subsection I 
 <italic>- End-stage organ failure meeting the following criteria</italic>. For each patient, physicians receive a digital questionnaire in EHR [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] that corresponds to the suggested items in the algorithm. After completing the questionnaire with medical data the SOFA score is received, based on which the action and patient priority are determined.
