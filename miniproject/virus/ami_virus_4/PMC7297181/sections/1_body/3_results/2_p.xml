<p id="par0135">Since social distancing is one of the most efficient methods for the suppression of coronavirus certain modules of MIS MEDIS.NET were adjusted and the new ones were developed. The main objective was to equip MIS MEDIS.NET with well-developed and adjusted modules, which would further assist in the implementation of social distancing. Through the use of those modules the following results were achieved: the exposure to the coronavirus of vulnerable groups was minimized, the interaction based on the patient to patient and patient to healthcare worker relationship was reduced, the configurable questionnaire for fast patient triage was developed, the online communication between patients and physicians was established. In the continuation, modules from MIS MEDIS.NET which are most relevant to the coronavirus are presented. In the section that follows, it is also presented how these modules respond during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially during the first weeks since the introduction of the emergency state in RS.</p>
