 <italic>LIS</italic> (
 <italic>Laboratory Information System</italic>) is a special IS, integrated with MIS MEDIS.NET. As a separate extension of 
 <italic>LIS, Result Sending Module</italic> is developed. 
 <italic>Result Sending Module</italic> aims at sending results to patients vie email or SMS. The increased degree of social distancing was achieved in this way, since patients did not have to collect results of biochemical analyses at the health center in person.
