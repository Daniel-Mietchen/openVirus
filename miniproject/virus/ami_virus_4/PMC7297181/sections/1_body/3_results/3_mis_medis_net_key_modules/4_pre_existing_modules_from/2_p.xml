 <italic>Smart EHR Module</italic> enhances MIS MEDIS.NET making it a more advanced version. One of the functionalities of the module is the clustering of patients based on the demographic and medical data by using the DNN [
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Logistic regression [
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], Random Forest [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and DNN are used for the implementation of subsystem for the smart identification and assessment of patients who will not come to the appointment with the chosen physician or/and to expensive diagnostic examinations for which a patient needs to wait, sometimes even for several months. This system has enabled patients to make appointments in overlapping slots [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] during the COVID-19 pandemic. For chronic patients [
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] during a pandemic, a special submodule is used which suggests to general practitioners a possible therapy with the amounts of a medicine and the periodicity of taking a medicine, as well as possible referrals for specialist examinations [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Due to the use of new medicines during the treatment of infected patients with the COVID-19 infection, a subsystem is used as an assistance, which warns the physician whether the prescribed therapy corresponds to the established diagnosis. The subsystem also informs about the possible contraindications with other medicines the patient is using. A smart mobile reminder for taking the prescribed therapy [
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] helps elderly and chronic patients during the pandemic not to forget to take the therapy at the predefined time. The developed subsystem for the use of existing data from MIS MEDIS.NET in the education of students at the Faculty of Medicine and newly employed workers, as well as for medical research [
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], enables tracking and studying the COVID-19 disease at this stage. 
 <italic>Open Data Service</italic> is used for obtaining the demographic data from available open data sets in Serbia [
