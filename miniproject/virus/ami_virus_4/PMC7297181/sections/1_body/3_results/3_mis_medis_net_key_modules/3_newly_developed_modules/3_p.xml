<p id="par0150">The algorithm of patients’ triage who came to the health center for an examination during the state of emergency in the RS and the pandemic of COVID-19 is presented in the 
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> . The algorithm shows the modules of MIS MEDIS.NET which were used during triage of patients, one of them being 
 <italic>MSPT</italic>, which is applied for triage at the waiting room. In 
 <italic>MSPT</italic> chronic and acute patients are classified into 4 groups according to the degree of urgency (Green, Yellow, Red, Blue), which is calculated using the developed dynamic questionnaire (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ) according to the SOFA score [
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] adapted for COVID-19. The questionnaires contain questions which can be answered after the laboratory analyses have been done and the results have been obtained, so it is first necessary to complete chosen biochemical analyses. There is a predefined set of biochemical analyses for COVID-19 cases. Using deep neural network (DNN) and the data from the database, the DNN model was developed and trained for the recommendation of biochemical analyses to physicians. Besides the COVID-19 predefined set of biochemical analyses, the system using the DNN developed and trained model, automatically offers additional biochemical analyses. Offered analyses depend on patient’s current vital parameters and medical history. The physician at the end decides which recommended analyses can be accepted and also has the possibility to add new analyses. For the creation of dynamic questionnaires in MIS MEDIS.NET a special tool was developed, which enables the creation of a higher number of questionnaires. The questionnaires appear both in 
 <italic>MSPT</italic> and the EHR. The emergence of questionnaires in some modules of MIS MEDIS.NET depends on the sets of privileges per modules.
