<p id="par0155">Questions in the questionnaire can be dynamically adjusted via the specialized questionnaire creation tool. A set of questions is created for each questionnaire. The type of question is determined for each question (multiple-choice, free text, or numeric field). The difficulty level is determined for each answer to the multiple-choice question. Minimum and maximum question difficulty levels are defined for each question. For each questionnaire one or more decision-making thresholds are adjusted, based on which the condition of a patient is estimated after the completed questionnaire. Based on the score achieved and values of adjusted decision-making thresholds an appropriate system notification is created.</p>
