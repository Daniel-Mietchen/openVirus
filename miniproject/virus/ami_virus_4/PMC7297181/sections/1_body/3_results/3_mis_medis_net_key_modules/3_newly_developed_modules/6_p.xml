 <italic>Module for Children Online Enrollment in Schools (MCOES)</italic> enabled integration of MIS MEDIS.NET with 
 <italic>Republic Services for School Enrollment</italic> which was developed by the Ministry of Education of RS. In this way medical certificates for school enrollment of pre-school and school children from EHR are automatically delivered to the 
 <italic>Republic Services for School Enrollment</italic>. Since children and their parents do not have to come to the health center to collect paper certificates as it was earlier the standard procedure, their degree of social distancing increased.
