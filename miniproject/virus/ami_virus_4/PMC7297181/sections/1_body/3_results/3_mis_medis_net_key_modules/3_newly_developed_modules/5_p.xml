 <italic>COVID-19 Scheduling Module</italic> is developed during the pandemic. This module enables smart scheduling of checkup appointments to certain identified critical groups of patients with huge enough time slots. Huge time slots enable contact avoidance of patients who belong to vulnerable groups at the health center. The system proposes the most suitable times of appointments for groups of patients identified according to following parameters: chronic patient, chronic diagnosis, acute state, age, gender, mobility of patients, risk factors, the date of previous visit.
