 <italic>Modul for Chronic Patients</italic> was created to keep the record about chronic patients. The module represents the register of chronic patients with established diagnosis and established therapy. The register enables fast check whether some patient has an established chronic diagnosis. For a chronic patient the whole course of treatment is shown. The lack of this module is currently its local availability (the register at the HCN). This module is of great importance in the triage of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.
