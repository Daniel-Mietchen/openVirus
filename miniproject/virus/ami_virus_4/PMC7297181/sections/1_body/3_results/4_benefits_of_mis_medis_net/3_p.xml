 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. the most significant decrease in the number of patients’ arrivals can be noticed from the 13th pandemic week of 2020, in comparison with the number of patients’ arrivals during the same weeks of previous years. It was achieved by increasing the degree of social distancing. Due to the reduced number of patients, the number of specialist referrals was also lowered. By the implementation of additional module (MCOES), the number of arrivals of pre-school children (Age [0−6]) and school children (Age [7–18]) decreased significantly. MCOES enabled a direct transfer of medical certificates from the health center to schools, where the children were applying for an enrollment. A significant drop in arrivals was recorded as well for elderly patients, Age [65−79] and Age 80+, which belonged to High Risk (HR) and The Highest Risk (*HR) categories respectively (

Those categories of patients represent the most vulnerable group that needs to be most protected during the pandemic. The integration of MIS MEDIS.NET with the 
 <italic>COVID-19 Republic IS</italic> enabled online communication of patients with chosen physicians, which significantly influenced the decrease in number of patients belonging to Age [19–34] and Age [35–64] categories. In this way increased social distancing was achieved in the patient to patient and patient to healthcare worker relationship. Reduced contact frequency at the HCN implies the reduced probability of infecting the medical staff. The amount of prescriptions (
