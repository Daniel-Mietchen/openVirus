<p id="par0255">For chronic patients, the therapy duration does not have a time limit, and control checkups are planned every 3 months. The established therapy is corrected/confirmed during control checkups. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic with the help of 
 <italic>Therapy Extension Module</italic> the duration of prescribed therapy to chronic patients was extended to 6 months. In this way the number of arrivals of chronic patients to the chosen physician for a control checkup and extension of chronic therapy was reduced. A patient could take the extended therapy directly at the nearest pharmacy or upon a special request could receive it to a home address. The aim of such changes was to reduce the number of contacts of chronic patients, as well as their movement and circulation at HCN and outside of their homes. 
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> clearly shows the reduction of the number of arrivals of chronic patients suffering from hypertension (ICD-10 I10 - Essential (primary) hypertension) and diabetes (ICD-10 E11 - Type 2 diabetes mellitus). During the 12th pandemic week via 
 <italic>Therapy Extension Module</italic> the therapy was extended to all chronic patients with the validity of 6 months. Due to the reduced physical movement during the pandemic week there were sporadic cases that had to contact the chosen physician to change the therapy because of problems with hypertension. The online consultation with a chosen physician significantly helped those patients. Due to the extension of therapy validity for chronic patients, the number of arrivals of patients to the physicians of various specialties was reduced (
 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, Specialist examination). A significant decrease in the number of arrivals was noticed also for patients with diagnosed hypertension and diabetes, who actually belong to the most vulnerable category during COVID-19. By adapting MIS the number of their arrivals at the HCN was significantly reduced, at the same time the degree of their social distancing was increased and exposure to the viral environment was reduced.
