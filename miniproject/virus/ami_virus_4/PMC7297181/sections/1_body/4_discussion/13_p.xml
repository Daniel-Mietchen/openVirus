<p id="par0300">The University of California, San Diego Health (UCSDH) incorporated a series of EHR enhancements created to support the rapid deployment of new regulations, procedures, and protocols across a healthcare system to combat the COVID-19 pandemic [
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. They developed the multimodal COVID-19 screening processes, such as telephone calls, direct email, and EHR messaging, which take place before personal encounters. Since triage protocols were developed as multiple templates and embedded in EHR, they can be easily updated for screening purposes. This functionality for the creation of triage protocols is similar to the presented triage questionnaire in 
 <italic>Smart Patient Triage Module</italic> which is also configurable. As a good solution to avoid unnecessary patient and staff exposure, they developed the Patient Facing Technology which includes video visits for outpatients, and it is achieved by moving in person clinic visits to telemedicine-based visits. MIS MEDIS.NET achieved the wider degree of social distancing using The 
 <italic>Therapy Extension Module</italic> and 
 <italic>MCOES</italic>. The 
 <italic>COVID-19 Reporting Module</italic> is similar to the UCSDH COVID-19 operational dashboard, from the perspective of constant COVID-19 pandemic reporting. The authors from UCSDH created a predefined set of laboratory analyses especially for COVID-19, with the possibility of adding additional analyses. In MIS MEDIS.NET during triage besides a standard set of analyses for COVID-19, the system proposes additional analyses, which can be accepted or denied by the physician. The authors argue that the EHR is a necessary tool in supporting the clinical needs of a health system during the COVID-19 pandemic management.
