 <italic>Smart EHR Module</italic> also enabled scheduling of overlapping appointments during the state of emergency and COVID-19 pandemic. This mode of appointments scheduling was used for the patients who did not have visible COVID-19 symptoms. The aim of this feature was to increase the occupancy rate of available appointments for medical checkups. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 62 % of patients were not coming to scheduled appointments which is a decrease in the number of patients who come to scheduled appointments on a regular basis. One of the main reasons for such a decrease was that the movement of patients was limited during the state of emergency on the territory of the RS. In order to obey the movement time limitations, patients were coming to the HCN outside of the scheduled time slots, when they could go out. Consequently, the scheduled time slots remained empty and available. Since the 12th week of 2020 the number of scheduled appointments with chosen physicians dropped even for 76 %.
