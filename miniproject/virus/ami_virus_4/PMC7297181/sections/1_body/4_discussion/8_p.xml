 <italic>Result Sending Module</italic> is aimed at sending the results of biochemical analyses to patients via email or SMS. The objective of the module is to reduce the contacts among patients and healthcare workers at the counter of the Department for Biochemical Laboratory while receiving the results of analyses. Also the smart notification of patients via emails is supported. The system informs a patient to urgently call a chosen physician depending on the results of marked analyses for the notification. Those notifications are forwarded to epidemiologists. The number of laboratory referrals and analyses significantly dropped (

The problem appeared with patients who did not have access to computers. The percentage of such patients out of all patients who had laboratory referrals during pandemic week was 28 %.
