<p id="par0050">The main problem that naturally arises is the efficient suppression of the rapid spread of epidemic i.e. reducing the number of persons who could be exposed to the infection through the proposed key activities. The reduction of disease transmission is most efficiently conducted by socially distancing people from each other and reducing their contacts [

Additionally, educational campaigns which strengthen the understanding of the outbreak and adhere to mitigation strategies need to be conducted in order to raise awareness about the COVID-19 disease and its consequences. Some epidemics have the characteristic of rapid pathogen spread, which causes them with the high incidence of hospitalized and severely ill patients. Emerging of an enormous number of patients, suffering from the disease which causes the epidemic, within a short period of time, can become a major problem for the whole healthcare system of a country especially with an emphasis on the secondary or tertiary protection level. Even well-developed countries with the most sophisticated healthcare systems can easily experience the healthcare collapse during epidemics [

 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). The primary healthcare system in such circumstances needs to undertake significant steps in early diagnosing of ill patients and reducing the degree of contact in order to avoid the collapse of secondary and tertiary level. Besides engaging healthcare resources to combat the epidemic, the need emerges for an intensive use of IT solutions.
