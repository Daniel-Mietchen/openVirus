The newly upgraded system MIS MEDIS.NET was designed to assist the health care system of the Republic of Serbia to reduce the number of infected patients by implementing the measures of contact tracing and social distancing. This paper presents upgrades and adaptations of existing MIS MEDIS.NET during first 4 weeks from the beginning of the state of emergency and significant results which were achieved in reducing the following types of contacts: patients to patients, patients to healthcare workers at the health center. The proposed triage of patients during COVID-19 is a critical functionality for quick actions in case of the patients in critical conditions. Additional work is needed to upgrade the triage module with additional cases of use and to be available online to patients for self-triage. The results achieved by adapting MIS MEDIS.NET for the needs of COVID-19 pandemic and the experience acquired can also be used during other epidemics around the world (e.g. seasonal flu epidemic, jaundice epidemic, smallpox epidemic).
