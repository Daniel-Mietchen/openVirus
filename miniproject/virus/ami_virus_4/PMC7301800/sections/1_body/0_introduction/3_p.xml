 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] on the virucidal activity of PVP-I against MERS-CoV showed that the lowest concentration of PVP-I to be effective was 1% when used for 30 s under “dirty” conditions, leading to a reduction of viral activity of ≥99.99%; but not effective at 0·1% [

 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the lowest concentration tested and effective against coronaviruses, was 0·23%. Kariwa et al. showed that in vitro treatment of SARS-CoV with various preparations of PVP-I for 2 min reduced the viral activity to untraceable levels [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The lowest concentration throat spray (Isodine Nodo Fresh®) of 0.23% was used in Japan. In many orthopaedic and ophthalmic surgeries PVP-I is used as preoperative agent for Decolonization of Nasal
