<p id="p0025">The oropharynx and nasopharynx are the target sites of novel coronavirus with the result that saliva contains a high viral load of COVID 19 with up to 1.2 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> infective copies/per ml [
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As an otorhinolaryngologist is closely working in this area, there is a significant risk of exposure during routine office based examinations of Ear, Nose and Throat and many endoscopy procedures. Even a few microliters of saliva contamination of surfaces or instruments may carry many thousands of infectious viral particles. Though asymptomatic, the viral shedding initial phase of COVID 19 is highly infectious [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. At present there are no universal guidelines either for preoperative testing or for treatment of for COVID 19, and individual hospitals are creating their own protocols of treatment and prophylaxis. Povidone Iodine (PVP-I) has better antiviral activity than other antiseptics such as chlorhexidine [
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and has already been proven to be an effective virucidal in vitro against similar coronaviruses (SARS –CoV and MERS-Cov) [

 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] although it has not been tested directly with COVID 19. Hence, we propose the use of 0.5% PVP-I as gargles and nasal drops as a prerequisite for patients attending ENT Out-Patient department and health care workers attending these patients.
