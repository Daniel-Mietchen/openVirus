<p id="p0015">Iodine has been recognized as an effective bactericidal agent since the 1800s. Povidone‑iodine (iodine with the water-soluble polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone, PVP-I) was discovered in 1955 at the Industrial Toxicology Laboratories in Philadelphia by H. A. Shelanski and M. V. Shelanski. It was developed so as to find an alternative form of antimicrobial iodine complex that was less toxic than tincture of iodine. The onset of antimicrobial action of PVP-I starts when free iodine [

The free form of iodine rapidly penetrates microbes disrupting proteins and oxidising nucleic acid structures resulting ultimately in microbial death. PVP-I antibacterial activity is enhanced by dilution of the usually available 10% w/w cutaneous solution, from 1:2 dilution up to a 1:100 dilution (0·1%), with a reduction in activity occurring beyond 1:100 [

PVP-I has been shown to be active in-vitro against the coronaviruses that have caused epidemics of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2002–2003) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2012–2013) [
