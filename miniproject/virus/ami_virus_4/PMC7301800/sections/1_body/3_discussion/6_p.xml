<p id="p0130">We do accept that direct testing and demonstration of the virucidal activity of PVP I against SARS-CoV-2 has not been yet documented. However, the experience gained from the previous studies by Eggers et al. [

 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showing in vitro virucidal action of PVP-I in SARS COV and MERS [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we propose to use it for reduction of SAR-CoV-2 viral load in the oral cavity to prevent COVID 19 transmission in the suggested manner. We propose this protocol for disinfection of the oral, oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and nasal cavities, similar to the recommended practice of hand sanitisation for transmission reduction. It will potentially prevent the infected patients from passing on the virus and at a portal of virus entry for HCW (potentially protecting them from being infected via the nose/mouth). It is accepted that aerosolised secretions from the lower respiratory tract almost certainly have a part to play in disease transmission and therefore that this proposal forms only part of the strategy to reduce transmission, in addition to the use of personal protective equipment by the health care workers.
