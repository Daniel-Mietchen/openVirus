<p id="p0135">We propose that protocolled nasal drops/douching and oropharyngeal wash of PVP-I should be used in current COVID 19 pandemic to limit the spread of SARS – COV-2 from patients to healthcare workers and potentially vice versa. We propose that no office based ENT examination, office based endoscopic procedures, planned surgical procedures and intubation should be carried out without disinfection by PVP-I. Although, we have not estimated the effective reduction in the viral titres of coronavirus 2, but we theoretically presume depending on past studies that the reduction in the titres is possible and can last at least for 20 min in vivo [

 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The reduction in the titres as well as the length of time for which antisepsis remains has to be researched by various randomised controlled studies. A risk free time of 20 min following the use of PVP-I should be sufficient for examination and short procedures. The question of total iodine exposure seems well within previously recorded safe limits in those without contraindications to its use (history of allergy [

 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], dermatitis [
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] etc.) as only PVP-I is used just before examination. Urgent consideration should be given to the application of PVP-I to patients and HCWs as described above.
