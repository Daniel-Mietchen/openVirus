 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>], there is absolutely no harm in repurposing 0.5% PVP-I to another two special senses' organ for extrapolating its probable antiviral action against SARS CoV 2. A significant proportion of COVID 19 sufferers are asymptomatic, but shedding these viral particles. And pre-procedure testing for COVID 19 infection, may not be feasible in all patients attending the clinic. Moreover, a false negative test creates a pseudo feeling of security amongst the health care workers. The evidence presented suggests that application of povidone iodine to the nasal and oral mucosa, oropharynx and nasopharynx of patients with COVID-19 may significantly reduce the viral load in these key anatomical areas. This will definitely help to reduce the risk of transmission to health care workers. It also allows a time period to perform procedures at reduced risk. Further reduction of risk of transmission may be achieved by similar application of PVP-I to the HCW providing the care as a form of prophylaxis. We therefore propose that for the duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic. At low concentrations, staining of teeth is minimal and reversible.
