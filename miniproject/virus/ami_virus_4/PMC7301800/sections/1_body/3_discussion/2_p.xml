<p id="p0110">PVP-I is being extensively used worldwide as a handwashing agent (usually a 7·5% solution containing foaming agents), for pre-procedural skin antisepsis [

 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (often diluted to 5%) and in oral surgery as 10%. The PVP-I is commercially available in the Far East as a 1% w/v mouthwash for use every 2–4 h [
