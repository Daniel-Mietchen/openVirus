<p id="p0185">With the considerable past evidence of benefit of the use of PVP-I antiseptic against SARS Cov and MERS in maintenance of oral health prevention and treatment of oropharyngeal infections, we propose the immediate use of PVP-I in healthcare workers and their patients as described to minimise the risk of spread of the disease as an addition to currently recommended PPE used during management of COVID-19 patients. Amidst the deadly menace, we are extrapolating the in vitro efficacy of very economical PVP-I to apply it for in vivo use as there is no harm in considering the potential use of PVP-I in reducing Viral load in oropharyngeal and nasal cavities.</p>
