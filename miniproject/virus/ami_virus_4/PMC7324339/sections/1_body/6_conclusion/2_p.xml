<p id="p0160">This review presents a short brief account of recently published papers on the role of melatonin and its potential benefits, based on which it can be included as a therapeutic adjuvant in the treatment course of Covid-19 patients with chronic diseases. A common trend exists between the increased number of SARS-COV-2-infected cases and the low levels of blood melatonin in people with chronic metabolic diseases and elderly people. These individuals show decreased levels of endogenous antioxidants, including antioxidant enzymes, and melatonin accompanied by a weak immune system and increased susceptibility to inflammation. The ability of melatonin to decrease viral infections in obese and diabetic patients is attributed to its characteristics such as potent antioxidant effects, improving the endogenous antioxidant system, immunomodulatory, and the strong anti-inflammatory capability. Altogether, these features strongly recommend that melatonin can be useful as a therapeutic option for SARS-COV-2-infected patients with or without chronic metabolic diseases to improve their health. Although there is no direct evidence to support the utility of melatonin in the treatment protocols of Covid-19 patients, extensive data published over the past 50 years recommend its utility.</p>
