<p id="p0035">In metabolic diseases, cell death and oxidative stress are strongly related to inflammation, and changes in proinflammatory cytokines have a strategic position at the crossroad between oxidative stress and inflammation (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Muriach et al., 2014</xref>). Cytokine dysregulation may be responsible for clinical manifestation, and high levels of proinflammatory biomarkers are a feature in diabetic and obese patients. Moreover, several factors have been suggested to explain the increased susceptibility for SARS-Cov-2 infection in diabetic and obese persons. These factors include weakness of the immune system with increased susceptibility to hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome (

The prevalence of virus infection and its clinical consequences are most featured in older age and in individuals with obesity and diabetes. This category of population exhibits weak immune activity and increased oxidative stress due to the decline in endogenous antioxidants. The levels of inflammatory mediators typically increase with age and metabolic syndrome, even in the absence of acute infection or physiological stress (
