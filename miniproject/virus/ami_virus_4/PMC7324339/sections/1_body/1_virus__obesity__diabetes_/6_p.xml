<p id="p0055">Another recent study reported increased morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that glycemic control is essential in individuals with coexistence of Covid-19 and diabetes (

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Maddaloni and Buzzetti, 2020</xref>). The authors emphasized that IL-6 is a major inflammatory cytokine whose levels are increased in diabetes and contributed to the susceptibility of diabetic patients to Covid-19 infection and initiation of serious pathological illness. Hence, deactivation of IL-6 receptors is a practical approach for the treatment of Covid-19-induced lung dysfunction in diabetes. A novel study reported that in stressed conditions, it is necessary to improve and optimize the blood glucose management strategy for diabetic patients with Covid-19 infection (
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Zhou and Tan, 2020</xref>). The authors of that study inferred potential and important reasons for the sensitivity of diabetic patients with Covid-19. They demonstrated that a diabetic diet or a personalized diet was unavailable accompanied by the inability of quarantined inpatients to perform exercise due to limited indoor space and poor pulmonary function. In addition, the anxiety caused by Covid-19 induces hyperglycemia (
