<p id="p0145">It is possible that melatonin directly interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 membrane and its genetic material. It has been speculated that melatonin can affect the biological activity of viruses. This is supported by the fact that melatonin is a small molecule with amphiphilic nature and can readily cross biological membranes and freely enter all cells and reach subcellular organelles and structures (

Based on these recent findings, comprehensive molecular studies are required to elucidate the ability of melatonin to reverse or inhibit the biological activity of SARS-CoV-2 in diabetic or obese patients. To date, there is no direct experimental evidence on the viricidal effect of melatonin but it has indirect antiviral actions due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and immune enhancing characteristics (
