For instance, statins cannot prevent patients infected with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza from developing severe disease. In addition, there is no direct evidence was shown that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), might be effective in the therapy of severe influenza-induced cytokine storm (
