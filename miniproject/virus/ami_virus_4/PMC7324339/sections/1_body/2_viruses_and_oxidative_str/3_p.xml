<p id="p0065">Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus results in severe inflammation with increased reactive oxygen species production leading to oxidative stress (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Gravier-Hernandez et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, oxidative stress-related gene polymorphisms are likely to be associated with hepatitis B virus-induced liver disease, suggesting that information on these variations is useful for risk assessment of HBV-induced liver disease (

An experimental animal study demonstrated an important role of reactive oxygen species in the pathology and immune response to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The transcriptional profile of reactive oxygen species -related genes in the respiratory system after RSV infection in the natural host has been discussed recently (

Zika virus (ZIKV) is associated with congenital malformations, and a recent research has reported that astrocytes are the targets of ZIKV. Infection with ZIKV induces mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and DNA breakage in human astrocytes (
