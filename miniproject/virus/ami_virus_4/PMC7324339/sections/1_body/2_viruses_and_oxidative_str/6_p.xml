<p id="p0080">Macrophages are essential for innate immune responses and play a remarkable role in protecting animals against viral infections. Infections of macrophages with infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV) and Connecticut A5968 (Conn-A5968) strains produced intracellular coronavirus-like particles within cells. IBV causes respiratory defects with increased macrophage count in the respiratory system of animals. When macrophages were infected with IBV and Conn-A5968 strains, the production of the antimicrobial molecule nitric oxide (NO) was inhibited (
