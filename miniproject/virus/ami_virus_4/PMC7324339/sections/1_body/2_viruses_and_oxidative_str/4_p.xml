A previous study reported that oxidative stress was induced in infection with the Epstein–Barr virus during the early stages of infection in B lymphocytes and epithelial and lymphoblastoid cell lines. The oxidative stress was manifested by increased lipid peroxidation and decreased activities of CAT and SOD, suggesting an alteration in the molecular mechanisms promoting cellular resistance to reactive oxygen species (
