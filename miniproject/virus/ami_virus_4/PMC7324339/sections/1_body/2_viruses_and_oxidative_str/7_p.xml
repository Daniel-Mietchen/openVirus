<p id="p0085">Viroporins are virus-encoded proteins that alter membrane permeability and can trigger subsequent cellular signals. Many viruses including corona viruses encode viroporins which are required for maximal viral replication and virulence, as in case of SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Castaño-Rodriguez et al., 2018</xref>). Most corona viruses encode two viroporins; E protein and 3a protein, which act as ion-conductive pores in experiments with planar lipid bilayers. SARS-CoV encodes for additional viroporin 8a, which was reported to have less impact on replication and virulence of SARS-CoV than the two other viroporins (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Castaño-Rodriguez et al., 2018</xref>). They could possibly be responsible for inflammasome activation. Inflammasomes are large multimolecular complexes that can activate caspase-1, which in turn enhances the production of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). Recent research has reported that viroporin can induce production of IL-1β. Fluxes of potassium, hydrogen, and calcium ions in addition to reactive oxygen species, autophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum stress are involved in this activation (
