<p id="p0125">It has been reported that melatonin has immunomodulatory roles with dual proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory actions. The proinflammatory effect is exhibited to fight pathogens, whereas the anti-inflammatory action is manifested in high-grade inflammation in case such as sepsis, oxidative stress, and organ injury and also in low-grade inflammation associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases (

Besides its ability to downregulate proinflammatory cytokine production and upregulate anti-inflammatory cytokine production, melatonin exhibits high antioxidant capacity and can downregulate inducible nitric oxide synthases and inhibit neuronal nitric oxide synthases, downregulate cyclooxygenase-2, inhibit high-mobility group box-1 signaling and toll-like receptor-4 activation, prevent inflammasome NLRP3 activation, and inhibit NF-κB activation (

In a novel potential therapy using melatonin to prevent and treat obesity caused by systemic inflammatory disease, It is reported that melatonin alleviates adipose tissue inflammation by elevating α-ketoglutarate and diverting adipose-derived exosomes to macrophages in mice (
