<p id="p0120">Increased accumulations of fat in body organs and tissues develop inflammation that can cause several metabolic disorders, including diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Due to its antioxidant properties, melatonin treatment can improve the inflammatory mechanisms and energy metabolism. Animal experimental studies have shown that melatonin efficiently decreased the production of blood inflammatory cytokines such as leptin and resistin, reduced adipocyte hypertrophy, and improved the blood lipid profile (

At its pharmacological dose, melatonin enhanced the effects of metformin on insulin sensitivity and body weight gain and when given in combination with metformin, it exhibited a dual therapy for the treatment of diabetes associated with obesity (

Recently, the latter research group demonstrated that melatonin has a remarkable therapeutic action in decreasing the obesity-induced inflammatory storm. The authors anticipated that melatonin can be used as a low-cost therapeutic agent to improve disorders associated with obesity (
