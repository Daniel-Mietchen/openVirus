<p id="p0095">Melatonin is associated with a variety of signaling mechanisms including the ERK and MAPK pathways (

 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Sung et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, several cell signaling pathways, including ERK1/2-C/EBPÎ±, are involved in the regulatory roles of melatonin in T-cell biology (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2017</xref>). Melatonin also stimulated the SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway to reduce lipopolysaccharide-induced reactive oxygen species generation (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Shah et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, melatonin ameliorates H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative stress through modulation of Erk/Akt/NFkB pathway (
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Moniruzzaman et al., 2018</xref>). Melatonin exerts its action directly or indirectly using specific melatonin receptors, MT1 and MT2, on cellular membranes. Melatonin achieves many of its physiological effects by interacting with membrane MT1 and MT2 receptors and intracellular proteins such as quinone reductase 2, calmodulin, calreticulin and tubulin (
