 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Reutrakul et al., 2018</xref>). Evidence indicating the ability of melatonin to reduce the development of diabetes is derived from the observation that altered glucose metabolism and insulin resistance in shift-workers and high illumination level during night are associated with low blood melatonin levels (

This research group explained that through its receptors, melatonin can regulate GLUT4 expression and initiate the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and its intracellular substrates mobilizing the insulin-signaling pathway (
