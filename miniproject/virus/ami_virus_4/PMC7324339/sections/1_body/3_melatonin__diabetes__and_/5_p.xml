<p id="p0105">Increased oxidative stress and inflammation are a common feature in patients with diabetes with periodontal diseases. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, supplementation with melatonin was found to significantly increase the serum activities of SOD, CAT, and GPx and decrease lipid peroxidation in diabetic patients with periodontal disease. This effect was accompanied by lower IL-1b levels in melatonin-treated patients than in control individuals (

Both these studies indicate that melatonin significantly regulated the antioxidant enzymes and increased the total antioxidant capacity in the body. An earlier study reported that “Melatonin is ubiquitous but shows unequal intracellular distribution, including its high concentrations in mitochondria, likely aid in its capacity to resist oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis” (

These and several other studies agree on the effectiveness of melatonin to block oxidative stress, inflammation, and cell death and improve organ function in several human trials. The high-safety profile of melatonin also strengthens this conclusion (
