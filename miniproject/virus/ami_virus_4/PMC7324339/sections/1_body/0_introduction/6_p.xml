Accordingly, intervention with antioxidants is a potential approach to overcome oxidative stress and attenuate proinflammatory mediators in diabetic and obese patients. We anticipated that upregulation of the immune system is a potential intervention to block virus progression and consequences. In this context, melatonin is a worthy candidate that can be used to strengthen the immune system against Covid-19 infection and its related complications in obese and diabetic patients.
