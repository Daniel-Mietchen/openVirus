<p>Four ml of whole blood were collected from hospitalized patients with AFI, which were transported to the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala (UVG) laboratory. Plasma was separated and frozen at -70Â°C. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (DENV, CHIKV, ZIKV) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgM (DENV) tests were done at the UVG laboratory to confirm arboviral infection. Patients with AFI enrolled in the study were not tested for diarrheal illnesses.</p>
