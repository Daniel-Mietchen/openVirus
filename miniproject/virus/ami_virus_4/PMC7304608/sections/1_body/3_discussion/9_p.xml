<p>HAP exposure is a major risk factor for acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Particulate matter exposure risks include respiratory symptoms; acute and chronic decrement in pulmonary function; bronchial hyperactivity; acute phase reaction; respiratory infections, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations; asthma development; and premature mortality in people with chronic lung disease [

We found anecdotal evidence that suggests households that frequently cook with firewood may have fewer arboviral infections than households that do not cook with firewood. Rather than suggesting that biomass smoke be employed as a preventive measure, these findings suggest that arboviral surveillance studies should monitor levels and trends during efforts to reduce HAP exposures in order to help determine whether a causal relationship exists. Given the public health importance of arboviruses in the Americas, it is important to understand whether interventions to reduce HAP might actually increase risks for mosquito-borne infectious diseasesâ€”especially during transmission season or outbreak periods, which would warrant expanded education and vector control efforts in conjunction with interventions to reduce HAP.
