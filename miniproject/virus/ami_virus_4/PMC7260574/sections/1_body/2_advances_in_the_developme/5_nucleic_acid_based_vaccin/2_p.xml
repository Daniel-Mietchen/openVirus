<p id="p0080">Nucleic acid vaccines, including DNA and RNA vaccines, are based on plasmids or messenger RNA that encode vaccine antigens, and they are introduced into the host to produce immunological response to protect organisms against diseases

 </xref>. GLS-5300, a DNA vaccine expressing MERS-CoV S-protein antigen, is the first MERS-CoV vaccine to advance into human trials. The vaccine induced durable immune responses, as most participants maintained detectable S1 binding antibodies and had cellular immune responses at almost 1 year after the last vaccination

 </xref>. Nevertheless, CoV DNA vaccines based on full-length S protein may cause a Th2-related harmful immune response, leading to liver damage in vaccinated animals. One study comparing the immunogenicity of MERS-CoV DNA vaccines expressing S or S1 in mice showed that plasmids expressing the S1 (pS1) subunit triggered a balanced Th1/Th2 response, thereby avoiding the risk of immunopathological risk associated with Th2 response
