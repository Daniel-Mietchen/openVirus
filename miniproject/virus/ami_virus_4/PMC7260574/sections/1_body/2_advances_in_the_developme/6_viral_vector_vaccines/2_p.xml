<p id="p0095">Viral vectors have a molecular mechanism that assists the target gene to enter cells and infect them, which is an important vector platform for CoV candidate vaccines. Viral vector-based vaccines encoding S protein of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have been widely studied. To date, adenovirus (Ad), modified vaccinia ankara (MVA), attenuated parainfluenza virus (BHPIV3) and rabies virus (RV) have been used as vaccine vector

However, some viral-vectors, such as certain serotypes of adenoviruses, may fail to induce effective immune responses owing to the high prevalence of virus-neutralizing antibodies in the human population resulting in elimination of viral vectors
