<p id="p0100">Virus-like particles (VLPs) are multiprotein structures that mimic the organization and conformation of native viruses but devoid of infectious genetic materials. VLP is a potential candidate for the development of safe and effective CoV vaccines, which can efficiently stimulate innate and adaptive immune response functions. Bacterial, insect, yeast and mammalian cells expression systems have been widely used in the production of VLPs. One study indicated a chimeric VLPs that coexpression of SARS-CoV S protein and E, M and N proteins of mouse hepatitis virus resulted in the efficient production of neutralizing antibodies, thus inhibiting SARS-CoV replication in the lung
