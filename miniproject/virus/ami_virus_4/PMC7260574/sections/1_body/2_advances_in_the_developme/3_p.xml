<p id="p0065">No CoV vaccine is currently approved for use in humans. Most of the currently developed CoV vaccines are in the preclinical stage. In addition to the traditional inactivated and attenuated live vaccines, other development of candidate CoV vaccines was mainly focused on the S protein of coronaviruses. These types of S protein-based vaccines include nucleic acid-, viral vector-, virus-like particle (VLPs) and subunit vaccines. Because the research of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is still in the early stages, the following review will discuss strategies for the development of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines in the hope of providing useful guidance for the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.</p>
