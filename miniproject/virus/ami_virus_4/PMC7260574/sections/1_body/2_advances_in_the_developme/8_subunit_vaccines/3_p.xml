<p id="p0110">Since the SARS and MERS outbreaks, subunit vaccines based on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV RBD have been extensively studied and tested, showing sufficient effectiveness and strong protection against CoV infection in various animal models
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,

 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>. For example, RBD-Fc (RBD fused with human IgG1 Fc) elicits long-term humoral immune response, and produces neutralizing antibodies that protects the vaccinated mice from the SARS-CoV challenge without causing immunopathological damage

 </xref>. Also, a newly designed RBD without the Fc tag induces robust humoral and T cell responses, particularly neutralizing antibodies in immunized mice, protecting mice against SARS-CoV infection

 </xref>. It has been demonstrated that S377-588-Fc, which is a fusion protein of RBD fragment S377-588 (spike residues 377â€’588) and human IgG1 Fc, induces the higher-titer IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies among all RBD fragments in mice

 </xref>. A study has also shown that i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc induces humoral IgG antibody response comparable to those induced by s.c. vaccination, including neutralizing antibodies, but more robust systemic cellular immune responses and higher local mucosal immune responses in mouse lungs

 </xref>. In the rhesus macaque, a recombinant receptor-binding domain (rRBD) protein vaccine can also induce sustained and robust immunological responses

 </xref>. These studies suggest that RBD-based CoV vaccines have potential for preventing respiratory infections caused by CoV, further enhancing beneficial strategies for emerging coronavirus infection. However, it is worth noting that highly purified proteins are generally low immunogenicity and often require the addition of vaccine adjuvants.
