<p id="p0105">Subunit vaccines are composed of highly purified antigens which require only a part of the pathogen to generate a protective immune response. Subunit vaccines are characterized by high security, controllable performance and easy production on a large scale, thereby gradually becoming the focus of more and more researchers. Compared to the full-length S protein, RBD contains several critical neutralizing epitopes and lacks non-neutralizing epitopes that may cause harmful pathological responses. Therefore, RBD-based subunit vaccines not only can induce effective neutralizing antibodies, but also avoid adverse immune responses. From the safety and effectiveness perspectives, the RBD-based CoV vaccines are more attractive candidates in the development of CoV vaccines.</p>
