<p id="p0120">Highly purified proteins in subunit vaccines are usually not inherently immunogenic, as they generally do not directly stimulate the innate immune system. However, the development of effective CoV vaccines requires the activation of powerful humoral and cellular immunity to induce protective immunity and virus clearance in the body. Therefore, adjuvants are needed to be incorporated in subunit vaccines to enhance the immunogenicity of these weaker antigens and evoke the required antigen-specific immune response phenotype, thus improving the overall potency of poorly immunogenic subunit vaccines. The following review will discuss adjuvants commonly used in subunit vaccines against coronavirus infection.</p>
