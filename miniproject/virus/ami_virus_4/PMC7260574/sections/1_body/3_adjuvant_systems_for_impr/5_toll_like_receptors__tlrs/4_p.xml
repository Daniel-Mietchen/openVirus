In addition, SARS-CoV S protein with adjuvanated TLR3 and TLR4 agonists successfully induce high expression of antigen-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies without eosinophilic infiltrations and elicit Th1/17 cytokine responses in the lungs after the SARS-CoV challenge infection in the mouse model
