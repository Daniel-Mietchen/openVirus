<p id="p0155">The Toll-like receptor (TLR) families have been characterized as key players in RNA virus detection and antiviral immunity. Polyinosinic acidâ€’polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C) is a synthetic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) analogue that acts as a TLR3 receptor agonist, inducing the production of type I IFN and inflammatory cytokines through a TRIF-dependent pathway

 </xref>. Previous reports have indicated mice deficient in the TLR3 signaling way are extremely susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, showing increased lung pathology and higher viral titers

 </xref>. Additionally, intranasal treatment with PolyI:C induces both innate and T cell immune responses against viral infections, protecting aged animals from infection by IAV or SARS-CoV, as well as providing more rapid virus clearance

 </xref>. Furthermore, MERS-CoV S protein together with poly I:C effectively trigger CD8 T-Cells response to accelerate MERS-CoV clearance without immunopathological effects

 </xref>. These results suggest that PolyI:C, a potent type I IFN inducer, should be evaluated as a promising adjuvant in CoV subunit vaccines.
