<p id="p0130">Aluminum adjuvant has been widely used in the development of CoV vaccine due to a variety of advantages noted above. Several studies have indicated that RBD-based subunit vaccines in the presence of alum induce powerful serum-specific and neutralizing antibodies, providing a degree of protection against viral challenges
