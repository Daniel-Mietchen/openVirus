<p id="p0140">The toxicity of Freund’s adjuvant mainly comes from the non-degradable oil in the ingredients. To avoid the toxicity problem of Freund’s adjuvant, oil-in-water emulsions prepared from biocompatible oils such as squalene (

One study indicated that the SARS-CoV rRBD protein with SAS protect mouse against lethal SARS-CoV challenge, where the protection correlated well with the high titer of neutralizing antibodies
