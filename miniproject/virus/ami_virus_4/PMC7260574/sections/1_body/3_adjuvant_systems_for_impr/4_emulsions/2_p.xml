<p id="p0135">Another approach that has an extensive history of use as CoV vaccine adjuvants are emulsions. Freund’s adjuvant is a water-in-oil emulsion, divided into complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) and incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA). As a powerful agonist for Th1 cells, CFA can induce Th1 cytokines and enhance cellular and humoral immune responses. While IFA generally induce Th2 cytokines
