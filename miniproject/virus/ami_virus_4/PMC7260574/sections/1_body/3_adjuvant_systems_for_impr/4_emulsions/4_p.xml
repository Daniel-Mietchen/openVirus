<p id="p0145">MF59, another squalene-based oil-in-water emulsion, has been licensed in Europe for adjuvanted influenza vaccines. It is revealed that MERS-CoV RBD in trimeric form with MF59 elicits highly efficacious Th2-based IgG1 and Th1-based IgG2 antibody responses, as well as neutralizing antibodies against pseudotyped and live MERS-CoV, protecting 83% of hDPP4-Tg mice from lethal MERS-CoV infection (
