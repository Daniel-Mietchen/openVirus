<p id="p0170">STING (stimulator of interferon genes), a central component in the innate immune response, plays an important role in defense against viral and intracellular bacterial infections. STING is a transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Following stimulation by cytosolic cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), STING undergoes a conformational change, resulting in a downstream signaling cascade involving the activation of NF-
