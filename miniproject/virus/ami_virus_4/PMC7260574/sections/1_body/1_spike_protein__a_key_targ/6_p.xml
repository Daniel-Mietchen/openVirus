<p id="p0050">Antigen-specific targets of S protein include full-length S protein, S1 subunits, RBD and S2 subunits. Viral vector vaccines encoding full-length S protein or S1 subunits have been demonstrated to induce high levels of neutralizing antibodies in various animal models

However, some non-neutralizing epitopes on full-length S protein or S1 subunits may compete with neutralizing epitopes, leading to several safety concerns, including inflammatory and immunopathological effects such as pulmonary eosinophilic infiltration and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) following subsequent viral challenge of vaccinated animals

 </xref>. Vaccines based on RBD elicited a robust protective immune response and neutralizing antibodies. At the same time, RBD does not contain non-neutralizing epitopes that may cause harmful immune responses, which is a hot spot for CoV vaccine development. It is worth mentioning that RBD has relatively low immunogenicity and often requires repeated doses and adjuvants

Because the S2 subunit is highly conserved and not prone to mutation, S2 region has become an important target for the development of protective vaccines. However, reports regarding the presence of neutralizing epitopes in S2 and a protective role for antibodies to S2 have been inconsistent. Several studies demonstrated that S2 domain could induce specific cellular immune response and a high level of total IgG but little neutralizing antibodies against coronavirus infection
