 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). The virus genome mainly encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelope (E) proteins. S protein forms the spikes on the surface of coronaviruses and mediates adsorption and fusion of the virus and host cells. N protein forms a helical capsid, which locates inside the viral membrane to protect viral RNA. M and E proteins are important components of the viral envelope, and together mediate the assembly process of the virus

 </xref>. Among the four structural proteins, S protein is the leading mediator of virus entry and is the main factor that determines the virulence and host range of the virus.
