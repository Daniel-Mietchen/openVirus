<p id="p0045">S protein is a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein whose trimers constitute the spike structure on the surface of the virus. The S protein (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B) can be divided into two functional subunits: an N-terminal S1 domain contains signal peptide and receptor binding domain (RBD), and a C-terminal S2 domain contains fusion peptide and two heptapeptide repeats (HR1 and HR2) to facilitate viral fusion. RBD mediates the binding of virus and cell receptor, which then triggers a conformational change of the S protein, exposing HR1 and HR2 to form a 6-helix bundle fusion core structure, further leading to membrane fusion and viral RNA release
