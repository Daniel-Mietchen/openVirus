<p id="para150">We screened titles and abstracts, reviewed full texts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias by two authors and independently, using standardised prepiloted forms (Covidence; Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, VIC, Australia), and we cross-checked screening results using artificial intelligence (Evidence Prime, Hamilton, ON, Canada). We resolved disagreements by consensus. We extracted data for study identifier, study design, setting, population characteristics, intervention and comparator characteristics, quantitative outcomes, source of funding and reported conflicts of interests, ethics approval, study limitations, and other important comments.</p>
