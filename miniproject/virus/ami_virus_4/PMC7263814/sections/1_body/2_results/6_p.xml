When differential N95 or similar respirator use, which was more frequent in health-care settings than in non-health-care settings, was adjusted for the possibility that face masks were less effective in non-health-care settings, the subgroup effect was slightly less credible (p
 <sub>interaction</sub>=0·11, adjusted for differential respirator use; 
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">figure 4</xref>). Indeed, the association with protection from infection was more pronounced with N95 or similar respirators (aOR 0·04, 95% CI 0·004 to 0·30) compared with other masks (aOR 0·33, 95% CI 0·17 to 0·61; p
 <sub>interaction</sub>=0·090; moderate credibility subgroup effect; 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>). The interaction was also seen when additionally adjusting for three studies that clearly reported aerosol-generating procedures (p
 <sub>interaction</sub>=0·048; 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">figure 5</xref>). Supportive evidence for this interaction was also seen in within-study comparisons (eg, N95 had a stronger protective association compared with surgical masks or 12–16-layer cotton masks); both N95 and surgical masks also had a stronger association with protection versus single-layer masks.
