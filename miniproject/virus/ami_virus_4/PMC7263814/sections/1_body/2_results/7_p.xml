<p id="para270">We did a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of our findings and to integrate all available information on face mask treatment effects for protection from COVID-19. We reconsidered our findings using random-effects Bayesian meta-analysis. Although non-informative priors showed similar results to frequentist approaches (aOR 0·16, 95% CrI 0·04–0·40), even using informative priors from the most recent meta-analysis on the effectiveness of masks versus no masks to prevent influenza-like illness (RR 0·93, 95% CI 0·83–1·05)
