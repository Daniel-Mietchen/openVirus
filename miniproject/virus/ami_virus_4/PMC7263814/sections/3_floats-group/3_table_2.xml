Setting was any health-care or non-health-care setting. Outcomes were infection (laboratory-confirmed or probable) and contextual factors. Risk (95% CI) in intervention group is based on assumed risk in comparison group and relative effect (95% CI) of the intervention. All studies were non-randomised and evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale; some studies had a higher risk of bias than did others but no important difference was noted in sensitivity analyses excluding studies at higher risk of bias; we did not further rate down for risk of bias.

We did not rate down for indirectness for the association between distance and infection because SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV all belong to the same family and have each caused epidemics with sufficient similarity; there was also no convincing statistical evidence of effect-modification across viruses; some studies also used bundled interventions but the studies include only those that provide adjusted estimates. aOR=adjusted odds ratio. RR=relative risk. SARS-CoV-2=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. SARS-CoV=severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. MERS-CoV=Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
