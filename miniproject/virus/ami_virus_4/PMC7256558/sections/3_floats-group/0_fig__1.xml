  <p>Comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees of the NTD (A) and RBD (B) regions of SARS-CoV-2 (red), RaTG13 (green), RmYN02 (light blue), Pangolin coronaviruses (Guangdong lineage, grey; Guangxi lineage, orange), and other Asian (dark blue) and non-Asian (brown) bat coronaviruses belonging to the 
   <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> subgenus. Trees are based on amino acid sequences and were built using PhyML (
   <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Guindon and Gascuel, 2003</xref>). Trees are mid-point rooted. (C) Combined variability in S1 (grey) and S2 (red) domains of SARS-CoV-2 when compared to RaTG13 and pangolin coronaviruses spike sequences. (D) Sequence alignments showing absence of the YLTPGD insert in bat sarbecoviruses, and the sequence of the RBD region involved in the interaction with ACE2. (E) The position of YLTPGD inserts forming conformational clusters (red spheres) at the NTD of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is shown (left). The ribbon structure of the spike protein-ACE2 interaction surface is represented to show polar interactions (right). Polar interactions were analyzed using PyMol using PDB id: 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6m0j" id="ir0005" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6m0j</ext-link> (
   <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2020</xref>). (F) Alignment of the region carrying the polybasic amino acid insertion (red) at the S1/S2 cleavage site. GenBank/GISAID accessions for the sequences included in trees are: NC_045512.2 (SARS-CoV-2), MN996532.1(RaTG13), EPI_ISL_412977 (RmYN02), MT084071.1 (MP789 or Guangdong 1), EPI_ISL_410544 (Guangdong P2S), MT040334.1 (GX-P1E),MT072865.1 (GX-P3B), MT040335.1 (GX-P5L), KY417148 (Rs4247), DQ071615.1 (Rp3), GQ153547.1 (HKU3–12), GQ153542 (HKU3–7), MK211378.1 (BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2018D), DQ648856.1 (BtCoV/273/2005), JX993987.1 (Rp/Shaanxi2011), KJ473816 (BtRs-BetaCoV/YN2013), MG772933 (CoVZC45), MG772934 (CoVZXC21), KY417151.1 (Rs7327), KF569996 (LYRa11), NC_014470.1 (BM48–31/BGR/2008), KY352407.1 (BtKY72).
