  <p>The same reconstruction of SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny, now denoted by geography. Isolates originated and initially diversified in China (purple), followed by multiple and independent introductions to Oceania (blue), Europe (green and yellow), and North America (red). Less information is known about Africa, India, South America, and other populations of major concern in the Global South. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p>
