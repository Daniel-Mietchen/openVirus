<p id="p0215">Since SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread around the world, and the number of potential cases increases rapidly, faster and more-accessible testing is extremely needed. Thus, many companies are racing against the clock to develop commercial test kits to detect SARS-CoV-2 more quickly and accurately. More than fifty RT-PCR-based diagnostic tests are currently available in the US that have been granted the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization (

These tests can qualitatively identify SARS-CoV-2's RNA in the lower respiratory tract (bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum, and tracheal aspirate), and upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs). Recently, the FDA approved emergency use for a portable, fast, swab test for SARS-CoV-2 which can provide results in less than 15Â min. The IDNOW COVID-19 (Abbott, Illinois) can be used at a point-of-care in doctor's offices, urgent care and hospitals. Lateral flow immunoassays are another rapid, point-of-care diagnostic test, which has been widely used. The Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIA is the first COVID-19 antigen test to be granted the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization. This lateral flow immunofluorescent sandwich assay is used with the Sofia 2 instrument intended for the qualitative detection of the nucleocapsid protein antigen from SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs.
