<p id="p0210">Because SARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus and its genome is very divergent from those of HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, and -HKU1, several commercially available multiplex NAAT tests (BioFire FilmArray Respiratory Panel, ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel, NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel, RespiFinderSmart22kit, and others.) for the detection of respiratory organisms in clinical virology laboratories were predicted no cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 (

While the CDC assay was designed for specific detection of three different regions of the N gene, the assay developed by
