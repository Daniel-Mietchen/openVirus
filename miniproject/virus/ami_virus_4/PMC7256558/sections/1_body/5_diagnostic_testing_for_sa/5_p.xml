<p id="p0220">Another diagnostic approach would be to devise blood tests for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Many companies around the world have raced to develop antibody tests. The qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test (Cellex Inc.) was the first antibody test being approved by the FDA. This test is intended to qualitatively detect IgG and IgM antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 in human serum, plasma, and whole blood. Together with increased availability of commercial RT-PCR-based diagnostic tests, important questions about immunity to the novel coronavirus will be answered soon. The use of serological tests is complementary to those based on direct detection of viral RNA because they indicate that the individual has developed specific immunological response to the virus, which usually takes a few days after infection; hence, a negative result does not necessarily mean that a person is not infected - this might have occurred too recently to have developed the immune response, and a positive results does not necessarily mean that the person has an active infection. Consequently, these tests are essential to obtain a more precise estimate of the total number of infections in a population and in which proportion they are expected to be immune to a future infection by the virus. Its main use is in epidemiological surveillance rather than in clinical diagnostics. Early application of community surveys for seroprevalence have suggested far more widespread community exposure than has been supposed based merely on the reporting of diagnosed cases, suggesting for example that by mid-April as many as one in five residents of New York City may have been exposed, with diminishing exposure rates less proximate to the outbreak's epicenter.</p>
