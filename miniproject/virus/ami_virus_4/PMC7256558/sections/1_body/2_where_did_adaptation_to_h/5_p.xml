<p id="p0065">Clearly, huge gaps remain in our understanding of SARS-CoV emergence and adaptation to our species. Most likely, acquisition of inserts in the spike protein and remodeling of the RBD did not occur in a single animal-to-human jump event. The majority of relevant changes might have been present in a reservoir/intermediate species and only minor changes may then have been required to gain full transmissibility in humans.</p>
