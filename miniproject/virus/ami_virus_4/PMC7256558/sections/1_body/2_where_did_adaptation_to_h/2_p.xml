<p id="p0050">Although, for the reasons mentioned above, an as-yet unidentified intermediate host is likely to have played a role in the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the Wuhan market or elsewhere, the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 was directly transmitted from bats to humans cannot be discarded. Indeed, serological surveys on people living in proximity to bat colonies in Yunnan province indicated that direct bat-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV related coronaviruses might occur (

In general, wild animal trade might reduce the ecological barriers separating humans from coronavirus hosts, including these bats or other mammals. However, the observation that some early COVID-19 cases had no apparent epidemiological link to the Huanan seafood and wildlife market (

Clearly, wide sampling of coronavirus diversity in different mammals in China and neighboring countries will be necessary to track down the progenitor(s) of SARS-CoV-2.
