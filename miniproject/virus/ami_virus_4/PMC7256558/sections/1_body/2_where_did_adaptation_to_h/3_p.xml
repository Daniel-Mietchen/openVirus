<p id="p0055">The scenarios described above implicitly imply that, whatever the source of the zoonotic transmission, SARS-CoV-2 emerged and adapted in another host, eventually spilling over to humans (
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>). It cannot however be excluded that, before being recognized in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 had been circulating for a while in humans, maybe causing mild symptoms. The acquisition of some key viral mutations during unrecognized human transmission might have then fostered the current pandemic strain, characterized by sustained human-to-human transmissibility and virulence. In this case, the identification of such mutations and the assessment of the role of the above-mentioned furin cleavage site insertion would be of paramount importance. Nonetheless, it should be kept in mind that extreme caution should be exerted when ascribing phenotypic effect to mutations that arise during viral spreads (
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Grubaugh et al., 2020</xref>). Here, again, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have lessons to teach. Whereas in the case of SARS-CoV, changes in the spike protein RBD contributed to the adaptation of the virus to human cells (
 <xref rid="bb0660" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Qu et al., 2005</xref>), MERS-CoV adaptation to our species occurred with limited changes in the RBD (

 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Forni et al., 2015</xref>). However, during an outbreak of MERS-CoV in South Korea, viral strains carrying point mutations in the spike RBD emerged and spread (
 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, whereas these RBD mutations were found to decrease rather than increase binding to the cellular receptor, they facilitated viral escape from neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">Rockx et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Kleine-Weber et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that changes in the spike protein do not necessarily arise as an adaptation to optimize receptor-binding affinity.
