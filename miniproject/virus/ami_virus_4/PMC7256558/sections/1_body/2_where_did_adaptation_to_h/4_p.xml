<p id="p0060">Even more emblematic is the case of SARS-CoV ORF8, encoding an accessory viral protein. In the early stages of the epidemic, SARS-CoV strains acquired a 29-nucleotide deletion in ORF8 (

Together with the observation that the encoded protein is fast evolving in SARS-CoV strains, this finding was taken to imply that deletions in ORF8 were driven by natural selection and favored human infection (
