<p id="p0070">Alternatively, the progressive optimization from multiple zoonotic events may have followed short events of human-to-human transmission over an extended period of time. This has been earlier observed during MERS transmission, entailing repeated jumps of MERS-CoV from camels (

Accumulation of mutations in NTD and RBD during global and local transmissions further strengthens the likelihood that the progenitor virus may have been transmitted among humans over time, adapting to become more efficiently transmitted in people.
