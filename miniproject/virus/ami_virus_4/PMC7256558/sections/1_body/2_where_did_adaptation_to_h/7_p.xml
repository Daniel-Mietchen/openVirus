<p id="p0075">In a nutshell, the missing knowledge about the reservoir/intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2, as well as about the extent of its distribution in wild and domestic animals, raises concerns about zoonotic transmissions. If pre-adaptation routinely occurs as these viruses incubate in animal reservoirs, there is a high probability for new pandemics to recur. Thorough surveillance of animal populations and early diagnosis in people will be necessary to prevent future COVID-19 like pandemics.</p>
