<p id="p0115">This observation, although needing more in depth analysis, suggests that viral diseases transmitted by bats seem likely driven by ENSO climatic anomalies. Abnormal rainfall, temperature, and vegetation development, whether above or below normal condition during El Niño - La Niña events, are known to create appropriate ecological conditions for pathogens, their reservoirs and vectors that may enhance transmission, risk of spill-over, emergence, and propagation of disease clusters (
