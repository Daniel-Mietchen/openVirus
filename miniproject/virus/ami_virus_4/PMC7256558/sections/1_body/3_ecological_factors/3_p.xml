<p id="p0085">Two scenarios have been proposed to explain the cross-species transfer and evolution of the new betacoronavirus to a human-to-human transmission. The precursor of the SARS-CoV-2, cycling in an animal host before the zoonotic transfer, might have evolved the bind to an ACE2 receptor similar to that of humans (

For this to have occurred, a high host population density would have been needed to achieve efficient natural selection for this important phenotype. The second scenario proposed by Andersen and colleagues hypothesizes that natural selection for this trait occurred in humans after the virus established itself in human beings, continuously adapting before transmission caught the attention of the medical and public health communities. In either scenario, the new coronavirus emergence required a combination of successful mutations that enabled the virus to cause infection in humans, and ecological and behavior determinants that enabled the virus to breach host species barriers and then spread in large and dense human populations before being recognized as the agent of a potential pandemic. Such an alignment of genetic, ecological, epidemiological, and behavioral factors was proposed by
