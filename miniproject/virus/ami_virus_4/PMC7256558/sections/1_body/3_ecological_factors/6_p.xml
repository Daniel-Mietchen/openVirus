<p id="p0100">Decline in wildlife populations caused by predatory hunting activities, decreased habitat quality and habitat loss driven by extensive deforestation has been linked to increased probability of zoonotic virus spillover to humans at the human-animal interface (
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Geoghegan and Holmes, 2017</xref>). In these human-dominated landscapes, primates and bats are reservoir hosts of more viruses than other mammal species, increasing the potential for new infections in humans to become established (

 <xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">Menachery et al. (2015)</xref> using a reverse genetics system entailing a chimeric virus expressing the bat SHCO14 in a mouse-adapted backbone. This study illustrated scenarios for the emergence of bat SARS-CoV in humans: infection of an intermediate nonhuman host might be followed by human infection. Direct bat-human transmission could be followed by selection in the human population (distinct from closely-related viruses circulating in the source host). In a third scenario, the circulation of quasi-species pools in the animal reservoir might maintain multiple virus strains, some of which capable of causing infection in humans without the need for additional mutations. Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirues were identified in free-ranging bats from Myanmar, showing the potential for zoonotic virus emergence in humans in close contact with sylvatic animals in forest areas disturbed by ongoing process of changes in land use (
