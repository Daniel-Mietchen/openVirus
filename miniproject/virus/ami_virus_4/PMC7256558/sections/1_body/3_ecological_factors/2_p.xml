<p id="p0080">Zoonotic spillover of infectious pathogens is threatening socioeconomic development and public health worldwide (
 <xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2008</xref>). The emergence and rapid worldwide propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has led to the COVID-19 pandemic. The chain of events that facilitated the zoonotic spillover likely required the alignment of ecological, epidemiological and behavioral determinants that allowed a precursor lineage of a bat virus to trespass a series of barriers, possibly after establishing infections in intermediate hosts, before evolving to become capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. The mechanisms involved in the spillover and evolution of this coronavirus as a human pathogen remain unclear, including contrasting information regarding the immediate reservoir or other hosts, including horseshoe bats (
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic>) or the ant and termite-feeders, critically endangered pangolin species (
 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>). The latter is the most trafficked animal worldwide and illegally imported from Malaysia into China for trade in markets (
