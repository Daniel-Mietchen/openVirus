 <xref rid="bb0610" ref-type="bibr">Vanwambeke et al., 2019</xref>). In fragmented forest landscapes, generalist reservoir species are capable of adapting to new ecological conditions, becoming more abundant, expanding their distribution range, and accumulating parasites and pathogens. In this scenario, the host species richness and high population density increase the human-animal reservoir contact rate and the exposure to parasites (

 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, the close proximity of people to forest ecosystems, increased human population density, poor living conditions, low socioeconomic condition and human mobility facilitate human exposure to wild animals and the probability of spillover events (
