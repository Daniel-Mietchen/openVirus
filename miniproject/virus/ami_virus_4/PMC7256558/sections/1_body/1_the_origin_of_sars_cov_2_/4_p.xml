<p id="p0035">In analogy to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, several lines of evidence suggest that an intermediate host was responsible for the cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans. First, most although not all, early COVID-19 detected cases were associated with the Huanan seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan city, where several mammalian species were traded (
 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). This is reminiscent of the circumstances associated with the initial phases of SARS-CoV spread, as palm civets were sold in wet markets and their meat consumed (
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). Second, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments have shown that, in addition to bats, SARS-CoV-2 can infect cells from small carnivores and pigs (
 <xref rid="bb0705" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020b</xref>). Experimental 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> infection and transmission in ferrets and cats was also reported (
 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0550" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2020a</xref>). Third, viruses very closely related (85.5% to 92.4% sequence similarity) to SARS-CoV-2 were very recently detected in Malayan or Sunda pangolins (
 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>) illegally imported in Southern China (
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2020</xref>). The analysis of these viral genomes indicated that pangolins host at least two sub-lineages of sarbecoviruses, which are referred as the Guangdong and Guangxi lineages after the locations where the animals were sampled (
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2020</xref>) (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A and B). Viruses in the Guangdong lineage share high similarity with SARS-CoV-2 in the receptor-binding motif of the spike protein. This same region is instead the most divergent between BatCoV RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0705" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020b</xref>). This observation is very relevant, as the binding affinity between the spike protein and the cognate cellular receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, ACE2, in the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) is a major determinant of coronavirus host range (
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Haijema et al., 2003</xref>;
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">McCray Jr et al., 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">Moore et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0540" ref-type="bibr">Schickli et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, coronaviruses use a surface spike glycoprotein to attach to host receptors and gain entry into cells (
 <xref rid="bb0620" ref-type="bibr">Walls et al., 2020</xref>). It is a homo-trimeric protein formed by two subunits, S1 and S2. The S1 subunit contains an N-terminal domain connected by a linker of variable length to the receptor-binding domain (RBD). In various coronaviruses, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and RBD contribute to define host range (
 <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">Lu et al., 2015</xref>). The S2 domain participates in membrane fusion (
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Duquerroy et al., 2005</xref>). Comparison of the complete spike protein, as well as of the NTD, indicated higher similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with RaTG13 than with pangolin coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). Domain based sequence analysis indicates that sequence variations are majorly confined to the S1-domain (~16% variable sites) than to the S2-domain (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C), and mutations were observed in both NTD and RBD. Interestingly, an insertion (YLTPGD) is present only in the NTD of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and Guangxi pangolin coronaviruses, but absent in related bat coronaviruses (in Guangdong pangolin viruses the region is not fully covered by sequencing) (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D). This motif forms a conformational cluster at the exposed NTD regions of the spike trimer and may contribute to determine host range. However, as mentioned above, within the RBD, SARS-CoV-2 shows higher identity with pangolin viruses belonging to the Guangdong lineage than to RaTG13 (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B and D). Structural analysis of the binding interface between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and human ACE2 shows a strong network of polar contacts (PDB id: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6m0j" id="ir0030" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6m0j</ext-link>) (
 <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Lan et al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 RBD mediates these polar interactions through Lys417, Gly446, Tyr449, Asn487, Gln493, Gln498, Thr500, Asn501, Gly502 and Tyr505 with ACE2 (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E). These residues, which participate in polar interactions with the host protein, are almost completely conserved with pangolin coronaviruses of the Guangdong lineage (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D).
