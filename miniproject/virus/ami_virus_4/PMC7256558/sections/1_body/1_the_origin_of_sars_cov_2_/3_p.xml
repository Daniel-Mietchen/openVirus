<p id="p0030">In the aftermath of the SARS and MERS epidemics, intense efforts were devoted to identify the animal reservoirs of these viruses and to reconstruct the chain of events that led to the human spillovers. It is now known that both viruses originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts (

 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Killerby et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, the progenitor of SARS-CoV emerged through recombination among bat viruses and subsequently infected palm civets and other small carnivores, eventually spilling over to humans (

 <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">MÃ¼ller et al., 2014</xref>). MERS-CoV displays limited human-to-human spread, and most cases resulted from independent zoonotic transmission from camels (
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). It is thus unsurprising that the closest known relatives of SARS-CoV-2 are two bat coronaviruses (BatCoV RmYN02 and BatCoV RaTG13) identified in horseshoe bats (

 <italic>R. affinis</italic>, respectively) (

 <xref rid="bb0705" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020b</xref>). Both BatCoVs display an average nucleotide identity of ~95% with SARS-CoV-2, although with variations through the genome, and they were detected in bats sampled in Yunnan province, China, in 2019 and 2013, before the first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in humans (
 <xref rid="bb0705" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020b</xref>). Both the place and timing of BatCoV RmYN02 and RaTG13 detection, as well as their levels of identity with SARS-CoV-2, indicate that these viruses are not direct progenitors of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic strain, but clearly support the view that the latter had an ultimate bat origin (
