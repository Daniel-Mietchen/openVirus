<p id="p0045">In any case, these data do not necessarily imply that pangolins had a role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and in its spread to humans, as these animals might have in turn contracted infection from a bat or other reservoir. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein displays a unique feature that is not shared with either BatCoV RaTG13 or the pangolin viruses, namely the presence of a furin cleavage site insertion (PRRA) at the S1-S2 junction (

 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>). It is presently unknown how and when SARS-CoV-2 acquired the furin cleavage site, but it is equally unexplored whether it affects any viral phenotype or if it contributed to adaptation to humans or other hosts. Importantly, though, the presence of a similar insertion in a virus isolated from wild bats is another strong indication in favor of a natural animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 (
