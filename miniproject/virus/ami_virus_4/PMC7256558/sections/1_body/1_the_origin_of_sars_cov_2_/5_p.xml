<p id="p0040">One possible explanation for this observation is that the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and Guangdong pangolin viruses have been progressively optimized through natural selection (convergent evolution) to bind ACE2 molecules from humans and pangolins (and possibly other non-bat mammalian species) (

 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Cagliani et al., 2020</xref>). It is presently impossible to disentangle these two alternative scenarios, and only the sequencing of additional related sarbecoviruses might eventually clarify the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2 RBD. It is also worth mentioning here that, as previously noted (
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>), the similarity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD with that of viruses only recently sequenced from pangolins can be regarded as a major evidence against the circulating theory that SARS-CoV-2 is the result of deliberate human manipulation.
