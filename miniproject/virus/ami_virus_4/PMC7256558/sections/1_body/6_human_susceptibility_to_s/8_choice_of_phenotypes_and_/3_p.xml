<p id="p0275">Identification of a susceptibility gene with no a priori hypothesis is difficult for an active acute viral infection, but candidate genes, potentially controlling these phenotypes, would include those from both innate and adaptive immunity. Published GWAS, which might be of interest for suggesting susceptibility loci, tend to have used phenotypes from chronic rather than acute conditions e.g. COPD. Whether conducting genotype/phenotype studies or simply measuring immune responses, age and sex are clearly major factors in the outcome of infection with SARS-CoV-2, and will require careful consideration in all analyses.</p>
