<p id="p0270">To date, phenotypes employed for human genetics have been limited: susceptibility to infection 
 <italic>per se,</italic> some measures of morbidity and mortality. For both candidate gene studies and GWAS, finding totally ‘resistant’ individuals, for an unaffected control group, is hard since for COVID19, despite the occurrence of asymptomatic individuals, many show very mild symptoms of disease. There is scope for development of phenotypes, particularly relating to the most pertinent issues of pathogenesis and control of immune responsiveness. Perhaps immediate research could focus on critical and potentially useful phenotypes e.g. severity of disease sufficient to require a ventilator, or antibody responses.
