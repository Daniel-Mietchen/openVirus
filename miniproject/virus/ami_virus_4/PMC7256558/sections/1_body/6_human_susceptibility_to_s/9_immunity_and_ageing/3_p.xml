<p id="p0285">A number of immune response molecules/genes are of interest, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), proinflammatory cytokines and the appropriate signalling pathways. Both adaptive and innate immunity are recognized to decline with age (

 <xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">Nikolich-Å½ugich, 2018</xref>), and although, in the past, adaptive immunity has been the focus of attention, there is now cumulative evidence for a decline in innate immunity with age. Changes occur in neutrophil, macrophage, dendritic cell and NK populations, and there are changes in TLR expression, with an overall distinct but not uniformly lower expression in later life, particularly in macrophages, and consequent major changes in TLR mediated responses (

The innate immune system of the frail elderly is often in a state of heightened inflammation, but this higher basal production of proinflammatory cytokines does not necessarily translate to a generally elevated and/or effective response (

In particular, the incidence of and mortality from lung infections increase sharply with age, with such infections often leading to worse outcomes, prolonged hospital stays and life-threatening complications, such as sepsis or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The review by 
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Boe et al. (2017)</xref> covers research on bacterial pneumonias and pulmonary viral infections and discusses age-related changes in innate immunity that contribute to the higher rate of these infections in older populations.
