<p id="p0295">We know multiple host factors, including age and sex, are important for disease outcome of coronavirus infection and a systems approach has been suggested for the study of disease pathogenesis (
 <xref rid="bb0535" ref-type="bibr">Sch√§fer et al., 2014</xref>). However, to date, we do not know the relative importance of factors such as host and pathogen genetic variability. Whilst we can draw some comparisons with other similar acute respiratory infections such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2 presents unique and urgent challenges. There is an unprecedented opportunity to obtain large sample sizes and the need to understand the role of human genetics in the outcome of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is well recognized (
 <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Kaiser, 2020</xref>). Information on infection with SARS-CoV-2 is being added to health data e.g. inclusion in the UK Biobank with its 500,000 volunteers (
