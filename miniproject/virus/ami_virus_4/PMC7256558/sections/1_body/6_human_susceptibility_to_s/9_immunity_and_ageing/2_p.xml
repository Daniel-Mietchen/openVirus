<p id="p0280">Immunity and pathology will be influenced by many factors including genetics, age, sex, viral dose and underlying health problems. The interactions between these factors will also be important (
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Gubbels Bupp et al., 2018</xref>). COVID19 particularly affects the elderly, with age a key consideration in any study design, as are sex differences, which are known to be important for respiratory infections in general (
 <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Kadel and Kovats, 2018</xref>). Although both innate and adaptive immunity are required to mount an effective immune response, and despite the tools for investigation of the relevant loci being available, the lack of candidate gene studies for coronavirus infection even prior to COVID19, including information on MHC associations, has been noted. Not only will variability in amino acid sequence be important, such as that influencing MHC restriction, but also the levels of immune mediators, possibly driven by promoter variation. Timing of responses is another area for exploration. 
 <xref rid="bb0520" ref-type="bibr">Rockx et al. (2009)</xref> discuss molecular mechanisms of age related susceptibility in coronavirus infected mice, and development of pathology via the host response. Aged mice showed a greater number of differentially expressed genes when infected than young mice, including elevated interferon and cytokine genes, indicating a different host response kinetics in old versus young mice.
