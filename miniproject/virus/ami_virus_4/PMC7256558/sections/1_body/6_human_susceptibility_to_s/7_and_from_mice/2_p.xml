<p id="p0265">More recently, loci of interest have been identified using mouse models, after infection with SARS-CoV, where pathology can be well studied. These include 
 <italic>Trim55</italic> and 
 <italic>Ticam2</italic> (
 <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Kane and Golovkina, 2019</xref>). 
 <italic>Trim55</italic> codes for an E3 ubiquitin ligase present in smooth muscle around blood vessels, affecting lung pathology by controlling airways and immune cell infiltration. Deficiency was relevant to lung injury although susceptibility alleles were not reported (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Gralinski et al., 2015</xref>). 
 <italic>Ticam2</italic> knockout mice were highly susceptible to disease with some evidence of allelic heterogeneity. Ticam2 is an adaptor for MyD88-independent TLR4 signaling contributing to innate immunity (
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Gralinski et al., 2017</xref>). These genes require complementary studies in human populations.
