<p id="p0235">Although host genetics is likely to be important for the outcome of infection, because of the nature of the disease, we only have preliminary information on the heritability of susceptibility to coronavirus infections, i.e. estimates of the proportion of phenotypic variability due to genetic factors. Heritability, a time and place-specific measurement for a population, provides an indication of likely success in the hunt for susceptibility loci, and low values for heritability of &lt;20% would indicate that very large sample sizes might be needed to detect genetic effects. 
 <xref rid="bb0650" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al. (2020)</xref> have reported high heritability, in the range 40â€“50%, of COVID-19 symptoms in a classical twin study (
 <xref rid="bb0650" ref-type="bibr">Williams et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, the apparent differences in susceptibility seen between ethnic groups could be due, in part, to human genetic variability. 
 <xref rid="bb0470" ref-type="bibr">Niedzwiedz et al. (2020)</xref> report a higher risk of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, not accounted for by variables such as socioeconomic differences, in some minority ethnic groups as included in the UK Biobank (
 <xref rid="bb0470" ref-type="bibr">Niedzwiedz et al., 2020</xref>). The genetic contribution to the outcome of infection will be complex, since some of the underlying health conditions associated with death from coronavirus infection are known to have a significant genetic contribution.
