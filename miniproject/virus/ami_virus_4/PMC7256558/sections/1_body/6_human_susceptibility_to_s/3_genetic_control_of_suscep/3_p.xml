<p id="p0240">The difficulties of family-based studies, whilst controlling for exposure, leaves us with case control association methodology. Ultimately, the high numbers of affected people will facilitate genome wide association studies (GWAS), or even studies of whole genome or exome sequence, particularly where genotypic information is already available, as is the case for UK Biobank participants. In the short term, we are likely to see a number of candidate gene studies. For susceptibility to coronavirus infection 
 <italic>per se</italic>, loci coding for viral receptors provide obvious candidate genes. Nevertheless, the major question is why some individuals develop life-threatening immune-mediated pathologies, where knowledge of genetic variation may contribute to our understanding of key mediators of the immune response.
