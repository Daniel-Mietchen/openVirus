<p id="p0245">Most relevant, albeit limited, information on the allelic diversity contributing to susceptibility/resistance to date has used sampling from the SARS CoV 2003 epidemic, and a little information has been gleaned from the MERS-CoV 2012 epidemic. Sample sizes are small, and results sometimes conflicting, hence no firm conclusions can be drawn. There are several studies identifying genes of interest from mouse models (

 <xref rid="bb0560" ref-type="bibr">Sironi et al., 2015</xref>). To date, candidate genes for published human studies have included pathogen receptor genes and loci controlling innate and adaptive immunity.
