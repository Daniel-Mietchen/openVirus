<p id="p0230">Knowledge of genetic variation, at both individual and population levels, may further our understanding of disease transmission and pathogenesis, enabling identification of individuals at high risk of infection and sequelae. More broadly, this may inform drug design and vaccine development. However, previous coronavirus epidemics of recent years, namely SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012, did not lend themselves to such evaluation owing to their rapid progression, acute onset, and relatively small reach. The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic appears unfettered by any population-level protective immunity to cross-reactive epitopes. The much greater number of individuals affected, together with the availability of high throughput technologies, will stimulate rapid research on variation in host susceptibility. Indeed, the number of preprints appearing online, prior to peer review, is unprecedented. Other respiratory viruses where host susceptibility has received attention include Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (
