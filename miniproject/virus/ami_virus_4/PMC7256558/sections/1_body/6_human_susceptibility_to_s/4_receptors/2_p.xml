<p id="p0250">S1 spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cell membranes, catalysing the cleavage of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II and countering the activity of ACE. MERS-CoV binds to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, CD26) an immunoregulatory serine exopeptidase. Particularly considering indications of relevance from cross-species comparisons (
