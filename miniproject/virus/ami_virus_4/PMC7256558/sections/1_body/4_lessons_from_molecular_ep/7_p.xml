<p id="p0150">The total number of points at any column (encompassing different time intervals) informs about the sampling success at those times. There are only a few sequences from the early weeks (before January 15) followed by a clear increase until the beginning of February (around February 5). Then, Chinese researchers (see below) almost completely ceased to deposit sequences in GISAID and only a few sequences were being obtained from other countries. This period corresponds to the silent spread of COVID-19 throughout most countries. Asymptomatic infections were not detected, hence no virus samples were available for sequencing and we lack detailed information on how the virus was spreading. This period also corresponds to a bout of diversification that can be observed in the upper part of the tree, with many new sublineages stemming from pre-existing lineages. The times of these diversification events are inferred from the application of a constant rate of evolution of 8 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions per site per year. The constancy of this evolutionary rate is difficult to be evaluated at this stage in the evolutionary history of the virus, given the very short time elapsed since its appearance. By the end of February, the situation changed drastically, as many more sequences became available for analysis when the pandemic exploded and cases accumulated rapidly in many countries.
