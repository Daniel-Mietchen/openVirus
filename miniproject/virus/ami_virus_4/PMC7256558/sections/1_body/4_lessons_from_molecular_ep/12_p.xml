<p id="p0175">Acknowledging this broader context, what do the phylogenetic data say about the proximate origins of SARS-CoV-2? More surveillance among the viruses of suspected animal reservoirs (bats, most especially) will be needed to confidently estimate when and where this virus first took a firm foothold in people. Early reports (

 <xref rid="bb0700" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0705" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020b</xref>) identified BatCoV RaTG13 and RmYN02 as the closest isolates to SARS-CoV-2 and it has been proposed that these lineages diverged between 40 and 70 years ago (
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Boni et al., 2020</xref>). Assuming constancy in the evolutionary rate, which is also problematic as discussed above, a few months may have elapsed between human acquisition of the virus and its recognition by the medical and public health communities in December 2019. Molecular clock analyses suggest a time for the most recent common ancestor of all current SARS-CoV-2 lineages in October–December 2019 (
 <xref rid="bb0605" ref-type="bibr">van Dorp et al., 2020</xref>) If further sampling identifies more genetically proximate enzootic viruses, then the estimated times for separation and diversification may likewise change. Lacking such additional sampling, it seems fair to suspect from the available evidence that an exclusively human chain of transmission may have gone undetected for some months before galvanizing public attention.
