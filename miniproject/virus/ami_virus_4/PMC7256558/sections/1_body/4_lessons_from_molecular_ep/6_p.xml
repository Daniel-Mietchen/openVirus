<p id="p0145">One feature establishes, without question, the usefulness of this tree: contemporaneously sampled viruses (each depicted by its own color) are perfectly chronologically organized. In this rendering, each sample (circle) was colored to indicate when it was sampled. The “rainbow” pattern means that each virus has undergone a nearly equal amount of change. Note, too, that the viruses do not “bunch up” at the tips of the tree, but are situated throughout. We need not guess when and where ancestors lived, because we can see them. Lastly, no branches protrude to any great extent, eliminating the fear of being misled by tree artifacts introduced by recombination. Although recombination contributed to the origins of this viral group (
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Boni et al., 2020</xref>), and future recombinations cannot be discounted, this does not appear to have been a major force over this five month period. By so faithfully reproducing these samples' known chronology, this tree should earn our trust.
