 <bold>Some lineages took root outside of China.</bold> Note that clusters of viruses define foci of transmission. Some of these represent expansions outside of China. For example, a group almost exclusively composed of red dots (near the bottom of the figure) indicate a viral lineage that took root in the United States. These mostly came from the state of Washington (although Wyoming, Virginia, and other states are included in the group). Within this cluster, a few dots different to red indicate likely exports from the USA to other countries, such as Australia, Taiwan, Iceland and India. Nevertheless, inferences about epidemiological processes drawn exclusively from genome information must be taken very cautiously (
