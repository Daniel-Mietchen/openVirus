 <bold>The Global South has not been sampled nearly enough.</bold> A complete description of the virus evolution would necessitate vast and representative sampling. With diagnosed cases (as of mid-April) numbering in the millions, and in the face of untold numbers of undiagnosed cases, how much confidence should we place in trees reconstructed from only hundreds or thousands of isolates? Biologists have means to assess internal consistency, enabling many facets of the recorded history to be viewed by now as impervious to egregious sampling error. Nonetheless, it is clear that the available evidence neglects to inform us much about the epidemic. This is for lack of attention, not for lack of virus. Even in the most affluent of societies, the virus is exploiting preexisting social inequities (
 <xref rid="bb0670" ref-type="bibr">Yancy, 2020</xref>). As the virus takes root in Africa, South America, and other under-resourced regions, evolutionary epidemiologists should assume responsibility for understanding and communicating all that can be learned about how, where, when, and why the pandemic is unfolding there. The toll of this disease will be multiplied where patients cannot access therapies and where clinicians cannot protect themselves. There, the behavior of the virus may or may not parallel patterns so far described. We will not know if we do not look.
