<p id="p0135">Evolutionary trees (phylogenies) illustrate relationships among biological lineages. The tools that build such trees “work backwards” from existing sequence data, inferring the genealogical or phylogenetic relationships among them, and reconstructing which and when changes arose. There are a few basic methodologies with a plethora of different implementations which are beyond the scope of this review to detail (

 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Holder and Lewis, 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, the currently most popular and reliable methods are based either on maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Some of these methods can incorporate temporal information, at the tips and/or at internal nodes which, along with some restrictions on constancy of the evolutionary rates, global or local, can be used to date particular nodes, including the root or Most Recent Common Ancestor (MRCA) of the sequences in the tree. Differently from most other phylogenetic analyses, the time of sampling of most sequences derived in the molecular epidemiology analyses of SARS-CoV-2 is known. This allows the use of time-stamped phylogenetic trees (
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">Neher and Bedford, 2018</xref>). In these, the purely phylogenetic information is enriched with sampling time data which improves the use of genetic information from pathogens to track their spread in time and space. When the analyses include hundreds or even thousands of sequences we face a problem in analyzing the data and visualizing the results. Some convenient, easy-to-use solutions have been provided by the NextStrain Platform (

 <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Hadfield et al., 2018</xref>), but most readers need only understand that millions of alternative trees are considered and only the most compatible with the data is represented. Nothing guarantees this tree to be correct in every detail because other, similar trees enjoy nearly equivalent support.
