 <bold>Long-distance travel spread closely related viral isolates.</bold> Although most of the isolates in the group discussed above were sampled from patients in the American Pacific Northwest, a few blue dots in that group denote Australian isolates, demonstrating air travel as a powerful disseminating force. Specific introductions [i.e., from China to Germany, from Germany to Italy, from Italy to Iceland (

For example, the phylogeny accords with other evidence that the virus was introduced to Europe by early January (
