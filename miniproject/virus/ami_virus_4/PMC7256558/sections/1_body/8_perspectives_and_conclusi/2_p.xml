<p id="p0330">The current COVID-19 pandemic has impacted on many aspects of social, economic, personal, and behavioral matters of our daily life. We still do not know when we will completely recover from these effects and when life will return to be “normal”. It may never be the same as it used to be or, with luck, an effective vaccine becomes widely available and the return takes only a few months. But the pandemic has also exposed scientists and the processes of scientific advancement, by focusing on what the experts had to say about the new virus, how to control its spread, how to treat those infected, or what to expect if different social measures should be taken. It has shown that science advances through uncertainties and that different opinions and interpretations are frequent, especially when moving through unexplored fields. And a new pathogen is almost inevitably one such field and when it has such a dramatic impact on the health of so many people, the need for urgent answers puts an extraordinary, additional pressure on the daily work of scientists.</p>
