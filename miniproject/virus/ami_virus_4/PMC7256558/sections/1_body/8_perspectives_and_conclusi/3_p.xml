<p id="p0335">In little more than four months, we have learned a lot about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. We know that it is a new coronavirus, closely related to those usually found in bats and, quite oddly, in an endangered species, Malayan pangolins. But we do not know how the jump from a yet unknown intermediate species to humans occurred and how the virus was capable of being so easily and efficiently transmitted among individuals of our species. From what we have learned from other zoonotic spillovers, it seems clear that several factors have concurred in this jump, including ecological, cultural, and possible behavioral. We know that recombination is frequent in coronaviruses, including sarbecoviruses, but we do not know whether this process played a significant role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 as a new pathogen. All the evidence gathered so far undermines the possibility that the virus was created in, or escaped from, a laboratory proximate to the city where the initial infections were detected.</p>
