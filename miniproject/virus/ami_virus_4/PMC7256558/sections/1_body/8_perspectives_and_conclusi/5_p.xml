<p id="p0345">There are substantial differences in the natural history of infection. These were observed from the very start of the epidemic, with a much more severe presentation in aged persons and those with additional pathologies. Those differences have persisted but, as the number of infected persons has grown continuously, the cases of serious, even fatal, infections in younger persons have become more frequent. Nevertheless, there are still many unknowns around the differences in susceptibility, progression, and outcome of the infection by SARS-CoV-2 that, as in other infectious diseases, probably depend on a complex interaction of host, pathogen, and environmental factors. Several large-scale analyses encompassing all three kinds of factors are underway and hopefully will shed light on this critical point.</p>
