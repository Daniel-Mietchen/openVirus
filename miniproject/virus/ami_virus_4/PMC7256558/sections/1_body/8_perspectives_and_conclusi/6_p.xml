<p id="p0350">Currently, there are many additional unknowns highly relevant for the possibility of recovering a more or less “normal” lifestyle. There is no specific and highly efficient treatment yet, there are several vaccine candidates in the making but we are still at least months away from their availability for the general population. We do not even know whether those infected by SARS-CoV-2 will develop a strong immune response or a weak one and how long it will last nor whether the virus will have a seasonal behavior or will circulate all year round. In the meantime, the most important measures to prevent a generalized spread of the virus and a collapse of health systems, the main reason behind the social and economic disruption caused by COVD-19, are still social distancing, contact tracing and testing.</p>
