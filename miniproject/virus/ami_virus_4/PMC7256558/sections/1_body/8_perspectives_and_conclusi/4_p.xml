<p id="p0340">SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, even by asymptomatic and presymptomatic infected persons, which makes its spread very difficult to control. This can be observed in its fast expansion in just a few weeks to almost every country in the world and the poor efficiency of border closures, as implemented by most governments, to stop it. When these have been put in action the virus was already circulating within borders. Genomic epidemiology of the virus is allowing a “live” monitoring of the viral spread and has revealed differentiation in several lineages, some clearly resulting from ongoing local circulation, which also show the frequent exchange across borders even from distant countries and continents. Globalization shows its dark side in this fast spreading pandemic.</p>
