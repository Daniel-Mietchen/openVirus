 <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2020</xref>) also revealed clear immunological features characterizing severe cases. The overall message based on these early studies point towards the polarization of a macrophage response in the lungs associated with severe disease. Conversely, patients that recovered had increased cytotoxic T cell response compared to severe cases. Specifically, analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients using single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq) combined with T cell receptor sequences revealed a distinct population of monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages in BALF samples from patients with severe disease, while patients with mild disease presented increased levels of FABP4+ alveolar macrophages (

 <xref rid="bb0640" ref-type="bibr">Wen et al., 2020</xref>) confirmed the findings in BALF, namely that mild disease was associated to clonally expanded cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which suggest that a specific T cell response may be at play in controlling COVID-19 infection in the lungs.
