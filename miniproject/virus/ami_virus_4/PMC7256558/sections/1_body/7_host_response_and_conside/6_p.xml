<p id="p0320">From a vaccine point of view, it remains to be seen whether a strong humoral response mediated by neutralizing antibodies can be successfully mounted without side effects, and whether T cell responses could be also generated by a vaccine. Based on current knowledge it appears that severe cases are associated with a sustained, virus-specific immune response, with evidence of a hyper-inflammatory response causing severe lung damage. Notably, recent work revealed that SARS-Covid-19 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses are identified in 70% and 100% of convalescent patients, respectively, thus supporting the notion that viral specific adaptive response can be mounted and maintained (

The fact that all arms of the immune responses are activated in patients that clear the virus, while in severe disease cytokine storms occur along with lymphopenia, suggests that a broad T and B cell-based vaccine should be considered (
