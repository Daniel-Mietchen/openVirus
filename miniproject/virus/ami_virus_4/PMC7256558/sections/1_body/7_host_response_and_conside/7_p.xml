<p id="p0325">Data on SARS-CoV-2 so far revealed that several epitopes can be targeted by neutralizing antibodies response. Previous work on a SARS-CoV/macaque models investigating host response in the productively infected lungs revealed unexpected interactions between the presence of anti–spike IgG (S-IgG) prior to viral clearance and the Alveolar macrophages (
 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). The latter population was found to undergo functional polarization in acutely infected macaques, demonstrating simultaneously both proinflammatory and wound-healing characteristics. However, the presence of S-IgG prior to viral clearance, abrogated wound-healing responses and promoted MCP1 and IL-8 production and proinflammatory monocyte/macrophage recruitment and accumulation. The authors commented that patients who died of SARS displayed similarly accumulated pulmonary proinflammatory, absence of wound-healing macrophages, and faster neutralizing antibody responses, whereas blockade of FcγR reduced such effects. Therefore, vaccine development should consider possible host responses that exacerbate disease, and alternative therapies should be also considered in combination with vaccines to avoid virus-mediated lung injury.
