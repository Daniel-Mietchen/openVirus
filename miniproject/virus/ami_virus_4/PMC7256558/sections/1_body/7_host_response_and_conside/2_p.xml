<p id="p0300">There is limited knowledge on the mechanisms driving immune response against COVID-19. A recent work (
 <xref rid="bb0595" ref-type="bibr">Thevarajan et al., 2020</xref>) showed that a strong adaptive response across B and T cells was mounted during symptomatic phase in a 47-year-old woman from Wuhan, Hubei province in China, that successfully cleared the virus within two weeks. Increased antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), follicular helper T cells (TFH cells), activated CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells and immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies that bound the COVID-19-causing coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 were detected in blood before symptomatic recovery and with a peak around day 7â€“9 since onset of symptoms. These immunological changes persisted after full resolution of symptoms at day 20. These findings, based on a single subject, support the hypothesis that a rapid multi-factorial immune response against COVID-19 can be mounted within a week and with evidence of recruitment of T and B cells as well as macrophages before resolution of symptoms, and that this rapid response may correlate with positive clinical outcome.
