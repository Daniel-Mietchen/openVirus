<p>In the current COVID-19 pandemic, saving lives and increasing hospital capacity for ventilatory support are priorities for many already stretched and often overwhelmed healthcare systems. Currently, we have supportive but very limited therapeutic options for high-risk COVID-19 patients in intensive care settings. In this viewpoint we presented a theoretical framework by which ACE2 replacement or augmentation appears a rational therapeutic option for severely ill, high cardiovascular risk, no-other option COVID-19 subjects. If early phase 1/2 ACE2 replacement proves promising, then expedited compassionate off-label use might also be considered. Given that ACE2 is synthesised using recombinant manufacturing, it is likely that a number of pharmaceutical companies would have the capacity to scale up production quickly for global use.</p>
