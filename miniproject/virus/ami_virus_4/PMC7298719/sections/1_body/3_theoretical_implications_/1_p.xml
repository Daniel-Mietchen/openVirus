<p>Given that SARS-CoV-2 specifically targets ACE2 receptor and based on SARS-CoV homology and previous SARS-CoV pathology studies, it is reasonable to expect that during viremia host cells and tissues that express ACE2 in the major organs such as lungs, heart, vascular system and kidneys will be susceptible to viral infection.
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 32</xref> It is also conceivable that relative loss of ACE2 (through viral destruction) in these affected tissues at a time of increasing RAS activation may act to amplify the pathophysiological consequences of viral infection in these organs. Previous studies of SARS-CoV show viral induction of ACE2 shedding in infected cells
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and downregulation of ACE2 levels in tissues has been linked to viral replication efficiency and pathogenicity.
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Therefore, extensive viral lysis of ACE2-expressing cells may act as a tipping point in tissues ability to adequately respond via RAS/ACE2 to ensuing inflammatory, oxidative stress and ongoing cytokine-mediated cellular insults (

 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> it is conceivable that, with RAS-ACE2 homeostasis intact, the consequences of acute viral infection may not reach this threshold.
