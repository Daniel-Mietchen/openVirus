<p>Two poorly prognostic elements may thus combine in SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiovascular disease patients, namely (1) a pre-existing imbalance in RAS activity and ACE2 counter-regulation that renders this cohort susceptible to more cardiovascular complications of COVID-19 and (2) destructive targeting by SARS-CoV-2 of ACE2-expressing cells in multiple cardiovascular and other tissues leading to further critical loss of ACE2 reserve. This amplified RAS-ACE2 imbalance in COVID-19 may greatly exacerbate tissue injury and inflammation in affected organs of cardiovascular patients.</p>
