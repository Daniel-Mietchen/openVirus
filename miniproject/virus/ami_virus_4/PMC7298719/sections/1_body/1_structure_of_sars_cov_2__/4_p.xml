<p>In na√Øve humans subjects, SARS-CoV successfully evades the innate immune response and hijacks host cell metabolism through initial degradation of host mRNA and modulation of ubiquitination.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Efficient viral replication within the host cell then ensues, leading to cell damage and viral-induced cytolysis. Interestingly, comparative analysis of two successive SARS epidemics in early 2000s showed that increased affinity of the SARS virus for human ACE2 receptor strongly predicted severity of clinical disease suggesting that spike protein conformation is potentially a key determinant of virulence.
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Moreover, the spike protein present on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 facilitates host cell-to-cell fusion to form syncytia that may have potential pathological consequences for tissues such as the heart.
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Interestingly, in several Wuhan cohorts cardiac injury and arrythmia were prominent in high-risk COVID-19 subjects.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 3 4</xref> Previous SARS-CoV studies also indicated that clinical and pathological impacts of viral infection in various tissues and organs are determined not solely by viral load or tropism with respect to cell surface receptors but also by the counter-regulatory pathways within the host.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These host mechanisms include inter alia complex elements of homeostatic and inflammatory pathways, anti-apoptotic responses and the compensatory repair power or functional reserve of tissues and organs within the infected subject. The balance between these countervailing forces in SARS-CoV-2 infection may in large part determine the severity of clinical manifestation and outcome of COVID-19 in human subjects.
