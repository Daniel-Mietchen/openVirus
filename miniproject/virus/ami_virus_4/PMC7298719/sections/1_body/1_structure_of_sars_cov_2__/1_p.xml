<p>SARS-CoV-2, a positive-strand RNA virus, shares 80% genomic homology with SARS-CoV virus and initial infection is mediated through interaction of virion spike glycoprotein (S protein) with the ACE2 receptor on target cells. The S protein is cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits that act cooperatively to allow ACE2 receptor engagement and viral cell entry.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> S1, via a receptor-binding domain (RBD), binds the peptidase domain of ACE2 with the S2 subunit implicated in membrane fusion.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> S2 cleavage site activation by host transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is facilitated by a conformational change secondary to S1â€“ACE2 binding (

 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Comparative genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 suggested that it is optimised for binding to human ACE2 and in this way it exploits the membrane-bound receptor in host cells to initiate and spread infection.
