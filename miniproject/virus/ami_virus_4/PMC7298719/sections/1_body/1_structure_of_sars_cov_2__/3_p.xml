<p>Although robust histopathological data are still unavailable for organ and tissue damage in COVID-19 patients, it may be useful to look at the homologous SARS-CoV infection that shows similar ACE2 viral tropism. Pathological examination of SARS-CoV subjects has identified viral infection throughout the respiratory tract, spleen and lymph nodes, intestinal epithelium and mucosal lymphoid tissue, liver hepatocytes, tubular epithelium of the kidney, neural cells in the brain and cardiomyocytes and vascular cells within the heart.

Preliminary real-time PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in different clinical specimens shows similar widespread seeding of virus in respiratory, circulatory and gastrointestinal systems.
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Although the exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 induces cellular damage remains unknown, clinical and laboratory data from early cohort studies
