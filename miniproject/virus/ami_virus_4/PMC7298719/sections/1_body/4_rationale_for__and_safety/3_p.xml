<p>Administration of ACE2 recombinant protein in COVID-19 patients raises the question of whether this might exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection given viral tropism. All experimental data suggested that the opposite response is more likely. Despite this early phase 1/2 clinical trials should evaluate potential side effects such as hypotension, tachycardia and worsening respiratory failure with close monitoring of vital signs, respiratory parameters, electrocardiography and haematology and blood chemistry profiles. Given that ACE2 downregulation by SARS-CoV is linked to viral replication efficiency,
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33 34</xref> it is conceivable that ACE2 augmentation may reduce virulence. Importantly, rhACE2 is a soluble protein whereas SARS-CoV-2 binds to cell membrane-bound ACE2 and requires the cooperation of the TMPRSS2 protease to achieve viral cell entry. Therefore, soluble ACE2 alone is likely insufficient to allow viral infection of cells. Previous studies with SARS-CoV and more recently SARS-CoV-2 studies
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> showed that soluble ACE2 protein actually inhibits SARS-CoV-2 viral spike RBD binding to membrane ACE2 receptor. For SARS-CoV pathogenesis, ACE2 not only acts as a receptor for viral entry but also protects against local tissue injury.
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> If the same holds true for SARS-CoV-2, then soluble rhACE2 may reduce ongoing SARS-CoV-2 access to membrane-bound ACE2 receptor, alter favourably local AngII/Ang1â€“7 levels and inhibit deleterious RAS effects on remaining at risk tissues in COVID-19 patients.
