<p>ACE2 protein replacement has proven beneficial in multiple preclinical models such as hypertension, diabetic vasculopathy and renal disease, postmyocardial infarction, heart failure and especially in ARDS where RAS-ACE2 imbalance is prominent.
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10 35 36</xref> The mechanism of ACE2 benefit is likely increased metabolism of local tissue AngII and increased bioavailability of Ang1–7
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> with reduction in reactive oxidation, cell death, inflammation and endothelial cell activation. These protective activities of ACE2 may thus counteract the deleterious effects of tissue injury and associated activation of RAS. In human subjects, this has already been exploited with completion of the first pilot phase 1/2 trial of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) in ARDS.
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In this safety study, which was not powered for efficacy, rhACE2 proved safe and was well-tolerated haemodynamically with a rapid reduction in AngII and increase in Ang1–7 observed after intravenous infusion.
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Pharmacokinetic evaluation of rhACE2 in healthy volunteers supports a twice daily infusion,
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> although given a relatively short half-life it is likely that continuous infusion if tolerated would be more effective in more severely ill subjects. AngII and Ang1–7 responses to ACE2 replacement are rapid (within 30 min) so it may be feasible to identify responders and non-responders quickly, although AngII assay variability may require further study and validation.
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Moreover prescreening using AngII levels, ACE2/ACE activity ratios and prognostic ACE gene polymorphisms may further assist in risk stratification of patients more likely to respond to ACE2 therapy.
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> We proposed that existing COVID-19 subjects should have an ACE2 deficiency state confirmed prospectively by analysis of ACE2, AngII and Ang1–7 levels in low-risk and high-risk subjects with further dichotomisation based on survival or non-survival. In severe COVID-19, with no current options to save these patients, there is also a rationale for testing the ACE2 deficiency hypothesis in phase 1/2 randomised controlled trials of rhACE2 protein in subjects at high risk of death. Such risk stratification could be based on conventional intensive care unit prognostic scoring systems in addition to circulating factors that indicate poor outcomes such as elevated soluble urokinase plasminogen activator levels.
