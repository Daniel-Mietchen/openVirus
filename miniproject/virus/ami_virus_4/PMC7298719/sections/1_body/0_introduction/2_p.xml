<p>The most extensive clinical experience of this virus to date comes from the more than 80 000 positive cases identified in Hubei Province.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref> These early clinical reports clearly indicated that although most clinical manifestations of COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation are respiratory, there is a substantial minority of patients who undergo progressive and severe cardiovascular compromise.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2 4</xref> Subjects at highest risk of death appear to be more elderly patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and/or classical risk factors that accompany advanced cardiovascular illness.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The goal of this viewpoint article is to examine whether the nature of SARS-CoV2 infection and the homeostatic status of high-risk cardiovascular patients can be linked in a mechanistic framework that provides insights into corrective therapy over and above current and emergent antiviral approaches to COVID-19.
