<p>Genetic knockout studies show that under normal conditions deficiency of ACE2 has relatively modest effects on blood pressure, cardiovascular homeostasis and renal function when compared with ACE gene deletion.
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> However, under conditions of oxidative stress, sepsis, inflammation or experimental hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction or heart failure, ACE2 deficiency greatly amplifies the RAS-associated pathological phenotype in animal models

 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and greater AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and infarction,
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> whereas ACE deletion confers a modest reduction in circulating AngII, but no effect on tissue levels.
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> This would support multiple non-ACE pathways for AngII generation in the body, but limited pathways for AngII degradation, which highlights the potential importance of ACE2 disruption at a tissue level especially in states of RAS activation. Moreover, this underscores the potential of ACE2 replacement as a more potent strategy in reducing AngII and augmenting Ang1–7 compared with conventional RAS inhibition.
