<p>The dipeptide carboxypeptidase ACE metabolises angiotensin I to form angiotensin II (AngII) and AngII is subsequently metabolised by the carboxypeptidase ACE2 into the vasodilator angiotensin (1–7) (Ang 1–7).
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> While ACE and AngII have been the focus of therapeutic targeting for more than four decades,
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> ACE2 has only recently come to prominence as a major player in RAS imbalance, especially in the presence of disease. Although ACE2 shares sequence homology with the extracellular domain of ACE, it functions quite differently as a carboxypeptidase
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and is not blocked by ACE inhibitors. Therefore, ACE2 represents an endogenous counter-regulatory pathway with RAS and acts in opposition to the ACE axis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">figure 3</xref>). Indeed, in the cardiovascular system ACE2 may be more important than ACE in regulating the local effects of AngII and Ang1–7 with consequences for counter-balancing RAS activation.
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 22</xref> AngII contributes to systemic hypertension and locally promotes vasoconstriction, endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, endothelial oxidative stress, smooth muscle cell migration, proliferation and contraction and in situ thrombosis.
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> In the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), AngII is regarded as a pivotal player in vascular permeability, cytokine amplification and inflammatory cell infiltration.
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 23 24</xref> In contrast, Ang1–7 opposes local vascular effects of AngII, has antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects and attenuates vascular disease in murine models.
