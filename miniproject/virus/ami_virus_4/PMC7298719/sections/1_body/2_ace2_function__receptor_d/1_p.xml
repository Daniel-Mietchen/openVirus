<p>RAS as a signalling pathway acts as a homeostatic regulator of vascular function, and at a tissue level it regulates function within organs such as the kidney, lungs and heart.
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> At a regional level, RAS regulates blood flow to organs and controls trophic responses to a wide range of triggers including cell death, injury, inflammation, fibrosis and vascular repair.
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Many of these regulatory elements involve opposing functions to accommodate rapidly coordinated responses to local stimuli.
