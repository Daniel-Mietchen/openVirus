<p id="p0015">Patients’ metabolic conditions could therefore have a crucial role in determining the release of certain proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β). An in vitro study of ours conducted some time ago showed that monocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes and normal controls overproduced IL-1β when tested in a low-glucose milieu 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. This happened already in basal conditions, but even more in the presence of a known proinflammatory factor, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the structure of which contains glucosamine (a picture similar to the experiment conducted by Wang et al). The same did not happen under normal and high-glucose conditions, not even in the presence of LPS. On the other hand, monocytes retained their anti-inflammatory capacity by overproducing anti-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin 10 (IL-10) in response to LPS, but only in the presence of normal glucose concentrations.
