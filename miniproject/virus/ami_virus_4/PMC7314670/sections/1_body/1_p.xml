<p id="p0010">A highly contagious virus like influenza A, which causes annual flu epidemics all over the world, has been known to trigger such cytokine storms too, leading to inflammation, the need for hospitalization, and even death. The mechanisms behind such cytokine storms, that make some individuals suffer more from the flu than others, remain unclear, however. A study on influenza A virus infection in mice showed that glucose metabolism was a driving force behind the onset of the often fatal inflammatory response known as a cytokine storm. Mice treated with glucosamine produced significantly higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines than mice not given glucosamine. When researchers analyzed blood glucose levels in patients diagnosed with influenza A and healthy controls, they found that the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, by means of which a small portion of glucose is metabolized, plays an essential part in cytokine storms triggered by the influenza virus. These findings may partly explain why diabetics are at greater risk of serious complications and death from influenza and other infections. Preliminary data indicate that this appears to be the case for COVID-19 as well
