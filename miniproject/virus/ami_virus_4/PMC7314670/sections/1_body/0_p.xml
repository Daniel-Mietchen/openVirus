<p id="p0005">The COVID-19 pandemic is claiming many victims among those infected worldwide. Patients’ prognosis depends primarily, but not exclusively on their viral load. The response of the host’s immune system is partly responsible, either by default (in immunocompromised patients) or, paradoxically, by excess - when a destructive “cytokine storm” occurs in the lung as a result of an exaggerated mobilization of the host’s immune cells. This cytokine storm seems to be the most serious prognostic factor because it aggravates the inflammatory, thrombophilic state, leading to a disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) - a situation difficult to control and potentially fatal. There is no clear scientific evidence as yet to indicate what triggers a cytokine storm.</p>
