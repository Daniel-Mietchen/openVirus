<p id="p0020">It has been reported that hypoglycemic conditions induce an upregulation of the GLUT 3 glucose transporter in the plasma membrane of the monocyte-macrophage 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and that LPS amplifies GLUT 3 overexpression 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. GLUT 3 upregulation is a self-regulating mechanism to ensure an adequate glucose supply to the cells, and thus protect monocytes against the harmful effects of low glucose levels, thus amplifying inflammatory cell activation in the presence of LPS. Wright et al. showed that acute hypoglycemia induced by hyperinsulinemic clamping led to an increase in CD40 expression (an inflammatory activation index) on monocytes in type 1 diabetic patients
