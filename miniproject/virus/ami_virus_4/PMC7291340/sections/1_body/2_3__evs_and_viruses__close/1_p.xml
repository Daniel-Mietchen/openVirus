<p>In recent decades, the similarity between EVs and viral particles has become increasingly evident. Viruses and EVs share different aspects such as size, structural and biochemical composition, and the transport of bioactive molecules within cells [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Like EVs, viruses present a size ranging from 30 to 1000 nm, starting from the small ones, such as poliovirus and hepatitis A virus (HAV) particles, which possess a diameter of about 30 nm, all the way to hepatitis C virus (HCV) of about 50 nm, and HIV or SARS viruses that are about 100â€“120 nm. Finally, mimiviruses have a size of about 400 nm. Furthermore, EVs and some viruses have morphological similarities: as previously described, EVs are double-membrane-enclosed entities and enveloped viruses are also surrounded by a lipid membrane acquired from the cell. Interestingly, they possess a similar lipid composition enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol, as well as a similar protein content. Notably, both EVs and viruses carry nucleic acids; while viruses present single or double-stranded RNA or DNA genomes, which are carried and protected inside their capsid, EVs can transport a variety of nucleic acids [

 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. EVs and enveloped viruses also share similar biogenesis processes since both are generated in the endosomal network or bud from the plasma membrane using specific pathways [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For example, some retroviruses such as HIV hijack the cellular vesiculation machinery to favor their own replication and budding. In this regard, it has been reported that the endosomal sorting complex (ESCRT), the same that mediates the inward invagination of ILVs in MVBs, is also involved in the budding and release of HIV particles [

 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, just as EVs can be generated from ESCRT-independent pathways, some viruses bud from specific membrane domains [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. These domains, called lipid rafts, are enriched in glycosphingolipids, cholesterol and ceramide. In addition, proteins like tetraspanins are stored in these domains and form clusters among themselves and other transmembrane and cytosolic proteins, thus inducing inward budding of the microdomains in which they are enriched [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. As previously mentioned, specific glycocalyx compositions also play a role in vesicle release; however, glycocalyx can be also involved in other membrane processes, including the absorption of some viruses [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In this regard, some viruses have evolved to exploit specific glycans to enter cells, like human rotaviruses that bind the blood group A antigens [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Instead, in the case of HIV [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], Ebola virus [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], HCV [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], as well as influenza [
 <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) viruses [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the viruses themselves present glycans on their surface. Their presence on viral surfaces is exploited by immune cells, such as macrophages or dendritic cells, to phagocyte virions. In turn, Ebola [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and SARS viruses [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] take advantage of this anti-viral system to enter and replicate in macrophages and dendritic cells. On the other hand, glycans are also used by viruses to create a shield that hides viral epitopes to immune cells, as happens with HIV, known to have the highest density of glycans attached to its surface proteins [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], and the Lassa virus [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].
