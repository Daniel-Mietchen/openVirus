<p>The presence of multiple similarities between viruses (in particular retroviruses) and EVs, immediately triggered conjecture on the real relationship between vesicles and viruses. For this reason, two alternative theories have been proposed. The first one, called the “Trojan exosome hypothesis”, states that retroviruses are vesicles evolved following a mutation of the 
 <italic>gag</italic> gene, which was originally encoded by an integrated retro-transposon that directed its expression product towards the route of vesicle generation. In this perspective, the typical characteristics of retroviruses would have been acquired by evolutionary divergence; the pre-existing biogenesis mechanism of vesicle production would have been used to form viral particles [

It justifies the similarities, giving more importance to the phenomenon of convergent evolution, which would lead to the sharing of the same biogenesis pathways for vesicles and viruses [

However, regardless of their possible origin, these affinities certainly have a negative impact on immunological surveillance in the host, since viruses, during infections, can take advantage of these affinities for escaping the immune system by mimicking vesicle composition and behavior [
