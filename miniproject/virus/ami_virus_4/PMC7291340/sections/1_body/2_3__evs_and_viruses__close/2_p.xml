<p>The substantial overlap of the biogenesis processes provides a plausible explanation for the similar composition observed between EVs and enveloped viruses [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, both EVs and enveloped viruses can bind to the plasma membrane of recipient cells and, after fusion events, directly with the surface membrane or after endocytosis, they release their luminal cargo into the cytosol, influencing cell activity [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this respect, in a similar manner to the viral envelope proteins, EV surface proteins, such as the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), mediate the adhesion and internalization of EVs in target cells [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Therefore, both EVs and viruses can be considered as bioactive structures able to influence the cellular behavior.
