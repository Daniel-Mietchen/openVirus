<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) usually exploit modified EVs as well. For instance, EVs from CMV-infected cells deliver proteins, such as lectin and dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), involved in the capture and internalization of pathogens [
