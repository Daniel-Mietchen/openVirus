<p>EVs released from HIV-infected cells can transport viral RNAs, which stimulate Toll like receptor-8 (TLR8) signaling to promote TNFα release, which may contribute to chronic immune activation [

TAR RNA is a microRNA precursor that matures after cleaving and its products are involved in apoptosis regulation and viral replication in infected cells. Once transferred to recipient cells, TAR microRNAs enhance the downregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins, thus supporting infected cells survival [

TAR–EVs have also been reported to modulate the gene expression of different pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-β, in human macrophages. These cytokines allow the maintenance of a continuous state of activation of target cells, probably favoring the efficient entry and replication of the virus [
