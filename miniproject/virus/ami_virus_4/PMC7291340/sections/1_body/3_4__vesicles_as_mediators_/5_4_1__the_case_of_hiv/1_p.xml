<p>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus recognized as the etiological agent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a progressive pathology that induces a weakening of the host immune system. The virus is characterized by two identical copies of a positive-sense single-stranded-RNA enclosed in a viral nucleocapsid, called a core, which is surrounded by a membrane envelope [

The genome codifies for three structural protein precursors, Gag, Pol and Env, the two regulatory proteins Tat and Rev, and the four accessory proteins Nef, Vif, Vpr, and Vpu. All these factors differently contribute to the establishment of HIV infection [

The main targets of the virus are the immune cells such as T helper lymphocytes, macrophages, microglial and dendritic cells, which express on their plasma membrane the CD4 receptor used by the virus to bind and enter the cells. HIV persists inside the host, leading to a progressive impairment of the immune system because of the depletion of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T helper cells, finally resulting in AIDS [
