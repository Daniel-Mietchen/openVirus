<p>In recent years, different studies have highlighted the potential roles of EVs in HIV pathogenesis. The virus can take advantage of the endomembrane system not only by enhancing the viral biogenesis itself, but also by inducing EV biogenesis changes. These modifications may involve alterations in cargo composition, the frequency of EV release and targets, thus promoting viral spread, replication, and immune evasion (see

In this respect, different studies have showed how EVs released from infected cells can deliver the HIV co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 to other cells, making them susceptible to the viral infection, probably increasing the tropism of the virus in vivo and favoring its dissemination [
