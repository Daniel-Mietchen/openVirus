<p>Furthermore, other factors such as Ago2, miR-122 and HSP90, have been found to intensify HCV replication [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. miR-122 is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the liver tissue, representing about 70% of the total miRNA pool [
 <xref rid="B119-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. The key role of microRNAs is to regulate the translation of cellular mRNAs via their integration into a protein complex called RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) with important proteins called Argonautes (Ago), of which human cells have four types: Ago1, -2, -3 and -4 [
 <xref rid="B121-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>]. Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the effector of RNA interference (RNAi), requires and associates with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). The latter is one of the heat shock proteins (Hsps), molecular chaperones that control the folding and function of proteins. However, it is necessary to underline that these factors potentiate viral replication, but they are not essential, since their inhibition does not prevent it.
