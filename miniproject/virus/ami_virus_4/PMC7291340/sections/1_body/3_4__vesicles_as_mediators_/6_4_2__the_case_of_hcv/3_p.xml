<p>However, during an HCV infection the EV cargo is not characterized exclusively by viral components. Indeed, cytokines and additional factors, which promote an efficient viral replication, have also been detected in EVs. One of these factors is represented by microRNAs (miRNAs), 21–23 nucleotide non-coding RNA molecules that post-transcriptionally repress gene expression [

For example, EVs can transport and release miRNA-192, causing phenotypic changes in the cells because of the increased production of Transforming Growth Factor β (TGF-β). This cytokine is involved in the liver tissue maintenance of fibrogenesis and acts as a powerful activator of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). TGF-β exists in three isoforms: TGF-β1, -2, -3, but the most representative of the fibrogenic pathways in the liver is TGF-β1 [

The latter usually reduces the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) thanks to the production of MMP inhibitors (TIMPs), which block the activity of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). However, the altered production of TGF-β leads to an increased transcription of pro-fibrotic molecules, such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen type I (COL1), through pathways involving MAPKs, JNK and Akt. These events finally cause the excessive formation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is responsible for the development of fibrous tissue [
