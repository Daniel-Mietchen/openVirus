<p>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) is a human virus belonging to 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, characterized by a positive single-stranded RNA of about 9.6 kb. The HCV genome codifies a precursor protein that is cleaved in ten viral proteins, including the core protein p22, the two glycoproteins of the viral envelope (i.e., E1 and E2) and the non-structural ones. This virus has hepatic tropism and it represents one of the main causes of liver damage, since it provokes chronic hepatitis in about 80% of infected people. The pathogenesis is mainly caused by an alteration of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors, which favor the production of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and decrease its degradation by means of metalloproteases (MMPs). These events lead to liver fibrosis that, in a variable percentage of cases, can evolve into cirrhosis and in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00571-f003">Figure 3</xref>). As previously mentioned, a peculiarity of EVs is their ability to transfer the virus, or parts of it, to other “naive” cells, thus becoming a vehicle of viral transmission [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. It is known that viral progeny is usually composed by infective and defective viral particles. The latter, because of random mutations, may not necessarily lead to a productive infection. In these respects, the vesicular transport can represent a real advantage for the virus, because EVs can compensate for some shortcomings [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. For instance, when viral particles defective in anchoring glycoproteins were carried inside EVs, they could enter target cells by means of cellular proteins present on EV membranes. In this way, EVs would allow the establishment of a productive infection for defective particles. Furthermore, different studies reported that HCV exploits the cellular vesicular pathway for the assembly and release of viral particles [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], and HCV-infected cells release vesicles containing E1 and E2 envelope proteins [
 <xref rid="B115-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>], the entire viral genome [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>], or even entire viral particles [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. These vesicles, once they enter target cells, can establish a productive infection exactly as with free viral particles [
 <xref rid="B118-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Considering these data, we can imagine that EVs could represent an interesting and important advantage, from an evolutionary point of view, in the generation of viral “quasispecies”. The latter are collections of closely related viral genomes generated upon replication of RNA viruses, including HCV, and subjected to a continuous process of genetic variation and competition among the variants generated. Only the variants that fit best in a given environment are selected [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. In this context, the EV cargo could help to establish a productive infection for those genomic variants that, otherwise, would be negatively selected due to the accumulated mutations that are incompatible with a successful infection. In this way, EVs might favor the survival of a major number of viral particles.
