<p>Some viruses do not influence the encapsulation of viral proteins into vesicles, but control the packaging of host factors (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00571-f001">Figure 1</xref>d). This occurs in the case of Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8). EVs released by KSHV-infected cells are enriched in metabolic proteins, such as lactate dehydrogenase, and in proteins affecting the immune system such as the cleaved forms of IL-1 and IFI16 [
