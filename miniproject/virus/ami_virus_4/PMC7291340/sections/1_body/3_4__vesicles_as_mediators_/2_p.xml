<p>Another well-known example is Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV), a DNA virus that exploits vesicular production to block the antiviral response. As happens in HIV and HCV infections, EBV-infected cells release vesicles enriched with viral proteins, including Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1), a pro-oncogenic protein that acts as deregulator of cellular transduction pathways by promoting EBV-infected B lymphocyte transformation and immortalization, as well as a global immune modulation [

 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. LMP1 was found in vesicles collected from in vitro infected cells and from serum of patients with EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma [

 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. A common belief is that LMP1 is selectively charged into EVs thanks to its localization in lipid rafts and its interaction with CD63, a well-known tetraspanin abundantly found in vesicles [

 <xref rid="B72-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. LMP1-containing EVs secreted by B cells inhibit T and natural killer (NK) cell proliferation, thus reducing the immune response against the virus [

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Also, these EVs upregulate the expression of adhesion molecules in uninfected cells, increasing their susceptibility to the infection [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Moreover, EVs released from EBV-infected cells can contain viral nucleic acids [

 <xref rid="B77-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. In particular, different RNAs have been found: miR-BART15-3p, which induces apoptosis in target cells, including the immune ones [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]; miRNA BHRF1, which suppresses the expression of the chemokine CXCL11 involved in antiviral activity [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]; the non-coding RNAs, EBER1 and EBER2, that support the survival and carcinogenesis of infected cells by avoiding cell apoptosis [
