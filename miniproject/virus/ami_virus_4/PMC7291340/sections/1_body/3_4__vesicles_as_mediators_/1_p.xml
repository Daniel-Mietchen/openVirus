<p>Studies conducted on exosomes and other EVs, isolated during a variety of infections caused by bacteria, parasites and viruses, have evidenced changes in the composition and biological activity of EVs [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In recent years, the relevance of vesicles in viral infections has been strongly highlighted, because EVs may incorporate viral proteins and/or fragments of viral RNAs, carrying them from infected cells to target ones [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Importantly, even if the viral hijacking of EVs contributes to create a suitable environment for viral survival through the suppression and evasion of the immune response, EVs can be involved in the induction of an antiviral response. Therefore, vesicles can play a dual role—both supporting viral spreading and inducing immunological protection [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Next we focused our attention on how vesicles can support viruses during infections. Some picornaviruses, such as HAV, Coxsackie B virus and Enterovirus 71 (EV71), can be released inside vesicles [

EV enveloped viruses probably take advantage of the membrane coating to avoid the recognition by neutralizing antibodies. In addition, these viruses could use cellular surface proteins to extend their own tropism, thus succeeding in reaching the most disparate districts in the host [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Instead, HIV and HCV seem to exploit EVs both directly and indirectly. They directly manipulate the machinery of vesicular biogenesis to enhance viral replication. Indirectly, they can charge exosomes and other vesicles with different viral components, thus favoring viral pathogenesis [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00571-f001">Figure 1</xref>b,c). The dynamics of the influence of EVs on HIV and HCV infection will be discussed later and in detail.
