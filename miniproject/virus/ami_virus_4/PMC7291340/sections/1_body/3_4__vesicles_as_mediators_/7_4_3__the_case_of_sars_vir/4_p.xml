<p>Although these second-millennium CoVs are some of the most pathogenically virulent human viruses in the world and a lot of research has been conducted on the first two, they are relatively new and thus there are several unanswered questions. For instance, the relationship between CoVs and EVs is still unclear and barely explored. In this respect, studies carried out on viral proteins and replicative strategies of these viruses suggest that CoVs hijack the vesicular release pathway in some way. It is possible to speculate that CoVs could influence EV release and composition (see

Several research groups reported that coronavirus replication is strictly linked to intracellular vesicle formation, and the replicative complex binds the intracellular membrane, leading to the formation of vesicular structures. Two different vesicular structures have been identified: the first one corresponds to single-membrane spherules that are formed in membranous organelles, such as ER, peroxisomes or endosomes [

 <xref rid="B158-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. The generation process of these structures is still not fully understood. Some research groups suggested that DMV formation could be correlated with the viral hijacking of the host’s autophagy machinery [

 <xref rid="B160-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. However, it is a common idea that different viral Nsps, thanks to their transmembrane domains and the fact that they are anchored to the membrane, can promote the formation of these structures. Interestingly, Nsp3, Nsp4 and Nsp6 SARS proteins are able to induce the formation of bilayer membrane vesicles in tissue cultures. Indeed, both the exogenous treatment with Nsp3 protein and the endogenous expression of Nsp3, Nsp4 and Nsp6 proteins may perturb the membrane network [
