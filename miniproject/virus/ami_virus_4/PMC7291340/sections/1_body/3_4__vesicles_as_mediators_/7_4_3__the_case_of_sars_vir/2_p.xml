<p>The interaction of the CoV S glycoprotein with its surface receptor is essential to determine the cellular host tropism. MERS-CoV S protein binds the human receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) or adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2, which is expressed on the surface of the cells of the airway system. A work carried out during the first SARS-CoV epidemic identified the human host factor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="B133-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. The main host protease, which mediates S protein activation in primary target cells and allows viral entry, is the Type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) [

 <xref rid="B141-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>]. ACE2 has a protective effect on lung safeguarding from acute injury in mouse models. The binding with SARS-CoV S induces a downregulation of ACE2 surface expression, and this mechanism possibly contributes to the severe pathogenesis of SARS viruses [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. The immune response against CoVs has an important impact on the development of the pathogenesis. Indeed, in severe cases of SARS, the pathology is correlated to the hyperactivation of innate immune signaling. This event occurs in the abnormal production of interferons and high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL-10 and TNFα, which contribute to the lung damage. In patients with severe SARS disease, aberrant IFN, Interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs), and cytokine responses were observed compared to healthy individuals, thus providing evidence that SARS is an innate immune response-regulated disease [

 <xref rid="B144-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] have described that ACE2 is an ISG in specific human, but not murine, airway epithelial cells. Indeed, by treating primary human upper airway basal cells with distinct types of inflammatory cytokines, they unexpectedly observed that IFN-α drives the

 <xref rid="B144-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. This potential strategy employed by SARS-CoV-2 could represent a unique challenge for the human host, as well as for HCoV-OC43, which targets the two restriction factors IFITM2 and IFITM3 [

 <xref rid="B144-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. Carefully controlled clinical trials will be essential to determine the overall effects of different IFNs [
