<p>Other CoV proteins are involved in membrane morphological modifications. For instance, the S2 subunit of the spike glycoprotein, which is involved in the cellular attachment, possesses various membranotropic segments that induce membrane perturbation and could allow membrane negative curvature [

Additionally, it was reported that M and E glycoproteins can promote, by themselves, the formation and release of 100 nm “vesicles”, morphologically indistinguishable from viral particles. These data confirm the possibility of the production of nucleocapsidless particles during CoV infection [
 <xref rid="B164-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. As reported for other viruses, the production of vesicles together with the viral progeny could be a useful strategy to mask viral particles and transport viral factors to uninfected cells. In conclusion, these observations suggest that CoVs, like other viruses, exploit the cellular pathways to produce EVs, even if, to date, there is no clear evidence of their induction during CoV infection in vivo.
