<p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to a large family of enveloped RNA viruses involved in various respiratory syndromes. The name coronavirus derives from their characteristic electron microscopy appearance. They have a typical round “fringe” that recalls the solar corona, which surrounds a spherical enveloped particle containing the positive single-stranded RNA genome. The latter is complexed with the N viral protein, thus forming a helical symmetrical nucleocapsid complex [

 <xref rid="B125-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. This type of viruses was known to cause mild to moderate diseases in humans, often characterized by cold-like symptoms and more rarely by the development of severe respiratory syndromes. However, some previously unknown species have caused epidemics with severe clinical conditions in the new millennium. This is the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in southern China at the end of 2002; the Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012; and now the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which originated in the city of Wuhan in China in December 2019 [
