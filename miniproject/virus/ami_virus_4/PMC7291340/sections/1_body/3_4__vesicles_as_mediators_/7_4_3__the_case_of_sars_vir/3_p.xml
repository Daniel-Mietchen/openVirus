<p>After binding to cell surface receptors, CoVs enter cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently, the translation occurs and two large polyproteins are produced and cleaved. Different nonstructural proteins (Nsps), with enzymatic activity that are involved in the genome replication and expression, are generated. The Nsps are recruited together with host cell proteins to form the membrane-associated replication and transcription complexes (RTCs). The presence of RTCs allows the accumulation of different mRNAs that are translated in structural and non-structural viral proteins. Once they are produced in sufficient amounts, the virus is assembled and buds on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi, where the membrane M, E and S viral proteins are accumulated. Finally, viral particles are released into the lumen of host cell membranous compartments and, afterwards, virions are released into the extracellular space via secretory pathways [
