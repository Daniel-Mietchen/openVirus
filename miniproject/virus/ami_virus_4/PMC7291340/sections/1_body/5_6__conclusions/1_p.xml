<p>EVs are important mediators of cell-to-cell communication both in physiological and pathological conditions. Their importance is due to EVs’ capacity to transport different biological molecules such as lipids, proteins, or nucleic acids to target cells, where they can promote a wide range of effects. Many studies have suggested that EVs and viruses are not so distant as one might imagine and, in some respects, they seem to be close relatives. During infections, many viruses take advantage of EVs by hijacking their vesicular biogenesis machinery; they modify EVs by incorporating specific viral factors that contribute to create a suitable environment for viral infection. HIV, HCV and SARS viruses are three representative examples of how viruses, in different ways, can exploit EV production to favor their survival and diffusion. As reported in this review, different structural proteins such as Gag and gp120 for HIV, the proteins E1 and E2 for HCV, and the proteins E and M for coronaviruses, have been detected inside EVs, probably as a consequence of their involvement in viral budding [

 <xref rid="B164-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. The generation of vesicles like viral particles during the infection could be a helpful strategy for the virus to avoid recognition by the immune system. Moreover, EVs can transport non-structural proteins and other viral factors, such as Nef [

 <xref rid="B110-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], or even the entire viral genome as in the case of HCV [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Both HIV and HCV are able to hijack the cellular system by redirecting cellular proteins and nucleic acids into EVs to create an appropriate environment for their own replication and spread. For example, HIV–EVs transport the viral co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 to other cells to extend the pool of target cells available for the virus [

 <xref rid="B100-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>], whereas HCV-EVs are charged with Ago2 and miRNAs [

 <xref rid="B120-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. The delivery of cellular and viral proteins through EVs exerts multiple effects on target cells. HIV-TAR RNA, for example, produces microRNAs with anti-apoptotic effects, helping the survival of infected cells [
 <xref rid="B110-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], whereas HIV-Nef EVs and HCV-Ago2-miRNA122 EVs act in target cells by enhancing viral replication. Moreover, HIV–EVs containing Nef, ADAM17 or TAR RNA and HCV-EVs with miRNA-192 and miRNA-19a have been associated to the perturbation of the cytokine/chemokine network [

 <xref rid="B120-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. Many of these effects allow the preservation of cell activation, thus favoring viral entry and replication, and often contributing to the progression of the pathogenesis. To date, few in-depth studies concerning vesicles and coronaviruses have been reported in the literature, since these viruses have only recently attracted the interest of the scientific community. Therefore, this field is certainly open to new studies and coronaviruses could significantly affect EV content. Finally, viral EVs not only help pathogens, but they are also recognized and used by the host to induce innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections. Ongoing research will pave the way for therapeutic and/or prophylaxis strategies that exploit EVs.
