<p>To date, some studies have used EVs-based therapeutics to treat diseases by engineering EVs with full-length proteins that were effective in inducing specific, unrestricted cytotoxic T cell (CTL) immunity when injected in mice. Specifically, they use a DNA vector for the expression of HIV-1 Nefmut peptide fused with human papillomavirus E7 viral antigen. Nefmut peptide allows the anchoring of the antigen to EV membranes and increases the production of vesicles in target cells. The intramuscular injection of the vector prompts the spontaneous production of EVs charged with the foreign protein fused to Nefmut, which appears to induce an important immunological response [

Subsequently, the same group explored the possibility to use this vesicle-based vaccine platform with different viral antigens such as Ebola virus VP24, VP40 and NP, Influenza virus NP, HCV NS3 and others. All the antigens tested were detected in engineered EVs that triggered the expected immunological response [

Another research group has proposed the engineering of the SARS-CoV S protein with VSV-G protein to generate an expressing vector for a chimeric receptor protein, because the S wild type protein of SARS was not detected in vesicles isolated from transfected HEK293 cells. Through transfection procedures, they obtained a cell population expressing the fusion protein and producing EVs charged with the S chimeric protein. When engineered EVs were injected in mice, the induction of high levels of neutralizing antibodies was observed [
