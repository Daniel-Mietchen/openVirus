<p>Furthermore, EVs released from infected cells can be charged with cellular proteins that have potent antiviral activities. This is the case of APOBEC3G, a cytidine deaminase that has an important role in restricting HIV replication. In infected cells, APOBEC3G is counteracted by the expression of the viral accessory protein Vif. The latter mediates the polyubiquitination and rapid proteasomal degradation of ABOBEC3G, thus preventing its incorporation into the progeny virus nucleocapsid. Uninfected cells can transport APOBEC3G through EVs to infected cells, in which it deaminates deoxycytidines in the minus-DNA strand that is formed during reverse transcription. This results in a high rate of nucleotide base substitutions (G-to-A transition) or the premature termination of reverse transcription that is incompatible with viral viability [
