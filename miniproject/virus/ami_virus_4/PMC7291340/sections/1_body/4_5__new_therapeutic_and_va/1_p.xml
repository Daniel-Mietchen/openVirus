<p>EVs are not only vehicles that can promote viral progression and pathogenesis, but are also important immunostimulatory structures acting as mediators of immune responses. In this regard, it was found that vesicles from dendritic cells (DCs), carrying the major histocompatibility complexes MHC-I and -II, as well as costimulatory molecules such as CD80 and CD86, can induce CD8
 <sup>+</sup> and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte activation [

In the context of infections, for instance, the transport of viral components can make EVs a double-edged sword: on the one hand, they support viral spreading and pathogenesis, while, on the other hand, they can potentially transfer viral antigens to immune cells and be responsible for the induction of adaptive immunity that is able to counteract the viral spreading [
