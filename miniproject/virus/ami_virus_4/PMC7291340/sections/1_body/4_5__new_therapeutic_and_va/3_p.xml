<p>The growing body of evidence indicating the capability of EVs to promote an immune response increased interest in the use of vesicles as potential therapeutic or diagnostic tools. In this regard, EVs are considered excellent biomarker candidates that hold great potential for the detection of many pathological conditions, due to their ability to alter their cargo according to different cell stimuli. Moreover, since EVs are present in many biological fluids, they are easily accessible for liquid biopsy [

In fact, EVs offer distinct advantages as gene therapy delivery vectors since they possess cellular membranes with multiple adhesive proteins on their surface. Their small size and flexibility enable them to cross major biological barriers, such as the bloodâ€“brain barrier. Their potential utility in drug delivery is also due to their intrinsic homing capacity. Unlike liposome formulations and lentiviral-based delivery systems, EVs are naturally secreted by cells and thus they possess a high biocompatibility, safety and stability in circulation, which allow them to overcome many of the limitations of cell-based therapeutics. In this regard, it was demonstrated that EVs are able to deliver the anti-inflammatory agent curcumin that, in this form, was found to be more stable than free curcumin [
