<p>Based on their biogenesis, EVs have been divided into three subgroups: exosomes, microvesicles and apoptotic bodies. Exosomes correspond to intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), which are generated in late endosomes by the inward invagination of their membranes, giving rise to the formation of high-density structures named multivesicular bodies (MVBs). Once formed, ILVs can meet two different fates: they can be degraded when MVBs fuse with lysosomes, or they can be released into the extracellular space upon fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane. In the latter case, ILVs are called exosomes (size between 30–150 nm) (reviewed by [
