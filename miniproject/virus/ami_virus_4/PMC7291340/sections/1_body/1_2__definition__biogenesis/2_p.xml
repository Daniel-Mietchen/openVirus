<p>Among the different types of EVs, exosomes are the best characterized. However, the processes leading to the generation of ILVs in MVBs and their fusion with the plasma membrane are not completely known. To date, two independent pathways have been proposed. The first one is accomplished by components of the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT), a molecular machinery made up by four multiprotein complexes (ESCRT-0, -I, -II, -III) and accessory proteins (i.e., Alix and VPS4) [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The second pathway for the biogenesis of exosomes is ESCRT-independent and involves tetraspanins (such as CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD82), a superfamily of proteins characterized by four transmembrane domains, and lipid molecules, such as ceramide, a conic lipid that facilitates membrane invagination [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The biogenesis of microvesicles differs considerably from that of exosomes. Prior to their shedding at the plasma membrane, cytoplasmic protrusions are generated by the cell, which undergoes fission events and, finally, microvesicles pinch off the cellular membrane [

The mechanisms underlying these shedding events are not well elucidated yet; however, microdomain-induced budding processes seem to be involved in their secretion. Recently, Shurer and colleagues suggested also a role for glycocalyx in regulating curved membrane features and driving the secretion of EVs ranging in size from approximately 100 nm to 400 nm [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. According to what was reported by Shurer et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], the glycocalyx would enable cytoskeletal filaments to extend and stabilize thin protrusions from the plasma membrane, and then spontaneous curvature imposed by the glycocalyx would induce the formation of membrane pearls that spontaneously fissure to release vesicles.
