<p>The important role played by EVs as potent vehicles of intercellular communication is mainly linked to their ability to carry a wide range of biological macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Regarding nucleic acids, DNA fragments, single and double-stranded DNAs, mitochondrial DNA and RNA species, such as mRNAs, miRNAs and a great variety of small non-coding RNAs, have been detected in EVs [

Representative examples are Interleukins 1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, both secreted upon inflammasome activation, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), IL-32 and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) family members. Interestingly, Interferon family members (IFNs) have also been detected in EVs (for a comprehensive review, see [
