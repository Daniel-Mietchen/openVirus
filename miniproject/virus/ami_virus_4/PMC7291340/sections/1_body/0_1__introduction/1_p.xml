<p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heterogeneous and polyhedral lipid bilayer-enclosed structures released by healthy, malignant or infected cells into the extracellular environment, with different origins, sizes and compositions [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Soon after their first observation by Chargaff and West in 1940s, EVs were considered as mere cellular “dust”. Gradually, numerous studies have recognized them as multi-molecular messengers acting in both autocrine and paracrine manners, and even at great distance, modifying the activity and/or phenotype of recipient cells [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. EVs have been isolated from most cell types and biological fluids including blood, urine, saliva, breast milk, and cerebrospinal and synovial fluid [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In physiological conditions, they are involved in antigen presentation [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], neuronal communication and protection [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], blood coagulation [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], wound healing [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], sperm maturation [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and regulation of the immune response against the fetus during pregnancy [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. On the other hand, EVs play a key role also in pathogenic processes including cancer [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], autoimmune diseases [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], inflammation [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], as well as in viral infections [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00571" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Pathogens like viruses seem to take advantage of the natural inclination of host cells to release EVs to transport their own genetic material or proteins, thus avoiding their recognition as non-self-molecules by the immune system. Therefore, EVs can play significant roles during viral infections by promoting the survival and propagation of the virus inside the host.
