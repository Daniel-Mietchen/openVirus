  <p>Schematic representation of EVs released by HIV-infected cells. EVs derived from HIV-infected cells carry both viral and host cell components that favor viral spreading and HIV-associated immune pathogenesis. Regarding host proteins, EVs transfer the two co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4, used by the virus to mediate its entry, to null cells. Among viral components, EVs carry the proteins Gag, gp120 and Nef, as well as Trans-Activation Response (TAR) RNA, a pre-microRNA that produces mature microRNAs. Nef protein also induces the uploading into EVs of ADAM17/TACE, a TNFÎ± converting enzyme. Nucleus (N); endoplasmic reticulum (ER); Golgi complex (G).</p>
