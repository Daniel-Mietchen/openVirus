  <p>EVs are vehicles for the communication between infected and uninfected cells. During viral infections, virus enters cells and exploits the vesicular biogenesis machinery to release EVs, microvesicles (MV) and exosomes (Exo) with a modified composition to favor its own pathogenesis. EVs can carry (
   <bold>a</bold>) entire viral particles; (
   <bold>b</bold>) different viral proteins, such as the envelope ones; (
   <bold>c</bold>) nucleic acids including viral genomes, microRNAs and small non-coding RNAs and (
   <bold>d</bold>) host cell proteins, whose production is induced by the virus. Finally, EVs are internalized through different mechanisms and their luminal content released into the cytosol of the recipient cells. Nucleus (N); endoplasmic reticulum (ER); Golgi complex (G); multivesicular bodies (MVB); intraluminal vesicles (ILVs).
