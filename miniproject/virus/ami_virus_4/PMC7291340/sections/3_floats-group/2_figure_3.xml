  <p>Schematic representation of EVs released by HCV-infected cells. EVs derived from HCV-infected cells carry both viral and host cell components that promote viral dissemination and immune pathogenesis. HCV-EVs carry entire viral particles, thus hiding them to immune system and allowing the virus to enter the recipient cells using uncanonical receptors. In addition, HCV-EVs transfer the glycoproteins E1 and E2, viral genomes as well as miRNAs, such as miRNA-19a, miRNA-192 and miRNA-122, and host proteins including Argonaute 2 (Ago2), the effector of RNA interference (RNAi) that associates with Hsp90. Nucleus (N); endoplasmic reticulum (ER); Golgi complex (G).</p>
