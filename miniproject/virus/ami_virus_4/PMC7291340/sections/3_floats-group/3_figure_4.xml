  <p>Schematic representation of EVs released by coronavirus (CoV)-infected cells. CoVs hijack the cellular machinery to favor their replication. CoVs proteins promote the formation into the cytosol of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that are associated to the replication and transcription complexes (RTCs) where the viral replication occurs. After the production of structural and non-structural proteins, the budding can take place from Golgi and ER membranes. Subsequently, viral particles are released into the extracellular space by exploiting the vesicular network. In addition to viral particles, CoVs induce the release of vesicles carrying the viral envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins. To date, there are not clear evidences of vesicles released by CoV-infected cells transporting other viral or host factors. Nucleus (N); endoplasmic reticulum (ER); Golgi complex (G).</p>
