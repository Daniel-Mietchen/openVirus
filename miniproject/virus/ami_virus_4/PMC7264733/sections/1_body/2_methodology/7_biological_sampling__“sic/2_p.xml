<p>To assess the presence of viral pathogens within the cough airflow, 2 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane filter cassettes (1 µm pore size) were attached to sampling pumps operating at 4000 ± 40 mL/min (SKC Inc, Airchek 224‐PCXR3). The filter cassettes were suspended within the chamber at distances of 
 <italic>x</italic> = 0.5 m and 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 m from the mouth of the subject, along the chamber centerline. Air sampling was performed concurrently with the HWA measurements, and the pumps drew air onto the filters for a period of 15 minutes after the 3 coughs were performed to collect any virus‐laden droplets or aerosols that were expired. Assuming the cough enters horizontally, it is expected that the largest droplets to reach the sampling location at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 m would be approximately 34 µm.

 </xref> A mid‐turbinate swab (MTS) specimen was also self‐collected immediately prior to the experiments to identify and verify the illness experienced by a subject. The filters and MTS were shaken for 10 seconds within a vial of UTM viral transport medium by a vortex shaker. The vials were stored at −80°C in a freezer until they were shipped, on dry ice, for analysis at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and Research Institute: University of Toronto by the Department of Microbiology, Division of Infectious Diseases. The identity of all pathogens was determined by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR) from a panel of respiratory viruses. Biological sampling was not performed during “convalescent” trials, or throughout experiments with the group of “healthy” control subjects.
