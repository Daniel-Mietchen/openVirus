<p>The time histories were extracted at the cough jet center, as well as at the chamber centerline and the HWA location, 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1 m away from the subject. After examining the velocity contours and vector arrays, the cough jet center was defined as the midpoint of the cough, where the greatest velocities are present (a typical cough is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="ina12680-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). If no jet center was evident, the cough was not used for analysis. Coughs were also excluded from the analysis if, at each extraction location, the peak velocity was below 0.20 m/s, because low velocities made it impossible to distinguish the jet boundaries and locations required for this analysis. The peak velocity was calculated after subtracting the residual air motion present within the chamber prior to the arrival of the cough. This quantity was usually measured to be approximately 0.05 m/s.
