<p>In the experiments conducted in 2013‐14, much of the cough flow missed the small field of view in some trials, and many coughs missed completely. To contain the entire width of the cough within the imaged window and due to a necessary change in the camera used, a new field of view was selected for the experiments conducted in 2017‐18 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ina12680-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Both windows were centered at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1 m downstream from the participant, and they were translated downward to compensate for the typically downward initial cough trajectory.

 </xref> A recursive Nyquist cross‐correlation algorithm was used, in TSI Insight 4G software, to process images into velocity vector arrays. A final spot dimension of 32 × 32 pixels was used for the 2013‐14 images, whereas it was increased to 64 × 64 pixels to compensate for the decrease in spatial resolution from 10.0 to 6.87 pixels/mm. Since the camera is farther from the laser sheet, increasing the field of view, a larger final spot dimension is necessary to ensure the proportion of validated vectors is over 85%. Eighty image pairs are recorded for each cough, allowing enough time for the cough to pass the field of view completely. The time at which the cough first reaches the measurement location was set to be
