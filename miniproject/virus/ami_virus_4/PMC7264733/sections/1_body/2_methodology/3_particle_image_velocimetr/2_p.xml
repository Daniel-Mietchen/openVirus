<p>PIV has commonly been used as a non‐intrusive technique to measure airflow fields due to its accuracy and spatial resolution. For PIV experiments, the chamber was seeded with aerosolized titanium dioxide (TiO
 <sub>2</sub>) particles (ranging between 0.15 and 0.47 µm with 69% of particles between 0.34 and 0.43 µm) that were dried in a vacuum oven. The particles were stored in a drum, which was placed on top of a loudspeaker that vibrated to aerosolize the powder. The seeding particles were carried into the chamber from the drum by a 30 kPa airline. Particles were illuminated by a 120 mJ per pulse, 532‐nm Nd:YAG laser, which was directed through an angled mirror and a cylindrical/spherical lens assembly to create a laser sheet (~1 mm thickness). Each pulse has a duration of 3‐5 ns, and synchronized image pairs were recorded by a CCD camera at a frequency of 15 Hz (2017‐18 experiments) and 16.7 Hz (2013‐14 experiments).

 <italic>t</italic> = 100 µs was used, while laser pulse delay and PIV exposure times of 400 and 405 µs were selected, respectively. Overall, a velocity uncertainty of 0.04 m/s was associated with the sum of pixel errors. Based on the approximate average peak measured velocity of
