<p>The recruitment procedures were approved by Western's Research Ethics Board (REB approval no. 108945). Subjects with influenza‐like illnesses were referred to the study after making an appointment to see a physician at Western Student Health Services. Following referral, subjects completed a questionnaire to determine whether they were eligible to participate in experiments. Participants needed to be between 18 and 35 years of age, and in the last 24 hours, they should have experienced a fever and cough/sore throat in the absence of any other known cause of illness (eg, allergies). Anyone who was immunocompromised, had underlying cardiopulmonary conditions, was pregnant, or smoked was excluded from the study. A total of 21 presumably ill subjects were recruited during the flu seasons of 2013‐14, 2016‐17, and 2017‐18. Measurements were recorded for “sick” trials, while the subjects were ill, and when they had recovered, the subjects returned for a set of “convalescent” experiments. Thirty‐seven healthy control subjects were recruited outside of the flu season.</p>
