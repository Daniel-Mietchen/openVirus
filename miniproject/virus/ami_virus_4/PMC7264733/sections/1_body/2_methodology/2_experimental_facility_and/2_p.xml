<p>The experimental chamber

 </xref> consisted of a 1.81 m × 1.81 m × 1.78 m enclosure, with all interior surfaces painted black, except for a glass window allowing optical access and a glass panel in the center of the chamber (Figure 
 <xref rid="ina12680-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The dimensions of the chamber were selected so that the cough airflow was not noticeably influenced by the chamber walls. A pear‐shaped opening, with a padded head rest and chin rest, fixed the participant's head in place, but allowed the participant to cough into the chamber with their nose and mouth unobstructed. Subjects were asked to cough 3 times each in separate particle image velocimetry (PIV) and hot‐wire anemometry (HWA) experiments with aerosol sampling. Participants waited for approximately 2 minutes between coughs to minimize the residual air motion within the chamber.
