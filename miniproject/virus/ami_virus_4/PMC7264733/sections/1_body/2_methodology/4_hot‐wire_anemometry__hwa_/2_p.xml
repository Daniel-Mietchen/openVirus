<p>HWA was used to measure the instantaneous velocity magnitude at single location. A constant temperature anemometry (CTA) unit was attached to a probe containing a tungsten wire 1.25 mm long and 5 µm in diameter, and voltage readings were recorded at a rate of 1 kHz. The system was calibrated for low airflow speeds using a specialized facility detailed in Mohamed.

 <italic>x</italic> = 1.00 m downstream from the mouth of the participant, 
 <italic>y</italic> = −0.17 m below the inlet centerline, since preliminary trials had indicated that the cough jet traveled along a slightly downward trajectory. A moving average filter was applied to the measurements to filter out high‐frequency fluctuations and noise. The size of the averaging window was selected such that further increasing the window size did not substantially alter the root mean square of velocity fluctuations about the moving average. This occurred when the averaging window was approximately 
 <italic>N</italic> = 200 samples, or 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0.2 s. The HWA velocity time histories were normalized by the same method described earlier. The maximum overall combined standard uncertainty for HWA velocity measurements was determined to be 5.4% using the root sum square method described by Coleman and Steele.
