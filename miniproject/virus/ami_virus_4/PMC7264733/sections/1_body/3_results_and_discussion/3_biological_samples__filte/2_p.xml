Overall, the percentage of subjects with a confirmed respiratory virus (57%) was very good considering the recruitment methods. A recruitment strategy based on self‐referral may have resulted in an increased number of subjects, but it is expected that such a strategy would have resulted in a much greater proportion of negative results. While several investigations have demonstrated the presence of viral particles within the cough aerosols of human subjects,

 </xref> no viral RNA was detected on any of the PTFE filters. It is possible that the virus‐containing aerosols or droplets were directed past the sampling locations due to the strength and angle of the cough. Another important reason is that the total mass of liquid expelled as droplets was very low (approximately 1‐4 mg per cough).

 </xref> Since the sampling method relied on the deposition of aerosolized particles or droplets onto the filter surface, only the smaller droplets and nuclei could be collected. With such techniques, there is also a possibility that a virus could be destroyed upon contact with the membrane surface.
