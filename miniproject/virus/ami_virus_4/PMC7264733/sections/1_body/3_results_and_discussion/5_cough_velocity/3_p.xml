<p>A 
 <italic>t</italic> test with a significance level of 
 <italic>α</italic> = .05 did not show a statistically significant difference in the peak cough velocity magnitude, 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>peak</sub>, between each cohort. Similar values were noticed for the average peak instantaneous velocities at the cough center, at HWA location, and along the inlet centerline (Tables 
 <xref rid="ina12680-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ina12680-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>) between cohorts, so it is expected that if more participants were recruited, and a greater number of coughs were analyzed, the average peak values would converge. Although the average velocities appear to be slightly lower in the 2013‐14 study, this slight variation may have occurred since the head and chin rest that fixes the participant's head in place was not present in the earlier study. This could have changed the trajectory of each cough and affected the measured velocity. Table 
 <xref rid="ina12680-tbl-0006" ref-type="table">6</xref> shows the resulting 
 <italic>P</italic> values obtained for the comparisons between the sick cohort and the healthy group, convalescent group, and a group containing both. These values represent the probability that the average 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>peak</sub> is the same between the groups indicated for each comparison. The obtained values are very high compared with the significance level. This indicated a strong possibility that the differences between the groups were obtained due to chance rather than a true difference in the strengths of the coughs between groups.
