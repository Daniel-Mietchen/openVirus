<p>The peak velocity magnitude, 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>peak</sub>, was used to characterize the strength of cough flow behavior in the far field. A comparison of the strengths of coughs from different cohorts is displayed in Table 
 <xref rid="ina12680-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. As expected, the greatest average velocities were noticed at the cough center, followed by the HWA location. The centerline location had the fewest number of coughs with usable data. Very often, the cough missed this location entirely, or the peak velocity at the location was below 0.20 m/s.
