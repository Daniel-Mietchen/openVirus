<p>The fluctuations about the moving average of the HWA signal were used to characterize the turbulence present at the peak of the cough. The normalized power spectral density (PSD) was used to indicate the distribution of turbulent energy. Figure 
 <xref rid="ina12680-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref> displays the normalized power spectral density for coughs for an example cough. A slope of −5/3 was observed between 8 and 100 Hz, which is consistent with the Kolmogorov decay law for the inertial subrange, and only subtle differences are observed between coughs. The turbulence scales in this region are larger than those of viscous dissipation, but smaller than those in the energy‐containing region. The turbulence intensity was estimated from Equation
