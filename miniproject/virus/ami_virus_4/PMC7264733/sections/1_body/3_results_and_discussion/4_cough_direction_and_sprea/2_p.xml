<p>The average location of the cough center at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 m was at 
 <italic>y</italic> = −0.122 m (below the cough inlet centerline, or 0.548 m above the chamber floor). The total range of cough exit angles measured was between 3° (above the centerline) and 15° (below the centerline), and an average downward angle of 
 <italic>θ
  <sub>c</sub>
 </italic> = 7° was observed. Previously, cough angles have been defined at the mouth by two downward jet angles: 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 15 ± 5° and 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> = 40 ± 4° (Figure

 </xref> The average cough exit angle from the literature, determined by the midpoint between 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, was 27.5° below the horizontal, indicating that the head and chin rests used in the investigation adequately reduced this angle so that the cough could be measured at the desired location. The jet spread angle, 
 <italic>θ</italic>, was calculated from the maximum measured width of the jet at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 m. The upper and lower jet boundaries were selected to be the location at which the velocity fell below 0.05 m/s. An average spread angle of 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 24° (Min. = 15°, Max. = 27°, Std. dev. = 3°) was measured, which is consistent with the spread angles previously determined.

 </xref> Through a critical review and analysis of experimental and numerical investigations, it was determined that steady free jets also exhibited spreading angles between 20° and 35°, which was consistent with the findings of the present investigation.
