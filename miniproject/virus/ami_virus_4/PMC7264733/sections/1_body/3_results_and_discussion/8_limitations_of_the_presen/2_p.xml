<p>The biological air sampling method used in this study was unable to assess the relative significance of far‚Äêfield virus transmission. This could mean that that three forced coughing events do not produce a significant quantity of viral droplets, or it is possible that the virus was present but not sampled due to the small area of the sampling cassettes. There is also a possibility that the air sampling method used destroyed the viral particles upon impaction, and, perhaps, in future investigations, aerosols should be sampled for more coughs or an alternative sampling method should be used.</p>
