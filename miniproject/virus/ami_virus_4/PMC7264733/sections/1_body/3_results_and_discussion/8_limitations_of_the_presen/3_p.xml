<p>It is possible that the type of viral infection will influence the production of mucous within the lungs and may alter the way a person will cough, such that it may not be accurate to consider all cough jets containing respiratory viruses as being identical. It is also assumed that the trajectory of a natural cough may be different from those studied here since the motion of the head is restricted in the trials. Another assumption used for this investigation is that a forced cough will behave aerodynamically like a naturally occurring cough.</p>
