<p>The validity of the numerical simulation was determined by comparing the normalized experimental velocity profiles with those determined computationally (Figure 
 <xref rid="ina12680-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). A peak velocity of 0.84 m/s is obtained from the URANS simulation, whereas it is higher in the LES with a value of 0.90 m/s. As expected, the peak velocity obtained from PIV experiments was slightly higher (1.17 m/s), since it was calculated from the instantaneous peak velocity magnitude, whereas the CFD values come from window‐averaged time histories. Both the URANS and LES showed good agreement with the experimental results. The LES may have been a better representation of a realistic cough, but it was substantially more computationally expensive and so may not be practical for some investigations.
