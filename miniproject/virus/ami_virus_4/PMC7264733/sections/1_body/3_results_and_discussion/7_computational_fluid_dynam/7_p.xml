<p>In this study, the near field was considered to be the region close to the mouth, where the flow field was primarily determined by the initial impulse of the cough, while the far field was defined as the region beyond this where the flow field resembled that of a transient turbulent free jet. In the far field, the velocity time history profiles were similar when normalized using the local peak velocity and timescale. Figure 
 <xref rid="ina12680-fig-0012" ref-type="fig">12A‐D</xref> shows that this occurs where 
 <italic>x </italic>&gt; 0.3 m. When 
 <italic>x</italic> &lt; 0.3 m, a poor agreement is noticed between the CFD velocity time histories and the average of those obtained experimentally at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 m. This means that the present model for far‐field cough flow can be considered valid in the region where

 </xref> By combining numerical and experimental results, the model can be applied to approximate the cough jet behavior at any location in the far field, although measurements of actual cough flow fields at greater distances than 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 m (50
 <italic>D</italic>) are recommended to confirm the validity.
