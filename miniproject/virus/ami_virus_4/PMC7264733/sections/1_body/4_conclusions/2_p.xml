<p>By combining experimental measurements using particle image velocimetry and hot‐wire anemometry and data obtained from previous unsteady Reynolds‐averaged Navier‐Stokes (URANS) and large eddy simulation (LES) CFD simulations, a complete model for the cough centerline peak velocity decay has been developed. Although a high degree of variability is observed between individual coughs, the average profiles are a good representation of the expiratory airflow field produced by a human cough in the region 
 <italic>x</italic> ≥ 15
 <italic>D</italic>. This approximate location can be used to distinguish between near‐field region, where the flow field is primarily governed by the initial cough impulse, and the far‐field region, where the locally scaled velocity time histories collapse upon each other. An average peak velocity of 
 <italic>V</italic> = 1.17 m/s was observed at the cough center, 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 m downstream. This is comparable to the velocity determined by the LES (
 <italic>V</italic> = 0.90 m/s) and URANS (
 <italic>V</italic> = 0.84 m/s), which both used the value of peak velocity at the mouth (
 <italic>x</italic> = 0) given by Gupta et al (2009) from their experiments as the initial jet condition. The strong velocities measured provided evidence to dispute previously assumed safe separation distances, and therefore, there is incentive to develop more viable infection prevention methods. The average spread angle of 24° obtained experimentally was comparable to the values previously published for steady free jets, where a spreading angle between 20° and 35° is typically measured.
