 </xref> It has been indicated that 99% of all expired particles are smaller than 10 μm and they can be easily inhaled by a susceptible host. By taking measurements of particles in their equilibrium states (after all volatile water content has evaporated), a multi‐modal distribution of particle sizes with peaks at 1 and 100 μm has been observed.

 </xref> Experimental investigations concerning subjects who have been naturally infected with influenza have shown that 65% of influenza RNA was found in particles smaller than 4 μm, although the presence of influenza RNA does not necessarily indicate the presence of viable viruses.
