<p>Very little is known about the production and dispersion of viral bioaerosols, even though such information is critical in healthcare settings during viral outbreaks. Viable influenza particles have been recovered through air sampling at hospitals, at health centers, and on airplanes,

 </xref> and several factors have been shown to influence airborne transmission of the influenza virus. Guinea pig models have demonstrated that low relative humidity (RH) and low temperatures enhanced the transmission of the influenza virus, whereas high RH and high temperatures interrupted transmission.
