<p>The velocity at which infectious particles are introduced into the environment influences the potential for transmission. Several investigations have been conducted to examine the flow behavior of coughs at or near the mouth of human subjects,

 </xref> While determining the cough flow behavior close to the mouth can be useful for determining boundary conditions for numerical or physical simulations, the flow behavior in the far field is more important when assessing the potential for virus transmission, since such separation distances are more common for most human interactions. Volumetric flow rates, volumes, and peak velocity times of coughs have been determined using spirometry techniques,

The experimental results vary significantly between experiments and between subjects, and no well‐defined model exists for near‐field or far‐field cough behavior. Furthermore, the separation distance that distinguishes between the near field and far field of cough flow behavior has not been defined. All previous investigations of the flow field have been conducted with healthy subjects and so there is no evidence indicating that coughs from subjects who have been naturally infected with respiratory viruses behave like those from healthy subjects. Statistical issues also become evident, due to the small number of subjects recruited for the experiments.
