<p>The objective of the present investigation was to test the “3 ft/1 m rule,” by conducting velocity measurements and bioaerosol sampling at 
 <italic>x</italic> = 1.0 m from the mouth of human subjects. Based on an average mouth opening diameter of

 <italic>D</italic>. Experiments were conducted to map the flow field of human coughs at greater distances than those studied previously and to develop a model for transient cough jet behavior. Subjects who have been naturally infected with influenza participated in experiments while they were sick and again when they had recovered. A cohort of healthy volunteers was recruited as a reference to assess any difference in the aerodynamic behavior of the coughs from the two groups. The velocity measurements were also used to validate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models based on unsteady Reynolds‐averaged Navier‐Stokes (URANS) and large eddy simulation (LES) methods developed by Bi.
