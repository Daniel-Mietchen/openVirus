<p id="par0565">Recently, an interesting approved animal study was performed on golden Syrian hamsters that were inoculated with SARS-COV2 isolated from a laboratory-COnfirmed COVID-19 patient in Hong Kong. Several tissue organs were dissected and underwent histological examination. Tracheal tissue examination revealed epithelial desquamation with focal cilia loss and mononuclear infiltration, while microscopic examination of the infected lungs revealed the formation of hyaline membranes with mononuclear cell infiltration, large multinucleated syncytial bodies and alveolar lumens filled with cellular debris, hemorrhage. Also, the proliferation marker Ki67 was extensively expressed in bronchiolar cells demonstrating marked cellular proliferation.</p>
