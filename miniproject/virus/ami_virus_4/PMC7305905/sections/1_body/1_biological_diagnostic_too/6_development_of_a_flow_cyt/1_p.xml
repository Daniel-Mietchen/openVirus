<p id="par0395">In a recent publication SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells responses were measured in COVID-19 cases. Using flow cytometry, among other approaches, SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup>T cell were seen in all COVID-19 cases, and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses were seen in most, thus, flow cytometry could present a potential for COVID-19 diagnosis, alongside other potential laboratory indicators like PCTâ€¦etc.
