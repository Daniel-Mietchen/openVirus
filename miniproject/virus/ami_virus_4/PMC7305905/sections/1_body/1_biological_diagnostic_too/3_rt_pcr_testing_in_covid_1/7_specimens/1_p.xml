<p id="par0210">It is strongly thought that involving various specimens from multiple sites could lower false negatives and improve sensitivity. An important issue is how and where to collect samples for testing. Actual guidelines (as the current public health England guidance) [
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] suggest samples from the upper respiratory tract. The question remains whether there is a significant difference in sensitivity between nasopharyngeal (NP, nasal) or oropharyngeal (OP, throat). Throat swabs may appear to be uncomfortable for patients and could induce coughing, while lingual swabs are more comfortable, and some consider that they can achieve comparable results.
