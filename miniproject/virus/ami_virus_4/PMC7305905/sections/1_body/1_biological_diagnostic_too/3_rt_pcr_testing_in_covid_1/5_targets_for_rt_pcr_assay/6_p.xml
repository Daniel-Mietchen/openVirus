<p id="par0180">Among these three novel assays, the COVID -19 -RdRp/Hel assay had the lowest limit of detection and the highest analytical sensitivity at 95% detection probability. Furthermore, the COVID-19 RdRp/Hel assay was significantly more sensitive than the established RdRp-P2 assay for the detection of viral RNA in both respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal aspirate/swab or throat swab) and non-respiratory tract specimens (saliva, and plasma), as it detected viral RNA in 15.4% additional specimens that were tested negative by the RdRp -P2 assay. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the sensitivity of the two assays for sputum and feces/rectal swabs.</p>
