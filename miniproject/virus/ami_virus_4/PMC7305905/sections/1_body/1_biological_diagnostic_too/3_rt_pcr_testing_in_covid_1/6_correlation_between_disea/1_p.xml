<p id="par0200">A retrospective study was conducted by Chen et al., with a total of 249 patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Results showed that the clinical progression of COVID-19 in patients presented two phases. The first phase was represented by fever, cough, fatigue and other systemic symptoms. In the course of this phase, upper respiratory specimens were tested by RT-PCR for viral RNA and the majority of the patients showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In the second week of the disease progression, symptoms began to relieve in most of the patients. In parallel, half of the patients showed PCR negative results with their upper respiratory tract samples. The estimated median duration to negative reverse-transcriptase PCR tests of upper respiratory tract samples was 11 days.</p>
