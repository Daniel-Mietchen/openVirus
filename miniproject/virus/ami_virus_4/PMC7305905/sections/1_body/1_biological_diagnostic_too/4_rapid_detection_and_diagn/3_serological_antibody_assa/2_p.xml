<p id="par0325">A study conducted by Zhao et al. enrolled a total of 173 confirmed cases of COVID-19 by the use of rRT-PCR on samples from the respiratory track reported that the seroconversion sequentially appeared for the total antibody (Ab), IgM and then IgG, with a median time of 11, 12 and 14 days, respectively. Besides, the presence of antibodies was &lt; 40% among patients in the first week of illness, and then rapidly increased to 100.0%, 94.3% and 79.8%, respectively since day 15 after onset. This may conclude that the total antibody is more sensitive than IgM and IgG for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
