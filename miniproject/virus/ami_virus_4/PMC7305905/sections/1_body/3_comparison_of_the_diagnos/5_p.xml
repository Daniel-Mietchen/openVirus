<p id="par0510">In patients with negative rRT-PCR results, 75% (n = 308) had positive chest CT findings. Besides, analysis of serial rRT-PCR assays and CT scans was performed; the mean interval between the initial negative to positive rRT-PCR results was determined to be 5.1 ± 1.5 days, and the initial positive to the subsequent negative rRT-PCR result was 6.9 ± 2.3 days. Using rRT-PCR results as the reference standard, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 were 97%, 25%, and 68%, respectively [
