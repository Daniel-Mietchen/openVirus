It started in China between 2002 and 2003, due to a new SARS-CoV coronavirus. It disseminated to 29 countries in 2003 due to the travel movement throughout the world, affecting 8098 patients with a case-fatality rate of 9.6%, and then SARS disappeared. Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV was common. Bats were considered as the primary reservoir, although unproven as the actual source while the intermediary source was considered civet cats in the wet markets in Guangdong [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="par0040">The second coronavirus-related outbreak was the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which was caused by MERS-CoV. MERS appeared in April 2012 and was first identified in humans in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The contact with camels or camel products is considered to be the cause of human infection. MERS continued to emerge and reemerge. Between 2012 and December 2019, a total of 2465 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 850 deaths (34.4% mortality), were reported from 27 countries [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="par0045">COVID-19 outbreak brings back memories of the Spanish Flu Pandemic in 1918&#x02013;1920, which was caused by H1N1 strain of the influenza virus.

Rapid and accurate diagnosis is vital in such a pandemic. From one side, rapidity may enhance management effectiveness and accelerate the application of more suitable isolation measures, leading to less contiguity. While, on the other hand, coupling rapidity with less costly procedures may permit, especially to low-income countries, more examinations to be applied, thus, faster and more effective community-scale management.</p><p id="par0060">In this review, we will shed light on the established diagnostic methods which were applied to help manage the outbreak.

Furthermore, the COVID-19 RdRp/Hel assay was significantly more sensitive than the established RdRp-P2 assay for the detection of viral RNA in both respiratory tract specimens (nasopharyngeal aspirate/swab or throat swab) and non-respiratory tract specimens (saliva, and plasma), as it detected viral RNA in 15.4% additional specimens that were tested negative by the RdRp -P2 assay. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the sensitivity of the two assays for sputum and feces/rectal swabs.</p><p id="par0185">Exclusivity testing showed that COVID-19 -RdRp/Hel assay did not cross-react with other human SARS-CoV, whereas the RdRp-P2 assay showed cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV in cell culture. This is because the probes of RdRp/Hel assay were developed to contain 7&#x02013;9 nucleotide differences with those of human SARS-CoV, whereas the probe of the RdRp-P2 assay contained only three nucleotide differences [<xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p id="par0190">The Charit&#x000e9; algorithm (Berlin, Germany) uses a two-step assay to confirm COVID-19 infection.

In the course of this phase, upper respiratory specimens were tested by RT-PCR for viral RNA and the majority of the patients showed positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In the second week of the disease progression, symptoms began to relieve in most of the patients.
