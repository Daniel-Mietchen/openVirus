<p>Ground-glass opacity is deﬁned as hazy opacity that does not obscure underlying bronchial structures or pulmonary vessels at computed tomography (CT). It represents many histopathological processes because the underlying mechanism may be partial airspace ﬁlling; interstitial thickening with inﬂammation, edema, ﬁbrosis; and neoplastic proliferation. GGO is a frequent focal lung finding representing cancer; it can also represent lung infections, lung edema, or interstitial diseases (where GGO can represent disease activity and may precede irreversible fibrosis). Since it is a non-specific radiological finding, it is fundamental to know the underlying physiopathology to narrow the differential diagnosis [
