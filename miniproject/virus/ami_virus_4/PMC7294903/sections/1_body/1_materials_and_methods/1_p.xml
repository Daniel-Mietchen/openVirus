<p>We retrospectively enrolled 33 patients aged between 19 and 88 years (20 males and 13 females), admitted to Verona A.O.U.I. - Policlinico Universitario G. B. Rossi, who underwent non-contrast-enhanced (NCE) and contrast-enhanced (CE) chest CT between March 12 and April 12. When CE-CT was performed, we used a high iodine concentration contrast agent (Ultravist 370, Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany). We included all patients with CT images positive for GGO. COVID-19 patients were excluded from this study. Patients tested for COVID-19 underwent a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR assay on a nasopharyngeal swab. Patients with other infective pneumonia were confirmed with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), viral panel, serologic tests, or blood cultures.</p>
