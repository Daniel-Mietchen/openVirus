<p>CTs were performed with the patient supine at full inspiration, using a 64-row MDCT scanner (Brilliance iCT, Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Scanning parameters were tube voltage 120 kV and tube current modulation 100 mA. Images were reconstructed with a slice thickness of 1 mm or 2 mm. All images were reconstructed on both lung (width, 1500 HU; level: -700 HU) and mediastinal (width, 350 HU; level: 40 HU) settings.</p>
