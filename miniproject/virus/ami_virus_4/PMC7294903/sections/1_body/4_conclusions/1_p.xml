<p>COVID-19 pneumonia is a novel disease, therefore, special attention to differential diagnoses with clinical and radiological presentations that may mimic it is recommended. Although CT represents a fundamental diagnostic tool because of its sensitivity, it still needs to be integrated with clinical data to achieve the best clinical management. This principle should be applied not just in the COVID-19 era but also in all pathologies that could have very similar radiological findings. However, in the presence of typical imaging features (e.g. GGO and consolidation), the radiologist should focus his attention on the pandemic and manage a suspect patient as COVID-19 positive until proven to be negative since it is of primary importance to manage COVID-19 pneumonia as early as possible in order to prevent the contagion from continuing to spread.</p>
