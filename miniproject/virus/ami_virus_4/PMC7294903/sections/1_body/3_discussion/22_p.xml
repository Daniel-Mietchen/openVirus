<p>GGO seen on CT can represent a wide spectrum of pathologic conditions, such as inflammatory disease and lung neoplasms. The analysis of several parameters, such as bilateral/unilateral involvement localization in the lung parenchyma, superimposed consolidation, and the presence of lymphadenopathies and pleural effusion and associated abnormalities will avoid most pitfalls, indicating a possible diagnosis of the underlying cause and offering a consistent differential diagnosis. Nevertheless, GGO remains a diagnostic challengeÂ and, therefore, a systematic approach is necessary to ensure an optimal workup.</p>
