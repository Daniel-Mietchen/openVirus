<p>The CT patterns of viral pneumonia are related to the pathogenesis of the viral infection and are affected by the immune status of the host and the underlying pathophysiology of the viral pathogen. Moreover, viruses of the same family have similar pathogenesis; consequently, viral pneumonia caused by different viruses from the same virus family exhibits a similar pattern on chest CT images [

COVID-19 is a new type of viral pneumonia; previous studies have demonstrated frequent CT findings, in particular, bilateral GGO and interstitial thickening, similar to other viral pneumonias, specifically SARS, and MERS, belonging to the same Viridae. SARS and MERS outbreaks were also due to a coronavirus: consequently, studying and understanding those epidemics may be helpful in managing the current pandemics [
