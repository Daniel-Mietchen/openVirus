<p>Since GGO lesions can be caused by a wide spectrum of pathologies, a GGO is a non-specific radiological finding. It does not represent a confirmed diagnosis, even in the Covid-19 era. It is, therefore, necessary to understand the underlying histopathology and to integrate imaging with clinical and lab data to achieve the correct diagnosis. According to our experience, in the current paper, we distinguished between the neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes of GGO. For each category, we analyzed the diagnostic pitfalls and discussed management during radiological practice.</p>
