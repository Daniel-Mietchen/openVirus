Interstitial pneumonias may be idiopathic or secondary to a variety of other causes, including collagen vascular diseases, pneumoconiosis, infection, and smoking. The American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society classification includes seven clinicopathologic entities: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), respiratory bronchiolitis (RB)-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), and lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) [
