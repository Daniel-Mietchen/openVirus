 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG5">5</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG6">6</xref>). Despite the typical imaging features and the onset of mild symptoms, the report excluded COVID-19 pneumonia; interstitial inflammatory involvement was correctly diagnosed. CT findings, along with clinical history, led to the correct diagnosis: it could have been misinterpreted since, in the COVID-19 era, every patient should be considered positive until proven negative. RT-PCR confirmed negative.
