<p>A 32-year-old male presented with a two-week history of high fever (T-max 39.5Â°C), cough, and muscle ache. Blood tests showed mild lymphopenia (900/mmc) and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (56 mg/L, normal value &lt;5); therefore, an ongoing infective process was suspected. Considering the possibility of COVID-19 pneumonia, RT-PCR was performed twice for the persistence of typical symptoms and because of chest CT findings, highly suspect for viral pneumonia. The CT scan reported a consolidating area in the medial segment of the middle lobe and GGOs in the lower left lobe (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG3">3</xref>-
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FIG4">4</xref>). Since the RT-PCR persisted negative, a BAL was performed and influenza A virus detected by multiplex PCR. The differential diagnosis among viral pneumonias appears to be extremely difficult: there is a significant overlap in the imaging appearance and overlapping with other inflammatory lung diseases; furthermore, blood exams are highly unspecific, too, showing generally lymphopenia and slightly increased CRP.
