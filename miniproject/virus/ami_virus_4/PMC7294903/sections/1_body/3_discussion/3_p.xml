<p>A 39-year-old male patient, a health worker, presented to the emergency department, with a history of dry cough. He did not report any significant comorbidity, nor malignancies in his clinical history. InÂ suspicion of COVID-19 pneumonia (clinical and epidemiological criteria), an RT-PCR assay on nasopharyngeal swab was performed. Later, he underwent a chest CT scan. The report showed a pure ground-glass nodule in the apical segment of the left superior lobe (Figures
