<p>GGO is a common sign of lung cancer. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, adenocarcinoma and its precursors are classified into preinvasive lesions (atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS)), minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), typically presenting as a pure GGO nodule greater than 10 mm in diameter, and invasive adenocarcinoma. In general, lung adenocarcinomas are thought to follow a path in which AAH progresses to AIS, followed by invasive adenocarcinoma. Most pure ground-glass nodules (GGN - without solid component) are preinvasive adenocarcinomas, often behaving as indolent tumors; semisolid nodules tend to be adenocarcinomas, as well as invasive because of the intrinsic histological difference in the solid component: the more they grow, the more invasive they areÂ [
