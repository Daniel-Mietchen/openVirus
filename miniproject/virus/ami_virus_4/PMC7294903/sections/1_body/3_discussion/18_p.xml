<p>A 54-year-old male underwent a heart transplant due to severe dilatative cardiomyopathy associated with mitral failure. He also reported centrilobular emphysema in his clinical history. During hospitalization and rehabilitation, direct contact with a COVID-19-positive patient was reported. Since the patient developed a cough, a chest CT scan was performed, reporting patchy bilateral ground-glass opacities affecting both the superior and inferior lobes, along with mild bronchiectasis (Figure
