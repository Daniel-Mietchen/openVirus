<p>In addition to centrilobular nodules, CT in cigarette smokers could show the typical imaging features of infiltrative lung disease, including GGOs and reticular anomalies, which likely correspond to variable combinations of respiratory bronchiolitis, airspace enlargement with fibrosis, and smoking-related interstitial fibrosis [
 <xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In these findings, the histopathological mechanism underlying GGO is small airway obstruction or fibrosis, which causes vasoconstriction in that area of the lung, shunting blood away from areas of impaired gas exchange, with hyperperfusion of the adjacent normal lung, leading to relatively increased attenuation with a subsequent “mosaic attenuation” aspect [
