<p>The number of symptomatic patients was 25/33 (75.7%). At clinical presentation, they reported fever and dry cough, and six out of 25 (24%) cases also reported dyspnea. Thirty-three (33; 100%) showed GGO at CT; 15/33 (45.45%) presented pure GGO and 18/33 (54.54%) presented GGO with consolidation. COVID-19 pneumonia was suspected because of the CT report and clinical presentation so an RT-PCR assay by nasopharyngeal swab was performed; interestingly, the virus was not detected in any patient. We investigated other potential underlying diseases: neoplastic causes (8/33, 24.24%) and non-neoplastic causes, in particular, infectious pneumonias (16/33, 48,48 %, viral and fungal), interstitial pneumonias (4/33, 12,12%), and cardio-pulmonary disease (5/33, 15,15%). The different meaning of GGO in every category was also investigated.</p>
