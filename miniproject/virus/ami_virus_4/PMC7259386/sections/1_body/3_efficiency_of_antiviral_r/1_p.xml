<p>As mentioned above, ISGs downstream of IFNAR signaling include a variety of cytokines and chemokines that may destabilize BBB junctional proteins and/or recruit antiviral T cells, respectively. T-cell chemoattractants including CCL2, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 may also be induced by interleukin (IL)-1, TNF, and type II IFN (IFN-II). The expression of CXCR3, whose ligands are CXCL9 and CXCL10 under IFN induction, on T cells permits their entry into the CNS during infection. CXCL10 is expressed at the BBB. During CNS infection with West Nile Virus (WNV), CXCL10 expressed by neurons guides the trafficking of CXCR3 + CD8 + T cells into the brain [

The CCR2--CCL2 axis, which recruits both myeloid and lymphoid cells, has been heavily studied in the migration of inflammatory monocytes during CNS infection and inflammation. Astrocytes have been shown to produce CCL2 in multiple neurologic disease, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [

 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which might recruit macrophages or activated microglia for phagocytic purposes. CCL2 is also expressed by activated endothelial cells and microglia, the latter of which may continue to express low levels of CCL2 after recovery [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A new subset of CD8 T cells expressing both CCR2 and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) has been identified within the CNS of mice that were acutely infected via intravenous (i.v.) injection of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) [
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. High levels of CCR2 expression were also detected in hippocampal CD8 T cells after viral recovery of both WNV and ZIKV [
