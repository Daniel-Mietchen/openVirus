<p>Taken together, the interplay between neuronal and immune cells creates an IFN–chemokine network, which is essential to initiating viral containment at acute stage of infection by promoting immune cell infiltration, directly involving lymphocytes and monocytes, in order to maintain the appropriate level of immune cell activities after viral clearance. The upregulation of sustained expression of chemokines could exert neurotoxicity via maintenance of neurotoxic T cells within the CNS parenchyma [
