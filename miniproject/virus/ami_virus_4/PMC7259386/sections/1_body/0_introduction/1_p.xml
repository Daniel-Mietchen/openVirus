<p>The central nervous system (CNS) has evolved multiple mechanisms to preserve and repair its complex structural and functional organization during neurologic diseases. After viral infections, innate and adaptive immune responses variably contribute to viral clearance and recovery, depending on the virus and its targets. Cell-mediated immunity in the brain primarily involves noncytolytic mechanisms of viral clearance that preserve neurons and supporting cells that express neurotropic factors (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). T cells are critically involved in virologic control, gaining parenchymal access via local restimulation after T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of viral antigens within perivascular spaces. Interactions with activated microglia also maintain T-cell effector functions within the CNS parenchyma. T cells may also undergo differentiation into regulatory, memory and tissue resident subsets, which, depending on their location, impact various aspects of brain function via cytokine-mediated effects on neural cells types including microglia, astrocytes and neural stem cells. These neuroimmune interactions may trigger processes that promote or prevent repair of acute injury sustained during the height of antiviral inflammatory responses, leading to recovery or progressive neurologic diseases, including dementia.Â
