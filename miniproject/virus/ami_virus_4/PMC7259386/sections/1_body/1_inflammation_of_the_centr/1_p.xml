<p>The CNS is a site of high anatomic and cellular complexity. The major cell types within the CNS include neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependymal cells, and microglia, all of which are potential viral targets and initiate innate immune signals to recruit antiviral mononuclear cells into the CNS for virologic control [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Three anatomically distinct barriers: acellular barrier, blood–brain barrier (BBB) and blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), surround the CNS and provide both immune specialization for the CNS and entry sites for immune cells upon pathogen invasion [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Infiltration of immune cells from the periphery is driven by a variety of factors including upregulation of adhesion molecules and disruption of endothelial and epithelial brain barriers [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and the generation of appropriate chemoattractant gradients created by virally infected cells both at barriers and within the CNS [
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These localizing cues promote not only the recruitment of mononuclear cells into perivascular spaces, but their parenchymal entry and interaction with resident cells within the CNS.
