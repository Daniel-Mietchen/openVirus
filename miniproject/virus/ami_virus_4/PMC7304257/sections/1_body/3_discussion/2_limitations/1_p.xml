<p>This research has a number of limitations due to its reliance on social media. For example, despite the breadth of tweets collected, not all medical professionals use Twitter, and those who do use Twitter use a significant amount of discretion with respect to their level of engagement with the platform. There are also temporal and geographic dimensions [

 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] that are not necessarily captured. The findings from the analysis could be improved through additional refinement of the defined categories and by focusing on specific categories (eg, actions and recommendations). In addition, the data collection could be complemented with surveys of medical professionals with more focused and specific questions to better understand their specific concerns and experience.
