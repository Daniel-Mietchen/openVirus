<p>Our target social media platform for data collection was Twitter. Initially, we identified 119 medical professionals who were actively discussing the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter. The medical professionals were identified by searching the Onalytica website, which specializes in providing influencer marketing software, and finding a list of top health care professionals ranked by influence score [

 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which provides a comprehensive COVID-19 case tracker as well as other useful information about COVID-19, including the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Experts/Centers account on Twitter. The Twitter IDs of the medical professionals were used to identify the target users. Next, using Crimson Hexagon with the search query shown in 
 <xref rid="figure2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, we extracted all tweets for the identified medical professionals between December 1, 2019 and April 1, 2020. A total of 10,096 English tweets were collected. The key advantage of using a social media analytics platform such as Crimson Hexagon is that it provides access to the “Twitter firehose” (ie, every public tweet ever posted on Twitter in any language and from any geographic location that meets the search criteria).
