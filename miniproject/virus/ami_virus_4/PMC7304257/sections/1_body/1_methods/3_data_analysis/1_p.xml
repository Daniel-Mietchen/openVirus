<p>For the data analysis, we started by identifying relevant tweets. To do this, a random subset of 250 tweets were analyzed by three researchers to determine which tweets were relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. Three researchers independently labeled the tweets as relevant or not relevant. To ensure that the obtained results were reliable and consistent, we followed a case study protocol and established interrater reliability. We obtained a Fleiss Îº value of 0.628, which is at the bottom of the range that reflects substantial agreement (0.61-0.80) and is just above the range that reflects moderate agreement (0.41-0.60) [
