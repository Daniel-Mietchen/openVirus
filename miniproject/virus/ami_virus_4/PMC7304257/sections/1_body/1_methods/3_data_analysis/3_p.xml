<p>We initially used Crimson Hexagon to define the categories from the qualitative analysis and the associated trained algorithm to explore the medical professional opinion surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref> describes each of the categories, lists the keywords delineating each of the categories, and provides a representative tweet for each. Using 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="app1">Multimedia Appendix 1</xref> as a codebook, we manually labeled the categories and automatically distributed 10,096 tweets over 9 categories: the 8 categories from qualitative analysis and 1 additional category for irrelevant tweets. The training was an iterative process, ensuring that each category was clearly outlined by the examples. The number of coded tweets increased over several runs of the model as we reviewed the categories and coded more tweets.
