<p>Studies that did not present data on childhood population were excluded, as well as those that focused the data exclusively on the level of severity and/or hospitalisations and/or paediatric intensive care units (PICU), or the treatment. All kind of studies (case series, cohort studies, comments, editorials, etc) were included although the emphasis was stated on those descriptive studies of cases. It is not ruled out that there may be some duplication in the cases included. A description of the results obtained was carried out. It was not attempted to rate the quality of included studies in this review.</p>
