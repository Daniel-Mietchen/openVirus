<p>If children are important in viral transmission and amplification, social and public health policies (eg, avoiding interaction with elderly people) could be established to slow transmission and protect vulnerable populations. Nevertheless, the application of the precautionary principle should be evidence based as much as possible and try to avoid creating adverse effects with potential medium and long-term negative impact on the childhood population. A study analysing viral load by age in a sample of 3712 patients from Berlin found no differences by age on viral loads, even in the very young patients do not differ significantly from those of adults.
