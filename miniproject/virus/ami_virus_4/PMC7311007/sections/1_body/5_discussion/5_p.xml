<p>Several limitations of the present rapid scoping review should be mentioned. The inclusion of none reviewed preprint papers, the inclusion criteria based only on one evaluation, the lack of critical analysis of the risk of bias and the inclusion of non-primary study designs may weaken the attempts at understanding the data. However, the urgent need to understand the process of transmission and the results obtained provide a reasonable evidence on the process analysed. Furthermore, the results of other reviews on the process of infection in children with similar results to the present study support the strength of the results obtained. Another limitation is the current lack of reliable, valid and comparable data on epidemiological surveillance,

On the other hand, up to date there are scarce data on the socioeconomic factors and its influence on the current pandemic. Social determinants of child health should be addressed to enhance the positive effects and avoid the adverse effects of this pandemic on children’s rights and social inequalities in children’s health.
