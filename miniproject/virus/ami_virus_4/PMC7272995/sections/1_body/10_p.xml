<p>As dental education proceeds into the 21st century, dentistry will have to assume a path that is more convergent with than divergent from medicine. In my viewpoint, infection control education needs to be expanded in the dental curriculum itself and students of every dental school should be trained adequately to protect them and prevent the infection from disseminating even before they see their first patient. Our dental graduates need to be not only excellent dentists but also thoughtful, independently practicing healthcare professionals providing oral health within the context of systemic health infection prevention.
