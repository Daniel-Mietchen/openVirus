<p>Prior to the present pandemic of COVID‐19, there have been multiple large‐scale epidemics and pandemics of other viral respiratory infections like seasonal flu, Spanish flu (H1N1), SARS, MERS, and others. The common transmission routes of these respiratory viruses include direct transmission (cough, sneeze, and droplet inhalation) and contact transmission (contact with oral, nasal, and eye mucous membranes). This mode of transmission, especially from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients, puts dental professionals at an increased risk for contracting these viruses from dental patients, as dental practice involves face‐to‐face communication with the patients and frequent exposure to saliva, blood, and other body fluids.

More dentists than controls also carried antibodies to adenoviruses, although this difference did not attain statistical significance. The authors concluded that dentists were at occupational risk of infection with respiratory tract viruses.
