<p>During the current COVID‐19 pandemic, public health measures, such as lock‐downs and social distancing, as implemented by the respective governments of the countries, are the most important actions for control and mitigation of pandemic. However, it is too early to say whether these measures alone will be effective in completely eradicating COVID‐19 from the community, or we will have to learn to live with some persistent infection becoming endemic in the community, until at least when vaccination is available and implemented. We also need to asses the tally of the effect of the pandemic on dental students, dental residents, and dental professionals, during the lock‐down period and also when the lock‐down eases. However, the modifications to the dental curriculum as suggested above addresses more than just the current COVID‐19 pandemic; it will also prepare dental schools to face any such future infectious disease epidemics.</p>
