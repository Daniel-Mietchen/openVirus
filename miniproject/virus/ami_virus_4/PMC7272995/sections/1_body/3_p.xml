<p>During the current pandemic of COVID‐19, as the dental professionals are at the top of the pyramid of healthcare professionals at risk, dentists as well as dental students seem to be facing various challenges to cope up with the current pandemic. Patient handling has become strenuous. Tele‐counseling and triaging of patients have become necessary along with informing the patients about the need of appointment cancellation. The need of the hour seems to be, to carry out emergency dental treatment only after telephone triage, risk‐assessment, and after adopting a low‐transmission approach of infection. In addition, dentists need to apply management education to their practice. They need to lay‐off staff with pay guarantee, keep them working for few hours with reduced pay, or discharge them. For personal health, dentists need to avoid unnecessary contacts, wear PPE while examining and working on patients, and adopt universal precaution along with basic infection control measures.</p>
