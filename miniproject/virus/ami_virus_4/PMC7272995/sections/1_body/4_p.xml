<p>In my view, dental education can play an important role in the training of dentists, helping them to adopt adequate knowledge and attitudes related to infection control measures. But are our dental schools adequately preparing the future dentists to face the challenges of these outbreaks of respiratory infectious diseases? The answer is “yes” as well as “no” depending on the country and curriculum of the dental school. In many countries, dental students may be in better stead than practicing dentists in relation to infection control practices. However, in many dental schools, especially in resource‐constrained countries, dental students are probably more susceptible to these viral respiratory illnesses because of the similar exposure profile, but with poorer knowledge and lack of practice of infection prevention.</p>
