<p>Although, the current dental curriculum at most dental schools does address basic infection control, especially, risk from blood‐borne infections such as HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV), and recommends Universal Precautions for preventing these blood‐borne infections; droplet and air borne infections appear to be seldom addressed. The infection control information as well as practice in dental schools of many countries is apparently not adequate. In a U.S. survey to determine the content of infection control information in the dental curricula, it was found that most schools did not have an independent course and only used classroom lectures and clinic demonstrations to teach infection control.

 </xref> In another study conducted among dental students of India, the level of knowledge and practice of infection control measures was found to be poor.

 </xref> This leads to inadequate practice of infection control. A systematic review that included studies from Brazil, United Kingdom, and France, studying the adherence of educators and students in academic dental institutions to hand hygiene procedures, found that hand hygiene among dental students did not even reach 50% of the total number of students.
