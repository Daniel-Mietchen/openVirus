<p>Dental professionals providing oral health care to the patients, must base their practice on ethical principles for implementing the oral health care. Infection control practice provides a case study of application of ethical principles and should be followed with vigilance. Each infection control practice is related to the 5 principles of health professions ethics: autonomy, non‐maleficence, beneficence, justice, and veracity.

 </xref> While these principles may overlap, they form the basis of professional ethical conduct. These principles apply to individual health practitioners, who are increasingly working to improve inter‐professional association for patient‐centered care, and to warrant safe dental care delivery. These principles must be applied regularly and the use of a standard checklist may help with conforming with standard infection control.
