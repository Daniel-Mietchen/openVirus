 </xref> Most of the patients of COVID‐19 are asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic but discharge large amounts of infectious viral particles in the early phase of infection. This poses an enormous challenge for containing the spread of the infection. The basic reproductive number of COVID‐19 at the early stage is estimated to be between 1.4 and 3.9. This indicates that 1 patient can transmit the disease to 2 to 4 other people, and this rate is higher than severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Until the middle of April 2020, &gt;9000 healthcare workers in the United States have been infected by 2019‐nCoV, accounting for 19% of total number of patients data available with the CDC.
