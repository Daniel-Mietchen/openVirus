<p id="par0080">Respiratory droplets are produced by the atomization of human secretions along the air passage from the lungs during coughing and sneezing. Respiratory droplet contains water and salts such as potassium and sodium chloride. For the infected person, the respiratory droplet additionally contains the viruses (
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Anonymous, 2020d</xref>). These droplets with high humidity and at human body temperature while traveling in the air initially undergo size reduction due to the drying of water content if the surrounding air humidity and temperature are very low and finally it becomes the droplet nucleus. The size of the droplet will not undergo size reduction if the surrounding is in high temperature and high humidity due to less potential difference for heat and mass transfer. The virus in the droplet nucleus is less active if the size remains larger with more water content. The droplet coming from the infected person will be initially at the body temperature of 37 °C. When it tries to attain equilibrium with the surrounding lower temperature the heat available from the droplet itself will be utilized for evaporation. When the surrounding air is dry (low Relative humidity) and cold, the size of the particle is reduced by combined heat and mass transfer (

 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). In hot and dry conditions the heat transfer potential is less, however, the mass transfer potential is high. The mass transfer effect will be more pronounced when the relative humidity is very low. If the surrounding air is humid, water cannot evaporate and the droplet size is not reduced. Water content in the particle plays an important role in diluting the virus so that it is less active and less harmful. Also, the salt (sodium chloride and potassium chloride) in the respiratory droplet is hygroscopic and acts as a desiccant to absorb the moisture from the humid air to increase the size of the droplets. The virus gets diluted with water content and become less active. Thus, a humid environment naturally makes the virus less active (

Further, in hot and humid conditions, the mucus membrane in the respiratory tract will be wet which will humidify and dilute the droplet nuclei. However in dry locations, the mucus membrane becomes dry and the fluid over lining the cells becomes more viscous and the little hair CILIA which normally protects our lungs from deep settling of particle, cannot filter out the virus. After entering the lungs, the virus can cross the one cell layer separating the air path in the lungs and the blood path, and it can infect the blood very easily.
