<p id="par0135">In all these states the major spread is reported in the capital city where the air conditioning system usage is the highest. In Karnataka, Bangalore, the capital city is located at a higher altitude (partial hill station) and hence the air-conditioner usage is less and avoided the high spread. The state Kerala normally referred to as â€œGod's own place" because of its lush greenery (full of forests, mountains, and backwater regions) and breath-taking sceneries. This makes the whole state in a comfort condition compared to neighboring state Tamil Nadu. Hence the air-conditioner usage is less and high virus spread is not reported. The spread rate in the three southern states, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, does not increase appreciably after the extended lockdown period. Being the lockdown period since 25
 <sup>th</sup> March, the spread due to the indoor environment is very minimal. The open hot outdoor environment is not conducive for the virus spread. However, the summer will continue till Mid-August. Hence it is very difficult to allow offices with the air-conditioned indoor built environment to start their function until this period. However, in these 3 states, the movement of the public in the outdoor environment and the non-air-conditioned indoor environments (factory sites) is not very critical as in the dry climatic condition. Keeping social distancing and following other precautionary measures are sufficient to overcome the scenario.
