 <xref rid="fig0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> shows that among the medium spread states, Kerala, Karnataka, West Bengal, and Jammu and Kashmir are the 4 states showing a comparatively higher spread rate. Among these Kerala and Karnataka are in the southern states which are supposed to be in the earlier category and the reason for not coming under a very high spread rate as in Tamil Nadu is already explained. Besides, it is observed that in Kerala during the initial spread period, the rate of spread is high and it declined at the beginning of April. It is one of the states in India where a considerable percentage of the population is working in the Gulf countries and every weekend the passengers flying from Gulf to Kerala are very high. So the spread through aircraft passengers was high initially (due to high occupant density). Jammu and Kashmir being a very cold place, the need for space heating is essential. Mostly in these regions space heating without humidification is being adopted. Hence in the conditioned space, the dry pockets may arise leading to high spread. In West Bengal, despite the presence of the city Calcutta, one of the thickly populated cities next to Bombay and Delhi, the spread rate is comparatively less. This is due to the location in the northeast region of the country, where the Himalayan base effect will provide better climatic conditions, and hence the usage of air-conditioner is less. The states of Punjab and Haryana also benefited by Himalaya and these states have the major rivers originated from Himalaya. However in these two states during May the humidity level will be the lowest and hence there is a possibility of increasing trend in May if the lockdown is released. The other 3 states shown under this medium spread category and the majority of the states shown under the low spread category (
 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>) are located in the North East region of India where the weather is either composite or warm and humid. Since the average temperature is less, the requirement for air-conditioner is minimal which is also seen from the electricity consumption. The possibility of spread is also in the outdoor environment when the dry climatic condition prevails. The solutions suggested to reduce the spread are (i) prevention of recirculation of contaminated air (ii) proper use of air filtration technology in the return air system of the HVAC system and (iii) to maintain higher temperatures and relative humidity in the indoor environment without compromising the comfort. Further, it is suggested to avoid spending long hours in the closed dry environment until the corona spread is controlled.
