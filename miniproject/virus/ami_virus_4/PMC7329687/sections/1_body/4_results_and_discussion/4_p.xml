 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> are drawn from the data obtained from the official website sources and illustrate the states with high, medium, and low transmission spread respectively during the period between January and April. 
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> shows that among the various states given under high spread, the major areas of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan are situated under hot and dry zone as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. The infection rate is very high during March and April 2020 in these states. Among these states, the spread rate is the highest in Maharashtra as all the three factors such as air conditioning usage; dry condition and population density are more favorable for the virus spread. The rate of infection is showing a near-vertical growth in the recent days despite the lockdown throughout the country since 25
 <sup>th</sup> March 2020. Further, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh being in the composite zone, the weather is dry during the reported months of March and April, and hence the infection and mortality is very high. Hence for these states, unless there is control through medicine, the present stringent action of lockdown is the only solution until the south-west monsoon begins in the middle of June. Once the rainfall starts, the dry weather condition will change and the spread rate may reduce appreciably.
