 <xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, that there is a high correlation exists between power infrastructure and energy utilisation with the number of infections and mortality during both March and April. Among the parameters considered for climate severity, monthly average relative humidity correlates better than the monthly average peak temperature, and monthly average minimum temperature with infection and mortality. The negative correlation for the average RH, represent that the decrease in RH increases the number of infection and mortality. Similar results have been reported by various researchers (
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Yueling et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">Jingyuan et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). This confirms that the decrease in RH which increases the drying potential causes the increase in viral spread. Hence it is understood that humidity will play a major role than the temperature, as the mass transfer potential for the respiratory droplets will be high at low humid conditions. It is also a well-known fact than for any drying phenomenon, mass transfer is the major influencing factor than the heat transfer. The effect of population density is the least from the correlation due to lock down and social distancing procedure. This will play a major role if the lockdown is released in the state.
