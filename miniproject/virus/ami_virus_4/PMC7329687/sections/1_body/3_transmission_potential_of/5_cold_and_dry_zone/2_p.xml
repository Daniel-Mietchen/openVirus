<p id="par0100">The cold and dry zone (a condition referred to as CD0 with 5 °C, 40% RH) is a highly unsafe condition since the drying potential already exists at low temperature. A small sensible heating without humidification, in this case, increases the drying potential CD1 (15° C, 20 % RH) and further heating will lead to CD2 (25 °C, 10 % RH), which increases the drying potential to a higher level and there is an additional possibility of the virus becoming airborne. In an environment with low humidity and low temperature, due to combined high heat and mass transfer potential leads to fast drying and size reduction of the respiratory droplets and the virus is almost active in all the locations.</p>
