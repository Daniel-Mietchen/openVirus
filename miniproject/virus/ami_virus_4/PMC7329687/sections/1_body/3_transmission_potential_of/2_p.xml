<p id="par0085">The respiratory droplets released during coughing and sneezing of the infected patient may have a size spectrum ranging from 0.3 microns to 1000 microns. The heavier droplets settle to the floor faster while the particles of lesser size are suspended in the air. These suspended droplets initially have a temperature of 37 °C and the relative humidity may be assumed to be in the range of 80 %, 70 %, and 60 % (DC1, DC2, and DC3) as shown in the Psychometric chart in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> . In this section, how the droplets are dried and size gets reduced under various climatic and the indoor conditions is demonstrated.
