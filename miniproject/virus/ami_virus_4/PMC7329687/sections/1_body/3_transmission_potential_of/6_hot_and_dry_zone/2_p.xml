<p id="par0105">In hot and dry climates, the drying potential for the droplet is higher at HD0 and HD1. If a cooling and dehumidification system is used in a hot and dry climate this will increase the drying potential and thus the virus activity to a dangerous level. Cooling with humidification like spray washer will improve the humidity level and will reduce the risk of viral contamination.</p>
