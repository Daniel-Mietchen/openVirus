<p id="par0095">In cold and humid zones (a condition referred as CH0 with 5 °C, 90% RH), although there is no potential for drying, a small amount of sensible heating from CH0 to CH1 (15 °C, 50 % RH) represented with a drying potential (S1-CH1) and on further heating to comfort temperature CH2, (25 °C, 25% RH) the droplet drying potential (S2-CH2) increases greatly due to relative humidity of 25%. Under such circumstances, the sensible heaters used for the heating system of the room will reduce the relative humidity of the room and will lead to the size and weight reduction of the droplet nuclei and increases the virus activity. The droplet nuclei containing the virus may become airborne (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). Thus in cold and humid places, the indoor environment with low relative humidity will serve as pockets for virus survival. Thus, the virus can be active in cold and humid regions in these moderately dry pockets mentioned above.
