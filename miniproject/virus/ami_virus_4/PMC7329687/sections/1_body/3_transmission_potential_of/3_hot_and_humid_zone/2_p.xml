<p id="par0090">In the hot and humid as well as warm and humid zone regions, the surrounding air has high temperature and humidity, and hence the temperature and humidity potential available for reduction in the size of the droplet is lesser. However, when the air for the indoor environment is conditioned, the air is cooled and dehumidified in the air handling unit and so the potential available for drying S2-RDC (refer in 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> with Room Design Condition 25 °C, 50% RH) is more compared to hot and humid outdoor conditions and hence there is a reduction in the size of the droplets in proportion to room temperature and RH setting. Inside a conditioned room due to the drying of respiratory droplets, the virus is active compared to a hot and humid outdoor environment. The virus is less active in the open spaces of hot and humid conditions as this respiratory droplet nucleus with salt contents, which act as the desiccants absorb the moisture and increase in size due to humidification in the hot and humid conditions. However, in hot and humid conditions, in the air-conditioned indoor environment, where the humidity and temperature are less the virus becomes active due to droplet size reduction. The water content and weight of the respiratory droplet nuclei are reduced and the concentration of virus and salt in the droplet nuclei increases and becomes more active. The reduction in the specific density of the respirator droplet nuclei make it to float and hence become airborne.
