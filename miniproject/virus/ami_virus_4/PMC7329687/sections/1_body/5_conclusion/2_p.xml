<p id="par0145">In the present work, the concept of respiratory droplet drying under various climatic conditions was explained. The variation of the severity relating to the drying potential of the respiratory droplet under different indoor environment conditions is demonstrated with a psychrometric chart. The population density, climate severity, power infrastructure, and energy utilization that represent the use of the HVAC system for all the major states in India are compared with the infection spread rate. The major conclusion arrived and the recommendations made are summarised below.

   <p id="par0150">The results inferred that the spread rate is directly proportional to the energy utilisation in all the states, which could be avoided by proper usage of HVAC systems with a higher set temperature as much as possible for the necessary comfort and the relative humidity in the range of 50 to 60% in the indoor environment in addition to the other recommended measures.</p>

   <p id="par0155">It is concluded from the present study that the region with low humidity has a higher spread potential even in the outdoor environment. Hence the high spread states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan, and Delhi with hot and dry weather conditions, the spread may continue till south-west monsoon begins in the middle of June. Hence the existing lockdown cannot be released till Mid-June in those states particularly in the cities like Bombay and Delhi.</p>

   <p id="par0160">In the southern Indian states, the spread rate due to the outdoor environment is very low. As the summer intensity increases, the effect due to the outdoor environment will further decrease. However, the increase in the use of air-conditioners in the built indoor environment may increase the spread rate. In these states, as summer continues till August, proper measures should be taken while using HVAC systems with the correct set conditions mentioned particularly in the cities like Chennai.</p>

   <p id="par0165">It is also concluded from the present study that the spread rate may reduce in the cold countries in the northern part of the world as summer begins. However, before the next winter starts, it is advisable to modify the kind of heating system adopted to avoid dry conditions in the indoor environment.</p>

   <p id="par0170">Increasing the fresh air circulation is one of the methods to reduce the spread rate by reducing the viral concentration. However, it should be ensured that the recirculation of air should not help the airborne virus to spread easily in the closed room. Hence, in addition to the existing prevailing measures like wearing masks keeping social distance, and washing hands, it is recommended to bring the humidity control check as a mandatory measure in the air-conditioning usage in all the indoor environment to reduce the virus transmission due to fast respiratory droplet drying. This must be done in conjuction with supplying clean outdoor air, avoiding air recirculation, proper use of air filtration technology in the return air. Special attention must be paid in high gathering indoor environment such as public buildings, hospitals, care homes, workplace environments, pubic transportation, school etc.</p>
