<p id="par0070">The mechanism of drying of respiratory droplets and transmission potential is explained initially using the various sources available in the literature. The present work shows how the conventional cooling and heating mechanism in the indoor environment creates the possible drying potential for the respiratory droplet using the psychrometric chart for different climatic zones such as (i) hot and humid zone, (ii) cold and humid zone (iii) cold and dry zone (iv) hot and dry zone. The effect of this drying potential on the size reduction of the droplets and its effect on the spreading of viruses is also analysed.</p>
