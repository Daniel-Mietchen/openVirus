<p id="par0075">In order to assess the concept proposed, the number of infected persons and the mortality from several states of India where different climatic conditions prevail during March and April, 2020, are compared using the selected parameters. The population density is one of the parameter chosen as there is a general agreement that the population density is the reason for its spread. The effect of climate severity in a particular state is brought through the parameters such as monthly average relative humidity, monthly average peak temperature, and monthly average minimum temperature. In any country, 40 % of the total power generated is utilized in the building sector in which 50 % of the energy is utilized for building air- conditioning. Hence 20 percent of the total energy generated in the country is used by the HVAC system. Hence the parameter energy utilisation is considered as another parameter which is proportional to the dry pocket creation during the period of analysis through the HVAC system. Power infrastructure (

The limitation of the analysis is there may be other unknown parameters which may also influence the spread of coronavirus which are not considered in the present analysis. Further, there is a drawback of using the average state-wise data in the analysis due to the possibility of mixed climatic zone prevailing in different places in the same state. A statistical study is thus performed on the dependence of mortality and infection in the Indian states with respect to four major parameters such as population density, climate severity (RH and minimum and maximum temperature), the volume of indoor spaces, and air-conditioning usage based on monthly data for March and April. The correlations obtained from the statistical analysis are well discussed to check whether it supports the concept of respiratory droplet drying under various climatic conditions proposed using the psychrometric chart.
