Hence the major objective of the present work is to propose the mechanism of virus spread under various climates and the indoor environment conditions maintained through the existing theory of respiratory droplet drying. Further, it is aimed to perform a statistical study on the dependence of mortality and infection in the Indian States with respect to four major parameters such as population density, climate severity, volume of indoor spaces, and air-conditioning usage based on monthly data for March and April. This study is done to confirm whether the trend and correlation from the analysis support for the drying of respiratory droplets under dry conditions proposed in the present work. Understanding the mechanism of production of dry pockets in various indoor air environments by the heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is very essential to take appropriate measures and to reduce the rate of transmission.
