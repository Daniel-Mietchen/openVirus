<p id="par0035">There has been some suggestion by the authorities that the most effective approach to prevent the transmission of COVID 19 among the population are: keeping social distance and washing hands. The rationale for such a policy is that virus transmission occurs through direct contact and droplet transmission, and public health professionals believe that using facial masks and gloves is an efficient way in preventing virus spread. It is a general belief that population density is an important parameter in deciding the spread of the COVID-19 virus; however, it is observed that the virus spread is less in densely populated areas in India such as Bihar, Chandigarh, Haryana, Kerala and Puducherry. Hence it is clear from the statistical study, that population density is not the only major parameter and it is one of the major parameters governing the spread of COVID-19 virus. In India, Six cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata) account for 50 % of all reported cases in the country. Lakshadweep is the only region that has not reported any single case (

 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Kay (2020)</xref> has prepared a comprehensive international database of large COVID-19 infection clusters or super spreading events in the spread of coronavirus for February and March 2020. The commonality of the outbreak observed by him is that all the infections were indoor with people closely packed. The main sources of infections are home, workplace, public transport, social gathering, and restaurants. Top 50 outbreaks have happened in the prison, religious houses, meat packing facilities, weddings, funerals, business networking events, call centers, and choir. Outbreaks happened outdoor is a small percentage of around 10%. The author has also mentioned that studies have to be done on the effect of indoor conditions such as temperature and RH in the spread of the virus. The various other factors are classified as:

    <bold>Minimum Infectious dose of virus</bold>: A minimum dose of about 1000 SARS COV2 infectious virus particles is required to start a pathogenesis cascade that can cause new infection (
    <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Kay, 2020</xref>). The successful infection is a product of the dosage of virus and time for exposure. A person can get infected by a strong dose of a virus for a shorter period or a weak dose of the virus for a longer period. For example if 1000 virus particle is required for infection it can happen by 10 particles in 100 minutes or by 100 particles in 10 minutes.

    <bold>Number of droplets released and speed of release</bold>: A cough by a person releases about 3000 droplets at 50 mph, a sneeze releases 30000 droplets at 200 mph and during the breath, about 5000 droplets are released at very low velocity (

    <bold>Age of the infected person</bold>: The amount of the virus released depends on the age of the infected person. It is lesser if the age is less than 20. It increases up to 40 and then decreases with age. When the viral load builds up the person becomes symptomatic (
