  <p>We should be skeptical about reports of a crackdown on the wild‐animal industry in the wake of the Wuhan catastrophe. We don’t know any details about the new laws that have been reported. What will be the enforcement and discipline? Law enforcement in rural China is notoriously lax, in contrast to the cities, where the use of surveillance technology and other means to control the population are widespread. What is the posture toward Chinese medicine, which is a significant driver of the wild‐animal industry? While thousands of such west markets have been closed, how did we get to 2020 with such practices in a city larger than the largest U.S. City?
