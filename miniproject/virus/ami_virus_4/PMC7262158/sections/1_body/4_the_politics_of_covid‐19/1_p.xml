<p>It has been suggested that the real problem is the source of the virus. The virus infects many species of mammals, and many animals serve as a reservoir for the CoVs. Many of these animals are kept in Chinese wet markets, which are a major portion of the Chinese food economy. Indeed, it currently seems as though the pandemic traces its jump from animal reservoirs to humans at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan.

In addition, other wild animals—including those that are reservoir hosts for CoVs—are often housed alongside traditional food sources (pork, fish, etc.), some being sold for medicinal and health purposes. Thus, the wet markets serve as the major point of human contact with CoVs’ animal reservoirs. The reporting done by Sam Ellis has brought wet markets to the forefront of the discussion of COVID‐19.
