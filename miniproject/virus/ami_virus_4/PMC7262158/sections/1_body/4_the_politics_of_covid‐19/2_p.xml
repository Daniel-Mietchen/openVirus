<p>To hear the 
 <italic>National Review’s</italic> Therese Shaheen imagine it, COVID‐19 represents a problem created by the failure of China government.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1013">13</xref> Inadequate governance, or perhaps even ideology is the real problem. In fact, according to Shaheen the problem finds its origin in the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (in effect the standing Executive Committee of the Chinese Communist Party). That is to say, it is a problem of ideology that began with the rise to power of the Communists after the revolution. Better government control will solve the problem. In a sense, Ellis and Shahen are correct; the first SARS‐CoV epidemic of 2002 began in the wet markets China. Several zoonotic epidemics began in ‘China and other regions of the world’ including ‘Ebola, HIV, bird flu, swine flu, and SARS.’
