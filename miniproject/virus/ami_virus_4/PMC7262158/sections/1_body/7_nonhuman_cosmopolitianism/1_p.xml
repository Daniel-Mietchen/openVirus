<p>In order to make our point about the problems generated by the human‐animal interface, we need to give an extended example. In Cape Town, South Africa, residents are often vexed by local baboon populations. Baboons steal food, look through garbage, and, in more dangerous cases, break into people’s homes or even briefly take children hostage as a diversion tactic:

  <p>[M]onitors and field biologists reported that (baboon) troops based at the tourist destination Cape Point will observe picnics being set out by unsuspecting tourists and when the opportunity presents itself, individual baboons will rush forward and take hold of a human child. The child typically reacts by screaming, as does the baboon, and the child’s family rush to its aid. The moment they leave the picnic unattended the troop descends, raids the picnic, and the hostage‐taker releases his or her victim. This is a high‐risk behaviour and as a result is not commonplace.
