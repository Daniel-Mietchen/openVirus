<p>There are many attempts to articulate a nonhumanist cosmopolitanism, and rather than give a total overview of them, we will instead focus on the portrait given by Eduardo Mendieta in his chapter ‘Interspecies Cosmopolitanism.’ Mendieta attacks a cosmopolitanism that hoists the interests of humans above animals wholesale. Interspecies cosmopolitanism cannot merely think the animal as a human, nor the human as merely animal. With Donna Haraway, Mendieta calls for a ‘robust nonanthropomorphic sensibility that is accountable to irreducible differences.’
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1041">41</xref> Mendieta calls for a process of ‘worlding together,’ by which he means a becoming‐with of human and animal together. Humans will have to come to terms ‘with the vertigo of being in a world in which we are no longer exceptional,’ and enter ‘into the messy world of companion species.’
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1042">42</xref> In short, human and nonhuman animals both have their place in an interspecies cosmopolitan order, but such an order must be established without erasing what are ultimately insuperable differences. While humans and, say, orangutans and eels have their place in the order of the world, it is a mistake to say that they have the same interests expressed in the same way.
