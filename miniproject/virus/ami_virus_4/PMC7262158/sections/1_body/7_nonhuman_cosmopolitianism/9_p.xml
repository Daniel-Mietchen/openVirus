<p>Take, as a paradigm example the albedo effect. Large sheets of snow help keep the earth cool by reflecting light that would otherwise be absorbed into the earthâ€™s surface. As the snow sheets melt, this creates a runaway effect. Less snow means less light reflected. Less light reflected means the ground absorbs more light. As the ground absorbs more light, it makes the global temperature warmer. As the global temperature warms, it causes more snow to melt, which causes less light to be reflected, etc. The effect builds upon itself, and, importantly, it is a system which is unaffected by the promulgation of laws.</p>
