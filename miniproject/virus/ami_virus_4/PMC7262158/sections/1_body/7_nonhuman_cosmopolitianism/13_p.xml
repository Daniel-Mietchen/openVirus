<p>This brings us to our key point, namely the kind of thinking that happens in systems: forces which draw responses out of one system do not necessarily draw responses out of other systems, even if their downstream effects can. But, regardless, many forces which draw responses out of one system must be 
 <italic>transformed</italic> before they draw responses out of others. Let us look back to the Cape Town baboons one final time. Imagine the case where a baboon raids a house for food and angers the homeowner. Do baboons respond to the anger of humans? Not immediately! The anger must be transformed or channeled, say in negative facial expressions or in an outward expression of force, in order to disperse the baboons. Yet, it is a grave mistake to say that the homeownerâ€™s anger is impotent short of its being transformed such that it draws a response from the baboons. The feelings of anger certainly draw responses from the homeowner themselves. It will change hormone secretion, affect emotional equilibrium, and so forth. Similarly, even for humans, law 
 <italic>qua</italic> law usually does not immediately draw a response. Law depends on police, courts, prisons, cultural reverence for law, in short a whole assemblage of symbolically mediated apparatuses.
