<p>So, which of these systems is more real than the other? Is it the self‐contained emotional state of the homeowner or the complex formed by considering the homeowner in relation to the baboons? Or is it the troop of baboons itself, even? For the purpose of sharp analysis, we must reject 
 <italic>any</italic> system as fundamentally 
 <italic>more real</italic> than another. If a set of systematic relations exists, it exists. The task of analysis is to locate and identify 
 <italic>which</italic> systems seem most relevant to the types of questions being asked. This problem is, perhaps, cosmopolitanism’s chief pitfall. Cosmopolitanism, by denoting an ethical‐political order works by assessing the states of the 
 <italic>ethically</italic> relevant members who constitute the cosmopolitan order—an 
 <italic>ethical</italic> system in which animals and viruses do 
 <italic>not</italic> forthrightly participate. As a result, however, the tool for 
 <italic>ethical assessment</italic> tends to bleed over into analysis in and of itself. But, just as the runaway effects of the albedo effect are not merely emergent properties from a more fundamental system of law, so too is the state of the cosmos understood in the largest sense not simply emergent from the state of the cosmopolitan project. So, the humanist and anthropocentric mode of engaging COVID‐19 runs into similar sorts of problems, especially around the human‐animal interface.
