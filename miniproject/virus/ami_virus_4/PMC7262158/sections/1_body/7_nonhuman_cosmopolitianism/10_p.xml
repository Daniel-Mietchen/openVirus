<p>Now, we are not saying that human law or human efforts have no ultimate effect on the runaway albedo effect. It is true that if humanity lowers pollution and slows global warming, then the runaway of the albedo effect could be slowed or even halted. However, the point here is that law 
 <italic>qua</italic> law does not draw a response out of the system circumscribed by the albedo effect. The law needs other mechanisms of mediation in order to draw any response. This seems obvious, but it is often not so, and the frustration of this inexchangeability (i.e. of the promulgation of law with law’s downstream effects) often goes unnoticed. The norms or regulating principles of a system are often called that system’s ‘laws,’ but this creates a slippage between law in the physical/social/chemical sense and law in the judicial or moral (i.e. natural law) sense.
