<p>As we have seen, COVID‐19’s origins lie at one level with the wet markets and the culture of shopping in China. However, another way to look at it requires us to set aside a merely humanistic frame and to see how the hoarding of animals, their slaughter and sell in the lively urban areas might lead to the spread. Yet, if we set aside the merely human frame, we might wonder how the animals would vote if given a voice. Is the answer, then, to fold nonhuman animals into the political community? Perhaps if the animals of the wet markets ‘had a voice’, whatever that would look like, then they could have protested their treatment, or perhaps at least cautioned us of the dangers posed by creating such environments. Some thinkers have attempted to rewrite cosmopolitanism to remove its humanist biases.</p>
