<p>On the one hand, as we have shown, cultural origin contradicts Shaheen’s origin story of the wet markets as a corrupt fringe of food production that flourishes in legal dark spots. Wet markets appear to thrive precisely because a culture has grown up around them, and because they supply something that even those in the industrialized West search for, namely freshness. The wet markets thrive for the same reason that farmer’s markets and locally grown food markets have grown in US cities. There seems to be a cultural bias at work here, since the qualities that make wet markets important in the Chinese food economy are similar to those of urbane Westerns. So, the narrative that these markets are primarily backward and permitted only by a corrupt Chinese government would not fit the self‐conception of the average person who shops at an urban wet market.</p>
