<p>As noted by Donald Hodges, the various definitions of humanism stem from Renaissance Humanism, which was a movement of the elites to ground their culture in the learning of ancient Greek and Roman culture.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1032">32</xref> Or, as Engelhardt has so poignantly put it, we ‘should take stock of the words and ideas that cluster around humanism’ and we should ‘appreciate the power of the original insights given articulation by aristocratic, often slave‐holding men whose visions still inspire and liberate twentieth‐century men and women of both democratic and socialist societies.’
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1033">33</xref> The various humanisms are to be perpetuated in a certain form of literate human culture. In time, humanism began to be something that set itself off against ‘religious’ and ‘backward’ learning and practices, and it became more firmly rooted in Protagoras’s claim that the human is the measure of all things. For the most part, Shaheen’s claim that COVID‐19 could have been prevented by better, more cosmopolitan government resembles a Kantian humanism articulated in ‘Perpetual Peace,’ where a league of nations mediates the problems of nation states in a universal cosmopolitanism.
