<p>Now, to be clear, the critique here is not that a cosmopolitan world is in some way undesirable (even if we would want to amend what is meant by cosmopolitanism). Rather, the critique falls on the cosmopolitical tendency to analyze problems in terms of a ‘what can be done’ or ‘what can be enacted legislatively.’ It is doubtless true that a change in Chinese food regulation would have some effect; certainly, it will. Our point is not that a change in regulation could not be part of some mode of action; rather it is that the cosmopolitan deploys an inaccurate analysis to perceive the problem as ‘a failure of Chinese food policy.’ If your only mode of action is to enact legislation (the means by which an idealized humanistic cosmopolitanism enacts change), then you run the risk of perceiving all problems, rather than just parts of their solutions,
