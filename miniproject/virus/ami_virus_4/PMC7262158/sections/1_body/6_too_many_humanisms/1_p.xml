<p>The logic to which Shaheen appeals for the way nation‐states are supposed to interact is a logic of cosmopolitanism, a logic in which nation‐states work together procedurally under a kind of loose common morality, grounded in philosophical humanism. As H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr. points out, philosophical humanism sets out to ground the type of cosmopolitanism that would be found in Shaheen’s argument.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1027">27</xref> The language of humanism carries a felicitous vagueness that lends itself to various meanings, most of which carry a positive moral valence.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1028">28</xref> The language of the cosmopolitanism that animates the commerce between nation‐states gains its generalities at the expense of rootedness.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1029">29</xref> Those that aspire to the language of cosmopolitanism aspire ‘to be at home anywhere—except that is, of course, in what they regard as backward …’
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1030">30</xref> The particular ways in which people carve out their lives—under whatever political regime—is imagined by other political regimes as parochial and simplistic. The drive of humanism is to imagine a shared unity in humanity, where particular differences are dissolved and all of humankind is bound together around that unity. But as Marshall Berman put it in his analysis of modernity, that unity is ‘a paradoxical unity, a unity of disunity: it pours us all into a maelstrom of perpetual disintegration and renewal, of struggle and of contradiction … To be modern is to be a part of a universe in which, as Marx said, “all that is solid melts into air.”’
