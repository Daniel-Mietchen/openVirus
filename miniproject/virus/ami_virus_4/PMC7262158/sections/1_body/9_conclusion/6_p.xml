<p>Thus, problems like COVID‐19 sit at the crossroads of a plurality of different systems, discourses, cultural formations, and realities that resist easy conceptualization. We should reject the over‐simplifications of seeing the problem as one of wet markets in China, or food economies world‐wide, or ‘a failure of legislation’, or what have you. Rather, by setting aside the various humanisms and by imaginatively stepping outside the normativity in the various humanisms, we might open towards new and difficult diagnoses. By doing so, other anchor points where normative leverage may be deployed might come into relief. COVID‐19 straddles too many different systems: culture, cuisine, diet, economic practice, and so forth, for narrow humanisms.</p>
