<p>We would therefore do well to see the origins COVID‐19 through a non‐humanist lens. In fact, COVID‐19 itself poses a unique opportunity to perform such an analysis. The virus, its origin, its proliferation, and its effects, stretch across many different domains. The rapidity of the pandemic has meant that its ‘shocks to the system’ have not yet had time to be absorbed or recuperated by more traditional, narrow forms of analysis. Rather than focusing our diagnosis on the virus‐animal, or the virus‐human, or the animal‐human, or the human‐culture, or the human‐technics, or the technic‐virus interface, we must instead acknowledge a reality that does not forthrightly fit into our systems of thought. To uncritically privilege any one of these interfaces over the others can have devasting consequences.</p>
