<p>Perhaps our own interests, then, depend on the imaginative ability of the human animal—the activity of human mind to imagine beyond its own being. Many of the popular, typical responses to pandemics like COVID‐19 are ready‐made and tool‐like; in fact, the tool‐like responses themselves are what frame the question. Each way of taking up with the problem, each way of questioning COVID‐19 has its ready‐made tool‐like solution in mind. And each way of taking up with COVID‐19 constricts what is possible to imagine, limiting the spectrum of possible answers. The different levels of reality all too often exceed a ready‐made conceptual construction or tool‐like intervention. These human‐centric approaches focus on humanity, its ability to act, and what affects it and thereby constrict what it is possible for us to think. Much is left hidden from our taking up the pandemic we now face.</p>
