<p>CoVs are RNA viruses, and SARS‐CoV‐2 represents a new evolutionary branch within the CoVs. RNA viruses tend to have higher mutation rates than DNA viruses, in part because of the extra steps necessary for viral reproduction and thus the increase in potential transcription errors.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1006">6</xref> However, the exact mutation that has resulted in the present pandemic is not certain. Genomic sequencing and comparison between SARS CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV showed extremely high homology at both the nucleotide level (RNA) and the proteonomic level. The nucleocapsid protein is highly conserved across these CoVs.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1007">7</xref> The CoV spike stalk protein (S protein) is also highly conserved, and it seems the S protein mediates the infection by binding to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme‐2 (ACE‐2) receptors in epithelial cells. Not only does this result in the host cell taking in the CoV into its cytoplasm, it also blocks the ACE2 receptor, resulting in the down regulation of the ACE‐2 receptor. At the same time, it has the physiological effect of upregulating angiotensin II and also upregulates a different type (1a) of ACE‐2 receptor. Overall these biochemical effects create physiological effects resulting in interstitial pulmonary edema, which has been seen in SARS and which in turn results in respiratory distress and a life‐threatening condition.
