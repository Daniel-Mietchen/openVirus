<p>Given that the mutation rates of RNA viruses are higher, and given that we have already seen the rise of three novel CoVs since the first SARS patients were identified in 2002—including SARS‐CoV, SARS‐CoV‐2, and MERS‐CoV—one can imagine that it is a mutation in the RNA code for the S protein that has resulted in higher infectious rates and in the more severe and deadly respiratory distress syndrome.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1009">9</xref> While it is true that viral mutations do in fact result in the possibility of a more infectious and deadly virus, it is also true that viral mutation is not merely the result of mechanical error in the process of RNA reverse transcription, to DNA transcription, and then the transcription of DNA back into RNA in the viral reproductive cycle. In fact, the very conditions of the human‐animal interface results both in environmental pressures for viral mutation and viral success (in the evolutionary sense), and also in human infection.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1010">10</xref> Thus, CoVs present a case in which we must expand our thinking beyond virology and viral mutation, and even beyond epidemiology in order to engage the problem represented by the COVID‐19 pandemic. We thus turn to the wet markets of Wuhan, China, where it is believed the virus leapt from the animal reservoir to the human animal, creating human disease.
