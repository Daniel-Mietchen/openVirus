SARS‐CoV‐2 is one individual virus that belongs to the family of 
 <italic>Cornonavirdiae</italic> (which has 39 species in 27 subgenera, five genera, and two subfamilies) in the suborder of 
 <italic>Cornidovirineae</italic>, the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, in the realm of 
 <italic>Riboviria</italic>.
