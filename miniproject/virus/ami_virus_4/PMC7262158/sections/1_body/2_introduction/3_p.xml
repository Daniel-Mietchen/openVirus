<p>Most ways of imagining this problem, we will argue, are grounded in humanistic ways of thinking. The normativity that animates humanistic ways of thinking limits how the question of COVID‐19 is framed; it is delimited by the kinds of answers that can be given. Put differently, every question is already a type of quest; some spectrum of possible answers is already assumed in the act of questioning, while others are excluded. In the first section of this paper, we will present a typical narrative of the origin of COVID‐19 as the result of genetic mutation, and then as some sort of failure of Chinese law, revealing how these are inaccurate and inadequate explanations: their inaccuracies result, we will argue, from framing the problem as a cosmopolitical dispute. Next, acknowledging the agricultural origins of COVID‐19, we will look at counter‐models of cosmopolitanism, specifically ones that include nonhuman animals as cosmopolitical subjects. We will show why this approach is deficient by invoking systems analysis. We will then unfold two recent and related non‐humanistic ways of imagining evolution, including simultaneous human and viroid evolution. We draw on the work of Bernard Stiegler for insight into the way life evolves by means other than life, namely through technical innovation; and benefit from Keith Ansell‐Pearson’s proposal that machinic thinking may be required at all levels.</p>
