<p>In this paper we will argue that modern epidemics and pandemics—such as the one the world currently faces—escape humanist and anthropocentric ways of thinking; as a consequence of this it is hard to gain normative purchase to even begin to resolve the problem. While pandemics can be thought in terms of particular systems, say a public health system, the problem can also be thought in terms of a long list of other options, such as viral mutation rates, or as a problem of technology, in that the failure of some countries to transition to modern refrigeration and food storage techniques has resulted in wet markets. It can be imagined as a problem of political economy or a result of globalization. Unfortunately, any one of these ways of asking questions restricts the global answers that may be required.</p>
