<p>Each way of framing the question of COVID‐19 imagines its particular approach or angle of attack as getting to the heart of the problem. But so far, each way of thinking about normative interventions into COVID‐19 has fallen short of the complexity of the whole. For instance, imagining it as a problem of viral evolution and viral infection, and thus focusing on vaccine or therapeutic interventions misses much of the problem. The public health approach sees it as a problem of health across populations, whereas seeing COVID‐19 as a problem of wet markets imagines the problem to be one of food economy in China. Seeing COVID‐19 as a problem arising in China might imagine it to be the result of government ideology; as often carried out, imagining it as the result of the cosmopolitan interaction of nation states conflates modes of action with modes of analysis. Inevitably, any systematic construal of the problem falls short of the complexity of what is happening. We must imagine the problem holistically as a techno‐organic evolutionary political‐economic complex.</p>
