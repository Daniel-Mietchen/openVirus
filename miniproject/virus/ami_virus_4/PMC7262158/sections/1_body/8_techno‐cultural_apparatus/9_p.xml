<p>While Stiegler is certainly more sophisticated than those who place so much emphasis on the arrival of technology as the next stage of becoming—the arrival of the silicon age—transhumanists forget that bacteria have engaged in a prehuman ‘metallurgy’ with their ‘use of magnetite for internal compasses’ long before humans arrive on the scene.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1061">61</xref> Apropos to our task here, Ansell Pearson notes, ‘[c]reative evolution on earth would have been impossible without the genetic engineering that characterizes viroid life.’
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="heyj13570-note-1062">62</xref> In other words, we have come full circle to viroid life that is SARS‐CoV‐2. Ansell Pearson, following Deluze and Guattari, but also correcting them, understands life and its evolution as a process of involution and a process taking place in what he calls the mechnosphere. It is the ability of viruses to ride, not just on biological entities but on technological entities, products of artifice created by humans that governs evolution. Ansell Pearson encourages us to think of it in terms of a mechanosphere, where viroid life is imagined as mechanics. If we think in nonhumanist or non‐anthropocentric terms—insofar as that is possible—we might have a better picture of what the human is up against in the midst of this multivalent mechanosphere. The human trick, however, is to not lose hope in the face of a world where human agency seems so impotent.
