<p>While certain features of the technologically‚Äêmediated, epiphylogenetic inheritance fall into the background and may no longer shape the future, other features that conform to the goal of permanent innovation come into play, such as the triumphalist history that construes technological innovation as progress. That is, human actors come to imagine 
 <italic>any</italic> form of technological innovation as progress. Certain aspects of the failures of the past become the primary background against which innovation is judged as progress for the benefit of perpetual innovation. It is thus not so much biological inheritance that drives human evolution and human culture; rather it is the disruption created by technological innovation that recursively comes to shape culture and cultural memory, or the cultural memory that matters for the sake of permanent innovation. Again, life proceeds by means other than life.
