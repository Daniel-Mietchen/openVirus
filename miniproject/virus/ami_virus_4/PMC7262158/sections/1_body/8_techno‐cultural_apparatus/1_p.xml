<p>Picking up on some of the points to which we alluded in reference to Haraway, the problem of COVID‐19 must now be considered form the point of view of the non‐human world of technics. Just as humanistic analysis misses something ethically important at the human‐animal interface, we now turn to the human‐technics interface. There are several ways in which technics might be seen as participating in the problem. On the positive side, we can imagine more widely available and widely accepted refrigeration technologies, which might result in the reduction of wet markets, and which, in turn, might reduce the interaction of wild‐animal, domesticated food animals, and humans, thus reducing the rate of transmission of viruses for zoonotic hosts to humans. On the negative side, of course, this ‘better‐world’ would come at the price of a larger carbon footprint as the result of increased electricity needed to make this a possibility. Or we could see the problem as one in which the COVID‐19 pandemic is the result of globalization made possible by the technologies of mass transit. Technology, then can be imagined as both the slave and the master. In this sense, we might imagine technology as having some form of agency or impacts upon the world, some of which are unintended consequences of human actors and consequences outside human anticipation.</p>
