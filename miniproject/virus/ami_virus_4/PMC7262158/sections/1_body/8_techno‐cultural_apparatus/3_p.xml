<p>In fact, technology has its own automaticities—self‐motion—and its own tendencies that are not fully under human control. One need think only of an assembly line, in which there are machines building machines. The machines carry the human intentions forward to build cars, for example, but the human actors in the factory are marginal to the activity. The humans are there only to assure the smooth running of the machines; the machine calls for human activity only when the machine fails. Humans are responsive to the machine, as much as the machines are responsive to the human will.</p>
