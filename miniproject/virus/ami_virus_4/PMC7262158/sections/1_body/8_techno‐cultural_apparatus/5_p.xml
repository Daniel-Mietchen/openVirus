<p>On Stiegler’s account, just as technology sets future development, it also shapes the past. To make this point, Stiegler notes that there are three modes of inheritance that shape the human being. The first mode is genetic inheritance, which is the unconscious biological inheritance that bequeaths to human life its biological foundations. The second form is what he called epigenetic

This form of inheritance could include the conscious awareness of the genetic inheritance, and the meaning or significance of the biological genetic inheritance for lived experience. Epigenetic inheritance is simply the routine memory of an individual, shaping her particular projects. The third form Stiegler calls the epiphylogenetic inheritance, which is the inheritance of the past that is recorded in and through our technologies. This inheritance is technologically mediated by books or by monuments, or recordings. It includes institutions like libraries and universities that carry the past into the present shaping how human actors imagine the future. Human evolution is technologically mediated by this epiphylogenetic inheritance.
