<p>To bring further clarity to this way of thinking about the problem of COVID‐19, we turn to the work of Bernard Stiegler in his three‐volume work, 
 <italic>Technics and Time</italic>. Stiegler sets out to argue that while we tend to believe that technology is inert and only gets deployed through human intentionality, the realities of technological activity are much more complex. Our way of imagining technological activity owes its vision to a long history. First, Plato’s distinction between 
 <italic>episteme</italic> and 
 <italic>techne</italic> (and thus the distinction between philosophy and sophistry [Protagoras’s ‘man as the measure of all things’]) sets the epistemological trajectory of Western philosophy in motion; 
 <italic>techne</italic> and the technical arts are merely instrumental, an instrument of sophistry. Second, Aristotle’s distinction between natural and technical beings is that natural beings having their own motion within themselves, and technical objects only have their source of motion outside themselves; this distinction set the trajectory of Western thinking on ontology, such that technical objects are imagined as inert, relying solely on the intentions of the human animal for their motion.

Thus, Stiegler concludes, in the mainstream Western way of thinking, technical objects are more like rocks than they are like living beings, which are organized and ordered to some end.
