<p>Blown up to the scale of thinking about technology as a technological system, we can see the global techno‐capital system. An example used by Stiegler will be illustrative of his point. The use of tariffs on the importation of English iron into France in the mid‐19
 <sup>th</sup> Century. With the tariffs in place, and with the decrease in cheap English iron, France could not develop the strong steel rails that could support the weight of more powerful steam engines. Thus, France lagged behind England in technological development and had to change its tariff laws in order to enter back into the system of technological development.

In fact, novel, progressive, and indeed permanent technological innovation sets the horizon of the cultural imaginary. Technology leads culture, which is to say it leads cultural evolution. Life evolves by means other than life itself—namely by technological mediation. Permanent innovation sets the pace of evolutionary development.
