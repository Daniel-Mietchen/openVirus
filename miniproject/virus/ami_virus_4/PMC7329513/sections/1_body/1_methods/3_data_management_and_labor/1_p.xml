<p id="Par26">Data were entered in Epi Info 7 and analysed using STATA (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). Risk ratios (RR) were calculated to evaluate the risk of filovirus seropositivity between different exposure groups and the unexposed control group, and to compare the risk for seropositivity between hypothesized higher-risk exposure groups (miners and their household members) to the lower risk exposure group (non-miners living within 50â€‰km of the mines). To investigate significant risk factors for seropositivity among all participants (exposed and unexposed groups), we computed Odds Ratios (OR), which provide a reasonable estimation of the Risk Ratio (RR) since the exposure-outcome is less than 10% [
