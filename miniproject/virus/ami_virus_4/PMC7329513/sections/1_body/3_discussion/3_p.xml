<p id="Par35">Another filovirus serological study by Nkoghe et al. (2011) in rural Cameroon and Gabonese populations where the prevalence of Ebola virus was higher in populations near forests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A second study in Gabon found that pygmies, who are forest dwellers, had a higher percentage of ebolavirus seroprevalence than other populations at 7.02% compared to non-pygmies (4.2%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This further indicates that communities that live in the forested areas, like the ones we studied in western Uganda are at higher risk of infection with filoviruses compared to those living in more developed or non-forested areas. Forested areas tend to have a greater abundance of fruiting trees that provide food to the fruit bats, the hypothesized reservoirs of ebolaviruses. However, in this study, going into the forest was not shown to be a risk factor for individuals being seropositive for filoviruses. While our investigation found that being a miner, but not necessarily living near the mines, is highly associated with being seropositive for filoviruses, it is likely that since the Kitaka caves are in a forested ecosystem near a national park that is comparable to the central African forest, this makes the mines a more attractive location for bats to live. Gold mining has been previously described as a risk factor for Marburg virus infection in a study in DRC [

We report artisanal mining and going inside the mines as risk factors for being seropositive for filoviruses, including Sudan virus, in Uganda (AOR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.3–8.5). The very first cases of Ebola virus were reported in mining communities in DRC in 1976.
