<p id="Par34">We expected a higher seroprevalence against Marburg virus than ebolaviruses, but the opposite was observed with ebolaviruses seroprevalence being higher than Marburg virus. Whereas it has been confirmed during previous investigations that bats occupying the mines are actively infected with Marburg virus and had been associated with two MVD outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], no outbreak of EVD has been reported in this region. It was therefore surprising to find higher seroprevalence to ebolaviruses instead of the expected Marburg virus. We cannot clearly explain why Marburg virus seroprevalence is lower than that of ebolaviruses, but this is consistent with other studies where the two pathogens have been tested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. One of the explanations could be that the antibodies for Marburg virus are not as long-lasting compared to those of ebolaviruses. Studies in Egyptian rousette bats have shown that IgG antibodies against Marburg virus do not last more than 3 months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the same study, bats were protected by secondary immunity when reinfected with Marburg virus. If a similar mechanism occurs in humans is yet to be fully understood, and further studies of the immune responses in MVD survivors in Uganda are needed. Another possibility for this finding is there could be a reservoir for ebolaviruses or another closely related filovirus in Kitaka mines and/or inhabiting the area around the Kasyoho-Kitomi reserve ecosystems to which these individuals were exposed, especially the gold miners. This area is near Queen Elizabeth National Park, and so there is a possibility of having an unknown reservoir of ebolaviruses in the game reserve that has not been previously identified.
