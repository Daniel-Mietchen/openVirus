<p id="Par41">These variations in seroprevalence could be due to differences in filovirus ELISA testing protocols and potential cross-reactivity caused by a non-filoviral infection. The test, developed by CDC that was used in this study is more specific than other filovirus serological tests used in previous filovirus seroprevalence studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This serological test was developed and validated by US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on known positive and negative human samples with a sensitivity &gt; 90% and specificity of &gt; 90%. However, we still see serological cross-reactivity within filovirus species even with this test as was reported by McNeil et al 2011 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. For example, one person in this investigation was seropositive for both Sudan virus and Bundibugyo virus, likely a cross-reactivity rather than representing previous exposure to Bundibugyo virus species, as has been described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Testing for filoviruses using serological tests can potentially overestimate the true level of seropositivity and therefore overestimate risk and exposure due to varying cross-reactivity between differing and unvalidated serological assays used in previous studies. We are continuing to classify these serological results with validation assays including viral neutralization to confirm if our findings represent true undetected filovirus infections in these communities, or through cross-reaction with other viral infections, or variability in serologic assays performed.
