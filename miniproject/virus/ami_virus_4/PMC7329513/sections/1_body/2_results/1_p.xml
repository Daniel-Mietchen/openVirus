The mean age of all participants was 36.3 years (SD = 14.8, 95% CI = 35.2–37.4), the median age was 33.0 years (range 3–82), and 85.6% (620/724) of the sampled people were ≥ 20 years. Males represented 54.1% (391/724) of the people sampled. There were no significant differences in age, sex, and education level between the three exposure groups and the non-exposed group. Most participants were farmers (67.7%) whereas 71.6% of participants had primary school education or less.
