 <xref rid="bib0955" ref-type="bibr">Mack et al., 2000</xref>). A similar phenomenon has been reported involving microparticles, HIV, and CXCR4 (
 <xref rid="bib1230" ref-type="bibr">Rozmyslowicz et al., 2003</xref>). CCR5 expression is also influenced by the release of EVs, specifically microparticles (
 <xref rid="bib1205" ref-type="bibr">Renovato-Martins et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, EVs have the potential to attribute greater complexity to CCR5 roles in viral infections. It is possible that the presence of CCR5 in cells is not only dependent on mechanisms of membrane expression and internalization of the receptor. It can also be dependent on CCR5 delivery mediated by EVs. However, the actual impact of EVs on CCR5-mediated immune response in infections remains to be determined and deserves further investigation.
