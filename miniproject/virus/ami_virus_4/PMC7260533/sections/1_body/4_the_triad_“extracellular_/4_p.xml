<p id="par0355">EVs participate in immune evasion processes, ultimately allowing viruses to bypass host defenses (
 <xref rid="bib0705" ref-type="bibr">Kaminski et al., 2019b</xref>). For example, HIV is likely to usurp the exosome biogenesis pathway in such a way that enhances its infectivity, while increasing its evading strategies from the host immune defenses (
 <xref rid="bib0395" ref-type="bibr">Ellwanger et al., 2017a</xref>). Regarding TBEV, exosomes were indicated as important participants in both viral infection and pathogenesis; in this case, tick-derived exosomes facilitate TBEV transmission to the host. Also, exosomes derived from TBEV-infected host neurons can facilitate the spread of the virus in the CNS (
 <xref rid="bib1700" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Exosomes have shown multi-dimensional roles in DENV life cycle. They can modulate negatively or positively DENV pathogenesis, where they are suggested as instrumental for Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever development in reason of the transportation of specific microRNAs (
 <xref rid="bib1025" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>). Since HCV can be found inside exosomes (
 <xref rid="bib0925" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), it is not suprising that blood-derived exosomes from HCV-infected patients can transmit the virus to other cells (
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">Bukong et al., 2014</xref>). These findings suggest that exosomes and other EVs assist in the transport of HCV particles/components between cells, ultimately facilitating viral infection. Of note, EVs can transport multiple viral components or molecules from virus-infected cells that end up facilitating the spread of the virus in the host. On the other hand, EVs can act in favor of the host, transporting molecules that assist host defenses in the elimination or control of infections (
