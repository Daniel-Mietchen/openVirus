<p id="par0365">Finally, a truncated CCR5 soluble form (
 <xref rid="bib1510" ref-type="bibr">Tsimanis et al., 2005</xref>), as well as soluble CXCR4, have also been reported in the plasma of humans (
 <xref rid="bib0965" ref-type="bibr">Malvoisin et al., 2011</xref>). Of note, the truncated CCR5 soluble form has ∼22 kDa (half the size of the CCR5 found on cell membranes) and is truncated at the end of the second extracellular loop (the third extracellular loop and the subsequent three transmembrane regions are absent) (
 <xref rid="bib1510" ref-type="bibr">Tsimanis et al., 2005</xref>). However, the existence of cell-free soluble CCR5 is still controversial and does not represent a consensus in the scientific community. Such doubts occur mainly in consideration of the structure of the receptor, which is highly characteristic of a cell membrane-associated molecule. We believe that EVs-containing CCR5 can explain potential (misleading) detections of soluble CCR5. The importance of circulating EVs-containing CCR5 on viral infections represents an additional and interesting open question to be investigated.
