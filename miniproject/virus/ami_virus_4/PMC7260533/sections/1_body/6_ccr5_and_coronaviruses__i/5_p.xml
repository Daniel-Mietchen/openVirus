<p id="par0395">Taking together, the findings mentioned above suggest that CCR5 could have some influence on the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, future studies addressing humans are needed to clarify this suggestion. In this sense, we emphasize that so far, there is no evidence showing a clear involvement of CCR5 in SARS-CoV-2 human infection.</p>
