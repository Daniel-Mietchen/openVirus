 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Intracranial infection of mice with Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV, a murine coronavirus) induces an increased CCR5 expression, which contributed to MHV-induced demyelination through CCR5-mediated macrophage recruitment to the CNS (
 <xref rid="bib0525" ref-type="bibr">Glass et al., 2001</xref>). Subsequent studies using MHV-infected mice showed that CCR5 participates in the regulation of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell activities against the virus in the CNS (
