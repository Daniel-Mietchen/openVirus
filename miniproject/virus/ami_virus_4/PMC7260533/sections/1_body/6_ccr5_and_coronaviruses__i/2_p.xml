Until 2019, humans have faced two major outbreaks of high pathogenic coronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak (

Considering the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the clinical variability observed in the affected individuals, ranging from mild to severe respiratory disease (
