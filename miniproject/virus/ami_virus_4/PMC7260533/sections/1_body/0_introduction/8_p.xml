<p id="par0060">The main results involving the triad “CCR5, HIV, and CCR5Δ32″ were published in 1996 in 
 <italic>Nature</italic>, 
 <italic>Cell</italic> and 
 <italic>Science</italic> papers by different groups (
 <xref rid="bib1120" ref-type="bibr">Parmentier, 2015</xref>). Since then, the research involving CCR5 has explored the role of the CCR5 protein and CCR5Δ32 polymorphism in different diseases, as well as the therapeutic potentials of CCR5 blockade. Currently, the physical interaction of CCR5 with HIV is known in detail (
 <xref rid="bib1340" ref-type="bibr">Shaik et al., 2019</xref>) and the research involving the impacts of CCR5Δ32 on HIV infection has led to the development of CCR5 antagonists: quite effective drugs used in the treatment of HIV-infected individuals, especially the licensed drug Maraviroc (Pfizer, Inc.), an allosteric modulator approved for clinical use in 2007 (

 <xref rid="bib0840" ref-type="bibr">Latinovic et al., 2019</xref>). Also, a recent study has shown that molecules that inhibit CCR5 trafficking to the plasma membrane also have a therapeutic potential against HIV infection (
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Boncompain et al., 2019</xref>). Research involving CCR5 has also brought other important advances in combating HIV infection. Of note, there are already two cases of sustained remission of HIV infection following stem-cell transplantation using CCR5Δ32 homozygous donor, the “Berlin Patient” (
