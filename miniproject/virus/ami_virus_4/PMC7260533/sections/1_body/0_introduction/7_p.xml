<p id="par0055">The CCR5Δ32 is the most studied genetic variant of the 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> gene because of its strong protective effect against HIV infection (considering susceptibility to CCR5-tropic strains). HIV entry into CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells is mediated by the interaction of the virus with CD4 and with a co-receptor, usually CCR5. The CCR5Δ32 variant is a 32 base-pair deletion in the 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> coding region, which causes a frameshift, resulting in a truncated protein that is not directed to the cell surface. CCR5Δ32 in heterozygosis promotes a decrease in the expression of functional CCR5 on the cell surface compared to 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> wild-type cells. Therefore, individuals with heterozygous genotype for CCR5Δ32, if infected with HIV, have a small protection against disease progression due to the reduced expression of CCR5 on the surface of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (reduced HIV−CCR5 interaction). In CCR5Δ32 homozygous cells, no CCR5 is expressed in the plasmatic membrane. Therefore, homozygous individuals for this polymorphism (Δ32/Δ32) show virtually total protection against HIV type 1 infection, since no CCR5 expression is verified on cell surface (no HIV−CCR5 interaction at cell surface is possible) (
