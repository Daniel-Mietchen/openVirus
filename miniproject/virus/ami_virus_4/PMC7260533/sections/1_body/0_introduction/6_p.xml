<p id="par0050">The human CCR5 protein (352 residues) is encoded by the 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> gene [Chromosome 3 (3p.21.31)], which is very polymorphic (

 <xref rid="bib0635" ref-type="bibr">Hoover, 2018</xref>). Among polymorphisms of the 
 <italic>CCR5</italic>, the CCR5Δ32 (rs333) has been intensively studied in different human populations. The frequency of the CCR5Δ32 is quite variable. In general, the Δ32 allele frequency is high in European-derived populations (for example, 16 % in Norway and 11 % in Germany) and low or absent in African and Asian populations (
 <xref rid="bib1405" ref-type="bibr">Solloch et al., 2017</xref>). However, although the Δ32 allele is more frequent in European populations, there are exceptions due to migratory events. For example, the frequency of the Δ32 allele is high in South Africa (13 %) and Chile (12 %) (
