<p id="par0045">The number of available receptors on the cell surface is related to the rate of internalization and recycling of CCR5, which affects the activation of CCR5 and consequent signaling of specific pathways that culminate in chemotaxis processes (
 <xref rid="bib1050" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2002</xref>). Of note, intracellular pools of CCR5 can be detected in the cells. These pools are probably formed by internalized or immature/precursor forms of CCR5 molecules (

 <xref rid="bib0770" ref-type="bibr">Kohlmeier et al., 2008</xref>). In other words, CCR5 molecules are recycled by cells. Specifically, CCR5 recycling can be mediated by degradation followed by 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis (in response to stimulation by natural antibodies) or occur in the classic short-term system without 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis (in response to stimulation by CCL5, for example) (

 <xref rid="bib1560" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The traffic of CCR5 between the plasma membrane and the intracellular medium is mediated by different molecules, including clathrins, Î²-arrestin 2, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1 (

 <xref rid="bib1560" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1570" ref-type="bibr">Venuti et al., 2018</xref>). Also, intracellular CD4 regulates the expression of CCR5 on the cell surface (
