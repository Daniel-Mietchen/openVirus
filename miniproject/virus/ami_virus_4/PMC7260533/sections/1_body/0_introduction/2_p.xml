<p id="par0030">Inflammatory cells play a crucial role in protecting the host from viral infections. Leukocyte migration is a fundamental step of the inflammatory response to viruses, a process regulated by the interaction between chemokines and their receptors. Therefore, dysregulations in the chemokine-mediated inflammatory process may contribute to viral pathogenesis (

The C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) interacts primarily with the chemokines CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), and CCL5 (RANTES), which act as CCR5 agonists by stimulating cell migration and mediating inflammatory responses. On the other hand, the chemokine MCP-3/CCL7 is the main CCR5 antagonist ligand (
