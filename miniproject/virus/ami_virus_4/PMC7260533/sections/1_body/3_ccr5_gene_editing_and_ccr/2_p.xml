<p id="par0320">In 2019, the multiple roles of CCR5 in physiological and pathological conditions gained the attention of the scientific community and lay public due to 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> gene editing in human embryos, the “CRISPR babies”, performed by a Chinese biophysicist. The researcher claimed to have used CRISPR gene editing technology to edit the 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> of germline cells to mimic the effects of CCR5Δ32, aiming to generate babies resistant to HIV infection. The ethical, safety, and legal aspects related to this procedure have caused an intense and broad discussion in the media and scientific literature (

Also, the consequences of the CCR5 absence have brought many concerns to light, once the CCR5 protein participates in tissue development processes, control of immune responses, and several other physiological processes. Considering these concerns, our group and others described some undesirable effects associated to natural CCR5 absence (due to the CCR5Δ32 homozygous genotype) and 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> editing (
