<p id="par0335">I) The non-redundant characteristics of the CCR5 should be taken into consideration when studying the CCR5 protein and the effects of CCR5Δ32 on viral infections: The traditional concepts of redundancy and robustness of the chemokine system consider that the absence of a specific chemokine or chemokine receptor is adequately compensated by other molecules. Although these concepts are generally correct for some chemokines/receptors and for some physiological conditions, the lack of CCR5 expression may affect the host protection against some specific infectious diseases once the CCR5 absence is not perfectly compensated for by other receptors (
