<p id="par0340">II) Studies evaluating the actual impact of CCR5 antagonists on neuroinvasive infections are needed: It is possible that those individuals using CCR5 antagonists (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, for the treatment of HIV infection) and living in areas endemic for neuroinvasive viruses, especially WNV and TBEV, may be at increased risk of developing viral encephalitis-related problems. However, it is still necessary that studies consistently evaluate this assumption, since the available evidence does not support risks for the use of CCR5 antagonists in endemic areas of flaviviruses (

As mentioned in the topic addressing WNV in this review, it is prudent to recommend to individuals using CCR5 antagonists to adopt measures to minimize the risk of neuroinvasive infections, such as the use of mosquito repellents and mosquito nets (considering the risk of WNV infection), and to limit their exposure to tick-infested areas (considering the risk of TBEV infection). Concerns regarding the use of CCR5 antagonists in areas of JEV circulation have also been raised by other authors (

 <xref rid="bib0825" ref-type="bibr">Larena et al., 2012</xref>). If the connection between the use of CCR5 antagonists and increased risk of neuroinvasive infections is confirmed in methodologically well-controlled studies, these recommendations should be considered of essential importance for users of CCR5 antagonists.
