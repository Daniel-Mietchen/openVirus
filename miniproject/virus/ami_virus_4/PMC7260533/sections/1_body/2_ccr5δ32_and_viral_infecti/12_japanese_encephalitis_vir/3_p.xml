 <xref rid="bib0825" ref-type="bibr">Larena et al. (2012)</xref> showed that CCR5 protects the host against JEV infection in the CNS, being essential for disease recovery. CCR5-deficient mice showed higher viral loads in the brain and spinal cord as well as increased mortality rate, as compared to control mice (
 <xref rid="bib0825" ref-type="bibr">Larena et al., 2012</xref>). Also using a mouse model of Japanese encephalitis, 
 <xref rid="bib0745" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al. (2016)</xref> demonstrated that CCR5 controls the infiltration of CD4
 <sup>+</sup>Foxp3
 <sup>+</sup> T regulatory (Treg) cells in the CNS, contributing to protection against Japanese encephalitis. The infiltration and action of inflammatory cells in the brain are important to limit neuroinvasive infections, processes that are regulated by multiple factors, especially cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, including CCR5. However, the uncontrolled action of inflammatory cells can cause damage to the CNS. Of note, CD4
 <sup>+</sup>Foxp3
 <sup>+</sup> Treg cells regulate the immune responses, avoiding undesirable or excessive action of inflammatory cells (
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Bardina and Lim, 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1545" ref-type="bibr">Veiga-Parga et al., 2013</xref>;

 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Campbell, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0745" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). According to these pieces of evidence, CCR5-mediated action of Treg cells is critical for the control of Japanese encephalitis. However, the role of CCR5 in JEV infection may be more complex than it appears at first. 
 <xref rid="bib0935" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2018)</xref> demonstrated that the use of the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc reduces the JEV-induced inflammation in mice brain, increasing survival rate. This result suggests that potential deleterious effects of CCR5-mediated inflammation in the brain may override the effects of CCR5-mediated action of Treg cells and, therefore, the use of CCR5 antagonists to treat Japanese encephalitis may be beneficial. Based on these complex and contradictory results, it can be concluded that CCR5 indeed has an important influence on Japanese encephalitis, but it is not yet possible to state its specific roles, once they are varied and appear to be context-dependent. Also, the results obtained in animal models may not fully represent the disease course in humans.
