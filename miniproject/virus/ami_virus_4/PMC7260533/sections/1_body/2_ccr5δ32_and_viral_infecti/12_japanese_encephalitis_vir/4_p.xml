<p id="par0305">Indeed, some evidences suggest the involvement of CCR5 in the pathogenesis of Japanese encephalitis in humans. In Indian individuals with mild cases of Japanese encephalitis, a significant dowregulation of the

 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">Deval et al. (2019)</xref> investigated the effect of various genetic variants, including CCR5Δ32, on the development of Japanese encephalitis in individuals from North India (
