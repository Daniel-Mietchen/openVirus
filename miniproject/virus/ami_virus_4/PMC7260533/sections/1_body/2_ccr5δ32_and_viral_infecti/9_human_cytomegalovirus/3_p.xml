<p id="par0255">CMV can manipulate the immune system producing virokines (virus-encoded cytokine/chemokine homologs) and viroceptors (virus-encoded cytokine/chemokine receptor homologs), molecules that enable the virus to evade host immune defenses. Such molecules can also facilitate viral replication (

 <xref rid="bib1585" ref-type="bibr">Vomaske et al., 2012</xref>), potentially affecting the pathogenesis of diseases in which CCR5 have an involvement, especially HIV infection. CMV infection in immunocompromised HIV/AIDS patients can cause different problems, including retinitis, esophagitis, gastritis, pneumonitis, and hepatitis (

 <xref rid="bib0685" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>). However, mixed results were reported regarding the effect of CMV on CCR5 expression since there is evidence indicating that CMV infection may reduce CCR5 expression in various cell types (

 <xref rid="bib1540" ref-type="bibr">Varani et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, these mixed results may not be contradictory. CMV-infected cells may indeed exhibit decreased CCR5 expression, limiting HIV infection in these cells. However, CMV-infected cells release CMV-associated soluble factors that increase CCR5 expression in non-infected bystander cells, then facilitating HIV replication in such cells and, consequently, contributing to HIV pathogenesis (
