<p id="par0250">Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the

However, in some cases, it can cause mononucleosis syndrome or other rare complications, including meningitis and myocarditis. CMV is an opportunistic pathogen and, therefore, symptomatic infection occurs more frequently in immunocompromised individuals (HIV infected or transplanted patients on immunosuppressive drugs). Congenital CMV infection is associated with morbidity and mortality in newborns, being associated with neurodevelopmental problems (

 <italic>e.g.</italic>, pUL122, pUL123, pUS28, pUL83, pUL111A) activate pro-oncogenic pathways, including angiogenesis, escape of immune control and tumor suppressors, tumoral inflammation, invasion and metastasis, genome instability, and increased cell survival and proliferation (
