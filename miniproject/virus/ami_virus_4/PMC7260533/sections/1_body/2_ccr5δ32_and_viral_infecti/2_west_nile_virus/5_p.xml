<p id="par0100">In agreement with studies showing that CCR5Î”32 homozygous genotype is a risk factor for symptomatic WNV infection in humans, 
 <italic>Ccr5</italic>-/- WNV-infected mice showed a reduced capacity of viral control, increased disease severity, impaired leukocyte trafficking towards the brain, and high mortality rates than 
 <italic>Ccr5</italic> wild-type mice. These findings reinforce that Ccr5 is a key molecule in the immune response against WNV (
