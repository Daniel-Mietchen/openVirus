 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">Diamond, 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1015" ref-type="bibr">Michlmayr and Lim, 2014</xref>), but the effects of CCR5Δ32 on the susceptibility to this infection and disease progression are different. According to 
 <xref rid="bib0910" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al. (2010)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">Danial-Farran et al. (2015)</xref>, CCR5Δ32 has no important effect on susceptibility to WNV infection. In accordance, 
 <xref rid="bib0940" ref-type="bibr">Loeb et al. (2011)</xref> found no association between CCR5Δ32 and WNV infection. Conversely, there is robust population-based data showing a strong association between the CCR5Δ32 homozygous genotype and increased risk of developing symptomatic WNV infection (

 <xref rid="bib0905" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2008</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0910" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Also, 
 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Bigham et al. (2011)</xref> showed that the CCR5Δ32 variant was associated with symptomatic WNV infection when the dominant model of inheritance was considered in the analysis. A recent meta-analysis confirmed the role of the
