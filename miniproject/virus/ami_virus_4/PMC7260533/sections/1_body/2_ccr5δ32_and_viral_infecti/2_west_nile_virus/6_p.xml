<p id="par0105">Based on the data mentioned above, the lack of CCR5 expression linked to CCR5Δ32 homozygosis is an important risk factor for increased severity of WNV-associated disease. The opposite effects of the CCR5Δ32 genetic variant on both HIV and WNV infections are summarized in 
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> . Hereupon, individuals homozygous for CCR5Δ32 and living in endemic areas of the WNV should take additional care to prevent WNV infection (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, use of repellents, mosquito nets). Also, the use of CCR5 blockers to treat HIV infection may have a negative impact on populations living in WNV-endemic areas. To avoid this negative impact, HIV-infected individuals who live in such areas and who use CCR5 blockers must apply robust measures against mosquito bites (
