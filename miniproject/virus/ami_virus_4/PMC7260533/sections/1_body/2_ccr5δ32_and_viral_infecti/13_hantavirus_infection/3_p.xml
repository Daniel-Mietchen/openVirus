 <xref rid="bib0760" ref-type="bibr">Kletenkov et al. (2019)</xref> evaluated the potential influence of the CCR5Δ32 on nephropathia epidemica in individuals from Republic of Tatarstan, Russia (
 <xref rid="tbl0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Of note, in their study, the authors stated hantavirus infection as the cause of Nephropathia epidemica, not specifying the PUV detection. No statistical difference was observed in CCR5Δ32 genotype frequencies between cases and controls, indicating that CCR5Δ32 does not influenced the susceptibility to hantavirus infection in the studied population. Considering only nephropathia epidemica cases, the study revealed an association between the wild-type homozygous genotype (functional CCR5) and increased severity of the disease. Conversely, the heterozygous genotype was considered a protective factor against increased disease severity (

 <xref rid="bib0760" ref-type="bibr">Kletenkov et al. (2019)</xref> suggest that further studies evaluating the roles of CCR5 and CCR5Δ32 on hantavirus infection are important.
