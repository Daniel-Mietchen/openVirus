<p id="par0310">Puumala virus (PUV) infection is a zoonosis endemic in Europe. PUV is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> family, genus 
 <italic>Hantaviridae</italic>. Most PUV infections are mild or subclinical. In some infected individuals, PUV is responsible for the development of nephropathia epidemica, a milder form of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, a condition typically caused by other Hantaviruses (
