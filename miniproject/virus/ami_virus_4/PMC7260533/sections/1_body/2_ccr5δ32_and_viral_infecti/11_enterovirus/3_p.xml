<p id="par0285">Some studies suggest that CCR5 influences different aspects of the pathogenesis of viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family, including Encephalomyocarditis virus (

 <xref rid="bib1045" ref-type="bibr">Muehling et al., 2018</xref>), once CCR5 participates in the regulation of the host immune response during infection by these viruses. Considering the effects of the genetic variant CCR5Δ32 on CCR5 expression and CCR5-related immune responses, it is possible that CCR5Δ32 also shows some impact on EV-related diseases.
