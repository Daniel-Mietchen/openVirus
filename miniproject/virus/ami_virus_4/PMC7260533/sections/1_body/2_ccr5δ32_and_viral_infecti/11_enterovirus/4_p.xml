<p id="par0290">In a German study that evaluated patients with enteroviral (chronic/inflammatory) cardiomyopathy (

It was suggested that the CCR5Δ32 genotyping could be used to assist in the prediction of the clinical progression of enteroviral cardiomyopathy: the Δ32 allele as a predictor of a better prognosis, without the need of antiviral interferon-β (IFN-β) therapy; and the wild-type genotype as a predictor of a worse prognosis and immediate need of antiviral IFN-β therapy (
 <xref rid="bib0835" ref-type="bibr">Lassner et al., 2018</xref>). The clinical use of IFN-β is effective to eliminate the virus, avoid irreversible cardiac injury, and reduce mortality rates, but it is also associated to numerous adverse effects (

 <xref rid="bib0835" ref-type="bibr">Lassner et al., 2018</xref>). Considering the prognostic value of the CCR5Δ32 on the clinical course of enteroviral cardiomyopathy, it is necessary to evaluate the relationship between the CCR5Δ32 and the disease in different human populations, mainly through genetic association studies. If this association is confirmed in other populations, the CCR5Δ32 genotyping will be a broad-spectrum clinical tool, enhancing and driving the treatment of enteroviral cardiomyopathy.
