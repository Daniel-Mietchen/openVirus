<p id="par0140">The relationship between CCR5Δ32, HPV infection, and cervical lesions is addressed in other studies (
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). CCR5Δ32 homozygous genotype was associated with increased susceptibility to HPV infection in a study performed with Swedish individuals (
 <xref rid="bib1685" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2006</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib0975" ref-type="bibr">Mangieri et al. (2019)</xref> investigated the potential influence of CCR5Δ32 on susceptibility to HPV infection and cervical lesions in Brazilian women. However, the genetic variant was not significantly associated with susceptibility to HPV infection (considering allele frequency, codominant model and dominant model) or HPV-associated lesions (
 <xref rid="bib0975" ref-type="bibr">Mangieri et al., 2019</xref>). In accordance, previous studies performed with Brazilian women did not find an association between CCR5Δ32 and susceptibility to HPV infection (
 <xref rid="bib1445" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>) or between the polymorphism and HPV-related cervical lesions (
 <xref rid="bib1445" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1300" ref-type="bibr">Santos et al., 2016</xref>). Lastly, CCR5Δ32 did not affect susceptibility to HPV infection in Lithuanian individuals with laryngeal cancer (
 <xref rid="bib1425" ref-type="bibr">Stumbrytė-Kaminskienė et al., 2020</xref>). In conclusion, although tissue analysis and evidence obtained 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> suggest that the CCR5 is potentially involved in the pathogenesis of HPV, most studies point to a lack of involvement of CCR5Δ32 in susceptibility to HPV infection or HPV-associated diseases.
