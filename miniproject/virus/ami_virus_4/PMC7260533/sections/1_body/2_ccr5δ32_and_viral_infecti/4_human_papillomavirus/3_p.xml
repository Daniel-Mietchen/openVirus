 <xref rid="bib1390" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2008</xref>), the genotype and allele frequencies of CCR5Î”32 were not different between cervical cancer patients and controls. However, when the patients were stratified by cancer stage (stages 1B to 4), the CCR5 heterozygous genotype was associated with stage 1B of cervical cancer. The HPV positivity rate among the evaluated patients was not described (
