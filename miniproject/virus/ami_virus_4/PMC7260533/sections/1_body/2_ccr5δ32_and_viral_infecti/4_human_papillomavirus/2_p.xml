<p id="par0130">Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the papillomavirus family. HPV is transmitted by direct contact (for example, through sexual intercourse). The HPV infection is quite common worldwide, and is usually controlled by the immune system. Viral clearance occurs in most cases within 1–2 years after infection. However, if the infection is not controlled, HPV can cause non-cancerous mucosal lesions or different types of malignant lesions such as anal cancer, penile cancer, vulvar cancer, head cancer, neck cancer, and especially cervical cancer. HPV is an oncogenic pathogen because it inhibits the activity of p53 and Prb (retinoblastoma protein) tumor suppressor molecules through the action of E6 and E7 viral proteins, respectively. These proteins also exhibit other oncogenic mechanisms. Worldwide, between 5–10 % of all cancers in women are due to HPV infection (

Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent HPV infection, having important positive impacts on multiple aspects of population health. HPV vaccine protects the vaccinated individual from infection
