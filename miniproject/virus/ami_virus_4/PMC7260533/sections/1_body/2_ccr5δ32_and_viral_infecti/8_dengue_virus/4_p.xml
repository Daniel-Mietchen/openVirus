 <xref rid="bib0680" ref-type="bibr">Islam et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, DENV infection is associated with increased frequency of human CCR5 
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (

 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Badolato-Corrêa et al., 2018</xref>). In a study performed by 
 <xref rid="bib0985" ref-type="bibr">Marques et al. (2015)</xref>, lower viral replication was found in macrophages treated with CCR5 blockers. In the same study, CCR5-/- mice were protected from DENV infection. These findings suggest that CCR5Δ32 could be a protective factor against DENV infection. However, 
 <xref rid="bib1635" ref-type="bibr">Xavier-Carvalho et al. (2013)</xref> found no statistical difference in the frequency of CCR5Δ32 polymorphism between Brazilian children with severe DENV infection and healthy controls. In the same direction, no effect of CCR5Δ32 on susceptibility to DENV infection was found in a small sample-size study performed with individuals from Western Australia (
