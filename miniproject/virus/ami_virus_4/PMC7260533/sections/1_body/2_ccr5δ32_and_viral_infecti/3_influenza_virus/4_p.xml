<p id="par0120">Although flow cytometry data did not indicate significant changes regarding CCR5 expression on the surface of human monocytes after experimental influenza A infection (
 <xref rid="bib1265" ref-type="bibr">Salentin et al., 2003</xref>), various studies have shown that, in mice, the lack of CCR5 expression is associated with a higher risk of death by influenza infection (

 <xref rid="bib0450" ref-type="bibr">Fadel et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, more research on this aspect is needed since this data suggests that, in humans, the CCR5 absence due to the CCR5Î”32 polymorphism could affect pathogenesis and the lethality rate of influenza infection.
