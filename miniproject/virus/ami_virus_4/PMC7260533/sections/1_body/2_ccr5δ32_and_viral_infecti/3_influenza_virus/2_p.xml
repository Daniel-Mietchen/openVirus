<p id="par0110">Influenza infection affects humans seasonally, causing recurrent epidemics and even pandemics in some years. In humans, the infection is caused basically by influenza A and influenza B, both enveloped negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family (
 <xref rid="bib0790" ref-type="bibr">Krammer et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1145" ref-type="bibr">Petrova and Russell, 2018</xref>). Influenza A is a zoonotic disease, and influenza B circulates primarily in humans. Influenza infection affects mainly the respiratory tract, which can cause mild to severe disease depending on viral and host characteristics. Secondary bacterial infection may also occur (
