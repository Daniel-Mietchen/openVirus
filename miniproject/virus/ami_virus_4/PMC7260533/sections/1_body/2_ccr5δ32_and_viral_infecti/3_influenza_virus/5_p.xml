 <xref rid="bib0455" ref-type="bibr">Falcon et al. (2015)</xref> evaluated the frequency of the CCR5Δ32 in pandemic H1N1-infected Spanish individuals and revealed an association between the polymorphism with fatal outcome. The CCR5Δ32 was also associated with increased disease severity in other studies (
 <xref rid="bib0725" ref-type="bibr">Keynan et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1210" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>). However, these results should be interpreted with caution since both studies were based on very small sample sizes (
 <xref rid="bib0725" ref-type="bibr">Keynan et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1210" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, other studies addressing humans reported no association between CCR5Δ32 and severity of influenza infection (

 <xref rid="bib0960" ref-type="bibr">Maestri et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1000" ref-type="bibr">Matos et al., 2019</xref>). Taking together, the body of evidence suggests that CCR5Δ32 has little influence on severity of influenza infection (

 <xref rid="bib0455" ref-type="bibr">Falcon et al. (2015)</xref> seem to be specific to that studied population, composed of individuals from 13 regions of Spain.
