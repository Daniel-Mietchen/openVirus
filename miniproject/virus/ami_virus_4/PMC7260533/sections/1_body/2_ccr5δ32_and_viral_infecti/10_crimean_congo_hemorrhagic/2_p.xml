<p id="par0265">Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Nairovirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>. CCHFV circulates in Africa, Europe, Middle East, and Asia countries, and can infect a variety of domestic animals and wild species, but without causing symptomatic illness. Humans are accidental hosts of CCHFV, for which the virus is transmitted mainly by tick-bites (especially ticks of the genus 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic>), although other routes of transmission also exist, such as exposure to blood of infected animals. Most CCHFV-infected individuals have no symptoms or have mild nonspecific febrile syndrome. However, in some individuals, the infection can cause the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a severe disease characterized by fever, myalgia, hemorrhage, among other manifestations. Neurological complications can also occur, being the spectrum and intensity of the disease quite variable (
