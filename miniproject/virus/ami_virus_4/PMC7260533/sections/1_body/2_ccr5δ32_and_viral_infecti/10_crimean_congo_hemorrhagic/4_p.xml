 <xref rid="bib0440" ref-type="bibr">Engin et al. (2009)</xref> evaluated the CCR5Δ32 in 15 Turkish CCHFV-infected individuals and observed the wild-type homozygous genotype in all cases. In a subsequent study evaluating the Turkish population, 
 <xref rid="bib1245" ref-type="bibr">Rustemoglu et al. (2017)</xref> found a protective effect of CCR5Δ32 heterozygous genotype and Δ32 allele on CCHFV infection, since the genotype and allele frequencies were higher in controls than in CCHFV-infected individuals. Conversely, the wild-type genotype (normal CCR5 expression) was prevalent among infected individuals. These findings suggest that CCR5 contributes to susceptibility to CCHFV infection and that CCR5 down-regulation due to CCR5Δ32 results in some protection against the infection. However, further studies are needed to explain the mechanisms by which CCR5 participates in CCHFV infection. In the same study, the CCR5Δ32 was not significantly associated with disease severity, clinical parameters, or mortality rate (
 <xref rid="bib1245" ref-type="bibr">Rustemoglu et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these findings (
 <xref rid="tbl0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>) indicate that the effect of CCR5Δ32 is given specifically on resistance against CCHFV infection, without affecting the pathogenesis/outcome of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.
