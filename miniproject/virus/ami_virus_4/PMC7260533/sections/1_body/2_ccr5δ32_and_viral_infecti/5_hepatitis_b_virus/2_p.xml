Individuals who have not cleared the virus after acute infection become chronic HBV carriers. Of note, chronic HBV infection affects 3.5 % of the world population. A portion of individuals who develop chronic infection have a variety of liver diseases: different levels of inflammation and fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer. The outcome of the infection (acute or chronic) as well as the course of liver diseases, depends on the interaction between host and viral factors. The pharmacological therapies available to treat HBV are not satisfactory, since frequently the infection is only controlled, and cure is rarely achieved.
