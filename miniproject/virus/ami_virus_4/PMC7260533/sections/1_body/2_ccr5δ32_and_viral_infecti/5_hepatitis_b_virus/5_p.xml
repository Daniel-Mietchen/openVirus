<p id="par0160">Some authors have observed significant influences of CCR5Δ32 on HBV infection. 
 <xref rid="bib1430" ref-type="bibr">Suneetha et al. (2006)</xref> reported an association between the CCR5Δ32 heterozygous genotype and chronic HBV infection. In contrast, 
 <xref rid="bib1480" ref-type="bibr">Thio et al. (2007)</xref> found an association between the CCR5Δ32 allele and infection recovery in a study that analyzed individuals with persistent HBV infection and individuals who recovered from the infection. Subsequently, 
 <xref rid="bib1485" ref-type="bibr">Thio et al. (2008)</xref> associated the HBV infection recovery with an epistatic effect between the CCR5Δ32 and the 
 <italic>RANTES</italic>-403A promoter polymorphisms. Finally, 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Abdolmohammadi et al. (2016)</xref> found a protective effect of the CCR5Δ32 genetic variant against HBV infection, once the Δ32 allele was more frequent in controls compared to HBV-infected individuals.
