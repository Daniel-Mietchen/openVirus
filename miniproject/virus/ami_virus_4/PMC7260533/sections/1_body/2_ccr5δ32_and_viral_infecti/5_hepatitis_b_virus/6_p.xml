<p id="par0165">Recently, we investigated the frequency of CCR5Δ32 in HBV mono-infected and HBV/HIV co-infected Brazilian individuals (
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">Ellwanger et al., 2020b</xref>). A control group and HIV mono-infected individuals were also evaluated in our study. A total of 1113 individuals were studied, which represents the largest study involving CCR5Δ32 and HBV infection to date (see 
 <xref rid="tbl0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> for comparisons with other studies). We found a significant protective effect of CCR5Δ32 on HBV/HIV co-infection, a result probably due to the partial protective effect of CCR5Δ32 against HIV infection since no important impact of CCR5Δ32 on susceptibility to HBV mono-infection was observed (
