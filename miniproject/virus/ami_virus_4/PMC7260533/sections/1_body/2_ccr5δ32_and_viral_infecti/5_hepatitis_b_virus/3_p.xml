<p id="par0150">The CCR5 and its ligands regulate the action of T cells and other leukocytes in the liver. Thus, CCR5 regulates liver inflammation and participates in the local immune response against viruses (

 <xref rid="bib1290" ref-type="bibr">Sanchooli et al., 2014</xref>). In mice models of hepatitis, CCR5 deficiency was associated with increased liver inflammation, tissue injury, and liver failure (

 <xref rid="bib1420" ref-type="bibr">Stevens et al., 2019</xref>). Deficiency of CCR5 expression is generally associated with reduced migration of inflammatory cells, which would translate into less inflammation. This reasoning is correct and applies to different situations and tissues (

 <xref rid="bib0700" ref-type="bibr">Kaminski et al., 2019a</xref>). However, CCR5 is an immunoregulatory molecule (

 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">Christmann et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0675" ref-type="bibr">Hütter et al., 2011</xref>) and therefore its deficiency can also cause deregulation in the action of various immune cell types (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, NK and Treg cells), increasing the inflammatory status in some tissues. In humans, multiple evidence has shown the involvement of CCR5 (protein and gene) in distinct aspects of HBV infection (

 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Ahmadabadi et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1645" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, CCR5Δ32 and other host genetic factors can affect the immunogenicity of the HBV vaccine (

 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">Ellwanger and Chies, 2019b</xref>). Considering these aspects, the influence of the CCR5Δ32 on susceptibility/resistance to HBV and disease severity is quite plausible.
