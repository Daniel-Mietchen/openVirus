<p id="par0190">A recent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study suggested that CCR5 blockage could have a beneficial effect on the treatment of HCV infection since CCR5 antagonists (maraviroc and cenicriviroc) inhibit HCV replication (

 <xref rid="bib0505" ref-type="bibr">Giaquinto et al., 2018</xref>) and these drugs have the potential to treat a number of diseases in which CCR5 is involved, including HCV-associated liver disease. Although the use of CCR5 antagonists on HCV mono-infection is not yet approved, it can be useful specifically for co-infected HIV/HCV patients, where CCR5 blocking (maraviroc) is already recommended (

 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Blackard et al., 2019</xref>). However, the detailed patterns of CCR5 expression in different tissues and at various points in the clinical course of HCV infection are still poorly understood. According to a recent study, the expression of CCR5 in CD8 
 <sup>+</sup> T cells is increased in the liver of chronic HCV-infected patients (
 <xref rid="bib1165" ref-type="bibr">Pirozyan et al., 2019</xref>), but other studies have found mixed results regarding CCR5 expression on T cells in the context of HCV infection (

 <xref rid="bib1580" ref-type="bibr">Vincent et al., 2005</xref>;

 <xref rid="bib1665" ref-type="bibr">Zahran et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, considering that the role of CCR5 in HCV infection is still uncertain, the potential use of CCR5 blockers to treat HCV mono-infection should be cautious.
