In addition to liver damage, HCV causes a series of immune-mediated extrahepatic manifestations, including rheumatologic, dermatologic, ophthalmologic, renal, pulmonary, neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, and hematologic manifestations, especially mixed cryoglobulinemia (

Early treatment of infected patients decreases death rates from HCV-associated liver disease, reduces disease transmission, and alleviates extrahepatic health problems. Focusing the efforts on HCV treatment is extremely important because there is no effective HCV vaccine (
