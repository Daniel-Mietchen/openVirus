 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Ahlenstiel et al. (2004)</xref> highlighted that the impact of CCR5 on HCV infection was controversial. In 2020, many controversies remain, although some points are better defined. 
 <xref rid="tbl0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> summarizes the main findings of the studies that evaluated CCR5Δ32 on HCV infection. Although some studies indicate an influence of the polymorphism on susceptibility to infection, most studies indicate that the Δ32 allele has little (or no) influence on HCV susceptibility. The impact of the CCR5Δ32 on HCV-related liver disease is quite variable and context-dependent. Finally, available data suggest some benefit of CCR5 antagonists for the treatment of HCV mono-infection. However, these data are still limited and further studies evaluating this topic are needed.
