<p id="par0210">The potential impact of the CCR5Δ32 polymorphism on response to HCV therapy was also evaluated by some authors. 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Ahlenstiel et al. (2003)</xref> found an association between the CCR5Δ32 allele and reduced response rates to interferon-α monotherapy, but the polymorphism did not affect the response to the combined interferon/ribavirin therapy. This finding shows that the use of more robust therapeutic regimens compensates the undesirable effects of CCR5Δ32 on HCV therapy with interferon-α monotherapy. Of note, the effect of CCR5Δ32 may be negligible in the context of modern HCV therapies (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Ahlenstiel et al., 2003</xref>). Other studies did not report significant effects of the polymorphism on response to HCV therapy (
 <xref rid="bib0510" ref-type="bibr">Glas et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1175" ref-type="bibr">Promrat et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0555" ref-type="bibr">Goyal et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0995" ref-type="bibr">Mascheretti et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1435" ref-type="bibr">Suppiah et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib1030" ref-type="bibr">Morard et al., 2014</xref>). Again, it is important to mention that the ethnic distribution of the CCR5Δ32 allele could interfere with study results. 
 <xref rid="bib0780" ref-type="bibr">Konishi et al. (2004)</xref>, for example, did not detect the CCR5Δ32 allele in any Japanese individual included in their study focused on host genetic factors involved in the response to interferon therapy. Lastly, the polymorphism also does not appear to be associated with any specific HCV genotype (

 <xref rid="bib1600" ref-type="bibr">Wasmuth et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0555" ref-type="bibr">Goyal et al., 2006</xref>).
