<p id="par0185">Infiltration of inflammatory cells in the hepatic tissue is a classic observation in HCV infection. Chemokines and chemokine receptors participate in the recruitment and activity of inflammatory cells in the liver, acting on anti−HCV immune responses and ultimately modifying the rate of inflammation and other histological manifestations observed during infection. Based on this rationale, the CCR5 molecule was postulated as having an impact on HCV-induced liver injury, susceptibility to HCV infection, and modulation of the possibilities of viral clearance. The downregulation of CCR5 due to CCR5Δ32 may interfere in these processes (

In agreement, several polymorphisms in other immune system genes [especially human leukocyte antigen (HLA), mannose-binding lectin (MBL), toll-like receptor (TLR), interleukins (IL), and interferon (IFN) gene families] indeed modify both susceptibility to HCV infection and disease progression (
