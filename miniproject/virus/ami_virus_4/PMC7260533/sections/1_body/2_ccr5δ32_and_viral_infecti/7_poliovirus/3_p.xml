 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2019</xref>). Considering that CCR5 affects the course of other neuroinvasive viral infections such as TBEV and WNV, it was hypothesized that CCR5Δ32 could influence the development of neurological impairment associated with PV infection, as this only occurs in a portion of infected individuals (

 <xref rid="bib1225" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg et al. (2013)</xref> evaluated the effect of the CCR5Δ32 on severe cases of PV infection through a retrospective study performed in Finland, including rare samples of individuals with neurological symptoms from the 1984–1985 PV outbreak occurred in that country (
 <xref rid="tbl0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> ). The authors found no statistically significant effect of the CCR5Δ32 on PV infection; only a trend of association between the Δ32 allele and increased risk of PV infection was observed (
 <xref rid="bib1225" ref-type="bibr">Rosenberg et al., 2013</xref>). However, this study had a very small sample size (only seven cases of severe PV infection were evaluated) and therefore the results were not conclusive. In addition, due to the declining number of PV infection cases in the world, the effect of CCR5Δ32 will be increasingly difficult to be assessed in population-based studies.
