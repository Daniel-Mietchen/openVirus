<p id="par0220">Poliovirus (PV) is a single-stranded RNA enterovirus of the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. There are three types of PV: wild PV type 1 (WPV1), type 2 (WPV2), and type 3 (WPV3). The PV replicates in the tonsils and intestinal tract. In few infection cases (âˆ¼1%), the virus invades the CNS and can cause poliomyelitis resulting in paralysis. Poliomyelitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the gray matter of the spinal cord and muscle paralysis unleashed by PV replication in motor neurons (

The global PV vaccination program (Global Polio Eradication Initiative) has virtually eliminated cases of PV-derived paralysis, which currently occur to a limited extent in some countries, such as Pakistan and Afghanistan, and are caused by WPV1, while WPV2 and WPV3 have not circulated in human populations since 1999 and 2012, respectively (
