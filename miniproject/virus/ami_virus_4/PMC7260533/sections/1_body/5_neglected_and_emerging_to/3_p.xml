 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Badolato-CorrÃªa et al. (2018)</xref> reported that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection induces an upregulation of CCR5 expression on T cells. Of note, ZIKV is another mosquito-borne flavivirus that recently reemerged in many countries, affecting Brazil in particular. ZIKV infection is associated with microcephaly and other human development problems (

 <xref rid="bib1660" ref-type="bibr">Zachova et al. (2019)</xref> showed that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells have increased CCR5 expression compared to EBV-non-infected cells. Also, recent evidence points to a pivotal role of the CCR5 in the attenuation of rhinovirus-associated inflammation, by controlling the activity of CD4

 <sup>+</sup> Treg cells (
