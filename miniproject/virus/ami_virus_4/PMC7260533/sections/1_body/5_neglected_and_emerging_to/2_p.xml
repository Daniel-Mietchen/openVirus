 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Chávez et al. (2013)</xref> demonstrated an involvement of the CCR5 protein in the infection by Rocio virus (ROCV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus that caused a major human encephalitis outbreak between 1975 and 1980, in the region of Ribeira Valley, São Paulo State, Brazil (
 <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr">Ellwanger et al., 2017b</xref>). Specifically, using a mouse model of ROCV-associated encephalitis, CCR5-deficient mice showed increased survival rate and reduced levels of brain inflammation compared to mice expressing CCR5, indicating the participation of CCR5 in ROCV-associated encephalitis (

 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Chávez et al. (2013)</xref>], the role of the CCR5 in ROCV infection represents a neglected topic. This knowledge gap should be addressed in further studies since the reemergence of ROCV in Brazil is a concern in terms of public health (
