<p id="par0075">This article is characterized as a narrative review. The selection of the articles was carried out from an initial search on PubMed (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/" id="intr0030" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>), using the terms “CCR5”, “CCR5Δ32”, “virus”, “viral infection”, “exosomes”, and “extracellular vesicles” (separately and in association). After extensive analysis of article abstracts, it was established that the review would address the following viruses: West Nile virus, Influenza viruses, Human papillomavirus, Hepatitis B virus, Hepatitis C virus, Poliovirus, Dengue virus, Human cytomegalovirus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Enterovirus, Japanese encephalitis virus, Hantavirus, Rocio virus, Zika virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Rhinovirus. All original articles that evaluated the involvement of CCR5 or CCR5Δ32 in the infections caused by the mentioned viruses were analyzed. Subsequently, the Google Scholar (

The authors of this review tried to include the largest number of original articles that addressed the topic covered in this work, intending to write a broad and complete article. However, some papers were not included because it was not possible to obtain clear conclusions from the studies. The reference lists of the consulted articles were also used to complement the selection of articles for this review.
