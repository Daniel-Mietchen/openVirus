<p id="par0080">As previously mentioned in the introduction, a discussion addressing the involvement of CCR5 in TBEV infection was not included in this work. Articles addressing the involvement of CCR5 and CCR5Δ32 in HIV infection were included only to present to the reader some basic and historical aspects related to such topics, cited mainly in the introduction section and figures, but not included as a major section of the article. Considering the importance of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, a section addressing the potential influence of CCR5 on the immune responses to coronaviruses was included in this article. Review articles were also selected in PubMed and Google Scholar for writing the sections and paragraphs that address the basic aspects of viruses, exosomes, and diseases (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, epidemiological, molecular, clinical aspects). Exceptionally, review articles with outstanding discussions regarding the role of CCR5 in viral infections were also cited in this work. Regarding tables, it is important to note that the data available in the “Population” columns are limited and often represent only general characteristics of the evaluated population. In many studies, a population can be composed of individuals from various ethnic groups. This limitation must be taken into account when evaluating the results of the studies cited in the tables. Finally, also in “Population” columns, “information not available” was used when this information was not clearly described in the cited article.
