<p id="par0415">The few studies involving CCHFV, EV, and Hantavirus infection have indicated important effects of CCR5Δ32 on these conditions. Based on these findings, further studies should investigate the role of CCR5Δ32 and CCR5 protein in such infections, considering populations with distinct genetic backgrounds. Some evidence suggested the participation of CCR5 in infections by ZIKV, EBV, and rhinovirus. Also, a mouse model of ROCV-associated encephalitis suggested an important role for CCR5 in host immune responses against the virus. However, the roles of CCR5 and CCR5Δ32 in infections by ZIKV, EBV, rhinovirus, and ROCV are still poorly understood and need to be investigated in future studies. The role of EVs in the transport of CCR5 between cells indicates that the expression of CCR5 on the cell surface may also depend on the release of EVs containing CCR5. Also, the transport of host molecules and viruses through EVs adds complexity to the topics covered in this review and should be taken into account in future studies that investigate the role of CCR5 in viral infections. Gene editing technologies have the potential to be used to treat different diseases, mainly when applied to somatic cells. However, 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> gene editing in human embryos presents a number of ethical problems. Besides, the absence of CCR5 can have deleterious effects in certain conditions, such as increased susceptibility to symptomatic WNV infection. Finally, this article showed that the participation of CCR5 in different viral infections is complex and varied and, therefore, cannot be generalized. This article also pointed out neglected gaps in knowledge involving CCR5 that should be addressed in future studies.
