<p id="par0410">The frequency of CCR5Δ32 is quite varied among human populations, and therefore the effects of the allele in a particular population may not apply to another population. Moreover, the effects of CCR5 and CCR5Δ32 are disease-specific. For instance, the CCR5Δ32 does not significantly affect susceptibility to WNV infection. However, the effect of the CCR5 and CCR5Δ32 on WNV disease progression is very robust. Some animal-derived findings suggest the involvement of the CCR5 in the pathogenesis of DENV infection. However, the effects of CCR5 on DENV infection are very different between humans and rodents. Of note, CCR5Δ32 does not significantly affect susceptibility to DENV infection or disease progression. Moreover, the effect of CCR5Δ32 on HBV-related disease is population-specific. Interestingly, CMV release virokines, which are molecules that can manipulate the host immune response and affect the CCR5 function. The examples cited above highlight the varied impacts of CCR5 and CCR5Δ32 on viral infections.</p>
