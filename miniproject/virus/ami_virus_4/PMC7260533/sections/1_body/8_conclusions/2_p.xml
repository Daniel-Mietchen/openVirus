<p id="par0405">Research involving CCR5 and HIV began in the mid-1990s. Since then, many achievements in the field of CCR5/HIV research have been made, such as the identification of CCR5Î”32 as a strong protective factor against HIV infection and the development of CCR5 antagonists for the treatment of HIV infection. Currently, these drugs are being tested for the treatment of other inflammatory and infectious diseases. In this context, the use of CCR5 antagonists has raised some concerns, since the blockade of CCR5 can affect or even weaken the host defenses against certain infections, especially neuroinvasive infections by flaviviruses. However, to date, there is no strong evidence indicating that the use of CCR5 antagonists has increased the susceptibility of individuals to problematic flaviviruses infections.</p>
