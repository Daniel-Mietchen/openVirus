<p id="p0015">On the other hand, the use of a pseudovirus system can greatly aid in avoiding the handling of highly contagious viruses. The pseudovirus system is a generating platform which utilizes vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or lentivirus vectors, among others [
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The advantages of using such a system is its rapid production, it is quantifiable, and is relatively safe since progeny viruses can only undergo a single replication cycle [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the lentivirus-vector system, although most of the vectors are derived from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), modified versions of the lentivirus vector are non-pathogenic [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is also the case in the VSV-ΔG pseudovirus system. In this system, the VSV-ΔG vector lacks the G envelope protein of VSV, thus allowing for recombination with a foreign envelope protein and/or reporter gene. Establishment of pseudoviruses using the lentivirus-vector system have been previously reported for emerging and re-emerging viruses that require BSL-3/4 facilities such as NiV [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], MARV [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], CHIKV [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and certain influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Ebola [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and LASV [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] pseudoviruses have produced using both lentivirus and VSV-ΔG pseudovirus systems. In cases such as influenza and coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) which their surface proteins mediate entry into host cells, hemagglutinin (HA) and spike (S) protein, respectively, are combined with the pseudovirus vector. Cleavage of HA0 to HA1 and HA2 has been reported to be necessary for virus infectivity and determines the pathogenicity of the virus [

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>]. Similarly, cleavage of the S protein to S1 and S2 of coronavirus enhances cell–cell fusion, increases viral entry efficiency, and determines virus infectivity [
