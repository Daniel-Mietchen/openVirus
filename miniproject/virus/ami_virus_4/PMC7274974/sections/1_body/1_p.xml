<p id="p0010A">Throughout the years, many viruses have emerged and re-emerged. An emerging virus may be defined as a newly discovered virus that has recently appeared within the population. Re-emerging viruses on the other hand may be defined as viruses that continuously reappear, thus causing many epidemics/outbreaks. Viruses such as enteroviruses (EV), dengue virus (DENV), and influenza viruses (e.g. H1N1, H5N1, H7N9) to name a few, are considered re-emerging viruses due to their constant reappearance in the population [

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], reassortment (e.g. influenza virus) [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and recombination (e.g. enteroviruses) [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] aid in the evolution of the virus, allowing it to cause new outbreaks, and potential pandemics, with each re-emergence [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Emerging viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome â€“ coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola virus, Zika virus (ZIKV), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Nipah virus (NiV), and the most recent SARS-CoV-2 have also resulted in large epidemics and pandemics [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In order to combat both emerging and re-emerging viruses, effective drugs and vaccines are needed to treat and prevent the viral infections. However, in order to do so, certain bio-safety level facilities are required for the handling of viruses that are considered to be highly pathogenic agents, such as bio-safety level 3 (BSL-3) facilities for SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, CHIKV, and avian influenza, and BSL-4 for Ebola, Marburg virus (MARV), Lassa virus (LASV), and NiV. This poses a major limitation in the development of vaccines and drugs against the viruses.
