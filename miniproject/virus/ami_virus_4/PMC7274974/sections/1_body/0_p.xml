    <title>Scientific background on the subject</title>
    <p id="p0015n">Highly pathogenic emerging and re-emerging viruses continuously threaten lives worldwide. To shorten the time-frame of vaccine development of the high risk viruses, the pseudovirus system, which can be handled in the biosafety level 2 facility, has been widely applied to examine vaccine efficacy, antigenic analysis, or immunogenicity.</p>

    <title>What this study adds to the field</title>
    <p id="p0020p">We successfully established a neutralization assay to quantify the neutralizing activity of antisera against the SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza virus H5 subtypes. We assessed the utilization potency of pseudovirus systems to accelerate the process of vaccine development, which would provide rapid community protection against highly pathogenic viruses.</p>
