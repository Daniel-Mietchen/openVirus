<p id="p0085">Taken together, our investigations successfully established lentiviral pseudovirus systems for emerging SARS-CoV-2 and re-emerging avian influenza virus H5Nx. We assessed the feasibility of pseudovirions in the process of vaccine development. Pseudovirus system showed convincing results for vaccine efficacy by applying pseudovirions in neutralization assay for both SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza viruses. In addition, we showed the potency of pseudovirions to be applied in antigenic property analysis and immunogenicity analysis, which is especially important for antigen candidate selection. Most important of all, the pseudovirus system exhibited a lower biosafety risk than wild-type high risk viruses such as SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5 that can be handled in a biosafety level 2 laboratory. Through this system, we might shorten the time frame and provide more suitable vaccine candidate in the process of vaccine development.</p>
