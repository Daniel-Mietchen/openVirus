<p id="p0075">Vaccine development of emerging and re-emerging viruses are always urgent as we continuously face their strong threats for our lives. To examine the efficacy of developed vaccines, neutralization activity of immunized animals and even human individuals was one of the most important indicators for vaccine evaluation; however, the highly pathogenic viruses needed to be operated in a high level of biosafety containment to protect not only laboratory personnel, as well as the surrounding environment and community, which increased the accessability difficulty for

Pseudovirus system have been widely applied in the studies of highly pathogenic viruses, including SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and high pathogenic avian influenza virus, which reduced the safety requirement and increase the accessability of neutralization assay against these viruses [

We here developed two series of pseudoviruses for emerging coronavirus SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and re-emerging virus avian influenza virus H5Nx by using lentiviral packaging system. The pseudoviruses stimulated the viral entry of studied viruses through their structural proteins and were applied to examine whether antisera had neutralization activities to block viral fusion into the target cells. Indeed, our results demonstrated that the viral entry of the SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza H5Nx pseudoviruses can be blocked by the antisera raised by SARS-CoV-2 S protein and inactivated avian influenza H5Nx pseudovirus, respectively. The successful neutralization indicated that the assay can be applied in vaccine development of either emerging or re-emerging viruses and the assay can be operated in a more available biosafety facility.
