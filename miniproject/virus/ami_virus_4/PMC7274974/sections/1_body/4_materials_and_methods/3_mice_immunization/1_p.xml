<p id="p0035">For SARS-CoV-2 antisera, 6–8 weeks old BALB/c mice were subcutaneously immunized twice with 50 μg of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S1+S2 ECD) (Sino Biological) and emulsified in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA, Sigma) for priming and Incomplete Freund's Adjuvant (IFA, Sigma) for the boost in a total of 100 μl at a 3-week interval. Recombinant protein solutions in PBS were mixed 1 to 1 with the respective adjuvant. Blood samples were collected by submandibular blood sampling at week 5 after the first immunization. For the avian influenza virus H5Nx pseudovirus, 20 ml of pseudoviruses were concentrated by Lenti-X™ Concentrator (Clontech) then resuspended in PBS. Pseudoviruses were inactivated by UV light for 30 min and then used in mice immunization. The pseudoviruses were used to immunize 6–8 weeks old BALB/c mice with the addition of adjuvant (Freund's Complete Adjuvant and Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant) which were performed by LEADGENE, Inc. Antisera were collected at 14, 28, 45 and 60-days post-immunization and pooled for neutralization assays.</p>
