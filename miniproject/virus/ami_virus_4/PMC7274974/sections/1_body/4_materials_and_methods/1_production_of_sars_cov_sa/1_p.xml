<p id="p0025">To generate SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza virus pseudovirus, we applied the lentiviral vector system provided by National RNAi Core of Academic Sinica Taiwan to produce the pseudoviruses expressing full-length S protein and HA/NA proteins, respectively. For SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, the sequences of S protein were 
 <italic>de novo</italic> synthesized. Synthesized genes were cloned into pMD.G plasmid to express SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses. For avian influenza virus pseudovirus, HA and NA sequences from different avian influenza viruses H5N2, H5N6, and H5N8 (H5Nx) were synthesized and replaced the VSV-G envelope glycoprotein in pMD.G plasmid. Cloned plasmids were transformed into One Shot Stbl3 Chemically Competent cell (Invitrogen) and were amplified in Lysogeny Broth with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Plasmids were extracted by Zymo Research midi kit. The 293T cells were seeded at the concentration of 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells in 6-well plates at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h, and then the cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCMVdeltaR8.91, pLAS2w.RFP-C.Pneo and pMD.G plasmids (pMD.G with S gene for SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 tagged by HA on the C-terminus and pMD.G with indicated HA and NA gene pairs for avian influenza virus, respectively) by PolyJet reagent according to manufacturer's instructions [
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ]. In the following of 24 h post-transfection, and the culture medium was displaced by FreeStyle™ 293 expression medium (Gibco) and then cultured for an additional 24 h. The total cell lysates collected were centrifuged to remove the cell debris then filtered through 0.45 μm filters for immunoblot and further experiments. For the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we utilized the rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS-CoV S protein (ARG54885, arigo Biolaboratories) and the mouse anti-HA tag monoclonal antibody (C05012-100UG, Croyez Bio.) against C terminal tag of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to detect S protein expression with 1:1000 dilution, respectively. For avian influenza virus H5Nx pseudovirus, we utilized mouse monoclonal H5N1 HA antibody (11048-MM06, Sino Biological) with 1:1000 dilution. The HRP-labeled secondary antibodies (474–1802, KPL) with 1:1000 dilution were used for all immunoblot assays.
