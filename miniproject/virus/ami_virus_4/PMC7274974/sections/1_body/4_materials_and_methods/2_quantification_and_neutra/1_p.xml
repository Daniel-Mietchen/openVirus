<p id="p0030">Vero-E6 (for SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions) and MDCK cells (for avian influenza virus H5Nx pseudovirions) were seeded in 24-well plates with 1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. After 24 h of culture, cells were infected with 200 μL of two-fold diluted viruses, adsorbed for 1 h and cultured at 37 °C (for SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions) or 35 °C (for avian influenza virus H5Nx pseudovirions). Mouse antisera were complement inactivated at 56 °C for 30 min before neutralization assay. The pseudoviruses were incubated with serially diluted antisera at 37 °C for 30 min. The mixtures were added into Vero-E6 at 37 °C or MDCK cells at 35 °C for 1 h incubation. The assays were performed in duplicates. Cell medium were then refreshed with Vero-E6 medium (Eagle's MEM with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin) or MDCK medium (Eagle's MEM with 1 μg/ml trypsin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin). Four days post-infection, infected cells with fluorescence were observed and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. Cells were resuspended with PBS for calculating the percentage of fluorescent positive cells through flow cytometer. Virus transduction unit was calculated with the formula: titer = N × Cn × DF/V (F: The frequency of RFP-positive cells determined through flow cytometry; Cn: The total number of target cells infected; V: The volume of the inoculum; DF: The virus dilution factor) [

To quantify the neutralization titers for both SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza pseudoviruses, the neutralization titers were defined by 50% reduction of the transduction unit (TU) in both duplication of diluted antisera concentration compared with the average transduction units. Neutralization results of avian influenza virus subtypes were further visualized by antigenic cartography analysis, which revealed the antigenic diversity of antigens. In brief, the short distance of antigens on antigenic map indicated similar antigenic properties between two antigens. Clustering scenario of antigens revealed the degree of diversity among tested antigen.
