<p id="p0060">In facing the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak, evaluation of the vaccine efficacy as the vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2 becomes urgently needed to reduce the threat of the virus. In order to evaluate vaccine efficacy against such highly contagious virus more efficiently, we applied the generated SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus for evaluation of the neutralization antibody by using neutralization assay. To examine whether the lentivirus-based pseudovirus is capable to be applied in the neutralization assay, we retrieved two mouse antisera from the National Health Research Institutes, whereby the antisera were obtained from mice were immunized by SARS-CoV-2 S recombinant protein. Antisera were serially diluted in two-folds to neutralize a total amount of 6.4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> TU of SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with duplication. We determined the antisera titers according to the antisera dilution exhibiting &gt;50% reduction of virus transduction in both duplicated neutralization experiments [
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ]. Antisera neutralization results demonstrated that the lentivirus-based pseudovirus successfully applied in determining neutralization antibody titrations of antisera. We successfully defined the titers of two different mouse antisera. Neutralization result indicated that 1:50 to 1:400 diluted antiserum MS-1 neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus in both duplication experiments, although 1:800 diluted antiserum MS-1 still neutralized over 50% SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus transduction in one of the duplicates. In contrast to MS-1 antiserum, no dilutions of MS-2 antiserum neutralized the SARS-CoV-2 spike pseudovirus in both duplication experiments. According to the result, antiserum MS-1 exhibited higher titers (1:400) against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus than antiserum MS-2 (≦1:50). In summary, the results demonstrated that we successfully generated SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 lentivirus-based pseudovirus that is able to be applied in determining neutralization antibody of the antisera within
