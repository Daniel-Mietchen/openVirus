<p id="p0050">In following the generation of the pseudoviruses, we first focused on investigating the transduction efficiency by titrating the SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. We first examined whether SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus can transduce into Vero-E6 cells. Abundant RFP fluorescence was observed in the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus-transduced Vero-E6 cells, suggesting the successful transduction of the pseudovirus [
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A]. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses were serially diluted and then transducted into Vero E6 cells, respectively [
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A]. Transduction unit (TU) of the virions were determined according to the percentage of RFP positive cells (%RFP) in 48 h post-transduction. Maximum % RFP reached 19.9% and 22.6%, and % RFP increased in dose-dependent manners for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses [
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> ], respectively. As we quantified the transduction units according to the absolute number of RFP positive cells, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirion (2.36 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> TU/ml) [
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>] had similar TU with SARS-CoV (2.33 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> TU/ml) [
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>] according to the results of % RFP. Titer was also performed by using VSV-G pseudovirus as control group, and maximum % RFP achieved 31.05% referring to 3.85 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> TU/ml. Taken together, the TU result implied similar pseudovirus production efficiency between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in our lentiviral pseudovirus system [
