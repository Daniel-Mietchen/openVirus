<p id="p0055">Early SARS coronavirus reports have shown that S1–S2 cleavage can be enhanced by exogenous proteases, such as trypsin, thermolysin, and elastase [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Next, we examined whether exogenous trypsin increases the transduction efficiency of our generated SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus. We added exogenous trypsin during SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus absorption to Vero-E6 cells, until we harvested cells for cytometry analysis. Unexpectedly, we observed a reduction in virion transduction with trypsin presence, especially for SARS-CoV virions. With trypsin treatment, the TU of SARS-CoV virions decreased 93% from 9.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 6.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> TU/ml. In contrast to dramatic TU reduction of SARS-CoV virions, the TU of SARS-CoV-2 moderately reduced 43% from 1.09 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> to 6.2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> TU/ml [
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B]. The transduction reduction effects of exogenous trypsin presence since virion absorption might have resulted from the trypsin cleavage of partial S proteins on the unbound virions being cleaved into S1/S2 subunits by trypsin in advance of virion fusion in the Vero-E6 cells; however, only moderate effects on SARS-CoV-2 virion fusion in contrast with SARS-CoV might imply that the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 were more resistant to trypsin cleavage. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 virion might mainly utilize proteases other than trypsin, such as furin [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], as fusing with Vero-E6 cells. Whether trypsin or furin treatment after virion binding to cells enhances SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 virions entry into Vero-E6 cells will be further investigated in the future.
