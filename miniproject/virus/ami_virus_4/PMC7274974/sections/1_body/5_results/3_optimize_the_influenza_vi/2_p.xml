<p id="p0070">We next examined the applicability of avian influenza virus H5Nx pseudovirus in neutralization assay. Contrast to single type of SARS-CoV-2 due to only one dominant strain, various avian influenza virus subtypes co-circulated in worldwide. Our study selected three recently circulating subtypes of avian influenza virus in Taiwan and worldwide, including H5N2, H5N6, and H5N8 subtypes to determine the neutralization antibody by using H5Nx pseudovirus. Instead of raising antibody by structural protein expressing recombinant protein subunit vaccine in SARS-CoV-2 virus, we concentrated the inactivated avian influenza pseudovirus as immunogens to raise antisera against avian influenza HA and NA structural proteins in mice. We determined neutralization antibody titers of raised antisera against different subtypes of influenza virus and generated an antigenic map to analyze the similarity of antigenicity according to neutralization antibody titers. Mouse antisera were respectively generated by each selected strain and examined neutralization activities against all selected avian influenza pseudovirions. Neutralization titers demonstrated that avian influenza virus exhibited partial cross-reactivity among H5N2, H5N6, and H5N8 subtypes. High neutralization titers of antisera between 1:160 and ≧ 1:5120 were observed among examined subtypes [

Among the examined pseudovirions as immunogens, antiserum which was raised by H5N8 TWX37 virus showed consistently high titers (1:1280 to 1: 2560) against all pseudovirions, suggesting that H5N8 TWX37 virus can be a suitable vaccine candidate for broad spectrum avian influenza virus vaccine. Although on average high neutralization titers were generally seen among the antisera against diverse subtype pseudovirus, we still observed the 2 to 8-folds of different titers among examined pseudovirions as which were neutralized by each antiserum. Anti-H5N2 Washington antiserum exhibited high neutralization titers (≧1:1280) against all tested pseudovirions except for H5N6-TW17 strain (1:320) with 4 folds of titer reduction. In contrast, anti-H5N6 Hyogo antiserum showed the highest titers against itself but lower titers against other pseudovirus with 2–8 folds of reduction. Also, antigenic cartography indicated that H5N2 Washington pseudovirus exhibited diverse antigenic properties in comparing with other virions, suggesting antigenic diversity occurrence among avian influenza H5Nx subtypes [

Together, we developed lentiviral pseudovirus systems of emerging SARS-CoV2 virus and re-emerging avian influenza virus as biologically safer efficacy evaluation assays than conventional neutralization assays needed to perform within Biosafety Level 3 containment when we developed a vaccine. The neutralization assay results not only reflected neutralization activities of antisera but also revealed the immunogenicity and antigenic property diversity of re-emerging viral subtypes, which is another important issue for vaccine seed selection in re-emerging virus vaccine development.
