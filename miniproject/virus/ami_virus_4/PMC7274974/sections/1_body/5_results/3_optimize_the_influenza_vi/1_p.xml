<p id="p0065">After successfully establishing emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus transduction and neutralization assays, we next investigated the generated pseudovirions of re-emerging virus avian influenza virus H5Nx. In contrast to using Vero-E6 by SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, we examined whether avian influenza virus H5Nx pseudovirus can be transduced into MDCK cells as host cells. Alike to SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 virions, we observed abundant RFP fluorescence pseudovirus-transduced MDCK cells, indicating the successful transduction of the avian influenza virus H5Nx pseudovirus [

 <sup>6</sup> to 10
 <sup>8</sup> TU/ml in MDCK cells [
