<p id="p0045">To verify whether the S or HA protein were incorporated into SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza virus H5Nx pseudovirus, we used Western blot to detect the structural proteins on the virions. In SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus particles, complete S proteins (approximately 190 kDa and 220 kDa) of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were detected by anti-SARS-CoV S protein antibody and anti-HA tag antibody, respectively [

In contrast to the complete S protein of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2, HA protein of avian influenza virus including HA0 (approximately 80 kDa) and HA2 protein (approximately 20 kDa) were observed in influenza virus pseudovirus by blotting with anti-influenza virus H5 HA2 protein antibody, which indicated the partial cleavage of HA0 protein to HA1 and HA2 [
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B]. The different cleavage manner between S and HA proteins in the pseudovirions might result from the diverse host protease requirement to digest the two structural proteins. Both S protein of coronavirus and HA protein of influenza virus harbor cleavage sites for different proteases in the boundary of S1/S2 subunit and HA1/HA2 subunit, respectively [
