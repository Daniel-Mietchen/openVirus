<p id="p0040">Due to the high infectivity and high pathogenicity of emerging virus SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and re-emerging virus avian influenza virus H5Nx, handling of the viruses in the biosafety level 3 facility are necessary but uneasily accessible to evaluate the vaccine efficacy by neutralization assay. Here, we thus established two pseudovirus systems for emerging virus SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and re-emerging virus avian influenza virus H5Nx including H5N2, H5N6, and H5N8. In order to generate pseudoviruses expressing emerging viruses structure proteins (Spike protein of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and HA/NA of avian influenza virus H5Nx), we replaced the VSV-G protein gene in pMD.G plasmid by either the S gene of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 (pMD.SARS-CoV-S/pMD.SARS-CoV-2-S) or HA genes (pMD.H5Nx-HA) and NA genes (pMD.H5Nx-NA) of avian influenza viruses. For avian influenza viruses, HA and NA genes from one to two strains of each subtypes were selected to develop pseudovirus systems, including a WHO available or pending vaccine strain and a circulating strain. We applied the lentiviral system which employed to express the structural proteins on the surface of pseudovirus and to package lentiviral RNA with red fluorescence protein (RFP) reporter gene to get pseudoviruses with S or HA/NA proteins expressed on the surface of virions, respectively [
