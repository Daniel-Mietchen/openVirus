  <p>Dose-dependent transduction rates of VSV-G pseudoviruses. Generated VSV-G pseudoviruses were serially diluted and then transduced into Vero-E6 cells. Transduction rate of VSV-G was gradually reduced in a dose-dependent manner. According to the transduction rate curve, the titer of VSV-G pseudovirus was quantified as 3.85 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> transduction unit.
