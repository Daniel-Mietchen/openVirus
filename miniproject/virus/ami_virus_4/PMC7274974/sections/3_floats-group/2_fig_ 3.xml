  <p>Pseudovirus transduction of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza H5Nx. Generated (A) SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and (B) avian influenza H5Nx pseudoviruses were transduced into Vero-E6 or MDCK cells, respectively. Red fluorescence indicated the cells transduced by the indicated pseudoviruses with RFP reporter gene. (C) Transduction titers of avian influenza H5Nx pseudoviruses were determined according to the numbers of cells expressing red fluorescence.</p>
