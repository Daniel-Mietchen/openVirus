  <p>Immunoblotting of S protein of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and HA protein of avian influenza H5. (A) S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were immunoblotted with mouse anti-SARS-CoV S protein antibody and mouse anti-HA tag protein antibody, respectively. (B) HA proteins of avian influenza H5 were immunoblotted with mouse anti-influenza virus H5 HA protein antibody. As the antibody recognized the HA2 epitope, both of HA0 and HA2 protein were detected by the immunoblotting.</p>
