  <p>Lentiviral pseudovirus system of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza H5. Structural protein genes, including S protein of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and HA/NA protein of avian influenza H5, were subcloned into envelope expression plasmid derived from pMD.G vector. To generate SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza H5Nx pseudoviruses, we co-transfected the structural protein expressing either S protein or HA and NA vectors, a package vector, and a reporter vector into HEK-293T cells. Generated SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza H5Nx pseudoviruses were harvested and transduced into Vero-E6 or MDCK cells, respectively.</p>
