  <p>Dose-dependent transduction rates of SARS-CoV pseudoviruses. Generated SARS-CoV pseudoviruses were serially diluted and then transduced into Vero-E6 cells. Transduction rate of SARS-CoV was gradually reduced in a dose-dependent manner. According to the transduction rate curve, the titer of SARS-CoV pseudovirus was quantified as 2.33 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> transduction unit.
