  <p>The SARS-CoV-2 possesses the characteristics of person-to-person transmission. The source of infection and susceptible population exist in both the male and female of any age, and the disease performance is both symptomatic and asymptomatic. The SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact; furthermore, there is a possibility of aerosol transmission when it is in a relatively closed environment and exposed to high concentrations of aerosol for a long time. The SARS-CoV-2 has an incubation period of 1–14 days, but mostly range 3–7 days. In addition, many studies have confirmed the existence of a large number of cluster outbreaks and family cluster outbreaks.</p>
