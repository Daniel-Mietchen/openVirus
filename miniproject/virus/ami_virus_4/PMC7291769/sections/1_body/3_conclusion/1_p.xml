<p>The number of people with COVID-19 continues to increase. Asymptomatic infections are hidden and easily overlooked. However, their potential to spread the virus cannot be underestimated, as the viral load they carried and their ability to infect close contacts may be similar to those of symptomatic individuals. In addition, asymptomatic infections can occur in any age range and either gender, and there may be no abnormalities in laboratory tests or CT examination. This, complete isolation of all sources of infection in the COVID-19 outbreak is a major problem. For this reason, measures of home quarantine and centralized isolation for observation over time have been and will continue to be necessary; otherwise, the pandemic will continue to cause great harm to the public and disease control will become even more complicated. Anyone who has had close contact with a confirmed or suspected case of COVID-19 should be closely monitored and screened; and therefore, the centralized isolation for medical observation and related tests of COVID-19 should be applied to the greatest extent possible, even if they have no symptoms. Healthcare workers should give close attention to screening consultations and collect detailed information, including the presence of even very slight symptoms. Overall, we have objectively summarized the current transmission and clinical characteristics of asymptomatic patients with COVID-19, which are deserve for further study and exploration in the future.</p>
