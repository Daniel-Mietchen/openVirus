<p>At present, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 continues to increase, and various prevention and control measures continue to be needed. With more in-depth research on COVID-19, systematic treatment plans and guidelines have been improved, so it is particularly important for patients to be diagnosed early and admitted to hospital for isolation treatment. Unfortunately, asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection are a silent source of infection, who can unknowingly place others at risk for infection. Therefore, as more research is conducted to understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to develop treatment methods, efforts to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic individuals will be the key to reducing the spread of COVID-19. While the epidemics of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, were all caused by coronaviruses and shared other similarities, there are many differences among these diseases as well. The number of cases of COVID-19 far exceeds the case numbers for the other epidemics, and of these three diseases, COVID-19 is the only one to cause a global pandemic. Notably, this, once insignificant and benign family of viruses, the coronavirus, has now generated three serious epidemics in the last two decades, indicating the importance of remaining alert to this class of emerging infectious diseases. This will be a long-term challenge, and we cannot yet predict when the next coronavirus outbreak will occur. What we can do is carry out more research and testing and develop better plans to handle such outbreaks in order to be better prepared when they emerge.</p>
