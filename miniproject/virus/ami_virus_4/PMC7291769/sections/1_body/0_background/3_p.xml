<p>In contrast, onset of SARS-CoV-2 is insidious. When asymptomatic or the early symptoms are mild, patients can move freely and transmit the virus [

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These characteristics allow for easy spread, and infection sources can be difficult to identify and isolate. In addition, the main routes of transmission are through respiratory droplets and contact [
