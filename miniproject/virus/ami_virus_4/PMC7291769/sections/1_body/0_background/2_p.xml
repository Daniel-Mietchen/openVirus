<p>SARS-CoV-2 is not the first coronavirus to threaten the life and welfare of humans. The years 2002 and 2012 saw the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Like SARS-CoV-2, the transmission of SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV is person-to-person [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref>], but they differ in crucial aspects. Most patients infected with SARS-CoV present with obvious clinical symptoms within a short period, the disease progresses rapidly and peak viral shedding occurs in the late stage [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; few patients with SARS are asymptomatic [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. MERS is primarily a zoonotic disease, and spread among humans was scattered and limited, the symptoms were obvious and infection rarely preceded symptom onset. Nosocomial transmission was more troublesome than community spread [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
