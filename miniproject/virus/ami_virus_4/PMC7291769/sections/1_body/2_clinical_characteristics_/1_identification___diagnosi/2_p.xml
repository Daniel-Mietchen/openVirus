<p>It is important to note that some patients with COVID-19 may experience only mild symptoms and signs. Kam

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported a 6-month-old infant who developed a temperature of 38.5Â°C during hospitalization, although for only 1 h. Hoehl 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] reported a 48-year-old German woman who experienced a mild rash and minimal pharyngitis after admission. Therefore, persons with COVID-19 may appear essentially asymptomatic, but do experience very mild symptoms and can enter the recovery period without being detected. Therefore, at the time of consultation healthcare workers should thoroughly interview the patient for any recollection of discomfort.
