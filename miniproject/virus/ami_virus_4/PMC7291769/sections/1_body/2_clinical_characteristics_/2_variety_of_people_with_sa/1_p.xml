<p>Asymptomatic infection is not limited to young or middle-aged adults [

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that asymptomatic patients were relatively young, with a median age of 14Â years in seven cases. In addition, asymptomatic infections were found in both males [
