<p>Multiple studies have found that there are asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections in the process of crowds and family-clustered outbreaks. Among a family of six in Shenzhen who traveled to Wuhan from 29 December 2019 to 4 January 2020, five members were identified with COVID-19, including an asymptomatic 10-year-old boy [

SARS-CoV-2 transmission from an asymptomatic infected person returning home from Wuhan on 10 January 2020 was suspected as the cause of a family cluster epidemic of five members in Anyang, China [
