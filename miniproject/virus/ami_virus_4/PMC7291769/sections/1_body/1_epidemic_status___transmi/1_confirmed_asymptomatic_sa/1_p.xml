<p>Multiple studies indicate that asymptomatic infections make up a large percentage of confirmed COVID-19 cases. A retrospective study in Beijing collected data for 262 individuals with diagnosed COVID-19 from 20 January to 10 February 2020, and 13 were asymptomatic (5.0%) [

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A further epidemiological investigation (28 January to 9 February 2020) was conducted in clinics and communities in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. The survey screened the close contacts of patients with confirmed or suspected infections. The results of nucleic acid screening identified 24 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 carriers without any obvious symptoms. Of these, five patients developed typical symptoms during the subsequent hospitalization, while the other 19 patients remained asymptomatic [
