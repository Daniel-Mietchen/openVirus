<p>SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples from asymptomatic patients [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The viral load detected in asymptomatic individuals was similar to that of symptomatic patients suggesting that people without symptoms have a strong ability to transmit the virus to others [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the blood and stool samples of seemingly well patients [
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22â€“24</xref>], and compared with the virus in respiratory secretions, the virus in feces may take longer to clear [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].
