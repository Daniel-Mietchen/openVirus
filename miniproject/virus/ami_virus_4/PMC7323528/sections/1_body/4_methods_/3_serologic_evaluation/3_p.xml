<p>To confirm the accuracy of results from the IgG ELISA, we performed a blind plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) of a stratified random sample of 60 serum samples (30 positive and 30 negative from the CHIKV IgG ELISA) for CHIKV to determine ≥90% reductions in plaque counts (PRNT
 <sub>90</sub>), as described elsewhere (
