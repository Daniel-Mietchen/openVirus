<p>For samples showing positive results for IgG, we then tested with a CHIKV IgM ELISA (InBios, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://inbios.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://inbios.com</ext-link>); we used the presence of IgM as a proxy for a more recent CHIKV infection than if there were no IgM. We interpreted both the CHIKV IgG and IgM ELISA results according to manufacturer instructions: CHIKV IgG absorbance/calibrator levels were negative at &lt;0.8, indeterminate at ≥0.8 to &lt;1.1, and positive at ≥1.1; CHIKV IgM absorbance/calibrator levels were negative at &lt;0.9, indeterminate at ≥0.9 to &lt;1.1, and positive at ≥1.1. We retested samples indicating indeterminant results on the initial test and considered the results obtained final.
