<p>Regarding cellular changes, most studies show that lymphopenia, although present in moderate infections, is more pronounced in severe COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>) and affects mainly T cells, including CD4 Th1 and Tregs, but particularly CD8 (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>–
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>). Also, in severe COVID-19 the number of circulating naive T cells increases and the number of memory T cells decreases (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>). Circulating CD8 in patients with severe COVID 19 exhibited phenotypes associated with abnormal functionality (CD8
 <sup>+</sup>IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup>GM-CSF
 <sup>+</sup>) and exhaustion (Tim3
 <sup>+</sup>Pd-1
 <sup>+</sup>) (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>) or (NKG2
 <sup>+</sup>CD107a
 <sup>+</sup>IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup>grzB
 <sup>+</sup>) (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). The latter phenotype is also found in NK cells. Interestingly, a negative correlation has been reported between serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 and the perforin content of NK and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells, which also negatively correlate with the increased number of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). Although the number of CD4 cells decreased, they expressed activation markers such as CD69, CD38, CD44, and HLA-DR, including Th17 CD4
 <sup>+</sup>CCR6
 <sup>+</sup> cells, (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>). NK cells also decreased in both moderate and severe cases of the disease (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>). Monocytopenia is also found in COVID-19 patients, particularly in severe cases, but the circulating monocytes belong mainly to the CD14
 <sup>+</sup>CD16
 <sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocyte subset (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>).
