<p>Ong et al. (
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>) compared the blood transcriptional profile of three patients in early phases of Infection -one of whom evolved to a severe disease- with 10 healthy volunteers. The main findings in the patient who progressed to severe disease was that only IL-1A and IL-1B preceded the nadir of the respiratory function, and that the expression of most inflammatory genes, particularly IL-6, IL-2, TNF-Î±, and IFNA1/13, peaked thereafter. Also, in this patient, transcripts associated with HLA, CD4, and CD8 T cell activation were diminished, while in the other two patients, who did not progress to severe disease, the transcription profile was comparable to that of healthy controls. The authors suggest that in the first case the decreased T cell activation may have helped the inflammatory response by the IL-1 pathway, while in the other two cases the low inflammatory response allowed a moderate T cell response.
