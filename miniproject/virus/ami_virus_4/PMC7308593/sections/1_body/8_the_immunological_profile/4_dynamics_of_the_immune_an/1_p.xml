<p>During the course of COVID-19 infection, viral replication, immune response, and inflammatory reaction are dynamic events that can change rapidly, resulting in different outcomes; several reports have addressed these changes. Thevarajan et al. (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>) reported the case of a patient with mild to moderate infection that was clinically, virologically, and immunologically followed over the course of the disease, including her recovery 13 days after the initiation of symptoms, and through to Day 20 at which point she had recovered. The virus was detected on Days 4 and 5 via nasopharyngeal swabs but was undetectable thereafter. IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies progressively increase from Day 7 through to Day 20. Circulating antibody-secreting B cells, CD3
 <sup>−</sup>CD19
 <sup>+</sup>CD27
 <sup>hi</sup>CD38
 <sup>hi</sup>, appeared in the blood at the time of viral clearance (Day 7), peaked on Day 8, and remained high through to Day 20. Follicular helper T cells (T
 <sub>FH</sub>), CD4
 <sup>+</sup>CXCR5
 <sup>+</sup>ICOS
 <sup>+</sup>PD-1
 <sup>+</sup>, were also detected on Day 7 and continued increasing through to Day 20. Activated cytotoxic CD8 T cells, CD8
 <sup>+</sup>CD38
 <sup>+</sup>HLA-DR
 <sup>+</sup>, were also present on Day 7, increased through to Day 9, and then decreased through to Day 20, although with values higher than in healthy controls. There was no increase in inflammatory CD14
 <sup>+</sup>CD16
 <sup>+</sup> monocytes, nor in activated NK CD3
 <sup>−</sup>CD56
 <sup>+</sup>HLA-DR
 <sup>+</sup> cells. Regarding serum cytokines, of the 17 pro-inflammatory cytokines studied, only low levels of MCP1/CCL2 were found on Days 7–9. This case is interesting since there are very few studies on patients with mild infections and because IgM and IgG antibodies, antibody secreting B cells, CD4 T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells, and activated cytotoxic CD8 cells were shown to be circulating before resolution of the symptoms.
