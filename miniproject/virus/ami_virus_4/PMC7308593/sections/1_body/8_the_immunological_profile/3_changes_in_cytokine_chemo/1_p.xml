<p>Plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines are also increased in COVID-19, but are higher in severe infections, and includes IL-2, IL-2R, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8 IL-10, IP10, MIP1A, and TNF-Î± (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Thus, its measurement has been proposed as a good biomarker to monitor these patients. Liu et al. (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>) studied sixty COVID-19 patients, half of whom had a severe case of the disease and high IL-6 levels. Baseline IL-6 was higher in more severe cases and correlated with bilateral interstitial lung involvement and high body temperature, as well as with other serum markers for acute inflammation. Of the 30 patients with severe disease, 25 improved clinically and showed a significant decrease in IL-6 levels, while these levels increased in three patients with disease progression. Coomes et al. (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>) performed a meta-analysis of 16 papers, that included 10,798 Chinese patients, in order to test the evidence that IL-6 levels correlate with COVID-19 severity, and the effectiveness of treatment with Tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against IL-6 receptor. All COVID-19 patients had increased levels of serum IL-6, but it was 2.9-fold higher in patients with severe COVID-19. Twenty-one patients treated with tocilizumab improved clinically with no adverse effects or deaths. Also, Xu et al. (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>) reported very promising results using Tocilizumab treatment in 20 patients with severe COVID-19; all patients improved remarkably within a few days and all were discharged from the ICU within an average of 15 days.
