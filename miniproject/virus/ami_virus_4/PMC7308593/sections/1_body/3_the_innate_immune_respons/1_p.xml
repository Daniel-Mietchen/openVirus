<p>During viral infections, after viruses enter the host cells they are recognized by Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRR) such as TLR7 and TLR8 in the case of single-stranded RNA viruses, RIG-I-like (RLRs), and NLR, all expressed by epithelial cells as well as by local cells of the innate immune response, such as alveolar macrophages (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Upon ligand binding, PRRs recruit adaptor proteins which activate crucial down-stream transcription factors, including interferon regulatory factor (IRF), NF-ÎºB, and AP-1, resulting in production of the Type-I and -III antiviral Interferons and different chemokines (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). These chemokines attract more innate response cells [polymorphonuclear leukocytes, monocytes, NK cells, dendritic cells (DC)], which also produce chemokines, such as MIG, IP-10, and MCP-1, capable of recruiting lymphocytes, which in turn, will recognize the viral antigens presented by DCs (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>) compared the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of human lung explants with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrated that both viruses can equally infect type-I and -II pneumocytes, plus alveolar macrophages, although SARS-CoV2 had a better capacity to replicate in pulmonary tissues. Interestingly, while SARS-CoV induced the expression of IFN-I, IFN-II, and IFN-III, SARS-CoV-2 failed to induce any such immune mediators and was also less efficient in inducting other cytokines. SARS-CoV induced the production of the 11 cytokines studied, while SARS-CoV-2 induced only five (IL-6, MCP1, CXCL1, CXCL5, and CXCL10/IP10). Blanco-Melo et al. (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>) studied the transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2, compared to SAR-CoV, MERS-CoV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3), and influenza A virus (IAV), in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> infection of respiratory cell lines, experimental 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> infection of ferrets, and post-mortem lung samples of COVID-19 patients. Their results show that SARS-CoV-2 induces a particular signature characterized by reduced IFN-I and IFN-III responses and significant induction of multiple proinflammatory chemokines, IL-1B, IL-6, TNF, and IL1RA. These findings were further supported by the increased serum levels of these molecules in COVID-19 patients. Altogether, these reports strongly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 differs from other coronaviruses in its capacity to replicate within the pulmonary tissue, elude from the antiviral effects of IFN-I and IFN-III, activate innate responses, and induce the production of the cytokines required for the recruitment of adaptive immunity cells.
