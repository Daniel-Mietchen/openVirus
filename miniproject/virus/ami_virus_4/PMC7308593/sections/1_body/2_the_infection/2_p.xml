<p>SARS-CoV-2 is acquired by exposure to microdroplets present in the exhalates of infected individuals or by contact with viral particles present in contaminated fomites. Once the virus reaches the bronchioles and alveolar spaces, the main targets are the cells of the bronchial epithelium and the type-II ACE2
 <sup>+</sup> pneumocytes of the alveolar epithelium. SARS-CoV infection induces autophagy (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), detachment of the basal membrane, and inhibition of ACE2 expression (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), hence allowing angiotensin II to bind the AT1aR receptor, resulting in acute lung damage (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Importantly, the main early defense mechanism of the infected cell is the production of type-I and type -III IFN and, although coronaviruses are sensitive to their anti-viral effects, they are able to inhibit its induction (

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The release of large number of virions leads to both infection of neighboring target cells and viremia, the latter resulting in systemic infection since ACE2
 <sup>+</sup> cells are widely distributed in many tissues (
