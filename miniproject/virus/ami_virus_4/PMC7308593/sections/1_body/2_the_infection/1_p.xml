<p>The COVID-19 pathological process exhibits a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infections, to mild (common cold-type), moderate, and finally severe (~15%) infections; the latter frequently requires hospitalization in ICU to ensure assisted respiratory support and other medical treatments until recovery, or possibly death, of the patient. The wide spectrum of clinical manifestations found in COVID-19 patients has been associated with risk factors such as gender and age. Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or diseases, or treatments affecting the immune system result in the highest risk of severe disease and death (

From the epidemiological point of view, these inapparently infected persons may have low viral loads, while still disseminating the virus and can therefore be responsible either for silent epidemics, leading to infection in more susceptible people who will eventually develop a clinical disease, or for contributing to the establishment of herd immunity (
