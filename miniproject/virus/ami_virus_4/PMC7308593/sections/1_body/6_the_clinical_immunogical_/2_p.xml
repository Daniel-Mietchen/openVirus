<p>From an immunological point of view, the wide clinical spectrum of COVID-19 allows us to postulate different hypotheses, some of them which have already been proven, the remaining requiring more information and longer follow-up observation of recovered patients. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref> shows diverse outcomes during the course of COVID-19 and allows for an analysis of the immune response at each clinical stage. However, it must be noted that the immune response is conditioned by epidemiological variables, such as intensity and duration of exposure to the virus and possible variations in viral virulence and, on the host side, genetic susceptibility/resistance and health conditions at the time of exposure. The latter includes, among other variables, age and the existence of comorbidities that may directly affect the immune system (
