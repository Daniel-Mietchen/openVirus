<p>In order to understand COVID-19 immunopathogenesis, it is important to elucidate what lies at the root of immune response failure occurring in infected individuals resulting at times in deviation of the protective response into a dysfunctional program, leading to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) with severe inflammation and, eventually, a multi-systemic failure. A better understanding of these events would contribute to the design of differential therapeutic approaches, depending on the stage of the disease, and to the delineation of prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Unfortunately, there are no studies on the immune response in infected asymptomatic individuals, which would allow a better characterization of the protective immune response as it occurs under the natural conditions of the infection process. Thus, the present view is based on the comparison between patients with moderate and those with severe infections, and also with those in the convalescent stage. Another aspect to be explored is the effect of previous exposure to other less virulent coronaviruses that may have cross-reactivity with more virulent ones. Additionally, most of the studies have been done using blood samples, which do not necessarily correlate with the events going on in the affected tissues. Fortunately, several studies on bronchoalveolar lavage cells were published recently, as will be discussed below.</p>
