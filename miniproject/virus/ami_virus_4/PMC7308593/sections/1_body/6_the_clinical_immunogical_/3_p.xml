<p>Despite its high infectivity, not everyone exposed to SARS-CoV-2 becomes infected (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The reasons for such resistance are still unknown. It is possible that a small, occasional inoculum does not reach the lower respiratory tract, where susceptible target cells are found. Nevertheless, as yet unidentified genetic conditions may also explain this 
 <italic>per se</italic> resistance. On this regard, no association of SARS with ACE2 polymorphisms was found (
