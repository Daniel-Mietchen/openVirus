<p>A central tenet of our view on COVID-19 immunopathogenesis is that a protective immune response must be present in patients with asymptomatic and mild infections, and even in some with moderate infections who do not progress to severe disease. This response must be capable of inhibiting viral replication and eliminating the host's infected cells with minimal tissue damage and low inflammatory manifestations (

 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>), using a bioinformatic approach, identified 241 candidate epitopes for HLA-II alleles in SARS-CoV-2, and 628 for class I alleles, which may be bound by the more common HLA alleles, irrespective of their ethnic group. The high number of epitopes, also present in SARS-CoV (
