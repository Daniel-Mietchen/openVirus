<p>In patients with COVID-19, the 
 <italic>post mortem</italic> histopathological findings are similar to those reported in SARS (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>) and MERS (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). Xu et al. (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>) described bilateral diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, pneumocytes desquamation and hyaline membrane formation, multinucleated syncytial cells, atypical enlarged pneumocytes with large nuclei, amphophilic granular cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli, as well as interstitial mononuclear infiltration. Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) also reported DAD with denudation of the alveolar epithelia, reactive type-II pneumocyte hyperplasia, intra-alveolar fibrinous exudate, and loose fibrous plugs, along with loose interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Also, these authors, using an anti-Rp3 NP of SARS-CoV-2, demonstrated the presence of the virus on alveolar epithelial cells, including damaged, desquamated cells within the alveolar space, but its presence was only minimally detected on the blood vessels and the interstitium. Taken together, the histopathological findings in COVID-19 fatalities support that, in addition to the direct cytopathic effect of SARS-CoV-2 on the pneumocytes, an immunological response exists that includes a severe inflammatory reaction and extensive lung damage (
