<p>Zhou et al. (
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>) used metatranscriptomic sequencing to profile immune signatures in the BALF of eight COVID-19 patients, compared to 146 community-acquired pneumonia patients and 20 healthy controls. Their results show that in BALF from COVID-19, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) included up-regulated proinflammatory chemokines genes, such as CXCL17, CXCL8, and CXCL2, as well as the CXCR2 receptor, critical to neutrophil recruitment, and CCL2 and CCL7, needed for monocyte recruitment. These authors also found that COVID-19 patients up-regulated IL-1β, antiviral Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs), and genes related to the IL-17, TNF, and NF-κB signaling pathways. In addition, the cellular analysis showed an increased neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with COVID-19 compared to patients with other pneumonias.
