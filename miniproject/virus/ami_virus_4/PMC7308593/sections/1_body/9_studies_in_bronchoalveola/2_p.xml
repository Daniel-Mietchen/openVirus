<p>In another study, Liao et al. (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>) used scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq to determine BALF cells' transcriptional signature in three patients with severe and another three with moderate COVID-19, and compared them with eight healthy subjects, previously studied. Their main findings were related to macrophages and CD8 cells. Macrophages were predominant in BALFs from patients with severe infection, with a minor proportion of T and NK cells, as compared with patients with moderate disease. Macrophages were classified in 22 clusters, according to their expression of 
 <italic>FCN1</italic> (monocyte-derived), 
 <italic>SPP1</italic> (pro-fibrotic), and 
 <italic>FABP4</italic> (alveolar macrophages). These genes were differentially expressed both among the two groups of patients and the healthy controls. 
 <italic>FABP4</italic> was preferentially expressed in healthy controls and in patients with moderate COVID-19, while 
 <italic>FCN1</italic> and 
 <italic>SPP1</italic> were expressed in patients with severe COVID-19. Further macrophages classification resulted in four groups: Group 1, FCN1
 <sup>hi</sup> only; Group 2, FCN1
 <sup>lo</sup>SPP1
 <sup>+</sup>; Group 3, FCN1
 <sup>âˆ’</sup>SPP1
 <sup>+</sup>; and Group 4, FABP4
 <sup>+</sup>. Group 1 macrophages expressed genes associated with inflammatory monocytes; Group 2 expressed chemokines and interferon stimulated genes (ISG); Group 3, genes related with immune regulation and profibrotic events; and Group 4 were alveolar macrophage typical genes. According to the investigators, these results suggest that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, inflammatory monocytes (
 <italic>FCN1</italic>
 <sup>+</sup>) are recruited from the circulation into the lungs, where they differentiate into 
 <italic>SPP1</italic>
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages, constituents of the severe inflammatory reaction. Analysis of the BALF transcriptome showed that T and NK cells are increased in COVID-19 patients, compared to healthy controls, which according to their gene expression can be classified in NK, CD8, CD4, Tregs, and proliferating cells. An important finding was that genes related to activating molecules, migration, calcium signaling, and effector molecules were highly expressed by CD8 cells in patients with moderate infection, compared with patients with severe COVID-19; this further supports the role of CD8 cells in the elimination of the virus and their subsequent, protective immunity. In contrast, patients with severe disease had a higher expression of genes related to proliferation, energy generation, and initiation of translation. These results suggest that in patients with moderate infection CD8 cells are more differentiated and efficient, while in severe Infection T cells are in a proliferative stage. Additionally, the finding that the TCR repertoire is higher in CD8 than in CD4 cells, suggests a larger clonal expansion of the CD8 cells taking part in the resolution of the infection.
