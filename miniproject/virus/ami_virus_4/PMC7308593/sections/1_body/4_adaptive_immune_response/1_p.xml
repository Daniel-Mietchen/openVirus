<p>The transition between innate and adaptive immune responses is critical for the clinical progress of SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is at this crucial moment when immune regulatory events, still poorly understood, will lead to the development of either a protective immune response or an exacerbated inflammatory response (

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). The protective response is T cell dependent, with CD4 helping B cells, geared toward the production of specific neutralizing antibodies, and cytotoxic CD8 cells capable of eliminating infected cells. It is worth noting that 80% of the infiltrating cells in COVID-19 are CD8 (

Contrariwise, a dysfunctional response, unable to inhibit viral replication and elimination of the infected cells, may result in an exacerbated inflammatory response leading possibly to a cytokine storm, manifested clinically by severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic consequences, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. In a SARS-CoV primate model of infection, Clay et al. (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) showed that the virus replicated in the lungs until Day 10 post-infection; but, surprisingly, lung inflammation was more intense after virus clearance, reaching its peak at Day 14 and remaining so until Day 28. These results suggest that an early phase dependent on virus replication does occur, while a later viral-independent, immune-dependent phase seems to be accompanied by an exacerbated inflammatory component. The viral-independent phase has been explained by the inflammatory reaction secondary to ACE2 inhibition or by an autoimmune phenomenon due to the epitope spreading caused by prolonged tissue destruction (
