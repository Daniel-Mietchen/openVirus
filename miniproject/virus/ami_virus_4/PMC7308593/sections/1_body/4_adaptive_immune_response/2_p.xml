<p>Although T and B cells, macrophages, and DCs do not express ACE2, some reports suggest that DC-SIGN may serve as a 
 <italic>trans</italic> receptor for SARS-CoV on DCs, which even when not infected may transfer the virus to other susceptible cells (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). Recently, Vandakari and Wilce (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) reported that CD26, an aminopeptidase involved in T cell activation, may bind to the 
 <italic>S</italic> protein of SARS-CoV-2, resulting in a non-productive T cell infection; Wang et al. (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>) reported that CD147, a protein of the immunoglobulins superfamily that induces the metalloproteinases of the extracellular matrix, binds to the S1 domain and facilitates viral entrance into host cells. The significance of non-productive T cells infection is not clear; however, it is tempting to speculate that it may be related to the lymphopenia found in patients with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). The binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to molecules like CD26 and CD147, which participate in T cell activation, would suggest that a non-productive T cell infection may result in activation-induced cell death (AICD). MERS-CoV has been reported to induce T cells apoptosis (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>), and there is evidence that T cells are functionally exhausted in patients with severe COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>).
