  <p>1 The alterations of the immune regulation that allow the disease to advance from an asymptomatic or mild infection to a severe disease with poor prognosis. Translational immunological research focusing on the cellular and molecular aspects of the virus-host interaction, using sophisticated bioinformatics and system biology tools, must be pursued. This includes experimental animal models required for a deep understanding of COVID-19's immunopathogenesis. Besides patients with moderate and severe COVID-19, studies in humans must include seropositive asymptomatic individuals and patients with virologically confirmed mild infections. These subjects should be studied in long-term follow-up cohorts.</p>

  <p>2 The genetics of resistance/susceptibility at the various stages of the infection and the disease. Topics like the resistance 
   <italic>per se</italic> in exposed non-infected individuals, and the genetic risk factors for the progression from asymptomatic to moderate and severe disease must be prioritized. Initiatives like “COVID Human Genetic Effort” (

  <p>3 Based on the previous points it is necessary to find correlates of protective immunity and prognostic biomarkers to guide personalized management of infected individuals in order to prevent their progression to severe forms of the disease.</p>

  <p>4 New pharmacological and immune-based treatments must be developed simultaneously with rigorous evaluation of treatments already available. The analysis of the currently available pharmacological treatments, or those under development, is beyond the scope of this review, but there is an excellent recent review about these treatments (
   <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>). Possible immunotherapies may include: convalescent plasma, already assayed in a small number of patients (
   <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>–
   <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>); monoclonal antibodies against the IL-6 receptor (
   <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>, 
   <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>) and interferon β (
   <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>, 
   <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>); and Leronlimab CCR5 blocking antibody (
   <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>), among others. Fortunately, a good number of controlled clinical assays have been initiated under strict supervision from regulatory agencies (

  <p>5 Development of vaccines to prevent, and hopefully eliminate, SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections. As expected, many investigators and biotechnology companies are dedicating all their efforts and resources to obtaining an effective vaccine in the shortest time possible. Although this topic is beyond the scope of this review, there are excellent reviews on the subject (
   <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
   <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>) Worth mentioning are the different approaches, mostly targeting the S protein with its RBD. Vaccine candidates include RNA and DNA vaccines, recombinant proteins, and vectored vaccines, as well as inactivated and live attenuated vaccines. The first human trial published assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) vectored expressing 
   <italic>S</italic> protein of SARS-CoV-2 (
   <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). One hundred ninety-five participants were allocated in three dose groups and followed for 28 days post-vaccination. Mild adverse reactions were common within the first 7 days after vaccination with no serious events noted during the observation period. Neutralizing antibodies were detected at Day 14 and peaked at Day 28 post-vaccination, and specific CD4 and CD8 cells peaked at Day 14 and remained present through Day 28 in the three dose groups. It is important to note that development of an efficient vaccine requires a deep understanding not only of the viral antigens and epitopes, but also of the immunological events leading up to the epitope presentation and recognition resulting in the establishment of a protective immune memory, the effector mechanisms in response to the antigens, and the adjuvants present in the proposed vaccine, one that would have minimal side effects (
