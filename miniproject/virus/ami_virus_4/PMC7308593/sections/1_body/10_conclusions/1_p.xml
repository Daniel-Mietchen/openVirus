<p>Just 5 months after the initiation of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, which extended quickly worldwide to greatly impact public health and economies, the amount of information gathered on all aspects of the infection and the celerity with which the international scientific community has shared such information is truly amazing. However, given the haste to publish results, many manuscripts are in repositories, and still waiting for peer review. A note of caution is therefore in order, if such information is to be used in defining new diagnostic, therapeutic, or prophylactic protocols. It is also important to consider the brief amount of time elapsed since the beginning of the pandemic, during which time it has not been possible to gather sufficient results from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and experimental animal models to ensure further understanding of COVID-19's biology. Even when considering these limitations, the information provided by the papers reviewed herein strongly supports quantitative and qualitative differences in the immune responses of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 which seem to correlate with the clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Although studies of asymptomatic infected individuals are lacking, the immunological profiles of patients with moderate infections indicate a protective T cell-dependent response, in contrast to patients with severe disease who exhibit an exacerbated systemic inflammation, with signs of T cells exhaustion.
