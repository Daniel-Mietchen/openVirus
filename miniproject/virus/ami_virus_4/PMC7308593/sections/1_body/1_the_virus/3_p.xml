<p>Coronaviruses have a single-stranded positive RNA of nearly 30 Kbp, a spheroidal shape, and a diameter of 80–120 nm. Their envelope contains the spike –S-, membrane -M-, and envelope -E-, proteins, and the nucleocapsid -N- inside the virion that covers the RNA (

 <italic>1a,b</italic> which occupy two thirds of the genome and code for the polyproteins pp1a and pp1b (
