<p>Protein 
 <italic>S</italic> is the best studied of the coronaviruses proteins, since it contains the Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD) for the ligand on the host cell membrane, and also has epitopes recognized by T and B cells, which induce the production of neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). 
 <italic>S</italic> is a type I trimeric glycoprotein that protrudes from the virion membrane, giving it the appearance of a crown. 
 <italic>S</italic> is formed by two subunits: S1, or bulb, that contains the RBD (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>); and S2, or stalk, responsible for the fusion of the virion with the host cell membrane (
