<p>As described above, the main receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 on the membrane of the target cells is the Angiotensin 2 Converting Enzyme (ACE2), a metallopeptidase present on the membrane of many cells, including type-I and -II pneumocytes, small intestine enterocytes, kidney proximal tubules cells, the endothelial cells of arteries and veins, and the arterial smooth muscle, among other tissues (

Thereafter, viral RNA serves as a template for the translation of the polyproteins pp1a and pp1b that are cleaved into 5â€“16 non-structural proteins (nsp2-nsp9), which in turn induce rearrangement of the membranes to form the vesicles where viral replication and transcription complexes are anchored. The virions are assembled in the ER-Golgi and mature virions are subsequently released by the secretory pathway (
