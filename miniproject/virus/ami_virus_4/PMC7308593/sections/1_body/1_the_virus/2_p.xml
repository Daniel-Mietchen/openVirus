<p>SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which includes a large number of species capable of infecting various wild animals, some of which also affect humans (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In humans, most coronavirus infections result in mild respiratory Infections and may be responsible for 20–30% of common colds (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). However, both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which emerged in the last two decades, were responsible for epidemics of severe respiratory syndromes. The three coronaviruses causing more serious pathologies belong to beta-CoV (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and, despite their genomic and structural similarities, they differ significantly epidemiologically. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have a low transmissibility but a high lethality, while SARS-CoV-2 has an extremely high transmissibility and a degree of lethality not yet established globally.
