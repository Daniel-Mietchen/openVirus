<p>Multiple evidences support that the humoral response, mainly antibodies against the

However, there are still many questions regarding the significance of antibodies against the different viral proteins, and the cross reactivity of antibodies against other highly prevalent alpha- and beta-coronavirus, although it seems that cross reactivity occurs mostly within the beta-coronaviridae (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>), particularly between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that share 90% of the amino acid sequence in S1 (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). However, it can also happen with other antigens, as demonstrated in the outbreak of HCoV-OC43 in British Columbia (Canada) where cross reactivity of anti-N antibodies with SARS-CoV was found (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). In this respect, it is interesting that there is no information regarding whether survivors of the SARS and MERS epidemics became infected with SARS-CoV-2, and if so, the nature of their clinical and immunological behavior.
