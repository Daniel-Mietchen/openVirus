<p>It is worth noting that the role of secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in COVID-19 has received little attention, despite the fact that SARS-CoV-2 enters the body through the respiratory mucosa and sIgA is fundamental to the mucosal defenses. Furthermore, several studies into COVID-19 have shown the presence of serum IgA against SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>–
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>) and, in preclinical studies with anti-SARS vaccines, administered either sub-lingually or intranasally, the presence of neutralizing IgA was demonstrated in bronchoalveolar lavages (
