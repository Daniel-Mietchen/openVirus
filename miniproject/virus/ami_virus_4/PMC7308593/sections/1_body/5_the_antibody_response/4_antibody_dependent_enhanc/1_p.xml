<p>An intriguing phenomenon that worries many clinicians and researchers is the “Antibody-Dependent Enhancement” (ADE), which could be linked to the severity of coronavirus infections and could possibly create difficulties with new vaccines (

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>) studying the antibody response in SARS, found that patients with more severe clinical courses had earlier and higher antibody responses, and hypothesized that earlier responders may have had, during the acute phase, cross-reacting antibodies with non-SARS coronaviruses. Jaume et al. (

 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>) demonstrated that anti-S antibodies, while inhibiting viral entrance in permissive cells, potentiated the infection by binding to IgG Fc receptor-II positive (FcγRII
 <sup>+</sup>) cells, like B cells and macrophages. Thus, IgG anti-S antibodies bound to FcγRII on mononuclear phagocyte membranes enhance viral entrance through canonical viral-receptor pathways, as recently shown for MERS-CoV (
