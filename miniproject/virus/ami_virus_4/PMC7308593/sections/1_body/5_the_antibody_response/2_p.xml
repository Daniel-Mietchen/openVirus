<p>IgM and IgA antibodies can be detected early during the 1st week of symptom onset, whereas IgG can be detected at around 14 days after the initiation of symptoms (

 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>); however, given the short time elapsed since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not known how long the protecting levels of these blocking antibodies will remain active. Nevertheless, in a cohort of SARS survivors followed for 6 years, Tang et al. (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>) found that anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were undetectable in 21/23 patients and that none of them had specific memory B cells, whereas specific memory T cells were present in 14/23 (60.9%) of the SARS survivors studied. Although the diagnostic value of the serological tests for COVID-19 is not yet fully defined (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>), it should be stated that the study of the antibodies against different SARS-CoV-2 antigens, in different populations and at various times during the pandemic, would be an important way of understanding the dynamics of transmission and seroprevalence as a proxy to herd immunity. Furthermore, it is equally important to conduct serial antibody titers measurements in cohorts of COVID-19 survivors in order to determine how long the immune memory remains active and its effect on the possible reemergence of SARS-CoV-2, or other coronavirus outbreaks.
