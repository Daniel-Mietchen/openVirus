<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and initiated with the first cases observed in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, has expanded dramatically throughout the world (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). This expansion has had devastating effects in many countries due to its contagiousness and the high number of patients presenting with severe infections and elevated death risk, requiring specialized medical care in intensive care units (ICU). For this reason, the WHO declared it a Global Sanitary Emergency on January 30, 2020 (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), including its genome, morphological structure, and molecules (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), its relationship with other coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), its entrance into the host cells by binding the Angiotensin II Converting Enzyme (ACE2) (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), its intracellular replication (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and the immune response of the infected individuals (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). All these studies aim at developing diagnostic tests, strategies for clinical management, effective antiviral agents, and eventually, production of a protective vaccine.
