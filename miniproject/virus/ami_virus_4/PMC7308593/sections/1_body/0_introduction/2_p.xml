<p>The goal of this review is to analyze the main aspects of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and the relationship between the protective and inflammatory responses and COVID-19 clinical spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic to severe clinical presentations. The review also highlights the principal immunological research challenges posed by COVID-19 pandemics. The immune response in humans and experimental animals against infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has been studied extensively and there are many excellent reviews (
