<p id="Par26">The model suggested that epidemics that were the first of the season or had early start dates should be modestly larger (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Start date had the largest estimated effect and the clearest posterior support for a non-trivial effect size. Posterior modes for the mean effects of antigenic change and absolute humidity across subtypes were near zero (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), with tight credible intervals (95% credible intervals: (−0.56, 0.27) for absolute humidity, (−0.50, 0.30) for antigenic change). Prior cases of an old variant given no antigenic change (95% credible intervals (−0.26, 0.85)), prior cases of all variants for non-first epidemics (95% credible intervals (−0.84, 0.33)) and rainfall during the epidemic (95% credible intervals (−0.68, 0.20)) also showed no strongly discernible effects, though with less posterior certainty. The model could not explain much of the variation in the data: the median-estimated standard deviation of log epidemic size about the expected log size is 0.77 (95% credible intervals (0.67, 0.90)). Since exp(0.77) is ~2.15, this implies that it is not unusual to see epidemics half or twice the expected incidence. The model estimated that the effects were very similar across subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>, median-estimated SDs for the distribution of subtype-specific effect sizes about the overall mean effect size near zero, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>). Only the effect of whether an epidemic was the first of the season showed meaningful heterogeneity: the model estimated that it is somewhat weaker for B/Vic than for other subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>).
