<p id="Par25">Whilst the magnitude of the effects of the climatological and virological factors may be individually subtle, it could be the case that they are only able to affect observable changes on the magnitude and timing of epidemics when acting in concert, or that large effects in opposing directions mask each other. We used a Bayesian multilevel regression model to identify which putative predictor variables affected epidemic incidence, and estimate posterior distributions for their effects on epidemic size. The model included the following variables: antigenic change, cumulative prior cases of the antigenic variant, mean absolute humidity during the epidemic, activity by other subtypes earlier in the season, epidemic start date and rainfall during the epidemic. Mean temperature during the epidemic was omitted as a predictor, since it was highly collinear with absolute humidity; analyses were subsequently repeated using mean temperature, and omitting absolute humidity with no substantial changes in the overall results.</p>
