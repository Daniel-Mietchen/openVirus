<p id="Par19">To investigate the impact of antigenic change on the spatiotemporal synchrony of epidemics, we examined the timing of epidemic activity across cities for years when a new major antigenic variant circulated in all five cities. New antigenic variants often failed to initiate epidemics across all five cities in a given year. We compared the synchrony of epidemics (defined as the reciprocal of the variance in epidemic onset timings) in the season in which an antigenic variant first emerges to the synchrony in subsequent seasons. There were no statistically significant differences in epidemic synchrony associated with antigenic novelty (Supplementary Fig.Â
