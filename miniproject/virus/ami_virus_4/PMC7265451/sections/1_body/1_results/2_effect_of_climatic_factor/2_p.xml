 </sup>. Overall, epidemic incidence should depend strongly on the initial exponential growth phase of the epidemic, where transmission may be facilitated by favourable climatic conditions. We therefore investigated the impact of mean temperature and mean absolute humidity during each epidemic, as well as just the period from epidemic onset to the peak, on that epidemic’s size. For both time periods considered, epidemic incidence was not associated with mean absolute humidity (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We found that epidemic incidence was weakly negatively associated with the mean temperature during the epidemic and the period from start to the peak, but this relationship appears to be primarily driven by two instances, where small epidemics occurred during the early and warmer part of the season; on balance, the highly variable epidemic sizes observed over a range of climatic conditions, suggest that climatic factors have limited and noisy effects (Supplementary Fig.
