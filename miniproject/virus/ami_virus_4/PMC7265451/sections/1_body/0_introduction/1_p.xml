<p id="Par3">Seasonal influenza virus epidemics are a substantial source of disease burden and result in ~650,000 deaths each year

Four co-circulating subtypes/lineages of influenza viruses currently cause disease in humans: A/H3N2 (A/H3), A/H1N1 (currently A/H1pdm09, previously A/H1seasonal (A/H1sea)), B/Victoria/2/87-like (B/Vic) and B/Yamagata/16/88-like (B/Yam) viruses. The timing, duration and size of local influenza virus epidemics can vary substantially from year to year
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>, but the underlying causes of this variation are poorly understood. Better understanding of the factors that govern epidemic onset and magnitude could allow for accurate and timely epidemiological forecasts
