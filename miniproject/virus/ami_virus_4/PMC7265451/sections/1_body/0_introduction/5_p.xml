<p id="Par7">Antigenic change could also produce earlier and more spatiotemporally synchronous epidemics. When more individuals are susceptible, fewer transmission chains go stochastically extinct, so each new introduction of a virus into a population has a higher chance of causing an epidemic. Consistent with this, studies have suggested that antigenic change is associated with earlier epidemics in Israel
