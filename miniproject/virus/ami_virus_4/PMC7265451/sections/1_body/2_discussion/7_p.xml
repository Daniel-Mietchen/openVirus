<p id="Par33">It is striking that individual antigenic variants of A/H3 and B/Vic viruses are capable of re-invading the same city multiple times over consecutive years, despite a lack of substantial antigenic change. A/H1pdm09 viruses had previously been shown to cause repeat epidemics without antigenic change

 </sup>, but our study establishes that this occurs for multiple types and subtypes of human influenza. One possible explanation for the lack of evidence for the year-on-year depletion of susceptible hosts is that influenza virus infection often fails to confer strain-specific and effective immunity. In some individuals, antigenic seniority and existing immunity against previously encountered antigenic variants may suppress novel strain-specific antibody responses, leading to only modest specific protection against reinfection
