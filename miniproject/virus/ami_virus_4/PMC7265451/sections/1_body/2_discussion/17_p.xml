<p id="Par43">While our Bayesian multilevel model estimated negligible effects on epidemic size stemming from climatic factors and prior cases attributed to the same antigenic variant, the estimated credible intervals were not tight enough to rule out these effects conclusively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). However, our study suggests that climatic and antigenic factors are unlikely to be strong drivers of local influenza epidemiological dynamics. Indeed, the effects of these specific factors are dwarfed in magnitude by more generic epidemiological drivers: seasonality not directly captured by climate (measured by start date) and competition for hosts among subtypes (measured by whether an epidemic is the first of the season) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). We also find that even with all generic and specific factors considered, precise predictions of epidemic size remain difficult because of substantial noise in the local epidemic process.
