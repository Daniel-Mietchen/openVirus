 </sup> also found regional differences in the associations between fluctuations in absolute humidity and epidemic onset. Strong associations were found in the Southeastern United States but not in Western states. In Australia, there does not appear to be an aggregate effect at the country level, and there were no consistent patterns at the level of individual cities (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The small effect sizes and lack of consistency in climatic patterns across regions and cities in the United States and Australia may reflect the fact that climatic factors alone are unlikely to account for the differences in the patterns of influenza seasonality between temperate and tropical regions
