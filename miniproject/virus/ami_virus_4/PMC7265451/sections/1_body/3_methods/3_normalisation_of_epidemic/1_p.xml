<p id="Par58">For each epidemic, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed cases per million people was calculated from the number of raw counts. Given the positive skew in the distribution of epidemic incidences, individual incidence values were log-transformed. To enable comparisons within subtypes, we needed to account for potential differences in surveillance intensity, and normalise values between cities: we subtracted off the overall city-specific mean log-transformed incidence from each individual value. Although the apparent heterogeneity in the effect of antigenic change and prior immunity between subtypes suggests that data should be stratified by subtype, we repeated our analyses with data aggregated and normalised across subtypes in order to increase statistical power. Individual log-transformed values for each epidemic were instead transformed by subtracting off the overall city- and subtype-specific mean of the log-transformed values.</p>
