<p id="Par60">The haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay data used in this study only compared the test virus and the then current reference vaccine strain to assess whether or not viruses had changed antigenically. However, this comparison to a single reference point is potentially problematic, given that new Southern Hemisphereâ€™s influenza vaccine composition recommendations are made every September. This is usually after the end of the influenza season in Australia, and may lead to misidentification during antigenic characterisation of submitted samples during the preceding season where samples containing a novel antigenic variant may have been tested with sera raised against its predecessor variant. To ameliorate this potential source of bias, we compared the antigenic characterisation data against phylogenetic data. This comparison revealed two instances for A/H3 viruses where the reference strain comparison by HI was misleading regarding the antigenic composition of an epidemic. There were a substantial number of laboratory-confirmed cases attributable to A/H3/Fujian/411/2002-like viruses in 2004, but phylogenetic analyses of sequences dated 2004 show that the Fujian/411/2002-like viruses had already been replaced by the novel California/7/2004 variant viruses. Similarly, in 2005, a substantial number of samples initially identified as A/H3 California/7/2004-like viruses were phylogenetically in the new A/Wisconsin/67/2005 variant group.</p>
