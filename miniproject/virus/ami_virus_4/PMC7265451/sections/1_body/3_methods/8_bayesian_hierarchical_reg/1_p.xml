<p id="Par67">To estimate reasonable bounds on the possible effects of climate and antigenicity on epidemic size, we used a Bayesian hierarchical model that partially pooled effect-size estimates across subtypes, increasing the capacity to detect any potential effects without assuming a priori that effects should be the same across different subtypes. We fit the model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with Stan
