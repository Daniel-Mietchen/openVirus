 </sup>, we generated a synthetic distribution of wintertime climatic values by bootstrap sampling. In order to maintain the sampling structure and control for anomaly variability among the cities, 15 n-week continuous blocks were randomly sampled from 1 April–31 August, 1985–2015 for each of the five cities. These 75 samples were then averaged to produce a mean 
 <italic>T</italic>′ and 
 <italic>AH</italic>′ value. This was repeated 100,000 times to produce a bootstrapped distribution of average values. The statistical significance for the mean 
 <italic>T</italic>′ and 
 <italic>AH</italic>′ values derived from the 75 empirically observed earliest-in-the-season epidemics was then calculated non-parametrically, by determining the quantile for the observed values within the bootstrap distributions. This bootstrap was repeated at the city level to see if there were geographical differences with individual bootstrap distributions that were created for each city.
