<p>GCs are the principal sites of affinity maturation of antigen-specific immunoglobulin, transient structures induced by T cell-dependent (TD) antigens [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells orchestrate the GC response in part by providing help factors for which GC B cells compete to survive and undergo clonal expansion [
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Proliferating GC B cells differentiate into plasma cells to produce antibody, and simultaneously differentiate to memory cells which produce powerful antibody responses. The numbers of GC B and plasma cells and TIV-specific IgG
 <sup>+</sup> ASCs were decreased in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice, which may explain the lower level of antibody response. We also found a decreased number of GC T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice. Furthermore, the expression levels of some factors of the transcriptional network regulating the cellular dynamics of splenic GC B cells, high-affinity antibody development and plasma cell differentiation, such as BCL6 or Blimp1, which are considered to be master regulators for GC or plasma cell development, were abnormal in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. BCL6 inhibits the transcription of Prdm1, the gene that encodes Blimp-1, and Blimp-1 represses transcription of the genes that encode BCL6 [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. So, BCL6 is a known inhibitor of plasma cell differentiation and thus promotes memory B cell differentiation [
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In this study, the increased 
 <italic>Bcl6</italic> mRNA and decreased expression of Blimp-1 and 
 <italic>Prdm1</italic> mRNA may be a reasonable explanation for the dynamic cells observed within GCs in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice. As expected, IFITM3 deletion resulted in diminished numbers of plasma cells and increased the memory cells. A previous study reported that IFITM3 loci contain several potential BCL6 binding sites and BCL6 could bind to these sites, including the promoter and 3â€™ conserved untranslated region to inhibit the expression of MX2 and IFITM3 in T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay [
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our findings indicate that BCL6 may have a close connection to IFITM3, giving us a hypothesis that IFITM3 deletion results in the high expression of BCL6 in T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells or other immune cells and then impacts on the antibody response. However, the mechanisms involved require further investigation.
