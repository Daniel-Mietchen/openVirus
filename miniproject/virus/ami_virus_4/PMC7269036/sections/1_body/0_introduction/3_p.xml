<p>Vaccination is the most effective method to prevent influenza virus infection. Growing evidence suggests that host factors including host genetics, the hormonal milieu, and gut microbiota play important roles as modifiers of influenza virus vaccine efficacy [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We are curious to know whether there is an association between IFITM3 and antibody response after TIV immunization. In this study, we recruited 171 healthy young adult volunteers who received TIV and observed the seroconversion rates (SCRs) for H1N1, H3N2 and B viruses. SCRs were found to be lower in donors with
