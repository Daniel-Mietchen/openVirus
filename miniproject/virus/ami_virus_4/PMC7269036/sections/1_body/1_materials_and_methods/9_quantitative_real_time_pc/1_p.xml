<p>Total mouse RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed to cDNA, then quantified with SYBR® Premix Ex Taq (Tli RNaseH Plus) ROX plus kit (Takara, Japan). Samples were assayed in triplicate. Ratios of 2
 <sup>−ΔΔC(t)</sup> were computed and analyzed with glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as the reference gene. The special primers were designed by Primer 5 with sequences downloaded from NCBI (Table S1).
