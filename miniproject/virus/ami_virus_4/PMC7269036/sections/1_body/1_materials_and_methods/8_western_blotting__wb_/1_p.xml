<p>Lymphocytes were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% DOC, and 1% Triton X-100), sonicated, boiled and used for SDS – PAGE followed by Western blotting. The following primary polyclonal antibodies were used: rabbit anti-IFITM3 (Proteintech, Chicago), rabbit anti-BCL-6 (Cell Signaling Technology, MA), rabbit anti-Blimp1 (Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-AID (Cell Signaling Technology) and mouse anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP and rabbit anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechology, Texas) were used as secondary antibodies. ECL western blotting detection reagents (Solarbio, Beijing) were used for detection.</p>
