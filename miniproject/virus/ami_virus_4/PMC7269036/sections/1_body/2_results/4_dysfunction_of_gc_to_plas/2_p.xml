<p>We further analyzed the numbers of TIV-specific IgG
 <sup>+</sup> ASCs by ELISPOT assay at days 0, 3, 7 and 14 after booster immunization (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>f). As expected, the numbers of TIV-specific IgG
 <sup>+</sup> ASCs in WT mice were two-fold higher than those in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice at days 3 and 7 (
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>g). Thus, these results indicate that IFITM3 deletion reduces the number of TIV-specific IgG
 <sup>+</sup> ASCs, but the number of memory cells in spleens of 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice increases.
