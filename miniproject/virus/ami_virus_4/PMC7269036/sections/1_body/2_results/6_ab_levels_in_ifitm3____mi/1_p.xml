<p>To verify if the increased numbers of memory B cells resulted in a more powerful antibody response in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice after TIV immunization, we detected the antibody level after a third TIV vaccination (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>a). The third immunization was implemented at day 7 after the booster vaccination. HI and IgG were detected at days 0 (for twice vaccination), 7 (for third vaccination), 14, 21, 28 and 32. The HI and IgG levels were lower in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice at day 7 after boosting compared with WT mice, then strongly increased at day 14 (day 7 after third boosting) (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>b, c). Despite this, the HI and IgG level of 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice remained lower than WT mice and there was no significant difference between WT and 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice.
