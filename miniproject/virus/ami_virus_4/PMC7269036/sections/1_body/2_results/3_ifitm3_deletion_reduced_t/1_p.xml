<p>Having demonstrated the low antibody response in

  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic>mice after TIV immunization, we sought to address the variation in B cells which secrete antibody. The antibody response to T cell-dependent antigen is depended on GCs. Within GCs, B cells activate and proliferate to become antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory B cells [

 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, we first analyzed splenic GC B cells by flow cytometry at days 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after booster immunization (Fig. S1; 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>a). In control mice immunized with PBS, there was no difference between the numbers of GC B cells in spleens of WT and

  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice. However, we observed a decrease in the frequencies of splenic GC B cells in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice at days 0, 3 and 7 after boosting (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>b). The overall numbers of GC B cells peaked at day 7 in WT mice, but was delayed until at day 14 in

  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice. Furthermore, the number of GC B cells was three-fold higher in WT mice than in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice at day 7 after boosting. These data show that IFITM3 deletion decrease the number of splenic GC B cells and postpone the peak of activated GC B cells.
