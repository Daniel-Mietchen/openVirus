<p>We analyzed the expression of the transcription factors by WB and the corresponding abundance of mRNAs by quantitative PCR using splenic lymphocytes at day 7 after booster. Firstly, the expression of IFIMT3 was substantially increased in WT mice after immunization which is consistent with the previous research (
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>b, c) [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We also observed that 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice showed a substantial reduction in the expression of Blimp-1 protein in spleens at day 7, whereas the expressions of BCL6 and AID were similar when WT mice were compared with 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice (
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>b, c). Additionally, there were substantial decreases in 
 <italic>Pax5</italic>, 
 <italic>Aicda</italic>, 
 <italic>Prdm1</italic> and 
 <italic>XBP1</italic> mRNA in the splenic lymphocytes of 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice at the same time point. However, the 
 <italic>Bcl6, IRF8</italic> and 
 <italic>Bach2</italic> mRNA were substantially increased in spleen of 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice at days 7 after boosting (
 <xref rid="F0007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>d). These results indicate that the expression of Blimp-1 declines at day 7 after booster immunization while at the mRNA level, 
 <italic>Bcl6</italic> and 
 <italic>Bach2</italic> mRNA increase in 
 <italic>Ifitm3
  <sup>-/-</sup>
 </italic> mice at this time.
