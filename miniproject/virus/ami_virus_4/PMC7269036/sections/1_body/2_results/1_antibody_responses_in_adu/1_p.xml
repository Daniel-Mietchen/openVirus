<p>Two hundred and twelve healthy adults (age from 18 to 59 years) were enrolled in the study and each received a single dose of seasonal TIV. Whole-blood specimens were collected for HI antibody test and 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> rs12252 genotyping on days 0 and 28 after immunization. In all, 49 donors (23.11%) demonstrated the 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> rs12252-T/T genotype, 107 (50.47%) had the 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> rs12252-C/T genotype, and 56 (26.42%) exhibited the 
 <italic>IFITM3</italic> rs12252-C/C genotype (
