  <p>IFITM3 deletion led to low antibody response after third TIV immunization in mice. (a) WT and congenic

    <sup>-/-</sup>
   </italic> C57/6 mice (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group) were immunized third by intraperitoneal injection of 50 μL of TIV (1.5 μg of each HA). The twice immunization was at day 14 after primary immunization, then the third immunization was at day 7 after twice immunization (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group). (b) The serum HI titres were detected by HI against A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1), A/Hong Kong/4801/2015 (H3N2) and B/Brisbane/60/2008 (B/Victoria). (c) Total IgG was investigated by ELISA with split H1N1, H3N2 and B/Victoria (1 μg/ml of each HA). The y-axis represents OD
   <sub>450nm/630nm</sub>. The x-axis shows days after boost immunizations. The bars represent the mean values and the standard errors of the means. Significant differences are marked by *
