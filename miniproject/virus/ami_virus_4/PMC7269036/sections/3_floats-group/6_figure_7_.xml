  <p>Transcriptional networks regulating GC B cells and plasma cells differentiation were detected by WB and qRT-PCR. (a) The transcription factors controlling GCs formation. * Primed B cells mean Ag-specific naive or memory B cells. (b) WB with anti- IFITM3, anti- BCL6, anti- AID, anti- Blimp-1 and anti- β-Actin revealing the difference between WT and 
   <italic>Ifitm3
    <sup>-/-</sup>
   </italic> mice. (c) Quantitative results of the ratios of IFITM3, BCL6, AID, Blimp-1 to β-Actin are showed. (d) The mRNA profiles were analyzed using the 2
   <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup> method and results were plotted as fold differences of relative expression normalized to 
   <italic>GAPDH</italic> and ratio of 
   <italic>Ifitm3
    <sup>-/-</sup>
   </italic> to WT individually (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 per group). The bars represent the mean values and the standard errors of the means. *
