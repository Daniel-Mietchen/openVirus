<p id="p0055">Upon release of the virus from the cell, the neutral pH of the extracellular environment causes dissociation of pr molecules, thus completing the maturation process. Maturation is inefficient and a substantial number of DENV particles released from the cell are either partially mature or immature 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, when they are complexed with specific antibodies, this can lead to ADE, rendering them infectious by facilitating the endosomal internalization of the immDENV:antibody complex. In this context, although furin can cleave the pr:M complex from the antibody-bound virion inside the endosome 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, it has remained unclear how pr dissociates in the acidic pH environment. Thus, we also describe below our recent use of simulations of the immature viral envelope in combination with cryo-EM, co-flotation assays, and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to rationalize an example of ADE at the molecular level.
