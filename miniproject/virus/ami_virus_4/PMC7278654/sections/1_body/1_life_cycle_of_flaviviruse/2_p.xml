<p id="p0045">Flavivirus infection is triggered through receptor mediated endocytosis, when the virus is internalized inside an endosome. The acidic endosomal pH triggers the E proteins to undergo a major structural rearrangement and a dimer-to-trimer transition. Through this process, hydrophobic fusion peptides (FPs), which are positioned at the tip of each trimeric E protein “spike”, become exposed. This allows them to interact with the endosomal membrane, leading to its fusion with the viral envelope 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. We and others have reported efforts to model the flavivirus lipid bilayer, and in particular, we describe in subsequent sections protocols to model the entire envelope particle in accordance with cryo-EM data, and to leverage such models to understand different stages of the viral life cycle.
