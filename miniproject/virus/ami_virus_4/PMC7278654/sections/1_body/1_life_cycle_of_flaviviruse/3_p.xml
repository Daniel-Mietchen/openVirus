 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Subsequently, the assembly of the nascent immature dengue virus (immDENV) proceeds via budding of its components into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The immDENV is rendered non-infectious due to the complex formed between the prM (precursor of membrane) protein with the E protein in the viral membrane. The immDENV envelope is composed of 60 trimeric spikes, in which each monomer consists of an E:prM complex

Nevertheless, the low pH prevents the dissociation of pr molecules from dissociating from the E protein
