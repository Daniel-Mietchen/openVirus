<p id="p0065">In the following, we summarize computational and integrative modelling methods, guided by biophysical data, that have yielded molecular insights into the “ins” and “outs” of enveloped flaviviruses. In 
 <xref rid="s0015" ref-type="sec">Section 3</xref>, we begin by highlighting areas of ongoing interest in the context of viral envelope dynamics, which have been tackled recently using a combination of multiscale simulation and experiment. We then go on to detail efforts to characterize the virion’s nucleocapsid cargo via simulation (
 <xref rid="s0055" ref-type="sec">Section 4</xref>) and RNA sequencing-guided modelling (
