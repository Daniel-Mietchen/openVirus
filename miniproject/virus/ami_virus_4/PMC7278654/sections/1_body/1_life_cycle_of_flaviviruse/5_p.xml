<p id="p0060">It is also emerging that flaviviruses undergo major structural and dynamic changes outside of the cell, in response to different environmental triggers. In particular, the envelope is modulated when exposed to higher temperatures that may be associated with fever. Such viral conformational dynamics have been referred to as “breathing”

 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The most prominent temperature-mediated transitions have been observed in specific strains of DENV2. The virus envelope has been observed to expand and become “bumpy” at 37 °C, in contrast to 28 °C where it exhibits a “smooth” envelope surface

 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Although the existence of such variable morphologies may not be correlated with infectivity 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, they likely have important consequences for antibody binding and neutralization, and represent a challenge for therapeutics development. Interestingly, flavivirus “breathing” was initially thought to be irreversible, but as described below, a combination of multiscale modelling, cryo-EM, single-molecule fluorescence, and HDX-MS has enabled us to observe the process of viral expansion in atomic detail, and to elucidate the mechanism by which divalent cations enable the virion to reverse this process
