<p id="p0180">Viruses have complex life cycles which are dependent upon interactions with a variety of host factors and are constantly adapting, making therapeutics development challenging. Continuing increases in computational power, widespread use of multiscale approaches, and growing efforts to integrate diverse structural, biophysical, and HTS data into theoretical models have made possible the accurate description of entire virus particles, including component protein, lipid, and nucleic acid material. As outlined here for flaviviruses, this is enabling us to refine envelope structure, predict its dynamic interplay with environmental and immunological triggers, elucidate capsid conformational ensembles, and map genomic architecture. Similar approaches are now being applied to the emerging virus SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, and indeed, numerous coronavirus structures of the trimeric pre-fusion glycoprotein spike responsible for infection have been published
