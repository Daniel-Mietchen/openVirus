<p id="p0130">Using MD simulations in conjunction with biophysical experiments, the dynamics of these IDRs can be better understood at atomic resolution. In recent years, the need for accurate treatment of IDRs in simulations have seen a rise in IDP-specific parameterised force fields

 <xref rid="b0385" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>. We recently showed that certain force fields are more suited to the DENV C protein than others 
 <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) provides low resolution information on the shape of proteins in solution and is suited to IDPs due to their fuzzy and dynamic nature 
 <xref rid="b0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Selecting conformations from a simulation has the benefit of selecting structures that have been relaxed and equilibrated and are closer to the experimental conditions. This is as opposed to selecting conformations from a random pool of conformations for the IDRs derived from X-ray structures or NMR structures that may have unresolved clashes or are in non-aqueous conformations. Using an ensemble of conformations derived from MD simulations, we were able to fit the SAXS data better than using a randomly generated pool 
 <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. The SAXS data was used to validate the most representative ensemble of conformations from the different force fields by fitting a pool of structures derived from the simulations, and selected via a genetic algorithm that minimises the chi-squared value. The force field with the smallest chi-squared value was the IDP-parameterized force field, amber03ws. The resultant conformations that best fit the SAXS data showed that the alpha 1 helices towards the N-terminus of the protein may come together in a clamp-like motion to occlude a hydrophobic patch at the core of the DENV C protein. This is a refinement of the previously solved NMR structure, and may be a better representation of the protein in an aqueous environment.
