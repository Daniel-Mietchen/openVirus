<p id="p0125">The flavivirus C protein is a small but multifunctional protein. A large part of its multifunctionality is derived from the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at the N-terminus of the protein. Due to the flexible nature of the N-terminal IDRs, the structure and dynamics of these regions have remained undefined: X-ray crystallographic and NMR structures of flavivirus C proteins either solve the structure without the N-terminal tails or are unable to resolve the atoms in the region

 <xref rid="b0355" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. However it remains an important task to characterise and understand the dynamics of these IDRs, and indeed, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are abundantly found in nature
