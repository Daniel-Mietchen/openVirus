<p id="p0135">HDX-MS may also be useful to elucidate the dynamics of IDRs. The protein is incubated in the presence of deuterated water and then the reaction is quenched. During the time of incubation in the presence of deuterium, the backbone amide hydrogens exchange with the deuterium, and this change in mass can be detected through mass-spectrometry. IDPs and IDRs show greater exchange of their backbone amide hydrogens with deuterium than do proteins regions that are structured. The correlation of backbone hydrogen bond formation or solvent accessibility with amide backbone deuteriation may also be used to validate the ensemble of structures derived from different forcefields 
 <xref rid="b0390" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Again, trajectories based on the amber03ws force field exhibited the highest correlations for both backbone hydrogen bond formation and solvent accessibility with experimentally measured amide backbone deuteriation, thus validating our calculated ensemble of C protein conformations.
