<p id="p0040">As described in the following sections, such computational models have enabled the description of the conformational dynamics of flaviviruses during progression along their life cycle in unparalleled detail, as well as furthering our understanding of their interactions with host components such as antibodies. In addition, the architecture of the flavivirus nucleocapsid complex containing the RNA genome is not well understood, because it appears not to be organized in a clear geometric pattern amenable to cryo-EM, and because a significant component of the C protein is intrinsically disordered and hence challenging to study via traditional approaches, depending on conditions and maturation state 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Thus, we also describe our recent efforts to integrate biophysical experiments with simulation to characterize the C protein conformational ensemble, and to use high-throughput sequencing (HTS) with chemical modification techniques in combination with modelling to predict genomic RNA structures.
