<p id="p0030">Flaviviruses are typically transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks, and encompass around 50 known pathogens that cause human disease. Dengue (DENV) is the archetypal member, infecting up to ~400 million people per year worldwide 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. All flaviviruses adopt a similar structure, composed of only three structural proteins, namely the envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins – embedded within a lipid bilayer vesicle and arranged in an icosahedral fashion – and the capsid (C) proteins, which form a complex with the single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome inside the virion core. 180 copies of the E and M proteins are arranged with icosahedral symmetry on the surface of the virion particle 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In the mature particle, these are found as three sets of parallel dimers or “rafts” which are arranged in a herringbone-like pattern. The E protein is exposed on the virion surface, and is responsible both for binding to cell receptors during infection, as well as fusion with endosomal membranes inside the cell, enabling genome release
