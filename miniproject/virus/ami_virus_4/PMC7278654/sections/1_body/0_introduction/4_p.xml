<p id="p0035">The discovery of new antiviral drugs is hampered by numerous challenges including the integration of the viral life cycle with that of the host, potential development of resistance, and the ongoing threat of newly arising pandemics. Vaccination is a potentially effective strategy to combat viral disease, but can be complicated by pathogen-specific factors such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> in which non-neutralizing antibodies actually facilitate viral infectivity. This is a particularly relevant issue for DENV, which exists as four distinct serotypes, and a recently available vaccine has been reported to worsen the outcome of patients who have not previously been infected 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. To counter the challenges in viral disease therapy, research efforts continue to focus on better understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with infection. These have been facilitated by advances in structural biology, including the ever increasing resolutions attainable by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> for whole virion particles, particularly when resultant density maps are combined judiciously with available X-ray crystallographic or solution NMR structures of individual viral proteins. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique has now come of age. With the ever increasing computational power available and specialized hardware, along with appropriate multiscale approaches that enable accurate but coarse-grained (CG) representations of systems or components thereof, it is now possible to simulate entire viruses, and to use such simulations to refine integrative models incorporating experimental data
