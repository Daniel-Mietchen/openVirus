 <sup>−2</sup> applied to the E protein backbone beads; this was sufficiently strong that the structure follows the centre of the harmonic spring closely, but not weak enough to avoid introducing numerical instabilities. Following an initial 100 ns of TMD simulation, the E protein coordinates of the entire virion typically reached ~0.4–0.6 nm RMSD with respect to the target, expanded virus structure. To further refine the structure, it is advised to run additional, shorter follow-up TMD simulations with ~3–5 times increased force constant. Thus, an additional 10 ns simulation with a force constant of 4,000 kcal mol

 <sup>−2</sup> yielded a virion structure within ~ 0.1 nm RMSD with respect to the expanded experimental structure. The TMD simulations revealed the gradual opening of protrusions at the 3- and 5-fold vertices on the icosahedral surface of the virus, consistent with cryo-EM images
