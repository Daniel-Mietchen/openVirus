<p id="p0110">ADE can result from the recognition of prM proteins by non-neutralizing antibodies on the surface of immDENV particles, facilitating virion endocytosis. However, following cleavage by furin of the pr:M complexes inside the endosome, it is unclear how pr dissociates in the acidic pH environment, such that the E protein FP is exposed and the virus can infect the cell. To investigate this further, low resolution (~12–25 Å) cryo-EM structural intermediates along the maturation pathway were solved of such an immDENV:antibody complex 
 <xref rid="b0325" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. To improve the resolution and to resolve TM regions, a higher-resolution structure (of a fully immature virion, PDB: 4B03) 
 <xref rid="b0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref> was overlaid onto the fully immature virion solved at pH = 8, via superimposition onto each of the individual 180 E protein ectodomains, using PyMOL 
 <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. Subsequently, a similar procedure to that described in 
 <xref rid="s0030" ref-type="sec">Section 3.3</xref> was used to generate equilibrated CG models for the proteins of the immature virion particle embedded within an explicit lipid bilayer envelope; the resulting theoretical density maps overlapped well with the equivalent experimental ones, reproducing the spherical membrane vesicle (
