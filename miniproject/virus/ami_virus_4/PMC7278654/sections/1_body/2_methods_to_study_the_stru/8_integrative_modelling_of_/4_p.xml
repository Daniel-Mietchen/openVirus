<p id="p0120">It should be noted that whilst the predictions regarding conformational pathways in breathing or maturation are likely to be accurate, not least because of the incorporation of multiple experimental intermediate “snapshots” which help to validate the structural transitions, the kinetics of these processes are more difficult to accurately characterize. In part, this is because of the TMD approach, in which the specified timescale during the linear evolution of the structure as well as associated biasing force constant will largely determine the rate of change along the pathway of interest. On top of this, the nature of the CG methodology means that timescales should be treated with great care. Like other CG forcefields, Martini simplifies the energy landscape, speeding up sampling rates, but this speed-up is not easily predictable and is unlikely to be consistent across different degrees of freedom, or different types of molecules
