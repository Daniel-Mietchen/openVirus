 <xref rid="b0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. On the other hand, several approaches are possible for the treatment of protein conformation, including application of an elastic network model 
 <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> (ENM) between backbone beads, on top of secondary structure dependent dihedrals, to preserve higher order structure. Our experience suggests that this tends to be system specific, and calibration against all-atom reference simulations is desirable. Thus, we first simulated the solvated DENV dimeric E protein ectodomain in atomic resolution for several hundred nanoseconds, and generated equivalent CG trajectories

 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Default Martini parameters along with a range of ENMs were tested, validated by comparing protein conformational properties from all-atom and CG simulations, including backbone root mean square deviations (RMSDs) with respect to the X-ray structure, protein radius of gyration, and pairwise residue contact maps. An ENM with non-standard cut-off distances and force constants were ultimately required to accurately describe the E protein conformational dynamics
