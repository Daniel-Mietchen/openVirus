<p id="p0080">The viral lipid bilayer vesicle was subsequently constructed using the CHARMM-GUI 
 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> Martini-builder, with a diameter chosen in accordance with estimates from cryo-EM density maps. The DENV2 membrane composition included palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (PC), palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylserine (PS) in a 6:3:1 ratio, as guided by lipidomics data measured for C6/36 mosquito cells 
 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. The complete protein coordinates of 180 E/M proteins representing the entire virion envelope, obtained from the cryo-EM structure, were next converted to CG representation. These were then directly overlaid with the lipid vesicle, and overlapping lipids deleted (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). To facilitate insertion whilst reducing steric clashes, we employed a “shrinking” strategy for the lipids. This was performed for the coordinates of lipid tails by scaling their atomic positions onto the lipid tail centres of mass in a plane perpendicular to the tail principle axes 
 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. This step did not involve any simulation, but was followed by multiple sets of energy minimization whilst “freezing” the coordinates of the protein backbone; this may be performed several times in an iterative manner to obtain a stable starting model of the lipid/protein envelope complex. This may subsequently be solvated (in a sensibly chosen simulation unit cell, e.g. dodecahedron or truncated octahedron), with energy minimization and protein-restrained equilibrations in the NVT ensemble to relax the system. We would advise that a short equilibration simulation time step (e.g. ~2 fs) be chosen initially, which can be gradually increased in progressive ~100,000-step equilibration runs. Finally, this may then be followed by NPT ensemble equilibration and unrestrained production runs.
