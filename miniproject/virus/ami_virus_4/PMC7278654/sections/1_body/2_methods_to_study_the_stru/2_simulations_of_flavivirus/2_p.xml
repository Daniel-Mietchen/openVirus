<p id="p0070">Numerous all-atom and CG simulations of the flavivirus envelope have been reported. For example, several all-atom simulation studies investigated viral envelope conformational changes occurring upon exposure to low pH, both during the fusion and maturation processes

 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. The sheer size of the virus particle, comprising 180 monomeric E/M proteins, represents a significant computational cost in attempting to simulate relevant timescales 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, leading to the frequent use of the well-established Martini CG force field, in which four heavy atoms map to approximately one CG particle

 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> for generating a complete flavivirus envelope model, for multiscale refinement of its structure in direct accordance with cryo-EM data, which may subsequently be leveraged to explore conformational dynamics associated with the viral life cycle.
