Both protein and lipid should be included for density map calculations, and it is recommended to use a voxel grid-spacing close to the resolution of the cryo-EM map of interest. The Chimera

This is performed via local optimization using steepest ascent to maximize the overlap or correlation between two sets of map grid points. The correlation between two maps corresponds to the mean cosine similarity across voxels, and varies from −1 to 1. In our case the correlation reached ~0.75–0.8 during the simulations of the DENV particle, dependent upon precise system conditions (
