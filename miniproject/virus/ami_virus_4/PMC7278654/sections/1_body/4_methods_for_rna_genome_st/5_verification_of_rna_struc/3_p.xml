<p id="p0175">Ultimately, verifying the functional significance of structural motifs relies on the ability to create viruses with mutations that disrupt the structures of interest and subsequently measuring the functional impact of these modifications via fitness assays in cells or in animals. This poses a particular challenge when the motifs are present in coding regions, as opposed to untranslated regions, as possible modifications are constrained by a number of factors such as the need to preserve protein sequences through synonymous mutations and the need to avoid rare codons that would impact translation efficiency independently of any structural effects at the genome level. Moreover, the ability to design compensatory mutations is heavily constrained in coding regions due to the same factors and the need for both modifications to align.</p>
