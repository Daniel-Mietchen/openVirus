<p id="p0170">Thorough verification of identified structural motifs is a crucial part of structural genomics research. Beyond the identification of structural peculiarities, identifying functional structures is a key goal. Functional structures, either existing within viral genomes or formed via virus-host RNA interactions in infected cells may offer targets for therapeutic intervention. A key method to validate structural motifs arises from investigating the evolutionary history of a particular virus

A prerequisite for such an analysis is the availability of a large number of viral sequences, ideally spanning as diverse a number of time points and geographies as possible. Such a wealth of sequence information is usually only available for well-studied systems, e.g. HIV, Influenza, or DENV. Emerging threats such as the 2016 Zika pandemic virus prove more difficult to investigate by reference to the historical genetic record. While there is a large number of full-genome sequences available for Zika viruses, most of these samples focus on the 2016 South American outbreak and exhibit only a limited amount of genetic diversity, making the identification of covariation for structure validation challenging. In contrast, analysing dengue viruses that have been subjected to much more intense surveillance over time and geographic regions allowed us to validate predicted structural motifs with high confidence
