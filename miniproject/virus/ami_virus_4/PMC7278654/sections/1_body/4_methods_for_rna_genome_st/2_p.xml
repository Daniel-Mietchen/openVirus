Recent advances in genome sequencing have allowed us to leverage structural probing techniques that were previously confined to small RNA systems on the whole genome level, particularly for viral genomes

Combining information obtained through structural probing and cross-linking experiments with computational modelling techniques allows us to gain insights into genome-level interactions between different loci that are of functional importance for the virus 
 <xref rid="b0475" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. Structural probing can be performed at distinct phases within the viral life cycle, e.g. at a virion stage or within infected cells, and hence a time-resolved picture of genomic organization can be obtained. This allows us to identify key structural features at the stages of translation, replication, or packaging, as recently demonstrated for the ~11Â kb RNA genome of DENV and ZIKV, potentially opening up novel therapeutic strategies targeting flaviviruses
