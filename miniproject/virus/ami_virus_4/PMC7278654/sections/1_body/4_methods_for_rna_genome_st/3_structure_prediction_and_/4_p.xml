<p id="p0155">Whereas SHAPE-MaP data is able to improve the prediction accuracy of local secondary structure significantly, there remains a level of structural uncertainty related to the macro-organization of genomic RNAs. Ensembles generated with common structure prediction tools yield a diversity of macro-patterns. Chemical cross-linking information is invaluable to narrow down the space of these patterns to fewer possibilities by providing pair-wise RNA interaction information 
 <xref rid="b0475" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. Several methods for cross-linking based structure probing exist, mainly based on psoralen intercalation into helical segments and subsequent UV-based covalent cross-linking 
 <xref rid="b0445" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0560" ref-type="bibr">[112]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0565" ref-type="bibr">[113]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0595" ref-type="bibr">[119]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0600" ref-type="bibr">[120]</xref>. One way of enriching for the cross-linked RNA interactions is to utilize a biotinylated version of psoralen, which allows the selective extraction of cross-linked segments using streptavidin beads. Subsequent proximity ligation steps followed by PCR amplification and deep sequencing produces chimeric reads that reveal intra-genomic structures at various distances. Moreover, if conducted in the presence of host RNA, virus-host RNA-RNA interactions can be captured as well. Interestingly, a significant number of positions tend to form multiple interactions that are mutually exclusive, indicating the presence of either structural heterogeneity in the virus population, or constant fluctuations in virus structures 
 <xref rid="b0475" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. Observing mutually exclusive interactions in the full ensemble is to be expected if structural heterogeneity in the underlying population exists, i.e. if there is more than one way that the genome can be arranged within the mature virions (or in infected cells for that matter). Unfortunately, to date, we have been technically unable to conduct an experiment on a single virion, which would answer this question. In case the observed ensemble is the result of in-virion dynamics, time averaging during the experiment may still reveal competing positions. If structural heterogeneity exists only across virions with a specific frozen state in each individual virion, the single-virion experiment would not show any competing positions, but a subset of the full ensemble. Combining ensembles of structures that have been predicted with high local accuracy using SHAPE-constrained modelling with information about the macro-organization obtained through cross-linking experiments allows for a high-confidence selection of plausible RNA structures from the local to global scale of organization.
