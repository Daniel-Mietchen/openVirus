 <xref rid="b0525" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>. As such, studying how RNAs fold and their energetic landscapes is important for understanding gene regulation 
 <xref rid="b0530" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>. The problem of predicting RNA secondary structure from sequence is challenging as a large search space of possible base pairs needs to be traversed and the energetics assessed with high accuracy. A variety of tools exist that allow the prediction of likely RNA secondary structure based on folding free energy estimates and capable of including chemical reactivity information

 <xref rid="b0545" ref-type="bibr">[109]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0550" ref-type="bibr">[110]</xref>. Generally, these approaches use energetic terms for base pairing and stacking interactions. The challenge for predicting the structure of long RNAs increases exponentially as the search space increases and hence accuracy of prediction for long RNAs without the inclusion of additional experimental information is limited 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. A common strategy to mitigate this effect is to limit the maximum distance between paired bases to a few hundred nucleotides, thus reducing the search space considerably. The trade-off involved in this approach results in more accurate predictions of local secondary structure at the cost of neglecting longer-range interactions that are responsible for the macro-scale organization of RNA molecules. Unfortunately, it is evident from studies into viral systems that such long-range interactions are often key functional elements, as is highlighted e.g. by the Flavivirus 5′-3′ circularization motifs that span the length of the entire genome 
 <xref rid="b0555" ref-type="bibr">[111]</xref>. At present, only a combination of different methods is able to capture long-range and short-range interactions with high accuracy
