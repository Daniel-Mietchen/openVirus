<p id="p0150">While it has been shown that de-novo prediction of RNA structures from sequences alone is unreliable for larger RNAs 
 <xref rid="b0570" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0575" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref>, this problem can be overcome to some degree by including experimental information on secondary structure in the modelling process 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. Selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) is an established protocol yielding such secondary structure information for all of the four bases (A, U, C, G) 
 <xref rid="b0580" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>. The concept underlying SHAPE probing is that local RNA structure, especially the difference between flexible and physically constrained bases, affects the reactivity of the 2′-hydroxyl group of constituent nucleotides. Flexible bases are able to orientate themselves to react with SHAPE chemicals to result in acylation at the 2′-hydroxyl of the RNA. Hence, local secondary structure can be read by observing the degree of 2′-hydroxyl acylation at a specific position. The readout can be performed on a full genome level, as 2′-hydoxyl modified nucleotides tend to induce skips with a significantly increased likelihood of reverse transcription over unmodified nucleotides 
 <xref rid="b0495" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. By sequencing a reverse-transcribed library of chemically modified RNA, an increase in mutations at modified positions can be observed. From this data, local secondary structure can be inferred by comparing the local mutation rate to the mutation rate of a mock (usually DMSO) modified sample. The modification ratio thus obtained can be used as a probabilistic penalty term in secondary structure prediction 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0505" ref-type="bibr">[101]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0590" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref>. It should be noted that whereas structuredness precludes high reactivity signals at a specific position, low reactivity signals are still more likely to occur even at an open or flexible region 
 <xref rid="b0590" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref>. In addition, low reactivity signals could also be protein-interacting sites, whereby the protein binding protects the region from interacting with SHAPE compounds. However, in general, reactivity can be translated into an odds ratio 
 <xref rid="b0590" ref-type="bibr">[118]</xref> that contributes significantly to the prediction accuracy of RNA secondary structure. Whereas naïve prediction accuracy for the 16S subunit of the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosome reaches around 45% of base pairs and helices, including SHAPE data allows an increase in accuracy to well over 90% 
 <xref rid="b0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>. This technique has been successfully applied to probe the genomic structure of a range of viral systems, e.g. HIV
