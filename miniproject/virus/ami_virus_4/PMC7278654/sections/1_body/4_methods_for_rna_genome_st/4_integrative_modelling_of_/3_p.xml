 <xref rid="b0620" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref>. Two such methods are the integrative modelling platform (IMP) 
 <xref rid="b0625" ref-type="bibr">[125]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0630" ref-type="bibr">[126]</xref>, which allows the definition of proteins and RNA as large beads whose spatial arrangement can be subjected to minimization to satisfy user-defined restraints, and PyRy3D (

These restraints can come from knowledge of protein-binding regions along the viral genome, length, size, base-pairing, long-range interactions, electrostatic interactions between the capsid and viral genome, and volume restraints of the viral particle.
