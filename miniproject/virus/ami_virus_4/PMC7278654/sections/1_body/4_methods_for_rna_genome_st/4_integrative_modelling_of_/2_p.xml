<p id="p0160">RNA molecules do not exist in isolation inside cells or even inside virion particles, and can closely interact with proteins, e.g. in viral capsids or the ribosome. Such RNA-protein interactions have the potential to materially affect the structure of RNA, but are currently impossible to account for in free-energy-based structure prediction algorithms. The integrative modelling of RNA and protein-RNA interactions in the context of the whole viral nucleocapsid is still a new and challenging field 
 <xref rid="b0225" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Due to the flexible nature of RNA and the range of secondary and tertiary structures that RNAs can adopt, modelling the RNA genome is a non-trivial problem at the atomistic and even CG level. There have been recent efforts to develop tools to model the 3D structure of RNA and these methods range from atomistic representations, CG representations, and graph representations of RNA (i.e. helices as edges and loops as vertices); these have been reviewed extensively elsewhere
