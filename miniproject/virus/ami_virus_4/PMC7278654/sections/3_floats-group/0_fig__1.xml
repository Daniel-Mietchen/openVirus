   <bold>Multiscale protocol for modelling flavivirus envelope particle and simulation-based refinement against cryo-EM data. (A)</bold> Multiscale representation of dengue virus envelope complex. Protein is shown in surface format (bottom), while the zoomed snapshot (top) shows an E protein dimer in all-atom and CG resolution. Proteins are colored according to their radial distance from the virus center of mass. Lipids are colored in orange. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Schematic of the step-by-step protocol for embedding viral proteins in a lipid vesicle. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Alignment of MD simulation-averaged (blue) and experimental (orange/green) electron density maps.
