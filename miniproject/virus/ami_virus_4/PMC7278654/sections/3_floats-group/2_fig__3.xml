   <bold>Integrative modelling of maturation and ADE. (A)</bold> Cross-sections of the cryo-EM map of the immDENV:pr:Fab complex at pH 5.0 (shown in blue, top), the MD simulation generated density map of the immDENV:pr complex (shown in red, middle), and an alignment of both (bottom). Fab molecules were not present during simulations, hence the different appearance of the theoretical versus experimental maps in the outer part of the virion (bottom). 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The initial (left) and final (right) frames of TMD simulations to sample the transition pathway during maturation. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Representative snapshots during a TMD simulation transitioning between experimental states (immDENV:pr at pH 8.0 and 5.0), during which a pr fragment is spontaneously dislodged. In the target experimental structure (bottom right) the pr molecule on the pentamer (red) was not resolved. In (B) and (C), proteins are shown in surface representation (the elongated structures are E proteins, whilst the smaller, compact structures are the pr fragments, shown in orange), coloured according to the symmetry axis for red (pentamer), blue (trimer), and green (dimer) molecules, and lipids are shown in grey.
