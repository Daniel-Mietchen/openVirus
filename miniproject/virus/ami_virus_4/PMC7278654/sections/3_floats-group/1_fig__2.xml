   <bold>Multiscale simulation approach to study DENV “breathing”.</bold> On the left, the application of TMD in CG resolution is illustrated for the transition between the smooth DENV2 (typical of lower temperatures as found in mosquitos) and expanded DENV2 (typical of higher temperatures as found in the human host). The envelope is shown in surface representation, with lipids in grey, and proteins in yellow, red, or blue for the 2-, 3- and 5-fold vertices, respectively. On the right, an atomistic representation for an isolated E protein pentamer is shown, following-back mapping from the CG expanded virion structure. Protein is shown as blue cartoon, with lipids (PC:PE:PS in a 6:3:1 ratio) in CPK lines format.
