   <bold>Experimental sources of data to augment RNA structure prediction.</bold> The search space for the prediction of long RNA molecules is too large to obtain accurate predictions of structure using computational techniques alone. Incorporation of experimental data can increase the prediction accuracy dramatically. SHAPE data provides information on local structure by assessing the differential reactivity of the 2â€²-hydroxyl group in flexible versus constrained bases. SPLASH and other cross-linking techniques can provide information on the macro-organization of RNA by forming chimeric reads. Footprinting techniques can identify regions of RNA interacting with proteins by observing an increased resistance to digestion that correlate with increasing protein concentrations.
