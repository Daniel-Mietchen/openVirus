<p>With regards to NAFLD, EVs play a key role in the mechanism of liver damage and disease progression through the accumulation of lipotoxic lipids in hepatocytes. In turn, hepatocyte-derived extracellular vesicles (Hep-EVs)—which are discharged from damaged or stressed hepatic cells—exacerbate the progression of liver disease through the stimulation of non-parenchymal cells [

In mouse hepatocytes and human hepatocyte-derived carcinoma cell (HuH) models, palmitate and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) increase the release of EVs, demonstrating the conservation of toxic-lipids and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) within serum EVs. LPC-induced hepatic lipotoxicity is triggered by chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (CXCL10), which is enriched in hepatocyte-derived vesicles, and promotes macrophage chemostasis [
