<p>Various mechanisms contribute to the intrahepatic accumulation of fat. These include fluctuations in the level of fatty acids, increased lipogenesis, the secretion of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and suppressed clearance through β-oxidation [

 <xref rid="B52-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Minimal TAG levels may be hepato-protective, whereas prolonged lipid storage may escalate into inflammation and metabolic dysfunction [
 <xref rid="B53-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The accumulation of TAGs—which occur predominantly as macrovesicular lipid droplets in hepatocytes—is associated with liver injury or necroinflammation [

 <xref rid="B55-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The authors of another study found that homocysteine (Hcy) serum concentrations are significantly higher in NAFLD patients and are not influenced by chronic hepatitis [
 <xref rid="B56-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Furthermore, there is a positive correlation between plasma Hcy levels and the severity of steatosis; therefore, plasma Hcy levels could be used to discriminate between NASH and simple steatosis [
 <xref rid="B57-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Glutamine, glycine and serine which are precursors of antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH) were demonstrated to be decreases in the NAFLD patients compared to healthy individuals [
 <xref rid="B58-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Proline and hydroxyproline, the elements of collagen protein, also observed to be elevated in serum of patients with NAFLD compared to healthy individuals [
 <xref rid="B59-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Another study indicated that a rate-limiting enzyme Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) increased expression in NAFLD animal models [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-03732" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Indeed, Alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) elevated levels are associated with hepatic fibrosis in steatohepatitis patients. ALKP serum level are notably higher in NASH patients compared to those without NASH [
