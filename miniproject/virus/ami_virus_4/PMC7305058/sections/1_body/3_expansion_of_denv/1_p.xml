<p id="par0075">DENV re-emerged in the Americas during the 1980s and 1990s, with all four serotypes (DENV1-4) co-circulating and causing major epidemics in urban areas throughout the region [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the past two decades alone, dengue has expanded its range beyond subtropical and tropical regions of the globe, with autochthonous transmission and outbreaks occurring in parts of the United States, southern Europe, Uruguay, central Argentina, and Australia [
