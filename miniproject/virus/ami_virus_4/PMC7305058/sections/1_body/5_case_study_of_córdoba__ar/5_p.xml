<p id="par0115">Ongoing research in Córdoba continues to assess the role of climate in mosquito-borne disease emergence at a local level over a long-term period. Although meteorological anomolies have been associated with each of the dengue outbreaks in the last decade, it is difficult to find significant relationships between climate and dengue transmission in a period of initial emergence with four outbreaks across ten years. It is, however, possible with the available data to begin exploring the effects of climare variability and extreme climate events on arbovirus transmission, and, as we have done here, use the results of this exploration to inform future studies aimed at finding signficant links between climate and arbovirus transmission. Córdoba is among a short list of places where an actively emerging arbovirus can be carefully studied and may provide important insights to understanding the emergence of arboviruses globally.</p>
