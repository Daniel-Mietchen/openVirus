<p id="par0110">Following the first outbreak, a robust entomological surveillance study was initiated in 2009, allowing for monitoring of vector dynamics during the first 10 years of arbovirus emergence [

 </xref>]. A recent analysis of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from this surveillance study, dengue cases and local climate in Córdoba revealed significant increases in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> population size between 2010 and 2017. Oviposition and larval abundance were significantly positively correlated with mean temperature in the same month. Monthly anomalies in minimum temperature, calculated using a thirty-year base period (1987–2017), indicate that this period of dengue emergence has been characterized by warmer than average temperatures, with 60% of months (65 of 108) warmer than the long term average of a given month (

 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Outbreaks in 2015 and 2016 followed extreme precipitation events where monthly precipitation reached a peak of 8.90 and 11.13 mm, respectively, above monthly averages (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>a,c). Outbreaks in 2013 and 2016 followed closely after periods in which the monthly mean minimum temperature was as much as 3°C higher than monthly averages, and the 2009 and 2015 outbreaks occurred during periods in which the monthly mean temperature was 2–3°C higher than monthly averages (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>b,c). The current 2020 epidemic is an order of magnitude greater than outbreaks previously experienced. However, it is hypothesized that the epidemic has grown due to the increased time that people are spending in their homes, exposed to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, due to mandatory quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate and other non-climate co-variates that may have increased the likelihood of the current epidemic also need to be explored.
