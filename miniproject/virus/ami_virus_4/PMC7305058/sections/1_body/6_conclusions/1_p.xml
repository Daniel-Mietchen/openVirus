<p id="par0120">With concerns of continued global expansion of arboviruses driven by climate change, much effort has been placed on developing a better understanding of which regions of the world are at risk today and in the future. Many mathematical and statistical studies have investigated the potential for dengue and related arboviruses to emerge in naive populations as a result of global rises in surface temperatures [

Studies have emphasized the connection between climate and dengue and predicted the potential for expansion of both the vectors and the arboviruses into regions at the margins of transmission that are currently deemed unsuitable for arbovirus transmission [
