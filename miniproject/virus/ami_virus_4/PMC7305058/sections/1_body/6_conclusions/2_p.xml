<p id="par0125">Although multiple studies have been conducted at the global scale, there are a dearth of local longitudinal studies in zones of current and future arbovirus emergence. The recent work investigating the impacts of climate on dengue in Córdoba is among the few longitudinal studies that aim to connect dengue emergence with temperature and precipitation in a temperate region. While global analyses are informative, it is local analyses that underscore the evidence that climate and arbovirus transmission are closely linked. Studies aimed at detecting arbovirus emergence and investigating links between transmission and climate are vital to our ability to understand, predict, and respond to emergence events [

In a recent study, health sector stakeholders from the Caribbean have highlighted the urgent need for more local studies linking climate and arboviral disease—without this information, they are limited in their ability to take informed actions to adapt to a changing climate [
