<p id="par0065">Temperature plays an important role in the transmission of arboviruses, due to nonlinear effects on mosquito physiology, which affect rates of development and mortality in

 </xref>]. Understanding the effects of rainfall on arbovirus transmission is more complex and depends on the local social-ecological context. The 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito prefers to breed and lay eggs in containers that hold water, often in and around the home, where female mosquitoes blood feed on people. Increases in rainfall can increase vector populations due to an abundance of rain-filled containers around dwellings [
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, drought conditions and water scarcity can also increase vector populations if people begin to store water in containers around the home [
