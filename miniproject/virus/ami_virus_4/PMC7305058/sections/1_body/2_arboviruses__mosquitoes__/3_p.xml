<p id="par0070">Numerous studies have looked at the links among temperature, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations, and arbovirus transmission. Mechanistic models based on mosquito thermal biology suggest that DENV transmission occurs optimally at 28.1°C in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti,</italic> and 26.4°C in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [

 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito expansion and potential of regions to support arbovirus transmission under current climate conditions and predicted climate change scenarios [

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> will expand its range into higher elevations of the Andean foothills, estimated to affect 4215 km
 <sup>2</sup> of new territory and 12 000 people under the most extreme scenario of climate change by 2050 [

 </xref>]. Similar elevational range expansions are to be expected throughout the tropical Andes, increasing the population at risk of arboviral infections. Although arboviral disease burden is expected to worsen globally, some of these models suggest that transmission of arboviruses may decrease in tropical regions due to temperatures that become too warm to sustain mosquito populations [
