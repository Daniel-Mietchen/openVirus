Our call emerges on the one hand from evidence for the neuroinvasiveness of coronaviruses, immunopathology in animal models and observations made in previous SARS epidemics [

On the other hand, there is an emerging number of reports of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection with neurological manifestations and complications which already let us foresee the potential spectrum of disease which we will encounter in the further course of the pandemic.
