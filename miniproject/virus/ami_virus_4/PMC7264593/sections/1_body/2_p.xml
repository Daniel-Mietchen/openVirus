<p>The neuroinvasive potential of SARS‐CoV‐2 may play a role in the emergence of respiratory failure in COVID‐19 patients. Indeed, coronaviruses were shown to reach the brainstem via a synapse‐connected route from the lung and airways [

Thus, further characterization of the central cardiac and respiratory dysfunction is key to understanding the underlying mechanisms and identifying patients requiring ICU admission early. The respiratory centre is located in the medulla oblongata and the respiratory rhythm is modulated from various sites of the lower brainstem, including the pons [

Still, these reflexes are associated with a considerable risk of aerosol transmission and have to be performed with caution. It is unclear if examination of other brainstem reflexes such as corneal reflexes and pupillary reflexes are helpful for early detection of CNS involvement.
