<p>Neurologists should also keep in mind the potential risks for para‐infectious and post‐infectious disorders. Of note, there were cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, vasculopathy and Guillain–Barré syndrome in association with the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoV [

 <xref rid="ene14257-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>]. This needs to be considered in addition to the potential risk of cardioembolic stroke due to ACE 2 expression in the heart and subsequent cardiac dysfunction [
 <xref rid="ene14257-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>]. Moreover, the number of reported cases of COVID‐19 patients with intracerebral haemorrhage is increasing [
 <xref rid="ene14257-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>]. Whether this potential association is related to uncontrolled hypertension by interaction of SARS‐CoV‐2 with ACE 2 needs to be clarified. Hypertensive encephalopathy may therefore be an early sign of infection or may develop during the course. As many patients have a high body temperature and electrolyte disturbances, seizures and encephalopathy may develop. Moreover, susceptibility for more severe disease in patients with pre‐existing neurological conditions and on immunosuppressive therapy is another concern. Finally, we do not know how many ICU survivors of COVID‐19 will develop a post‐intensive‐care syndrome including crticial illness neuropathy and myopathy and suffer from long‐term sequelae which again emphasizes the role of neurologists in the care of COVID‐19 patients.
