<p id="p0040">Most human viruses are difficult to maintain 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> and their culturing requires trained staff and specialized equipment. Hence, infectivity assays are rarely performed on wastewater samples. To date, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has not been assessed, even though culturable viral particles have been detected in the faeces and urine of infected individuals [

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. These studies typically use Vero E6 cells to culture the SARS-CoV-2, and a similar approach may be suitable for the widespread screening of wastewater samples. Nonetheless, to investigate the temporal changes of viral infections in the community, molecular detection of viral genomes is sufficient.
