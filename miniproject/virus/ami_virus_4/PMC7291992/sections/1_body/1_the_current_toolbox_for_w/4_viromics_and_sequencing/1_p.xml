<p id="p0045">Viral metagenomics of wastewater has been widely used to monitor the prevalence of multiple pathogens and could be used as an early warning system for the detection of outbreaks of novel viral pathogens [

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, a high-throughput sequencing approach was used as an alternative to q(RT-)PCR to explore the diversity of enterovirus D, hepatitis A and hepatitis E viruses [
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and mastadenovirus [
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in wastewater to assess the viral strains circulating in local populations of France and Australia, respectively. It may also be useful to monitor other respiratory viruses (e.g. influenza) alongside SARS-CoV-2, given the uncertainties about whether coinfection affects the outcome of COVID-19 cases. Untargeted sequencing applied during outbreaks can monitor genetic drift that might affect the detection efficacy of amplification primers used in both sequencing studies and in qPCR-based diagnostic tests. For example, complete genomes of norovirus have been recovered from wastewater containing mismatches in primer regions which would not amplify in qRT-PCR assays [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. So far, three studies performed sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 (q)PCR products derived from wastewater to verify the presence and potential origin of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Untargeted sequencing has not been used to investigate SARS-CoV-2 strains in wastewater.
