<p id="p0035">Recently, digital PCRâ€“based approaches have also been used for viral detection in environmental samples [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These methods enable the absolute quantification of the targets and are less sensitive to inhibition, however more expensive than qPCR-based assays. Other emerging technologies, including isothermal amplification and biosensors, are also suitable for viral RNA/DNA detection and quantification in environmental samples, providing results within an hour [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Simple and affordable platforms (e.g. paper-based microfluidics devices) also have great potential for rapid, on-site viral detection in wastewater [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], however, these assays are not as sensitive yet as traditional, PCR-based methods and have not been rigorously tested in the field [
