<p id="p0030">The most widely used methods for quantification of DNA and RNA viruses in wastewater are quantitative PCR (qPCR) and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), respectively [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These methods detect a small segment of the viral genome, enabling rapid, sensitive and accurate strain-level detection of up to five targets in one assay [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Several qRT-PCR assays have been designed for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">∗24</xref>], which are suitable for wastewater monitoring [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; however, the performance of the different assays may vary. Substantial differences in viral detection rates were observed when different primer/probes were used for quantification. For example, the ‘N2’ assay did not detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater samples which were positive for the ‘N1’ and ‘N3’ genes [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; hence the use of multiple primer/probe sets is recommended. A limitation of qPCR-based approaches is that the reverse transcription and polymerase enzymes are often inhibited by organic co-contaminants, which are concentrated and extracted together with the targets.
