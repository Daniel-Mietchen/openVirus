<p id="p0025">For the sensitive detection of viruses in wastewater, samples are often concentrated before quantification. Many different approaches are commonly used, as recently reviewed [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, wastewater samples are often centrifuged or filtered to eliminate debris, followed by electronegative membrane filtration [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], ultrafiltration [

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or polyethylene glycol precipitation [

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], aluminium flocculation [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or ultracentrifugation [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] enabling 20x-800x concentration. Sludge samples were either subject to RNA extraction directly [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], or viruses were eluted and PEG precipitated from the matrix [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Most concentration methods are inexpensive and easy to set-up, however, they may be time-consuming and difficult to perform with high sample throughput, especially when high turbidity samples are processed. The main disadvantage of these methods is the co-concentration of organic compounds (e.g. humic substances), which often interfere with downstream virus detection or

 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], suggesting 3–50% viral recoveries (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). Therefore, appropriate process controls, for example, viruses of the same family or genus should be added to the sample to estimate viral recoveries [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Alternatively, the concentration of a viral indicator, which is present in wastewater at high concentrations (e.g. gut-associated phages), can be compared between unprocessed and processed samples to assess concentration efficiency [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].
