<p id="p0060">Although the global clinical surveillance for COVID-19 has been established, there are a number of cases of asymptomatic individuals and those with very mild symptoms would not be identified and contacts not traced potentially missing an estimated 80% of actual transmission [

Wastewater-based epidemiology may be useful to identify emerging and re-emerging pathogens in a community and may serve as an early warning system, which would be useful for public health mitigation [

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. However, translating the viral titres from wastewater into the actual number of cases within a community is highly challenging, if not impossible. This type of calculation relies on many assumptions, which still remain poorly quantified (e.g. the amount and dynamics of viral shedding in faeces, viral persistence in the sewer network, variation in wastewater flow due to climate, etc). In addition, while suited to large urban communities (i.e. populations &gt;10,000), the approach is less well suited from an economic and logistical perspective to disparate rural communities which may have hundreds of small water treatment facilities.
