<p id="p0020">Municipal wastewater harbours a great variety of pathogenic viruses [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Extensive research has been undertaken on the persistence of human enteric viruses (e.g. noroviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, rotaviruses, hepatitis A/E viruses), transmitted via the faecal-oral route, in wastewater and in the aquatic environment [

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Temporal changes in viral concentrations in wastewater can therefore indicate the presence or absence of a virus, related outbreaks in the population, and their effect on public health. Hence, domestic wastewater monitoring may be an important tool to assess and mitigate viral outbreaks in a community. In this review, we aim to critically assess the recent efforts on using wastewater surveillance to represent public health, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2 surveillance.
