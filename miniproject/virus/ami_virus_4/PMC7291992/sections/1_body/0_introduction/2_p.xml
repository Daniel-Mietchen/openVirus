<p id="p0015">Owing to the often high infectivity and rapid transmission of viruses, individual screening in clinical settings is often challenging. In addition, cases with mild or no symptoms are often overlooked, and hence epidemiological models and assessments of disease prevalence may be inaccurate. There is therefore a greater need to understand the spread of viral diseases at a community level which would provide information for the timely mitigation of outbreaks.</p>
