<p id="p0055">Five studies have investigated viral titres in treated wastewater and three of those have found SARS-CoV-2 RNA in effluent with concentrations up to 10

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Whether this poses a major risk to the wider environment remains unclear. However, recent reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can also infect and replicate in semiaquatic secondary animal vectors such as mink [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This offers the potential for animals close to wastewater outlets to readily come into contact with SARS-CoV-2 from which it would likely become endemic in the secondary host. This is most likely to occur from the discharge of untreated sewage or from poorly treated wastewater close to watercourses (e.g. septic tanks). Considering the high concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater (up to 10
 <sup>7</sup> genome copies/l) [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], some virus particles may be intact and infectious in sewage and hence viral infectivity in treated and untreated wastewater should be investigated. However, even if sewage contains infectious viruses, the likelihood of humans contracting SARS-CoV-2 from bathing waters or shellfish is likely to be extremely low, given the low stability of the virus in water and the large dilution of wastewater in inland waterbodies or coastal regions.
