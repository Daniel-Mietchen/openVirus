<p id="p0050">Most studies on virus surveillance in wastewater have focused on the prevalence of human enteric viruses in wastewater and in wastewater-polluted environments. These studies have indicated good correlation between local viral outbreaks and high quantities of norovirus [

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and enterovirus D68 [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in sewage. Although the presence of respiratory viruses in wastewater has arguably received less attention, several countries have detected SARS-CoV-2 in sewage (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref>). No SARS-CoV-2 was reported in wastewater before the first cases [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; however, there is some indication that SARS-CoV-2 was present in wastewater at Amersfoort, the Netherlands days before the first cases were reported [
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. When the temporal changes in SARS-CoV-2 titres were assessed, viral concentrations showed good correlations with the number of COVID-19 cases in the community [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Consequently, wastewater-based epidemiology may find future application as an early warning system for virus outbreaks, to monitor the progression of viral outbreaks, and in the provision of viral genomic data at the population scale.
