<p id="p0070">Current data on SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses suggest that wastewater-based epidemiology is a viable addition to the assessment and mitigation of viral outbreaks. Easy and straightforward methods are available for the concentration of wastewater samples for viral detection, however, the use of process controls (e.g. spiking the sample with an animal virus with structure similar to the target pathogen before concentration) is recommended. The widely used q(RT-)PCR approach enables rapid and strain level RNA/DNA quantification, however, the primers and probes should be chosen carefully. Although the infectivity state of the target virus is not relevant for epidemiological surveillance, the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage, during wastewater treatment and in the aquatic environment should be investigated to assess health risks. Targeted and untargeted sequencing of wastewater viruses has the potential to track the spread of specific sequence variants and identify mutations that could affect detection in clinical settings.</p>
