<p>The latest advice (14 April) from the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) is that there is insufficient evidence to establish a link between NSAIDs/ibuprofen and susceptibility to COVID‐19 or worsening of symptoms, and it says patients can take either paracetamol or ibuprofen when self‐medicating for symptoms of COVID‐19. However, additional risks are plausible, and a rapid evidence summary from NICE rounds up all the evidence on this topic to date (ES23).
