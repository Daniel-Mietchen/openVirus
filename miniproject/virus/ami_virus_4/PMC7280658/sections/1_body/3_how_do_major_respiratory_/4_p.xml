<p>The COVID‐19 pandemic has often been compared with global influenza outbreaks in an attempt to put this new threat in an historical context. According to WHO data, seasonal flu causes three to five million cases of severe illness and 290,000–650,000 deaths from respiratory disease each year.
 <sup>17</sup> H1N1, the virus that caused the swine flu pandemic of 2009/10, infected 11–21% of the global population (750 million – 1.4 billion people) and caused around 280,000 deaths from respiratory disease and cardiovascular disorders; about two thirds of those deaths occurred in people aged 18–64 years.
 <sup>18,19</sup> As of 12 May, the number of deaths attributed to COVID‐19 worldwide has already surpassed 280,000.
