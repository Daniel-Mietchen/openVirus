<p>A trial claiming to show efficacy with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin received wide coverage in the lay media.

 </xref> Both included hospitalised patients with pneumonia and confirmed COVID‐19. In the Chinese study, remdesivir did not significantly reduce time to clinical improvement, though there was a trend towards faster improvement in patients with a symptom duration of 10 days or less. By contrast, the ACTT study suggested that treatment with remdesivir was associated with a more rapid recovery compared with placebo (median time to recovery 11 
 <italic>vs</italic> 15 days, p&lt;0.001), and there was a trend towards improved mortality (8.0 
 <italic>vs</italic> 11.6%; p=0.059). More data is needed to provide a clearer picture on its benefits.
