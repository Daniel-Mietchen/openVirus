 </xref> There is uncertainty about which is the optimal target antigen on SARS‐CoV‐2. Experience with vaccines against SARS and MERS infections revealed a risk of exacerbating lung disease, therefore testing in animal models is essential. And the duration of immunity and effectiveness of single‐dose vaccines is unknown. To this can be added the challenge of upscaling production to meet the urgent global demand. Given the seriousness of the challenge posed by COVID‐19, there may be calls to waive some of the usual requirements for evidence of safety to accelerate access to a vaccine. For example, an experimental vaccine was used to control an outbreak of Ebola virus disease in Guinea in 2015.
