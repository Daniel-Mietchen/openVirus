<p>The search for drugs and vaccines to treat or prevent COVID‐19 began quickly but, with many studies carried out independently in small numbers of people, there is a risk that the trials will lack statistical rigour. WHO has launched a non‐blinded clinical trial (SOLIDARITY) to evaluate four candidate treatments (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir/interferon beta‐1a, and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine) 
 <italic>versus</italic> standard of care in 18 countries worldwide. France is co‐ordinating the Discovery trial to compare the same drugs with standard care in 3200 patients in Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the UK. This will be randomised but non‐blinded and will assess outcomes at 15 days.
