<p>These vaccines are being developed using a diverse range of delivery platforms, including DNA and RNA, self‐amplifying RNA, virus‐like particle, peptide, viral vector, recombinant protein, live attenuated virus and inactivated virus. RNA and DNA delivery platforms offer rapid development of a vaccine from sequencing the virus to beginning a clinical trial. In the case of one vaccine now in trials, the interval between sequencing the virus genome and beginning the clinical trial was only 10 weeks. Others, including the Oxford Vaccine Centre's ChAdOx1nCoV‐19 vaccine, for which phase 1 clinical trials are now underway in the UK, use a non‐replicating viral vector such as an adenovirus.</p>
