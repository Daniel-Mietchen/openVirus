<p>The idea that herd immunity might protect the population from SARS‐CoV‐2 has proved controversial, largely because it is a concept normally applied to immunisation programmes rather than a pandemic with a high mortality rate. For herd immunity to be effective in the UK, the proportion of the population with immunity must exceed the threshold of about 65%.

 </xref> Achieving that level by national exposure to the virus would be associated with an unacceptable number of deaths. However, the extent to which lockdown measures can ultimately prevent rather than delay infection is uncertain, and it is unknown how the death rate would compare with the final mortality after the pandemic has run its course.
