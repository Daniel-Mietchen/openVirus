<p>The preferred way to build herd immunity is through vaccination. It is currently uncertain when a vaccine will be available to the general population; it is likely that frontline health workers would be the first to receive it, then high‐risk individuals. How quickly production can be scaled up to meet international demand is another unknown. There has been some anxiety in the media that infection may not confer lasting protection against SARS‐CoV‐2. However, evidence from an animal study
