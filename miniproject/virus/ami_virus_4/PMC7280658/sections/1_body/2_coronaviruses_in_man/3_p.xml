 </xref> The outbreak was largely over by July, and the last cases were reported in China in April 2004. This virus was responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a flu‐like illness, though diarrhoea was common. It could progress to pneumonia and respiratory failure in two weeks and 25% of people infected required intensive care. A total of 8098 cases and 774 deaths were notified.

 </xref> SARS‐CoV appears to have originated in horseshoe bats and possibly transmitted to humans via palm civet cats, traded in China for their meat.
