<p>SARS‐CoV‐2 more closely resembles the bat wild virus than it does either SARS‐CoV or MERS‐CoV, strongly suggesting that it is a novel coronavirus in humans.

 </xref> The coronavirus spike protein – the structure that binds the virus to the target receptor and mediates cell entry – requires six amino acids: SARS‐CoV‐2 shares only one of these with SARS‐CoV. This spike protein confers high affinity for angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the host receptor in humans (and many other species, including pigs, primates and cats).

 </xref> The second major structural difference from SARS‐CoV is a unique subunit of the spike protein that determines viral infectivity and host range. It may have been a mutation of this feature during human infection that led to the rapid spread of COVID‐19 in humans. There is currently no evidence that any of the mutations identified since SARS‐CoV‐2 virus emerged in humans have altered the key characteristics of COVID‐19.
