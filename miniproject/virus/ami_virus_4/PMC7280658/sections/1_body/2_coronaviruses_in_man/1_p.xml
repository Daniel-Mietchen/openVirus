 </xref> There is some evidence that the intermediate vector may have been pangolin, a type of nocturnal anteater imported illegally for its flesh. This animal carries a coronavirus that is very similar to SARS‐CoV‐2 but differs in a crucial region that determines viral infectivity and host range. It is therefore possible that the virus passed into humans and then, through adaptation as it infected more people, mutated to acquire the characteristics that made it spread so quickly.
