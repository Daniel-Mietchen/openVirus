 </xref> Like SARS, MERS causes a flu‐like illness with symptoms ranging from mild (with about one‐quarter of people also having diarrhoea) to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock and multiorgan failure. MERS‐CoV is believed to have reached humans via dromedary camels, which appear to be a reservoir in several Middle East states. The original source species is not known, but bats are the most likely.
