<p>COVID‐19 presents an enormous global challenge that has required levels of intervention on a scale that is unprecedented. In one sense, it is a new threat: SARS‐CoV‐2 emerged as a novel virus to which humans had no immunity, it spreads exceptionally quickly, carries a high mortality and can overwhelm the capacity of health services to treat the most seriously ill. But it is not incomparable: similarities with other coronaviruses and recent epidemics mean that infection control measures are well‐rehearsed and existing technologies can be deployed to speed the development of new vaccines and treatments.</p>
