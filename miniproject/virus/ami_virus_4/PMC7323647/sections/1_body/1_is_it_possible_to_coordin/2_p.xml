<p id="par0020">In a world characterised by increasing population density, human mobility and climate change, emerging infectious diseases are a real and growing threat for world health safety. Epidemic diseases affect everybody and do not respect frontiers. The costs of emerging infectious diseases are enormous in human as well as in economic terms. Vaccines are one of the most powerful tools in the fight against epidemics. Notwithstanding this, historically the development of vaccines has involved work that is risky, time-consuming and expensive. It is especially challenging to plan for the emergence of infectious diseases, given that there is only limited market potential for vaccines against them —which is not currently the case— and it is difficult to test them. A better system is necessary to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. The CEPI has moved quickly and urgently to coordinate with global medical authorities and its members to swiftly develop candidate vaccines against the disease. Its approach includes overcoming critical points between the many organisations involved in research and development, the financing of new and innovative technological platforms which have the potential to quickly accelerate the development and manufacture of vaccines against previously unknown pathogens, and to support and coordinate activities to improve the collective response to epidemics. COVID-19 has led to these concepts being put into practice and tested.</p>
