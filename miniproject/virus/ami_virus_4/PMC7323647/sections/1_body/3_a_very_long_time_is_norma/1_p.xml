<p id="par0080">The need to quickly develop a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 arose at a time when basic knowledge of the genome and structural biology may give rise to a new era in vaccine development. In the last decade the scientific community and vaccine industry have been asked to respond urgently to epidemics of H1N1 influenza, Ebola, Zika and now SARS-CoV-2. Although monovalent H1N1 influenza vaccine was not available before the pandemic peaked in the northern hemisphere, it was produced quite quickly. This was mainly because influenza vaccine technology was already quite well developed, and the regulatory bodies had already established the procedure for authorising new strains. The pandemic strain was added to the seasonal vaccines. Other cases, such as the SARS and Zika epidemics, finished before their corresponding vaccines had been developed, leaving the manufacturers with financial losses and delaying other vaccine development programs.</p>
