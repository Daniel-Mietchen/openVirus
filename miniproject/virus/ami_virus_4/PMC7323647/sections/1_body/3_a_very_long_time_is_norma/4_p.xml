<p id="par0125">This whole process is both long and costly; the majority of products which commence the preclinical phase are rejected in the following phases, and only a few are commercialised. Due to the cost and high failure rate, developers usually follow a lineal sequence of steps with multiple pauses for data analysis and manufacturing process checks. A new pandemic paradigm is needed for rapid vaccine development, starting quickly and with many of its steps executed simultaneously prior to the confirmation of the success of the previous step, which leads to a high level of financial risk. For example, before testing a vaccine in human beings, it is always necessary to have abundant information from preclinical experimentation in animals. It is now possible to commence trials in phase I in humans while the package of preclinical experimentation is still taking place in animals. This has made it possible to start phase I trials in healthy adults for several candidate products, even though complete preclinical data were not available.</p>
