<p id="par0120">Clinical development is a three-phase process. During phase I small groups of people are given the test vaccine. Phase II of the clinical study is more expansive and the vaccine is administered to individuals with certain characteristics (such as their age and physical health) which are similar to those of the target group for the new vaccine. In phase III the vaccine is administered to thousands of people, testing its efficacy and safety. Many vaccines are subjected to formal phase IV studies (post-commercialisation), after they have been approved and authorised.</p>
