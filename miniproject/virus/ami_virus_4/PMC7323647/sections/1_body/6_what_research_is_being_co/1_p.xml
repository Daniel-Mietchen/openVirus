<p id="par0160">The Centro Nacional de Biotecnología (CNB) of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) is running two projects. Sonia Zúñiga, of the team headed by Luis Enjuanes and Isabel Sola, is developing a complete virus vaccine. This vaccine may offer a broader response than subunit vaccines. Another CSIC team, headed by the scientist Mariano Esteban, is working on a subunit vaccine and aims to create modified vaccinia virus vectors that contain protein S of the SARS-CoV-2 surface.</p>
