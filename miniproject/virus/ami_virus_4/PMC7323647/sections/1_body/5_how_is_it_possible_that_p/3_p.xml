<p id="par0155">Multiple platforms are under development. Those with the greatest potential for swift development include the DNA and RNA-based platforms, followed by those developing recombinant subunit vaccines. RNA and DNA vaccines can be made quickly because they require neither culture nor fermentation, as they use synthetic processes. The experience of developers and regulators with these personal oncological vaccine platforms may facilitate testing and the prompt availability of vaccines.</p>
