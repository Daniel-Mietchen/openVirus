<p id="par0145">Influenza has given us scientific experience regarding the possibility of unforeseen influenza pandemics appearing. Thanks to this, pharmaceutical companies which develop vaccines have worked intensely and with different vaccine production lines to anticipate these possible situations. The same has occurred with other potentially pandemic viruses. Pharmaceutical companies have worked unceasingly with molecules that are vaccine candidates against these viruses. Vaccine technology too has evolved significantly in candidate molecule selection techniques as well as production culture and synthesis, together with release-administration systems.</p>
