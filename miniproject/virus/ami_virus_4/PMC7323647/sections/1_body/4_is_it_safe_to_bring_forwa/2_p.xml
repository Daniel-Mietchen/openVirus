<p id="par0135">A specific concern for this vaccine is the possibility of pulmonary disease exacerbation occurring in any of the vaccinated individuals due to an anomalous immune response. This adverse effect may be associated with the antibody response, which the virus may take advantage of to aid infection, or Th2 lymphocyte-mediated allergic inflammation. Decades previously, the vaccines developed against another coronavirus, infectious feline peritonitis, increased the risk that cats would develop the disease caused by the virus. Similar phenomena have been observed in studies in animals for other viruses, including the coronavirus that causes SARS; in this case worrying immune responses were observed in ferrets and monkeys, but not in mice. Additionally, some viral protein fragments may cause stronger or less risky immune responses than others, and it makes sense to learn this in animal studies before testing them in humans.</p>
