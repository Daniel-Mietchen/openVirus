<p id="par0130">If we take the first vaccine to be subjected to clinical research as an example, and based on experience with vaccines for oncology, it can be said that although the ARNm-based platform is safe in humans, the same is not necessarily true of this COVID-19 vaccine. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which works with Moderna in developing the vaccine, argues that the risk of delaying the progress of vaccines is far higher than the risk of causing disease in healthy volunteers. However, there is no unanimous agreement on this; Shibo Jiang, who has worked developing vaccines and treatments for coronavirus since 2003, states that “we have to urgently develop measure to fight the new coronavirus, but safety is always the first consideration”. He believes that standard protocols are essential to protect health.</p>
