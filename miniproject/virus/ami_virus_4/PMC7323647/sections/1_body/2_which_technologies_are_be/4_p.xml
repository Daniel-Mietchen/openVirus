<p id="par0065">The most surprising characteristic of all of the COVID-19 vaccines under development is the wide range of technological platforms that are under evaluation. Some of these have not been authorised yet by the regulatory bodies, including the nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) vaccines and the viral vector vaccines (replicants and non-replicants). More specifically, none of the projects which are now in clinical phase uses an authorised platform for the manufacture of preventive vaccines. Nevertheless, experience in fields such as oncology encourages developers to take advantage of the opportunities offered by these next generation, to achieve faster development and greater manufacturing capacity. On the other hand, half of the preclinical phase candidates use conventional technologies (recombinant proteins, attenuated live virus or inactivated virus and virus-like particles [VLP]). Those which use subunits of recombinant proteins stand out in first place, more specifically purified recombinant protein S (obtained by genetic engineering), as complete protein, a fragment or as fusion protein.</p>
