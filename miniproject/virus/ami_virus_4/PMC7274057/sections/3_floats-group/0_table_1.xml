   <sup>a</sup>Adapted from the American College of Surgeons, “Local Resumption of Elective Surgery Guidance” (2020 Apr 17) and Royal College of Surgeons, “Updated intercollegiate general surgery guidance on COVID-19” (2020 May 30). Decisions regarding elective surgery may be altered based on COVID-19 burden at respective institutions, availability of hospital resources (ICU beds, ventilators, clinicians, PPE), and the COVID-19 trajectory within the hospital
