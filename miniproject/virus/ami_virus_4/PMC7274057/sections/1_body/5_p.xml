<p>At the advent of resuming elective surgeries, it remains a judicious practice to prioritize the surgical care of the most vulnerable populations, such as cancer patients. The American College of Surgeons has recommended use of the Elective Surgery Acuity Scale, which aids the surgical decision-making process of triaging non-emergency operations. On this scale, most cancers in highly symptomatic patients are classified with the highest acuity. A recent multi-center study including 105 cancer patients and 536 age-matched non-cancer patients confirmed with COVID-19 found higher risks for severe outcomes among infected cancer patients; notably, patients undergoing cancer surgery also have higher death rates and a greater chance of developing critical symptoms secondary to COVID-19 [
