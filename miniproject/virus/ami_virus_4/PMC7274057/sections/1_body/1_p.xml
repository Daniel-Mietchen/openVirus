<p>An acute respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly spread worldwide, necessitating proactive management decisions from clinicians and centers in an effort to mitigate the risk of infection. In order to focus local resources toward both urgent and non-urgent medical treatment of the overwhelming number of infected patients, while supporting the safety of patients and healthcare staff, elective surgeries have largely been postponed or cancelled. While surgical care can be safely deferred in patients with non-life-threatening conditions, this remains an issue for patients with an illness that significantly impacts quality of life who would otherwise benefit from an elective or semi-elective procedure. Although dependent on location, global rates of COVID-19 are expected to reach their peak within the next few weeks, while the infection is expected to stay in the community for the foreseeable future. Amid strong efforts to control disease spread, and with no predictable end in sight, there is an emphasis on safely while preparing for the resumption of elective operations to meet the surgical needs of more patients. This focus begs several questions, such as, when is it appropriate to return to aÂ normal-capacity surgical practice? Are there potential risks with endoscopy or laparoscopy? What challenges exist with preventive measures, and what can be done to prioritize vulnerable patients?</p>
