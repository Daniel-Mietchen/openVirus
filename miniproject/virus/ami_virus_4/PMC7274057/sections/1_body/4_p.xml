<p>Depending on local diagnostic testing policies, rapid testing for SARS-CoV‑2 infection through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) may be considered for all patients undergoing planned surgery. Nevertheless, there have unfortunately been high false-negative rates reported with RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV‑2 in hospitalized patients clinically diagnosed with COVID-19 [

For these reasons, and in the absence of credible, evidence-based guidelines supporting the contrary, it remains prudent for all surgical staff to wear additional PPE during elective operations, whether open, laparoscopic, or robotic. Wearing additional PPE does not come without challenges to the surgeon, however, as it may restrict mobility, limit peripheral vision, and with headgear, make it challenging to operate amongst other staff, particularly in the deep abdomen. There are logistical delays that are often forgotten when utilizing additional PPE and infection-control measures. When elective surgeries are reinstated, it may be difficult to sustain a reliable supply chain with adequate inventory of PPE for both airborne and droplet/contact precautions. Operating room staff must also be trained in appropriate donning and doffing, if not done so already, while there are additional technical and administrative measures required to set-up a negative-pressure operating room. These immoderate delays may require significant pre-planning and coordination among all surgical staff. It remains to be determined how these infection-control measures, albeit contributing to the safety of the patient and staff, impact surgical care when elective surgeries are again performed.
