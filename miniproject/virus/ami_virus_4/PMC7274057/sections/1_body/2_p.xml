<p>The strategies to prevent viral transmission have been well established in the literature and mainstream media: proper hygiene, self-isolation, and social distancing are paramount. However, these strategies do not reduce the absolute number of infections, they merely lengthen the time it takes for individuals to contract the infection. Although general consensus suggests that a peak will soon be reached for the COVID-19 pandemic, there are major concerns regarding the threat of a viral resurgence if infection-control measures are not meticulously preserved, or if a vaccine is not developed and widely distributed. We can rely on the lessons we have learned in facing the previous severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in February 2003. In Toronto, Canada, many perceived the SARS outbreak to be over in May 2003, and hospitals relaxed their infection-control precautions. These changes preceded a surge of respiratory illnesses, particularly among hospital employees [

The decision of when to return to full capacity will certainly differ based on where an institution is situated relative to the curve of the disease as well as the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), intensive care unit beds, respirators, and personnel. The goal to optimally provide safe and high-quality surgical care has not wavered, but in resuming elective surgery, it remains vitally important to be considerate of its risks. The American College of Surgeons has since outlined 10 issues to be addressed locally before reinstituting elective surgery (Table

Addressing these issues may guide individual timelines of deciding when it is appropriate to return to full capacity.
