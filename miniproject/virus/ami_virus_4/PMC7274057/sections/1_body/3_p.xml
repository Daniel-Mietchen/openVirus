<p>Although leading surgical societies have guided surgeons in terms of appropriate surgical practice amid the ongoing viral pandemic, certain questions remain, particularly pertaining to the safety of performing minimally invasive surgery in the setting of COVID-19. Concerns have risen from theories that the environment created in a pneumoperitoneum for laparoscopy creates a relatively stagnant volume of gas in the abdominal cavity, which may allow for a concentrated aerosolization of the virus. These concerns have persisted after SARS-CoV‑2 viral RNA was identified in the stool of infected patients, with evidence that the virus may be found in the gastrointestinal mucosa [

As it pertains to surgical interventions, it would seem that the benefit of performing laparoscopy during the pandemic would outweigh any supposed risk, as minimally invasive surgery would (1) contribute to reduced lengths of stay and faster recovery times, (2) minimize the need for medical treatments, and (3) maximize availability of beds and other crucial resources. Vigneswaran et al. [

Laparoscopy seems to convey a negligible risk, but nonetheless, all pneumoperitoneum should be safely evacuated from the port attached to a filtration device before closure, trocar removal, specimen extraction, or conversion to open surgery [
