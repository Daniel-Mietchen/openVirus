<p id="p0155">Over the past few years, molecular diagnostics methods have been greatly improved [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several reports have been published on detection methods focusing on a single canine diarrhea-related disease [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Here, a multiplex 
 <italic>Taq</italic>man probe-based real-time PCR method was developed for the first time and optimized to better monitor CPV, CAstV, CaKoV, and CCoV epidemiology. The limitation of this method can reach to 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/μL, while multiplex RT-PCR shows no noticeable advantage in terms of sensitivity [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A multiplex RT-PCR assay for CPV, CCoV and CAV, in which the detection limit of the method was 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> viral copies/μL [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and a multiplex PCR detection developed for canine respiratory and enteric diseases. The limit of this method was also 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/μL [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, based on the analysis of 82 clinical samples, we found this method is able to detect positive samples previously considered negative by RT-PCR. Especially in the case of co-infection, it was more sensitive than the results of RT-PCR tests, which can effectively detect the virus epidemic situation. Moreover, CPV was found to be the most prevalent virus in diarrhea samples in Chinese canines, as previously shown [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The inaccuracy of RT-PCR usually leads to identity confirmation via sequencing which normally results in undetermined sequences. Real-time PCR can effectively prevent false positives by digitizing the results [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This method can be used in the early diagnosis of viral infection at a low titer. Thus, our detection method has a powerful monitoring ability, so as to achieve a rapid cure for canines.
