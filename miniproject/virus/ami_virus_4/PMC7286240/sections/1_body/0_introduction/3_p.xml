<p id="p0030">Until now, it is common laboratory practice the use of conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for single or multiplex detection. RT-PCR is a powerful genetic analysis method. However, its limitations are low efficiency and the requirement of sufficient concentration of virus [
