<p id="p0025">Viral canine diarrhea is usually highly contagious, and even more likely to cause mixed infections, leading to fatal diarrhea [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The long treatment cycle and slow healing of puppies can cause mental injury to pet owners. Canine Parvovirus (CPV), Canine Coronavirus (CCoV), Canine Astrovirus (CAstV), Canine Kobuviruses (CaKoV), Rotavirus and Canine Adenovirus (CAV) are causative agents of diarrhea. With the exception of CAstV and CaKoV, the research of detection method for other diarrheal viruses are common [

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. CPV, one of the most serious causes of diarrhea, can have a mortality rate of 70% in puppies and lead to hemorrhagic enteritis [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] of rapid transmission [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CCoV mainly causes gastroenteritis and clinical signs include vomit and mild to severe diarrhea [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], with the high positivity rate next to CPV [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. CAstV was first discovered in 1980 [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and a series of documents successively confirmed the existence of this pathogen in diarrheal feces by molecular biology, consist of electron microscopy, RT-PCR and then sequencing identification [
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. CaKoV was first detected in canines with acute gastroenteritis in the United States [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In China, there are only two recent reports on CaKoV and a handful of reports have discussed the prevalence of CAstV [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>]. Thus, CAstV and CaKoV are controversial in terms of prevalence and clinical symptoms, and supported by few relevant studies which was especially needed to monitor virus in real time. Differential diagnosis must combine specific antigen detection assays. However, there is no such method for the simultaneous and rapid identification of CPV, CCoV, CaKoV, and CAstV.
