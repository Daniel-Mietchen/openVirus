<p id="p0100">The RT-PCR was incubated in a PCR machine (Eppendorf, Germany) with a 20 μL reaction system, including, 10 μL Taq master mix; 1 μL Forward and Reverse primer; 7 μL ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O; 1 μL template. The cycling conditions included denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Fragments were observed in a 1.5% agarose gel.
