<p id="p0075">Uniplex and multiplex real-time PCR were carried out in a 20 μL reaction, consisting of 10 μL qPCR probe master mix (Vazyme, China); 0.4 μL primer pair and 0.1 μL probe added with corresponding target fragment; 1.5 μL target standard plasmid, and the rest were supplemented with ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O. In the multiplex real-time PCR reactions, the four primer pairs, probes, and the template of the four mixed standard plasmids were added. The cycling conditions were the same as described above.
