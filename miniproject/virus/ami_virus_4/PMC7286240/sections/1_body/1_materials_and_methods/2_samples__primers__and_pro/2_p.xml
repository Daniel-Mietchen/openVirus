<p id="p0040">Positive samples were screened for CPV [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], CCoV, CAstV [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], CaKoV [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and other related viruses, including Canine distemper virus (CDV) [
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], Torque teno canis virus (TTCV) [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and Canine influenza virus (H3N2 CIV), as previously verified by RT-PCR. CCoV was detected by RT-PCR using the following primers designed by 
 <italic>N</italic> gene: Forward; 5′- GGTTTTGAACACGTTGTATTTGGAGA-3′, and Reverse; 5′-ACCYTTCCTTAGTAATCCAACRACCA-3’. In addition, H3N2 CIV was detected by RT-PCR using the following primers designed by 
 <italic>M</italic> gene: Forward; 5′- TTCTAACCGAGGTCGAAAC-3′, and Reverse; 5′- AAGCGTCTACGCTGCAGTCC-3’. The corresponding templates were preserved at −80 °C for long-term storage.
