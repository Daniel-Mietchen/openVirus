<p id="p0105">Figure data was generated using the LightCyclerÂ® 96 SW 1.1 software and Graphpad prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The mean value is the quantity indicating the central tendency of the data sets. Standard deviation (SD) refers to a standard that measures the degree of dispersion of data distribution and is used to measure the degree to which the data value deviates from the arithmetic mean. The CV (Coefficient of variation), is the ratio of standard deviation to the average. The SE (standard error) refers to the error between the sample rate and the overall rate due to sampling. All the above statistics were conducted using Microsoft Excel 2007 (Microsoft, USA).</p>
