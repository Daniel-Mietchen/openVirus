<p id="p0070">Real time PCR procedure was carried out on a LightCycler96 machine (Roche, Shanghai). The annealing temperature included 54 °C, 56 °C, 58 °C, and 60 °C using 10
 <sup>7</sup> copies/μL standard plasmid were used in multiple procedure and selected the optimal annealing temperature according to the amplification efficiency. The cycling parameters were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 56 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. Acquisition of fluorescence signals was recorded during the annealing-extension steps and analyzed using the LightCycler® 96 SW 1.1 software. Primers and probes concentrations for optimization raged from 0.05 to 0.2 μM and 0.025 to 0.1 μM, respectively. The optimal primers and probes were selected based on amplification efficiency determined by the Cq (Cycle of quantification) value and the fluorescence intensity.
