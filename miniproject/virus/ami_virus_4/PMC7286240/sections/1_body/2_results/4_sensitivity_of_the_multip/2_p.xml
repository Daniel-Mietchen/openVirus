<p id="p0125">To identify the detection limits, reactions were prepared containing 10
 <sup>3</sup> to 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μL in triplicate. Since we defined Cq values ≥ 35 as the critical point of negative, the reliable detection limit was 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/μL (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). However, the average Cq value for CaKoV at 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μL was less than 35, there were two values greater than 35 among the three replicates. Therefore, we used a conservative approach and defined that the lowest detectable concentration of the virus in this experiment was 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/μL. Subsequent experiments also relies on these criteria.
