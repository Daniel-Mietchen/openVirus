<p id="p0110">The annealing temperature optimization was carried out over a range including 54 °C, 56 °C, 58 °C, and 60 °C. The optimal efficiency was at 56 °C (data not shown). The optimal reaction conditions for the different concentrations of primers and probes is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> . The highest amplification curve was achieved in all four fluorescence channels along with a low Cq value for concentrations of 0.2 μM of primer and 0.05 μM of probe.
