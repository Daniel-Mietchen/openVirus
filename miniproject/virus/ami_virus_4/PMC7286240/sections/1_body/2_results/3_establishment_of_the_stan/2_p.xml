<p id="p0120">The standard curves for the four viruses were prepared by 10-fold serial dilution of standard plasmids ranging from 10
 <sup>7</sup> to 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μL as templates. The corresponding slope of the equation, correlation coefficient (R
 <sup>2</sup>), and amplification efficiency (E) were as follows: −3.1611, 1.00, and 107% for CPV; −3.2261, 1.00, and 104% for CCoV; −3.3264, 1.00, and 100% for CaKoV; and −3.4054, 1.00, and 97% for CAstV (
