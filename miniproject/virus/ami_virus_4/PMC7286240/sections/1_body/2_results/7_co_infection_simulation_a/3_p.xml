<p id="p0145">In clinic, 82 fecal samples were tested by both multiplex real-time PCR and RT-PCR (
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> ) to validate its usability. The results for the multiplex real-time PCR were as follows: 29.3% positive samples for CPV, 7.3% positive for CCoV, 3.7% positive for CaKoV, and 6.1% positive for CAstV. Co-infection of two viruses included two samples of CPV and CCoV; one positive of CPV and CaKoV; and one of CCoV and CAstV. Co-infections of three viruses included one positive of CCoV, CaKoV, and CAstV. Furthermore, there was one sample co-infected with four viruses. For RT-PCR, 29.3% samples were positive for CPV, 2.4% positive for CCoV, 1.22% positive for CaKoV, and 2.44% positive for CAstV. However, only one co-infection of CPV and CCoV and one of CCoV, CaKoV and CAstV was detected. Furthermore, the standard error of the prevalence is close to 0, indicating that the results are representative and reliable. In general, the results showed that the number of positives detected by real-time PCR was exceed than that of RT-PCR.
