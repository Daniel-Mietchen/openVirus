<p>Multiple animal models have been explored in the context of SARS, including non‐human primates, hamsters, ferrets and mice (Table 
 <xref rid="ene14277-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). A comprehensive descriptive review of all suitable models is beyond the scope of this review and we refer the reader to a number of excellent reviews [

 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>]. It can be inferred that there is no single ideal animal model for SARS, although the evidence collected so far has significantly contributed to advancing the field. In particular, it is well established that models range from those in which only virus replication is observed (young BALB/c, B6 mice) to those in which replication is accompanied by minimal signs and histopathology (such as non‐human primates, ferrets and hamsters) [
