<p>Overall, these data show the relevance of the transgenic approach in converting the mouse response to infection from mild to severe leading to CNS involvement. Additional key findings emerging from these different SARS models include: (i) the fundamental role of innate immunity in the response to SARS‚ÄêCoV infection; (ii) the different severity observed in young versus old BALB/c mice underlies the age dependency in the clinical manifestations; and (iii) different kinetics of viral infection (faster clearance in animals) [
