<p>Transgenic K18‐hACE2 mice infected with SARS‐CoV develop a severe pulmonary phenotype, starting in the respiratory epithelium with rapid alveolar dysfunction [
 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>]. In this model there is a massive infiltration of macrophages and lymphocytes in the lungs, promoting a release of pro‐inflammatory cytokines not only at pulmonary level, but also in the brain. In a relatively short time frame (within 5 days), K18‐hACE2 mice develop a severe phenotype, that includes a lethargic‐like state, suggesting CNS involvement.
