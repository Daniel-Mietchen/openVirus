<p>In follow‐up studies in the same mouse strain, K18‐hACE2 [
 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>], the authors demonstrated an extensive involvement of the transgenic mouse brain. SARS‐CoV produced a widespread infection involving vital brainstem nuclei, such as dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, nucleus tractus solitarii and area postrema. This model also raised questions as to the cause of neuronal destruction and death in these animals [

As there was no pathological evidence of inflammation, the authors considered the possibility of apoptosis as the cause of neuronal death, although this was not confirmed [Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick‐End Labeling (TUNEL)‐positive cells were not detected]. It was proposed that a dysregulated cytokine response could be the cause of death in these animals. At day 4 post‐infection, infected K18‐hACE2 mice had an upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)‐1, tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL‐6. The authors also propose a possible direct involvement of the dorsal vagal complex, a vital region of the brain that plays an important role in orchestrating cardiorespiratory function. In fact, animals intracranially inoculated with low‐dose virus exhibited limited viral spreading but succumbed rapidly [
