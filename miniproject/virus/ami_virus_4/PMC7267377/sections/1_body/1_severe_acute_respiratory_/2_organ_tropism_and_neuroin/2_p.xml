<p>Distinctive properties in the structure of mouse ACE2 (as compared with hACE2 proteins) significantly reduce the virus tropism for mouse tissues. Hence, in order to overcome this species‐related difference, a transgenic model has been generated in which a vector carrying a hACE2‐coding sequence was introduced in wild‐type mice under control of the human cytokeratin 18 (K18) promoter [

Notably, when K18‐hACE2 transgenic mice were infected with SARS‐CoV, the infection would start in the respiratory epithelium and rapidly spread to the alveoli. More importantly, neuroinvasive routes were later explored using the same model, by monitoring the kinetic profile of viral antigen [

Strikingly, the authors showed that the viral spread started in the olfactory bulb and progressively invaded subcortical and cortical regions. Such a trans‐neuronal hypothesis could not apply for other infected regions, such as those brainstem nuclei that are not directly connected to the olfactory bulb. The authors raise the possibility that, once the virus is established in the brain, it might spread along specific neurotransmitter pathways or via non‐neuronal routes (blood or Virchow–Robin spaces) [
