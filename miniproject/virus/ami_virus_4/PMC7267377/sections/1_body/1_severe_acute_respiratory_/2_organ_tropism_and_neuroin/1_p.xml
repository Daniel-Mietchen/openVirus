<p>Compelling evidence demonstrates that SARS‐CoV attaches to the cell membrane by binding to human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), now also known to be the SARS‐CoV‐2 functional receptor [

Human tissue studies have shown an abundant presence of these receptors not only in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, but also in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied, including the brain [
