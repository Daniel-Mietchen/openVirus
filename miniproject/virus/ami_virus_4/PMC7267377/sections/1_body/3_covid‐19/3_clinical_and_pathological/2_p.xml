<p>Overall, the pathogenicity of SARS‐CoV‐2 is lower as compared with SARS‐CoV in mice. Indeed, as discussed above, hACE2 transgenic mice infected with SARS‐CoV exhibited widespread organ damage, whereas SARS‐CoV‐2, at least in this model, was confined to lungs, indicating a differential pathogenicity [

These studies reveal important commonalities between SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS‐CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention. In fact, very recently, a TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use (camostat mesylate) was tested and blocked SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into lung cells [
