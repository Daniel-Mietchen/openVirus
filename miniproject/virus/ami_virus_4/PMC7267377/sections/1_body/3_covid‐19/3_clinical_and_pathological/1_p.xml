<p>Several laboratories worldwide are accelerating attempts to develop a suitable animal model for COVID‐19. Experimental infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 in these models provides basic information to address a number of fundamental questions regarding its pathogenicity, the interaction with the different hosts and, hopefully, establishing the criteria for prevention and care. In line with observations in SARS models, non‐human primates and wild‐type mice infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 exhibit a relatively mild clinical disease, in spite of the evidence that Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) revealed a massive infection of the respiratory tract [

Rhesus macaques infected with bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from an affected patient developed a histopathologically confirmed interstitial pneumonia, associated with a widespread presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the respiratory tract. Clinical signs were mild and no viral RNA was detectable by means of RT‐qPCR in the blood of the primates during the whole course of infection (14 days) [

 <italic>et  al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref>] used the hACE2 transgenic mice and infected them with SARS‐CoV‐2 inducing interstitial pneumonia, with typical histopathological elements and, accordingly, viral antigens were found in airway epithelia. These lines of experimental evidence are relevant as they demonstrate the causal relationship between SARS‐Cov‐2 and pulmonary involvement, but, unlike in SARS models, nervous system involvement was not documented in these experiments. However, it is unclear if brain tissue was systematically assessed and the most susceptible brain regions explored for direct or indirect viral presence.
