<p>Among limitations, the following emerge as of primary importance. 
 <list list-type="bullet" id="ene14277-list-0002">
  <list-item>
   <p>Neurological subtle clinical phenotypes are not easily reproducible in animal models.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Neurological severe phenotypes are dependent on using specific transgenic approaches to enhance virulence, which limit direct translation to humans.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Severity of the clinical features does not always parallel either the viral replication level or the histopathological findings, hinting at indirect disease mechanisms (such as inflammation and prothrombotic states) that have not been attained in the present models.</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>Innate animal characteristics seem to influence viral infection kinetics leading to faster virus clearance.</p>
