   <p>Major routes of CNS infection: (i) spread via olfactory bulb and/or (ii) synapse‐connected route to the medullary cardiorespiratory center from the mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lung and lower respiratory airways; and/or (iii) hematogenic via brain endothelial ACE2 receptors.</p>

   <p>Major pathogenic pathways for CNS involvement: (i) direct viral pathogenicity; and/or (ii) immune‐mediated pathogenicity targeting brain tissue; and/or (iii) inflammatory involvement of brain blood vessels; and/or (iv) intravascular coagulation secondary to the systemic inflammatory response as a mayor cause of thrombosis, hemorrhage and stroke.</p>

   <p>Host individual susceptibility factors that underlie the variable severity of the disease in human patients. However, a relevant issue is also represented by gender. The clinical observation of a specific involvement of males might suggest a specific protective estrogenic effect.</p>
