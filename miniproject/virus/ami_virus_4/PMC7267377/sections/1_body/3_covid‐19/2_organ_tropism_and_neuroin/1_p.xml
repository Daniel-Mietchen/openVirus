<p>The SARS‐Cov‐2 ultrastructure was recently characterized by high‐resolution cryo‐electron microscopy [
 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>]. Remarkably CoV spike glycoprotein, by which the virus binds the cell membrane, binds ACE2 with a higher affinity compared with SARS‐CoV. In addition, most of the available antibodies to SARS‐CoV targeting ACE‐binding domain were unable to bind the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike protein, indicating that binding sites differ between SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2. Such a finding indicates the urgent need for generating specific antibodies for SARS‐CoV‐2 binding domain, but might also explain the distinct pathogenic properties of SARS‐CoV‐2 [

 <italic>et  al.</italic> took advantage of bulk mouse whole olfactory mucosa (WOM) RNA sequence data derived from macaque, marmoset and human and found in both mouse and human datasets that olfactory sensory neurons do not express two key genes involved in CoV‐2 entry, i.e. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [
 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref>]. In contrast, olfactory epithelial support cells and stem cells express both of these genes, as do cells in the nasal respiratory epithelium. Taken together, these findings suggest possible mechanisms through which CoV‐2 infection could lead to anosmia or other forms of olfactory dysfunction. Moreover, these findings may question the olfactory bulb as an entry route for CoVs into the CNS [
