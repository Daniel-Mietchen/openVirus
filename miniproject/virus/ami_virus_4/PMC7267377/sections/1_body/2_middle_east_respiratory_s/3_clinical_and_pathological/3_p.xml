<p>In studies using transgenic mice expressing human DPP4, it was possible to induce features of human disease in the animals [

With regard to pathology, whereas infected mice presented an extensive pulmonary inflammatory infiltrate, the only findings in the brain were a mild perivascular cuffing [

However, in a different study using human DPP4 transgenic mice, a few days after the appearance of pulmonary lesions, pathological changes were documented in the brain, with dilatation and congestion of the cerebral vessels and few areas of cellular necrosis in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus [
