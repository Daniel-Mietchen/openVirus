<p>A number of models have been developed and discussed in detailed review articles [

However, despite the mild clinical syndrome, no neurological signs and symptoms were reported. Thus, the self‐limiting nature of MERS‐CoV infection, as transient patterns at various levels of the model, suggests that this model does not fully resemble the lethal infection observed in humans [

It is of note that, when macaques were immunocompromised by immunosuppressive agents, the MERS‐CoV replicated to significantly higher titers and disseminated in other organs (CNS not examined). Surprisingly, histopathological alterations were reduced in the immunosuppressed animals [
