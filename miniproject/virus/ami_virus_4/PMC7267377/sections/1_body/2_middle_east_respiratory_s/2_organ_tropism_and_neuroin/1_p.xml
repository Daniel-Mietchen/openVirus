<p>The MERS‐CoV 
 <italic>ex‐vivo</italic> models supported the clinical tropism for the pulmonary tract by showing that the virus can replicate in human lung cultures (in bronchial, bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells) [
 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>]. This cell line susceptibility study also revealed that, although presenting a lower viral expression and no cytopathic effects, MERS can infect human neuronal lines. Dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 (DPP4), also known as CD26, was identified as a functional receptor for MERS‐CoV. DPP4 is generally expressed in human bronchiolar epithelial cells and bronchial lung tissue [
 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>]. It can also be found in the intravascular portion of vascular endothelial cells and in the cerebrospinal fluid [
 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>]. After identification of DPP4 as a functional receptor, which is expressed in the airway epithelia of rodents, it was expected that rodents would have been vulnerable to infection. This turned out to be wrong, as the human binding domain differs from that of rodents [
 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>]. This limitation was overcome by developing mice expressing human DPP4 that exhibited high susceptibility to infection and displayed the features of human disease [
 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>], including a lethargic state, and showing high mortality and extrapulmonary involvement (Table 
 <xref rid="ene14277-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The authors detected a severe lung infection, but brain invasion was not seen until day 4 of infection, suggesting substantially different kinetics of MERS‐CoV infection in the lung and brain [
