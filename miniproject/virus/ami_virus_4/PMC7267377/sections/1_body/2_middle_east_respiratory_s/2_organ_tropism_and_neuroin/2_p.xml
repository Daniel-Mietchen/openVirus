<p>A different animal model using human DPP4 transgenic mice studied the differences in viral replication in animals infected by a clinical aerosol transmission simulator compared with intranasal instillation‐inoculated mice [

They found that the disease onset, lung lesion and viral replication progression were slower in the MERS‐CoV aerosol‐infected mice than in the MERS‐CoV instillation‐inoculated mice. Furthermore, after aerosol infection, they detected high viral loads after 3–9 days in the lungs versus 7–9 days in the brain. Again, although both lungs and brain are infected, the timing is different, with a later infection of the brain [

Indeed, neuroinvasive routes were not explored in either of these models. In addition, similarly to SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV has been shown to replicate in human dendritic cells and macrophages, which would support the hematogenous hypothesis [
