<p>A translational neuroscience approach is mandatory to explore the possible CNS involvement in CoV infections, accelerate scientific knowledge transfer to the clinical frontline and test new disease‐oriented treatments. Indeed, both clinical features of the previous CoV epidemics (SARS and MERS) and lessons from animal models used in the study of SARS and MERS constitute valuable tools to understand the viral pathogenesis in the host and to characterize mechanisms of viral access and dissemination in the CNS. Meanwhile, several laboratories are rushing to study SARS‐CoV‐2 in a number of different animals, including primates, mice, rats, hamsters and ferrets [
