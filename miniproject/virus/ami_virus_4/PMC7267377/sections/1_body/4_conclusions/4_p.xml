<p>In order to speed up clinically useful discoveries, it would be desirable to follow some indications such as: (i) to build a systematic, consecutive, prospective registry including epidemiological data in patients with COVID‐19 with attention to neurological manifestation to fully understand if SARS‐CoV‐2 infections can cause CNS involvement and to what extent; (ii) to measure SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic patients; and (iii) to perform autoptic investigations of patients with COVID‐19 in order to find and characterize virus distribution across tissues (cerebral blood vessels, endothelia, glia and neurons) and neuropathological consequences such as antibody‐based neuroinflammatory responses in gray and white matter, vasculitis, neuroglial death or apoptosis and ischaemic or hemorrhagic events. Taking into account the fact that other CoVs are prone to infecting neurons in animal models as well as in humans [

Therefore, despite immune‐mediated control of acute infection being attained, host‐mediated immune regulatory mechanisms may fail to clear the virus potentially leading to ‘chronic infections’ and hence impact chronic neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis [

 <xref rid="ene14277-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref>]. This calls for long‐term patient follow‐up in the clinics and also exploring the effect of SARS‐CoV‐2 in mouse models of neurodegenerative disorders to anticipate the occurrence of chronic SARS‐CoV‐2 CNS infection.
