<p>With regard to the pathogenesis of immune‐mediated CNS pathology, data derive broadly from mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strains, a beta‐CoV genetically related to human CoV‐OC43 [

(i) An excessive host response to the infection can occur resulting in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome that causes a multiple organ dysfunction (including CNS). The main pathogenic mechanism in this case includes tissue ‘dysoxia’ due to intravascular coagulation and dysfunction of the microcirculation homeostasis. (ii) Direct viral infection of immune cells, including macrophages, microglia and astrocytes in the CNS, may activate glial cells that locally produce pro‐inflammatory cytokines, including IL‐6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL‐1β and IL‐12 [

Moreover, activated immune cells may contribute to tissue damage by producing toxic agents, recruiting and activating further immune cells and inducing apoptosis. Immune‐mediated events, either through T‐cells or by means of other cytokine and chemokine pathways, may also eventually lead to demyelination. (iii) An autoimmune reaction is generated by an adaptive immune response directed against host epitopes or proteins either misrecognized by pathogen‐directed antibodies or expressed by damaged tissues (and previously cryptic to the adaptive immune system) [
