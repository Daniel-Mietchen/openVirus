    "Coronaviruses recently returned with a new one, SARS-CoV-2, related to a potentially severe respiratory disease-called the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Research shows that the SARS-CoV-2 can be clustered with the Bat SARS-like coronavirus. Bats possess an additional, innate ability for antiviral defense, and, on the other hand, the potential to go hand-in-hand with the virus to generate variability. Besides the high potential of the novel coronavirus in compromising the respiratory system, its rapid transmission and ability to engage many hosts in severe forms of infections or immunopathological complications make it a tough opponent for the immune system. The interactions between SARS-CoV2 and the host immune system result in unleashing tremendous amounts of cytokines, and these cytokines make a storm that would determine the outcome (recovery or death) of the lungs of the patient."
