<p>With the urgency to develop effective measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic and to design vaccine strategies useful to confront future outbreaks and epidemics of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses, accelerated programs for T-cell immunogen design are needed. T-cell epitope prediction algorithms are an effective tool to narrow down the potential immunogen cargo in a future SARS-CoV-2 vaccine from the total viral proteome. However, approaches exclusively based on 9-mer epitope prediction will potentially miss critically important responses, and even those based on 9-mer and 10-mer epitope prediction have similar shortcomings, for the reasons described above. In addition, a relatively unbiased approach to characterizing the T-cell response using overlapping peptides will facilitate understanding of immune correlates of SARS-CoV-2 control versus disease. The benefit of the predicted 9-mer/10-mer approach would be that, when used in combination with panels of overlapping peptides spanning the viral proteome, optimal epitopes will be more rapidly identified and, at the same time, immune correlates of disease protection evaluated in an unbiased fashion. These considerations should not be overlooked, as invaluable time and resources could be directed in directions that may not yield the desired success.</p>
