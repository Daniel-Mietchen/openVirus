<p>The development of a vaccine able to prevent infection or severe disease course of SARS-CoV-2 is a priority to stem the current COVID-19 pandemic and to be better prepared for future flare-ups. To accelerate T-cell immunogen design, many current approaches are employing epitope prediction strategies. Although such approaches have great merit, it is also important that unbiased approaches to characterizing the T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 are incorporated into vaccine design, in order to generate a comprehensive picture of the total virus-specific T-cell response and to define correlates of protective immunity against the virus.</p>
