<p>One major limitation of using predicted epitope sequences of 9 amino acids in T-cell vaccine designs is that T-cell responses to only that specific region will be induced by the vaccine. However, the example of HIV infection (which likely has the best-characterized epitope “landscape” described) shows how this can limit the vaccine-induced response: by (1) screening just 5 amino acids up- and downstream of each described optimal (mostly 9-mer) epitope for suitable anchor positions satisfying the currently known allele-specific binding motif and (2) allowing for an epitope length of 9 to 12 amino acids, the number of potential independent epitopes that could bind the given HLA class I molecule and induce T-cell responses to the same region more than doubles [

Although this may be of paramount importance to cope with HIV variability and to prevent rapid cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape, other viruses, even genetically robust DNA-based viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have been shown to present as swarms of quasi-species and to be able to develop effective CTL escape variants as well [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Thus, it seems critical that SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development take this aspect into account and test immunogen designs that can target the same epitopic region by multiple specificities, ideally composed of a polyclonal T-cell receptor repertoire to (1) broaden the response and thus increase the chances of eliciting more potent clonotypes and (2) more effectively prevent T-cell escape.
