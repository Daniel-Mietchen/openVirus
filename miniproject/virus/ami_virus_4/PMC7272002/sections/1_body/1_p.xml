<p>Ever since the first identification of binding motifs for T-cell antigens presented by HLA class I molecules by Rammensee and colleagues almost 30 years ago, epitope identification has been greatly facilitated by epitope prediction algorithms [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Over the years, many vaccines designs targeting infectious pathogens as well as cancer neoantigens have been based on in silico prediction of potential HLA class Iâ€“restricted epitopes, and a series of vaccine candidates that apply such strategies to SARS-CoV-2 are currently in development. However, even though numerous prediction algorithms have been developed and gradually improved, there are several considerations that may threaten or limit the success of such approaches.
