<p>Although the initial characterization of eluted HLA class I epitopes by the Rammensee lab in 1991 produced predominantly 9-mer epitopes, there was already the notion of longer and shorter sequences that can be bound and effectively presented by HLA class I molecules [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This observation has been validated many times over since, with some HLA class I alleles for which the 9-mer seems to be rather the exceptional length than the rule (such as HLA-B8, B35, B57, B27, and others). In fact, even the first identified epitopes in influenza and HIV infection, defined by other approaches a couple of years before the first binding motif was described, turned out to be 13 and 10 amino acids in length, respectively [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Especially for HIV, we have equally fallen victim to consider “optimal” HLA class I epitopes those for which functional experiments have identified the shortest reactive peptide and thereby unwillingly contributed to cementing the dogma of 9-mer optimal epitope length as the rule [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, based on elution studies by many laboratories and crystallographic structural analyses, it is evident that many epitope variants presented by HLA class I molecules can exceed the 9-mer length [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In fact, even for members of the HLA-A11 allele family that have very strict and limited C-anchor binding requirements, elution studies have demonstrated that only about 20% of the (self and viral) epitopes are exactly 9 amino acids in length [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Of note, this was done in a system that uses soluble class I molecules secreted from the antigen-presenting cells and thus limits the bias to also identify (longer) processing intermediates. Similar observations have been made for other HLA class I alleles—for instance, HLA-B8, which consistently presents peptides that are shorter than 9-mers; or HLA-B57, for which the immunodominant and protective HIV-specific epitope is an 11-mer; or where epitopes have been found to be entirely embedded in other epitopes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], all cases that are generally not identified or scored as independent epitopes by prediction algorithms.
