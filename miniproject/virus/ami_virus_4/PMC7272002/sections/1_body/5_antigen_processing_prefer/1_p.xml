<p>Another critical limitation that is not properly addressed by most epitope prediction tools is the need to identify appropriate antigen-processing sites that could give rise to predicted, presented epitopes. As the composition of the antigen-processing machinery changes upon proinflammatory signals and can differ between different cell types, currently known prediction algorithms will likely not be suited to estimate the processing efficacy of viral antigens in the context of an infected target cell. Thus, without functional validation, there exists the risk that predicted epitopes may represent great theoretical or actual binder to HLA class I molecules, but they are either not processed at all or not processed at sufficient levels to induce a strong immune response and to sensitize infected target cells for CTL-mediated killing. In addition, the allelic diversity of TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) genes, which encode for proteins that form a bottleneck for the translocation of processed antigen into the lumen of the endoplasmatic reticulum, are only partly integrated into peptide prediction algorithms.</p>
