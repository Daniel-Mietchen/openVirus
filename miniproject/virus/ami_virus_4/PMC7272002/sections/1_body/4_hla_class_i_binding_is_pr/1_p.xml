<p>There are to date more than 20,000 HLA class I alleles described that translate into more than 11,000 different HLA class A, B, and C molecules. For many of these alleles, sequence similarities and structural analyses have allowed grouping them into larger, so-called HLA supertypes that share epitope binding similarities [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, there is extensive binding promiscuity even by short 9-mer peptides that go well beyond the specific allele and its assigned supertype and for which commonly used minimal cutoffs of binding affinities would not identify the reactive peptides [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In fact, screening data using several hundred epitopes derived from different viral infections suggest that the current prediction algorithm may miss a large number of reactive “optimal” epitopes and possibly an even larger proportion of responses when predicting potential epitopes on a full protein sequence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. An extreme example of this may be epitopes predicted (and presented) by HLA-E, for which binding peptides showed an unexpected broad permissiveness at anchor positions and extensive structural freedom to bind to the presenting class I molecule [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The current urgency by which the scientific community attempts to achieve a viable T-cell vaccine to SARS-CoV-2 will, however, not allow generation of larger training sets that could improve these predictions and thus may mislead the design into regions of the virus that are rich in epitopes fulfilling binding motifs of the most commonly studied class I alleles. In addition, these approaches will not be able to sufficiently cover the genetically different, and often more numerous, populations with less well-characterized genetics and, in parallel, less well-established healthcare systems in which vaccines may be the only way to stem against the pandemic.
