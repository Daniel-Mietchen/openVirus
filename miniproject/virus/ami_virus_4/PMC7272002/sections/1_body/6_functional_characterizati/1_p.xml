<p>Finally, there are evident advantages in identifying antigens not only to protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection but to develop vaccine candidates that could act against past and future coronavirus outbreaks. This would call for focus on particularly conserved regions between isolates and different coronaviruses, something that can be readily implemented in epitope prediction strategies, even if conservation on an epitope level does not need to be complete. Whether such cross-reactive T-cell responses could indeed mediate cross-protection and are associated with effective control of different coronaviruses, remains to be seen. Of note, emerging data start providing some insights into T-cell effector function profiles that may be protective and those that may be associated with a more severe clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008607.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Thus, a functional assessment of T-cell responses in individuals with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease courses may be indicated, so that potential detrimental effects of preexisting, cross-reactive T-cell immunity can be avoided. However, without an unbiased screening for total virus-specific T-cell responses with classical and alternative T-cell effector functions [
