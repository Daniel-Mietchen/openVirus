  <p>Weekly means of average daily temperature and solar radiation for 3,913 0.25° grid cell-weeks (shown as dots) of observation for COVID-19 incident cases in China (excluding Wuhan City) during January–February 2020, covering a total of 18,069 cases among a population of 151.2 million. Temperature is divided into tertiles, with each tertile then divided into tertiles of solar radiation. Numbers in each sector represent COVID-19 incidence rate ratios (adjusted for week, population density and precipitation).</p>
