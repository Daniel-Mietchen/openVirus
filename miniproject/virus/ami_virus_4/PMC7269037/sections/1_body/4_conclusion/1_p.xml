<p>While this assessment showed appreciable associations between COVID-19 incidence rates and weather patterns in China during Januaryâ€“February 2020, this does not amount to establishing a clear cause and effect relationship. However, it does not support any generalisations to the effect that the COVID-19 pandemic will simply go away given some nice summer weather. The size of the associations between weather and incidence in China is very much of public health interest in understanding the continuing spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus around the world, across different climate zones. The possibility that transmission is reduced during periods of brighter, warmer, drier weather, or increased during duller, cooler, wetter weather is important. Further assessments of this kind in other locations and seasons are needed to build a full picture, but meteorological data should be considered for inclusion in overall models of COVID-19 epidemiology and pandemic dynamics.</p>
