<p>The original COVID-19 epicentre in Wuhan City reported approximately 3 times as many confirmed cases as the whole of the rest of China, with peak incidence during January 2020 [
 <xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. This overwhelming number of cases in a single location was not included in analyses here since it did not contribute to geographic variation and occurred slightly earlier than the generalised epidemic in China. While the actual number of COVID-19 cases in China is generally considered to be much higher than the number of tested and confirmed cases, perhaps by as much as 20-fold [
 <xref rid="CIT0007">7</xref>], confirmed cases represent a reasonable basis for deriving incidence rate ratios in relation to environmental factors. It is unlikely in general that weather conditions would systematically affect the ratio of confirmed:unconfirmed cases.
