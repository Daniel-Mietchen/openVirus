<p>This eco-epidemiological assessment set out to use data on COVID-19 incident cases throughout China during January and February 2020 (excluding the original epidemic focus of Wuhan city) and to relate them to week of confirmation, population and meteorological data. This represents a kind of ‘natural experiment’ in terms of how secondary epidemic foci occurred in diverse locations around China, before the national epidemic was more or less under control by the end of February, with wide variation in week-specific and location-specific incidence rates. The objective was to characterise the extent to which ecological factors may have mediated COVID-19 transmission in China to inform public health planning and modelling in other settings.</p>
