<p>The large-scale outbreak of COVID-19 in China at the start of 2020, by now largely contained, presents an important opportunity to carry out an eco-epidemiological assessment which may be relevant for understanding patterns of transmission relevant for the ensuing pandemic. Unprecedented open-access data at the individual case level for the outbreak in China, including geo-location data, plus the availability of detailed remote-sensed and global-gridded ecological data, make this possible. The ecological dimensions of the pathogenâ€“host relationship are likely to be determined by multiple factors, including population density, social contacts, a range of environmental and meteorological parameters, and population-based control measures. This assessment specifically looks at weather and COVID-19 incidence on a small-area basis in China, adjusting for population density and week of the epidemic.</p>
