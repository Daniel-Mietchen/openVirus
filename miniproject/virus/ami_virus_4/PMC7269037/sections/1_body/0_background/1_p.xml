<p>In infectious outbreak situations, much epidemiological effort rightly goes into case-finding and follow-up in order to track epidemics. Population-based analyses of ecological factors are however also important, not least to inform models and prognostics for future spread of the same infection elsewhere. Where a new disease is involved, such as COVID-19, it is particularly important to chart an unknown infectious agentâ€™s interactions with environments in which transmission has occurred.</p>
