<p>Many well-established pathogens follow well-known seasonally and ecologically determined patterns of activity [
 <xref rid="CIT0001">1</xref>]. The established concept of ‘tropical medicine’ was largely predicated around pathogens and vectors predominantly localised in tropical regions, with some cases in travellers manifesting elsewhere [
 <xref rid="CIT0002">2</xref>]. Obviously little is yet known about seasonal and ecological patterns for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus causing the current COVID-19 pandemic, although it is already clear that this pathogen has capacity for wide and rapid geographic spread, and it is not confined to any particular climatic zone. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 transmission may still be mediated by local weather conditions. Other coronaviruses, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have been shown to follow established seasonal patterns [
 <xref rid="CIT0003">3</xref>]. Human coronavirus infections have been found to be more common in winter in Norway [
 <xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>], and in Israel in summer [
 <xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Thus, other coronavirus diseases show various weather-related transmission patterns, which may also be true for COVID-19.
