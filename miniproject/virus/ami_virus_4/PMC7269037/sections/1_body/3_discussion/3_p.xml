<p>Among the unknown unknowns, the effect of weather on human behaviour, and thus on behavioural risks for acquiring COVID-19, may also be important. The incidence of infections in China was markedly lower at very low temperatures, which might be related to characteristics of the virus, but equally may reflect reduced social contact when it is very cold outside. Conversely, brighter, drier weather may stimulate levels of social interaction, and thereby possibly counteract direct effects of heat and light on viruses. The complex observed relationship between temperature and solar radiation, as shown in 
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>, is important, because the effects of temperature and light, particularly in the ultra-violet spectrum, have been shown to be associated with seasonal viral activity in other contexts [
 <xref rid="CIT0017">17</xref>]. In this assessment, the independent association of precipitation with COVID-19 incidence rates was also appreciable. A recent meteorological analysis showed very similar weather patterns across a number of COVID-19 hotspots, including Wuhan City, in a corridor 30° to 50° North in early 2020 [
 <xref rid="CIT0018">18</xref>]. This is congruent with findings here that weather conditions in Wuhan City during January corresponded to the highest risk categories as assessed across the rest of China.
