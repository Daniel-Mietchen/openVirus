<p>While the open-access individual confirmed case data is a hugely valuable resource, it is not able to tell the full story of the circumstances of each case. The nature of COVID-19 transmission is such that many cases will have no idea exactly where, when or how they acquired their infection, and so the location data for confirmed cases are inevitably more reflective of illness and treatment-seeking rather than infection. However, during the period of COVID-19 spread around China, following the initial epicentre epidemic in Wuhan City, the Chinese authorities implemented stringent infection reduction and travel restriction measures in many locations, the exact nature and chronology of which are not documented. The somewhat counterintuitive relationship seen in this assessment between population density and COVID-19 incidence very possibly reflects the effectiveness of infection control measures targeted at densely populated urban areas. However, records of cases in 559 locations outside Wuhan City, as shown in 
 <xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>(a), show that there was widespread nationwide transmission, even though only a single confirmed case was recorded in 20% of locations with cases. This possibly speaks to the effectiveness of control measures in many places, as well as the proportions of actual cases tested and confirmed.
