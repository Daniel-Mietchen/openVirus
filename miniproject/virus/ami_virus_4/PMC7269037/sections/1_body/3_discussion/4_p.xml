<p>Despite possible weaknesses around the case data, one of the strengths of this assessment is that all the other data were sourced from global data models that are totally independent of the COVID-19 data from China. Additionally, since China is a very large and geographically varied country, assessment of COVD-19 incidence was made over a very wide range of weather, as evident from 
 <xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>(c–f), and detailed daily weather data were sourced on a small-area basis at 0.25° resolution. Although there may have been local variations in the rigour with which COVID-19 cases in China were identified, tested and confirmed, it seems unlikely that such variations would have been systematically related to weather in previous weeks. In addition, measures representing intuitively accessible concepts in any location (warmth, sunshine and rainfall) were used, and allowed to compete in a multivariable model against COVID-19 incidence rate ratios, to produce findings that are directly understandable in public health terms. Generalisability of these findings beyond the Chinese context cannot be assumed, but there is no suggestion from these results that there was any combination of weather that would arrest COVID-19 transmission on a seasonal basis. An initial assessment of this kind, while not intended to be hypothesis-driven, is likely to generate hypotheses for further research. The associations demonstrated here between weather and transmission also raise an important specific research question. Recent progress in mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is demonstrating the importance of social contact for transmission [
