<p>These analyses clearly show variations in confirmed COVID-19 case incidence rates in China which are associated with weather during the week preceding case confirmation. An observational study of this kind cannot formally attribute cause and effect, and there remain uncertainties which have to be considered as unknown unknowns. Nevertheless, this assessment of the effects of weather on COVID-19 transmission in China suggests variations of a sufficient magnitude to have important possible consequences for understanding COVID-19 transmission in other settings. This assessment also illustrates the value of the detailed open-access data available both on confirmed COVID-19 cases and ecological parameters.</p>
