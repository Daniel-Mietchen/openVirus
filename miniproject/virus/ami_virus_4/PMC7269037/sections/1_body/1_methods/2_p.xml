<p>There were 559/15,539 (3.6%) grid cells which contained at least one reported case at some point during January and February (excluding Wuhan City), and these were used to construct a Poisson regression model (Stata 12) in which the unit of observation was cell-week, over the period during which cases occurred anywhere in the country (weeks 3 to 9 of 2020, total 3,913 units of observation). Weather parameters during the preceding week were included in the model on the basis of the established 5â€“7 day incubation period for COVID-19, since this was likely to reflect weather at the time of disease transmission [

The dependent variable in the Poisson model was the number of incident confirmed cases in the cell-week and exposure was the population in the cell, allowing for clustering by the grid cell identifier over weeks, with incidence rate ratio as the outcome. In the absence of established hypotheses on relationships between ecological factors and SARS-CoV-2 transmission, tertiles of quantitative variables were constructed as independent variables to avoid erroneously imposing linear assumptions. Grid cells which had no incident cases reported throughout January and February were excluded from the regression model, in the absence of any evidence of the possibility of transmission in the cell.
