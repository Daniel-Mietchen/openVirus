<p>This assessment is based on the open-access COVID-19 incident case data maintained by the Open COVID-19 Data Curation Group [
 <xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. A total of 18,069 geo-located COVID-19 incident confirmed cases during January and February 2020 were extracted for the whole of China, excluding Wuhan City. No confirmed cases were reported for the first 2 weeks of January. All cases were mapped by week of confirmation onto a 0.25° latitude/longitude grid (approximately 25 × 25 km squares) for the whole of China, which included 15,539 cells. This grid was also filled with population data from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center [
 <xref rid="CIT0014">14</xref>]. Gridded weather data for the whole of China during January and February 2020 were sourced from the Copernicus Climate Change Service ERA-5 T model, specifically temperature at 2 m, total precipitation and total sky direct solar radiation at surface [
 <xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. Weekly averages/totals of daily weather data for each geographic cell were calculated and mapped on the geographic grid. These data were used as the basis for generating maps of cases and ecological factors.
