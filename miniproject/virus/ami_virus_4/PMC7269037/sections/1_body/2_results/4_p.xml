<p>If the single confirmed cases recorded in 113 cells genuinely represented local index cases who had travelled from elsewhere in China after becoming infected under different ecological conditions, it could be argued that they might distort the results. Though it was probably more likely that the single confirmed cases were contacts of local index cases, a sensitivity analysis was performed by repeating the regression with the omission of the 113 cells with single confirmed cases. The results of the regression model and this sensitivity analysis are shown in 
 <xref rid="T0002">Table 2</xref>, with no meaningful differences seen after excluding the cells with single confirmed cases.
