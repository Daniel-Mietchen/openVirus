 <xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> shows (a) the geographic distribution of cases, (b) population density for the whole country, and, for January–February 2020, (c) average of daily maximum temperature at 2 m, (d) average of daily minimum temperature at 2 m, (e) total precipitation and (f) average of daily total sky direct solar radiation at the surface. The Supplementary Material contains similar maps for temperature, precipitation and solar radiation on a weekly basis, showing the location of cases confirmed in the following week. Weekly means of maximum daily temperature varied from −28.0°C to 30.1°C, minimum daily temperature from −42.4°C to 23.0°C, maximum solar radiation from 0.04 to 2.74 MJm
 <sup>−2</sup> and total precipitation from 0 to 72.6 mm.
