 <xref rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref> shows adjusted incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the overall regression model. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (adjusted for week, population density and precipitation) for the composite temperature-radiation variable from the regression model are also shown in 
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref>. Most of the adjusted incidence rate ratios were significantly different from 1, evident in 
 <xref rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref> from the lack of overlap of 95% confidence intervals with the vertical line at an adjusted incidence rate ratio of 1.
