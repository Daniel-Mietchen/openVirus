<p>A total of 18,069 confirmed cases were reported, contained in 559 0.25Â° grid cells, which corresponded to an overall population of 151.2 million, around 10% of the total Chinese population. This amounted to an overall COVID-19 confirmed case incidence rate in cells with cases of 0.12 per 1,000 population, although the incidence of confirmed cases should be taken to represent a small proportion of all cases. In 113/559 (20.2%) of grid cells with cases, there was only one confirmed case during the whole period, while two grid cells recorded over 1,000 cases.</p>
