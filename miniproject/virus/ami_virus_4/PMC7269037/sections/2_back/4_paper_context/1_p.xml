<p>The availability of open-access individual-level case data from the COVID-19 epidemic in China during Januaryâ€“February 2020 provides an opportunity to assess disease transmission against local weather conditions at the time, available in global databases. This is potentially important information for other countries experiencing epidemics of COVID-19, allowing local weather conditions to be considered in estimates and forecasts of epidemic progression in other settings, and the prediction of possible resurgences during favourable transmission conditions.</p>
