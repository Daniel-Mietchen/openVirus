<p>A simple rate-equation model that accounts for susceptible (S), infected (I), and resistant (R) individuals, formulated nearly a century ago,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>
 </sup> quantifies epidemics by the so-called reproduction number 
 <italic>R</italic>. The latter reflects how many new infections are produced on average by every infected person. An epidemic grows or decays roughly exponentially if 
 <italic>R</italic> &gt; 1 or 
 <italic>R</italic> &lt; 1, respectively. The initial phase of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was characterized by a high 
 <italic>R</italic> value of ∼2.5 when no mitigation measures were implemented, and all individuals were susceptible to the virus. With an increasing number of resistant individuals that have successfully defeated the virus by their immune responses, the epidemic will naturally slow down and terminate once so-called herd immunity is reached. This state would require at least a fraction 1 – 1/
 <italic>R</italic> ∼ 60% of the population to be immune to the virus, although a straightforward solution of the SIR model
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>
 </sup> actually predicts higher values depending on the dynamical evolution of the pandemic, with 20% of people simultaneously infected at the peak of contagions. More sophisticated models taking into account social habits as well as geographical distribution and interconnections of the population also predict similarly large numbers of infections.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>
 </sup> and forecasts subsequent waves if those measures are relaxed.

 </sup> These models and forecasts, therefore, emphasize the need for economically sustainable mitigation actions to either bring 
 <italic>R</italic> below 1 (suppression strategy) or at least reduce its value so that a high peak of infections can be averted (mitigation strategy).
