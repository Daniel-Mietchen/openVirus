 </sup> Still, each of these measures presents specific problems, and it is questionable as to whether they are sufficient to reduce the reproduction number

 </xref>b–g, we illustrate everyday scenarios in which these measures may have limited efficiency, particularly in preventing the spread of airborne viruses in frequently used confined spaces (
 <italic>e.g.</italic>, toilets, elevators) and surface-deposited viruses in small-area surfaces such as handles, buttons, and handrails.
