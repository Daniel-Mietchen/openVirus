<p>With filters and chemicals requiring long-term planning and/or the evacuation of people while in use, certain wavelengths of UV-C light emerge as the most promising solution to act swiftly on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic because UV-C light meets the aforementioned requirements of fast, scalable, and affordable implementation. Direct comparison between UV-C light and hydrogen peroxide cleaning reveals similarly high efficiencies, yet with certain pros and cons: although UV-C light acts faster, access to shadowed areas can be a problem,
