<p id="sec1">Pandemics created by novel viruses from animal reservoirs have become recurrent events in our globalized world. The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a reminder that, once a virus emerges in the human population for the first time, it can rapidly spread worldwide and put our wellbeing in danger if it is not contained from the very beginning. Viral spread is particularly probable if the virus can be transmitted through the air, has a short incubation time, and is highly infectious. Our strongly interconnected society has a large fraction of the population concentrated in megacities hosting millions of inhabitants with frequent human interactions. In addition, our society has access to efficient travel systems that enable reaching even remote places within hours, thus fostering dissemination of diseases.
