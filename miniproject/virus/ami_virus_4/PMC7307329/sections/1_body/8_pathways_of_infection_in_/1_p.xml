 </xref>a illustrates different pathways of virus transmission classified into two distinct categories: (1) air transmission of viruses in droplets exhaled by infected individuals and inhaled by healthy individuals; and (2) surface transmission of viruses deposited on surfaces from either exhalations or hand contact. Infected individuals may spread viruses through coughing and sneezing but also through breathing and speaking in the presence of healthy, susceptible individuals. A long series of studies has revealed a relation between ventilation in buildings and the rate of infection of air-transmittable diseases,

 </sup> therefore prompting recommendations on the use of ventilation systems to minimize the risk of infection.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>
 </sup> In addition, recent research has conclusively shown rapid spreading of airborne pathogens in indoor spaces within a few minutes using methods that include fluid-dynamics simulations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>
 </sup> and experimental measurements of aerosol emission during speech,

 </sup> coughing,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
 </sup> and sneezing.

 </sup> Analyses in hospitals have recently provided

 </sup> Incidentally, the level of loudness while talking determines the size of the emitted droplets,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>
 </sup> which in turn plays a decisive role on the rate of transmission.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>
 </sup> Coughing, sneezing, and talking in confined air volumes therefore pose a real risk when several individuals, some of whom may potentially be infected, have to share the same room for hours. Obviously, the density of people inside buildings is a critical factor that determines the rate of transmission.

 </sup> Contact with surfaces that are frequently used by many people and on which the virus can survive for hours,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>
 </sup> such as door bells, door handles, and handrails, may also represent another efficient source of transmission.
