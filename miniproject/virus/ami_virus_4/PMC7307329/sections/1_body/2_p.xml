 </sup> These physiological actions produce aerosols made of droplets of various sizes that may carry infectious viruses and initiate new infection events when inhaled by others. Importantly, the specific size of the droplets determines their airborne lifetimes and, thus, the duration over which passing individuals may be exposed to the virus. Droplets larger than ∼100–200 μm settle down rapidly under the action of gravity and rarely reach distances beyond a few meters from the release point,

 </sup> whereas droplets smaller than 10 μm (5 μm) with settling speeds below 3 mm/s (0.8 mm/s) can stay airborne for ∼10 min (&gt;30 min in still air) or longer if they shrink by water evaporation and/or get dispersed by air currents.

 </sup> Droplets emitted in the intermediate size range (∼10–100 μm) can also shrink due to evaporation and be equally dispersed.

 </sup> Factors such as airflow speed, temperature, and humidity can also affect the transmission rate associated with infectious aerosols.
