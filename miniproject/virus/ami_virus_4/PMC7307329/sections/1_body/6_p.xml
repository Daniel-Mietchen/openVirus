 </sup> However, within indoor spaces, such as shared offices, classrooms, healthcare facilities, and public transport vehicles, these methods may not reduce viral transmission rates to a sufficiently low level to prevent exponential growth of the pandemic. Specifically, with its relatively high 
 <italic>R</italic> number of ∼2.5, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires the adoption of additional measures to supplement those mentioned above. The need for such additional measures is particularly acute in hospitals, where the high densities of infected individuals have already led to high rates of infection among healthcare professionals in epidemic hotspots, and consequently, new protocols are being tested.
