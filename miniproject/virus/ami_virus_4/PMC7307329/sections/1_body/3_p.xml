 </sup> Nevertheless, temperature and humidity influence virus survival on surfaces,

 </sup> Humidity plays an important role in viral transmission and is an especially important factor in relation to social and working environments because cold humid air from outdoors suffers a significant drop in humidity when entering indoor spaces.

 </sup> Consistent with this finding, animal models show that respiratory droplet transmission of influenza in ferrets is more efficient in a 30% relative humidity environment and least efficient above 50%.

 </sup> Relative humidity has been hypothesized to play a role in the determination that aerosols are the most efficient chain of transmission in temperate regions, although this parameter may also be responsible for a different transmission preference in humid and warm regions, where heavier, water-laden, airborne virus-containing droplets tend to settle on surfaces, thus favoring contact transmission.
