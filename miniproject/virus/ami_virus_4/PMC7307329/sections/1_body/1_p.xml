<p>The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown that initial measures of temporary confinement of citizens can be effective in curbing the spread of the virus and preventing the collapse of health systems.

 </sup> However, confinement causes a huge burden on national and global economies, negatively impacting businesses and individualsâ€™ physical and mental health. In addition, developing countries cannot assume such burdens and are instead forced to endure the pandemic. Consequently, in both developing and developed economies, there is strong motivation to end confinement and, instead, to implement measures that enable some degree of physical proximity between individuals, allowing them to have long interactions in indoor spaces. To contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to limit similar outbreaks in the future, prevention measures that can be rapidly adopted are an excellent investment in shared environments. Moreover, such prevention measures should be planned as part of future infrastructure in workplaces, public buildings, and mass transit systems.
