<p>Although we focus on work/public spaces such as offices and shopping areas, the effectiveness of UV-C light may require additional considerations in schools and other environments where social distancing is more difficult to maintain. In particular, prevaccination-era studies showed that UV light could reduce spreading of viruses such as measles, chickenpox, and mumps among school children
