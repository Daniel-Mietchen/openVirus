<p>The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is posing an extraordinary challenge that requires swift worldwide action for the massive deployment of affordable and ready-to-apply measures to abate transmission in indoor spaces, such as work settings. Physical means of reducing transmission should require relatively low costs and virtually no alteration of working conditions. In addition to massive monitoring and follow up of contacts of new infections, widely advertised measures such as wearing masks

 </sup> and frequent handwashing are proving useful but can still fall short of preventing the spreading of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Additional preventive measures also need to adapt to different regions and environments, where transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2 vary. Our succinct analysis of such possible measures leads us to argue that UV-C light stands out as a promising candidate that satisfies the above criteria and, in particular, that can be deployed in the short run with an affordable capital investment. The efficiency of this measure should be extensively monitored by studying correlations with the outcome of widespread testing.
