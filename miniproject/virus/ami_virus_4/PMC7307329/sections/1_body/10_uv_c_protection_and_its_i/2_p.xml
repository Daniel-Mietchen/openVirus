 </sup> wavelengths are less damaging for humans than 254 nm but have similar efficiency to inactivate pathogens. Unfortunately, the lower the wavelength of UV-C light, the more effective it is at generating harmful ozone. Recent studies promote the prospects of far UV-C light (wavelengths of ∼200–230 nm) as a regime of low risk to human health, yet still with low ozone production.
