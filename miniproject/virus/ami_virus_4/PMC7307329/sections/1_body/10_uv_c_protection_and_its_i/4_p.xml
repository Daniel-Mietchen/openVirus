 </xref>b,f and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) are used only intermittently and involve a high turnover of people. These spaces could be protected by safely exposing them to a high intensity of UV-C radiation while not in use (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>c), which could guarantee a virus-free space when a new user enters. In addition, their usable time could be automatically allocated in order to reserve a dwell time during which UV-C irradiation is applied. This approach could be equally practical in public transportation, with periodic irradiation cycles after a certain number of stops or time of continuous use. A similar concept could be applied to motion-inactivated UV-C illumination that would serve as a protective barrier in passageways and corridors (

  <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>
 </xref>e and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). We also note that frequently touched surfaces, such as buttons (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 
  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>d and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), handles, and specific segments of handrails, could be directly and continuously exposed to weak UV-C sources aimed at them, as they involve minor risk from eye irradiation or a limited exposure time on hands. Hand-held UV-C devices could be used as well for quick disinfection of these elements and of surfaces in public transportation vehicles (

 </xref>c and 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) as an alternative to cleaning through more time-consuming conventional methods.
