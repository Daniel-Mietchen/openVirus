<p>Disinfection of small confined spaces such as toilets and elevators (

 </xref>c) could be achieved by shining UV-C light while they are not in use, requiring an illumination power inversely proportional to the dwell time between uses. Because of their small share of total volume in buildings, their share of power demand should still represent a relatively minor investment. In turn, disinfecting such spaces could have huge health protection impact in view of their high frequency of use.
