<p>We can estimate the UV-C power needed to clean air through typical ventilation systems by considering a few of their relevant characteristics extracted from American

 </sup> standards. These systems generally inject a volume of virus-free exterior air inside the building equivalent to 1–1.5 times the building volume per hour (

 </xref>a); such fresh air is mixed with 1–2 times its share of recycled air (

 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>AC</sub>/

 <sub>ext</sub> = 2–3); disinfecting the latter can thus bring the rate of clean-air replacement to ∼2–4.5 times per hour at the cost of cleaning a volume of air per hour equal to 1–3 times the building volume. At full occupation, the building volume per person is ∼30 m

 <sub>d</sub> = 1 m
 <sup>2</sup> with an optical path to a single UV-C light source, we can achieve 90% virus inactivation in the recycled air with an output UV-C power of ∼

 <sup>2</sup> discussed above. This power alone can disinfect a volume per unit time ∼

 <sub>d</sub> × 3600 sec) ∼80–250 mW. In this rough estimate, we assume illumination collimated along the duct, but the actual light power demand is, of course, dependent on the geometry of the ventilation system. In fact, the illumination efficiency can be increased by creating multiple reflections in ducts coated with aluminum or simply covered with aluminum foil (

  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>e,f),
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>
 </sup> as this material offers a reflectivity 
 <italic>r</italic> &gt; 90% that can thus reduce the UV-C power demand by a factor 1/(1 – 
 <italic>r</italic>) &gt; 10 (upper bound estimate) because all of the reflected light is available for virus inactivation. For future designs, more sophisticated dielectric-based duct coatings could push 
 <italic>r</italic> closer to 100% and thus reduce the light power demand even further, while also minimizing the potential damage of stray light reaching people’s eyes and skin. In brief, ventilation systems operating at their maximum fresh-air injection capabilities can renew air at a rate of 1–1.5 times per hour, but this rate can be increased 2–3-fold with a modest investment of &lt;0.25 W output UV-C power per person or even lower power of a few mW per person after optimizing multiple reflections in the ventilation ducts.
