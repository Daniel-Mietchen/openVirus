<p>Upper- or lower-room UV-C illumination (

 </xref>b) can also be an efficient means of virus inactivation, but this approach requires more careful analysis of potentially hazardous stray light, thus making it less amenable to short-term implementation. The efficiency then depends on the fraction of illuminated to total air volume, the use of multiple reflections, and the existence of vertical air circulation. However, we expect similar efficiencies as in the ventilation systems discussed above.
