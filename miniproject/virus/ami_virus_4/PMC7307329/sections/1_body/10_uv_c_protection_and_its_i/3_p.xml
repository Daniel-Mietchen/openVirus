<p>Providing the conditions to resume work with a higher degree of safety in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementing protection measures while people are oftentimes present in the workplace. For this purpose, UV-C light sources could be distributed with no direct optical path to humans in the ducts of ventilation systems (

 </sup> As an alternative, one could instead use horizontally collimated illumination of a fraction of the room height near either the ceiling or the floor, adding air circulation through temperature-controlled elements such as heaters placed near or beneath the floor (

 </sup> Stand-alone systems consisting of UV-C elements hidden inside a pipe combined with fans to produce intense airflow through them could be an additional option, although the associated turbulent air dynamics could have unknown consequences on the dispersion of exhaled droplets. These solutions could be adequate to increase protection against virus transmission in office spaces, classrooms, and restaurants (
