<p>UV-C light has been applied in sterilization for over a century, including in the treatment of the disease lupus vulgaris, for which Niels Ryberg Finsen received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1903. This spectral range of light lies right at the edge of the UV water transparency window, where water is transparent enough to prevent light attenuation inside micron-sized exhaled droplets, so that the illumination can inactivate viruses contained in them. Early studies had already shown the benefits of using UV-C irradiation to prevent the spread of measles in rural schools.

 </sup> Specifically, fluorescence lamps are widely used sources to produce light at a wavelength of 254 nm, which inactivates pathogens through efficient absorption by their DNA or RNA (
