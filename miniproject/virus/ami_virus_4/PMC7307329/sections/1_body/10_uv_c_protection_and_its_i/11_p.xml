<p>Although all of the aforementioned methods rely heavily on the electronic characteristics of a selection of high-purity materials (

 </sup> provides another approach to generate UV-C radiation that is less sensitive to the nature of the material employed and can lead to highly directed and coherent emission. Light is then emitted due to the passage of a free electron near a periodic grating, whereby the electromagnetic interaction between the electron and each groove results in a coherent source that produces light with a well-defined relation between wavelength and emission direction. This effect, whose analogues have been extensively exploited to generate X-ray radiation in synchrotrons and free-electron lasers employing relativistic electron beams, has long been speculated to serve as a mechanism for the efficient generation of UV radiation using gratings with periods of tens of nanometers.
