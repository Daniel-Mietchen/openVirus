<p>A pertinent question is whether industry can satisfy the demand for UV-C sources for massive protection at a global scale. Currently, low-density fluorescence lamps are commonly used to generate UV-C light with 30–40% power efficiencies at 254 nm wavelength. However, LEDs have emerged as an alternative capable of emitting light down to wavelengths as low as 210 nm.

 </sup> The efficiencies of LEDs in the UV-C range are comparatively poor (∼1–2%) though,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">83</xref>
 </sup> still small compared with fluorescence tubes. Nevertheless, their faster and more versatile operation has pushed LED sources to take &gt;40% of the UV market.

 </sup> To cover large volumes, high-power sources are needed, such as microcavity plasmas, which have been shown to be capable of delivering &gt;20% efficiency at a 172 nm emission wavelength.

 </sup> Importantly, low-density fluorescence lamps are by far cheaper per output watt (∼$5/W rough estimate based upon inspection of current

Putting together the above figures, disinfection with fluorescence lamps could be implemented at a cost of a few dollars per person with minimum changes in infrastructure. Thus, a global capital investment of a few billion dollars could protect on the order of ∼10
