<p>The need for compact and efficient UV-C light sources clearly demands the investigation of alternative approaches besides traditional low-density discharge tubes, high-density plasmas, and the more recent LED devices. An alternative may be offered by relying on energetic free electrons as a source of excitation. Specifically, crystalline samples of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) were shown to produce intense cathodoluminescence (CL) emission at a wavelength âˆ¼215 nm upon bombardment by 20 keV electrons,

 </sup> which could even result in lasing when using an optical cavity. Initially thought to be associated with a direct band gap of this material, a subsequent study confirmed that the emission was related to the presence of an indirect band gap

 </sup> in which phonons provide the required momentum compensation during radiative de-excitation. This method was verified using field emission sources with electron energies down to 8 keV, which resulted in UV-C light generation at a wavelength of 225 nm from hBN powder,
