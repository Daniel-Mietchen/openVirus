  <p>Reduction of viral spread through UV-C light. (a) UV-C sources placed inside air-conditioning (AC) ducts. (b) UV-C collimated 
   <italic>wallpaper ceiling</italic> illumination combined with temperature-driven air circulation. (c) Direct UV-C exposure of toilets, elevators, doorways, and other small-volume spaces while not in use. (d) Local UV-C light applied to frequently used contact elements (buttons, handles, and handrails). (e) Reflecting surfaces placed near UV-C sources in ducts can create multiple light passages through the same volume of air, thus optimizing the efficiency. (f) Reflectivity of aluminum in the 200â€“280 nm UV-C range obtained from optical data;
