This is an underrecognized, hyperinflammatory syndrome characterized by sustained fever, with fulminant and fatal hypercytokinemia with multiorgan failure. These patients have a particular serum blood cytokine profile with cytopenia and hyperferritinemia. These findings also suggest that immunomodulatory therapy (IL-6 antagonist) may improve mortality rate considerably in these patients (
