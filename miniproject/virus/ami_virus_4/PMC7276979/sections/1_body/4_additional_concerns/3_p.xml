<p>As cytokines contribute to testicular function and maintenance of male reproductive health, and to the pathologies associated with their abnormal activity in this organ, COVID-19-induced changes in cytokines profile may have further implications to male fertility (

Furthermore, cytokine microenvironment deviations within the testis may have tumorigenic adverse effects on the cellular level, leading eventually to testicular cancer, a second long-term matter of concern (
