<p>To the best of our knowledge, no clinical studies on male fertility investigated survivors from the previous coronavirus epidemics, SARS-CoV (commenced in 2002) and MERS-CoV (commenced in 2012). This may be due to the fact that these viruses are much less contagious in comparison to the SARS-CoV-2, and the epidemics were short-lived and of limited scope: to date, only 8,098 and 2,538 people were infected worldwide by the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively (WHO website). It is also possible that the effect of these previous epidemics on male fertility were not explored in targeted studies. One study analyzed the pathological changes of testes from six patients who died of SARS, suggesting SARS-CoV orchitis (

SARS viral genomic sequences by in situ hybridization were not detected in all specimens, although immunohistochemistry demonstrated abundant IgG precipitation, indicating possible immune response as the cause of the damage.
