The highly contagious nature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, using ACE2 as the receptor of entry to both the lungs and testis, it is imperative to seize the opportunity to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on male fertility. One non-peer-reviewed retrospective study examined the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on male sex hormones in 81 hospitalized patients, in their third to sixth decade of age (

Serum luteinizing hormone levels were higher in the SARS-CoV-2 group compared with controls, while there were no differences in serum follicular stimulating hormone or testosterone levels. Another recent non-peer-reviewed study examined 34 recovering adult Chinese male patients, 20–55 yr of age, following confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. While six men had mild scrotal discomfort at the time of disease, suggesting viral orchitis, in none of these men was SARS-CoV-2 detected in their semen 29–36 days following recovery (
