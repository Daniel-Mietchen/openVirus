<p>Typical components of the RAAS have been found in the testis and epididymis in the human and mammalian animal models (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). For instance, the receptor Mas has been identified in rat testis (
 <xref rid="B17a" ref-type="bibr">16a</xref>) and mouse (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) testis; it starts to increase around puberty and reaches its maximal expression during reproductive life. ACE2 expression in the testis is restricted to the Leydig and Sertoli cells in humans (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Similarly, Mas mRNA in the testis is localized to Leydig and Sertoli cells, being much more pronounced in Leydig cells (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Knockout mammalian models, specifically to various components of the RAAS, such as Mas-knockout mice showed aberrant expression of genes involved in mitochondrial function and testicular steroidogenesis (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, unlike the case for alveolar cells, it is not yet known whether cells involved in spermatogenesis depend on intact ANG 1â€“7 for functional integrity, and this can be studied as a basic question in relevant model systems.
