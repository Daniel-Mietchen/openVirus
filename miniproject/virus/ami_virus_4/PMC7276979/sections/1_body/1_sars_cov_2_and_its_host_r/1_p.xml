<p>SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus, has been recently sequenced (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and has been shown to have many similarities with the original SARS-CoV, first reported in 2002. Spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have almost identical three-dimensional structures in the receptor-binding domain that maintains van der Waals forces. They have been shown to share 76.5% identity in amino acid sequences and to possess a high rate of homology (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Similar to most viruses, the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter the host cell (type 2 alveolar epithelial cells) by receptor binding followed by endocytosis, genome replication, exocytosis, and budding (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). While both viruses have been shown to recognize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as their host receptor, SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptor more efficiently than SARS-CoV, increasing its damaging pathogenicity and its ability of SARS-CoV-2 to transmit from person to person (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). ACE2 receptor recognition is the first step of viral infection, as it is the key determinant of host cell and tissue tropism, pathogenicity, and subsequent viral replication. However, ACE2, the entry receptor of the virus, also plays a crucial role against lung injury (
