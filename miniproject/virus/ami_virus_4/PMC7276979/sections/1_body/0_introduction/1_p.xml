<p>The pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), mediated by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) viral infection, is a serious, geometrically expanding, worldwide public health emergency, with newly recognized manifestations being appreciated and reported daily. The very high contagiousness of COVID-19 is largely attributed to its rapid community transmission, high virulence, and sustained surface viability. The presentation of COVID-19 varies considerably from rare asymptomatic cases, to mild flu-like symptoms, including high fever, to severe respiratory illness. The SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is a single-stranded RNA virus, with the gravest clinical pathophysiology, being a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The newly evolved virus has an estimated 10- to 15-fold greater mortality rate than the usual seasonal
