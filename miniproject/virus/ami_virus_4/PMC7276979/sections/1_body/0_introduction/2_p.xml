<p>In this perspective report, we focus on the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in different organs of the body, including the lung, heart, and kidney. We shall also discuss the physiological role of ACE2 in the testis and the theoretical adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the male reproductive system, as the virus may have the potential to use ACE2 as a route to infect this part of the body. Since there is only anecdotal evidence and concern in the literature as to the adverse effect of the coronavirus family, specifically SARS-CoV-2, on male fertility, we call for urgent targeted research on this topic to clarify this aspect from the current wave of the pandemic.</p>
