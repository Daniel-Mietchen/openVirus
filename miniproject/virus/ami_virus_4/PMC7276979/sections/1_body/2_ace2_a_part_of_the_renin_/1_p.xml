<p>ACE2 is a transmembranal zinc metallopeptidase with high homology to the classic ACE, but contains a single catalytic domain. Both ACE isoforms are part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), a cardinal endocrine system that plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance. Whereas ACE catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (ANG I) into angiotensin II (ANG II), ACE2 is responsible for the generation of angiotensin 1–7 (ANG 1–7) from ANG II. While ANG II exerts deleterious effects on the heart, lungs, kidneys, and the brain via angiotensin II type 1 (AT
 <sub>1</sub>) receptors (
