<p>ACE2 is abundant in the adult human testis, as it is in the lungs, kidney, and heart, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses ACE2 as its receptor of entry. Clinical and translational studies are needed without delay to determine the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on human spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis in the testis, to inform medical consultation with infected men, especially those in the reproductive years. This may be of greater importance for men already known to have a sperm production problem. The issue of sperm banking following SARS-CoV-2 infection and its safety should also be evaluated. Since all infertility and in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer treatments are presently deferred, this may be the best time to conduct these targeted studies before returning to our routine endeavors.</p>
