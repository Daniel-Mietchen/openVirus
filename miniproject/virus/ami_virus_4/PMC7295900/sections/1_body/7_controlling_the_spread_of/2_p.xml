<p>To control the transmission requires the identification and isolation of the infected individuals. Samples from the nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, sputum, tracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage should be tested for the detection of the virus (

Although quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the major confirmatory test however, to provide further testing support developing additional testing kits that could rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 with maximum accuracy in suspected, confirmed, and asymptomatic patients may be useful.
