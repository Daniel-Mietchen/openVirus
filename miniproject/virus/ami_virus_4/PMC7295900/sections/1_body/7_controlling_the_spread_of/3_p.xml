<p>To control the ongoing pandemic and risk of future epidemics, the development of safe and effective vaccines is necessary, that should be available for individuals at high risk of contracting COVID-19 infection. Until now, effective vaccine against COVID-19 is not available, however, some vaccines with preventive potential against COVID-19 infection are in pipeline. Such as the mRNA-based vaccine developed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in USA, is being trialed (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Nevertheless, more work is required; SARS-CoV specific live-attenuated (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and rhesus Î¸-defensin 1 and protein cage nanoparticles based vaccines can be evaluated for COVID-19 infection (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Moreover, monoclonal antibodies should be considered that are effective in inhibiting virus-cell receptor binding and virus-cell fusion (
