<p>In December 2019, clusters of patients reported with COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 were epidemiologically found linked to animals and the seafood selling market in Wuhan, China (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The zoonotic source of its origin and transmission is still debatable, however, some reports suggested bats (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) as the possible sources of transmission (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is thought to occur mainly via respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The rapid increase in suspected as well-confirmed cases has also been inferred with viral transmission through the fecal-oral route and aerosol formation. The half-life on the surfaces of stainless steel, copper, and cardboard is ~5.8 h, while that on the plastic surface is 6.8 h (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Moreover, several reports have confirmed the asymptomatic transmission while there is a chance for the animal to humans transmission (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Overall, these observations indicate that appropriate care is necessary while handling both confirmed and suspected individuals. Moreover, the surfaces of potentially virus-contaminated places, objects, and containers should be cleaned with effective disinfectants.
