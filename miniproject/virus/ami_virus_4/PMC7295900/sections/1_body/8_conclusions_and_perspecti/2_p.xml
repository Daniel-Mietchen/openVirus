<p>Given the importance of the current outbreak in Wuhan, further studies are necessary to provide deep understating of replication, pathogenesis, and biological properties using the relevant biological techniques such as reverse genetics and molecular techniques. To unveil pathogenesis and entry mechanisms further investigations should focus on structural elements ORF3b and ORF8 in novel coronavirus. These regions may play an important role in high human to human spread and may be linked to the severity of the disease. These investigations will help the control and prevention of COVID-19 mediated pneumonia and novel emerging diseases in the future. The COVID-19 outbreak has affected millions of people around the globe by causing mortalities and morbidities. Thus, curbing COVID-19 and preventing it from spreading further requires the development of effective strategies t related to detection of the virus, curing the disease, vaccination and prevention, and identification of the transmission sources. The research work should focus on preventing the spread and transmission of the virus, however, without taking effective measures the virus will come back again.</p>
