<p>The SARS-CoV-2 contains a single-stranded RNA with 29,891 nucleotides, encoding for 9,860 amino acids (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). The spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 contain two subunits (S1 and S2) (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The S2 subunit contains transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains along with fusion peptide. Novel coronavirus has over 80% identity with SARS-CoV. However, spike receptor-binding domains (RBD) are only 40% identical (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), while structural elements open reading frame (ORF)3b and ORF8 were found with no homology (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Coronaviruses contain six ORFs regions which serve as templates for the production of sub-genomic mRNAs and encode protein, spike, nucleocapsid, and membrane proteins. ORFs are responsible for the production of pp1a and pp1ab polypeptides (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infect bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes through ACE2 and CD26 receptors, respectively (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The mechanism associated with the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to investigate, however, it likely infects the bronchial cells through ACE2.
