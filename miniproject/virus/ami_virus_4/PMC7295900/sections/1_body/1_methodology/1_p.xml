<p>To identify and select the papers in this review we searched the published research and review articles relevant to origin and outbreaks of three human coronaviruses, and features, transmission, spread, entry mechanisms, infectiousness, control strategies, and animals hosts for SARS-CoV-2. We also search the papers published on SARS and MERS coronaviruses in the aspects of animal models and sources of transmission. We reviewed the World Health Organization, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nature reports, Medline, PubMed Central, Embase, google scholar, and ScienceDirect, according to the relevancy as explained earlier, until April 20, 2020. The search terms “novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, SARS and MERS” were broadly used. Studies conducted in laboratory and clinical based observations, and/or conducted through bioinformatics techniques were included.</p>
