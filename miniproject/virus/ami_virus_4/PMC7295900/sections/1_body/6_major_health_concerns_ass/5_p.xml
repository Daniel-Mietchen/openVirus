<p>COVID-19 infection in pregnant women is of serious concern, as it might have detrimental effects not only on mother's health but also on neonatal health can be at risk (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). In a recent study, COVID-19 infection was found to cause adverse neonatal outcomes. Two of the neonates were tested positive, and for COVID-19 while, five were found with neonatal pneumonia, suggesting the possibility of a link between adverse pregnancy outcomes and COVID-19 infection (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>) reported a newborn with elevated IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, who was born to a mother with COVID-19, suggesting the possibility of vertical transmission. Therefore, further investigations should focus on adverse pregnancy outcomes and the possibility of vertical transmission. The approach to prevention, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of pregnant women with suspected COVID-19 should be similar to that in non-pregnant individuals, with the consideration that pregnant women with other potentially severe respiratory infections, such as influenzaappear to be more vulnerable to developing severe sequelae. Moreover, pregnant women should be given attention and provided with the utmost facilities in terms of treatment and diagnosis.
