<p>According to the CDC report on coronavirus disease, individuals with underlying chronic medical conditions are at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 infection. Huang et al. reported that 32% of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals had diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The fatality rate was also high in individuals who had diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), cerebrovascular diseases (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), and hypertension (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Furthermore, COVID-19 infection in patients with lung cancer can develop severe COVID-19 disease that can lead to death (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Luo et al. (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) reported that more than half of the COVID-19 infected individuals who had lung cancer, needed hospitalization, whereas nearly a quarter of them died. However, people living with human immunodeficiency virus do not present excess morbidity and mortality among symptomatic COVID-19 patients (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The higher risk of disease and death in individuals with underlying diseases might be linked with weaker or comprised immune responses.
