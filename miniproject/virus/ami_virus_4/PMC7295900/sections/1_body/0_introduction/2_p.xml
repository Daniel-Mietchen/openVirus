<p>During the early days of the epidemic in China, a number of countries suspended travel to and from China, evacuated their nationals from the epicenter, and placed them in quarantine to curb the risks of pandemic (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). These responses were not sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19, therefore, it became a global pandemic (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Considering the seriousness of this situation scientists and medical researchers came forward and extended their services to the development of therapeutic strategies, preventive measures, and strategies to control the unfolding pandemic. Until now, researchers have unveiled some of the important biological and clinical features for COVID-19 infection, including the characterization of the whole genome (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and spike glycoproteins (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), investigation of clinical features and evaluation of different broad-spectrum antiviral drugs in combination with either antibacterial, antimalarial and/or traditional Chinese medicines (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Nevertheless, more research work is required to further investigate the sources of transmission, the biology of viral incubation and reemergence, and the potential of vertical transmission from mothers to neonates. In this article, we discuss the features of coronaviruses, the mechanism of infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2, and its medical consequences. We also describe the populations at higher risk and challenges in research progress. This narrative review article will benefit the public and scientific community regarding the current progress and the need for further work.
