<p>Although investigating the mechanisms underlying entry to host cell, transmission, polybasic cleavage, and predicted O-linked glycans are required to determine the research gaps associated with transmission and origination, however, this work requires suitable animal models. Unfortunately, there is no promising model while the non-human primates tested for SARS and MERS were unable to develop severe diseases in response to the infectiousness (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Nevertheless, the models developed for the expression of human ACE2 and DPP4 (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) can be further modified and used to study the transmission and infectiousness of SARS-CoV02. Moreover, CRISPR-interceded genetically modified small animals can be also utilized for the study of the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Nevertheless, it is important to investigate the ultimate source of viral transfer to humans, as even if the virus is eradicated with social distancing, other sources including zoonotic and environmental sources can again cause the transfer into humans, and thus another outbreak will be the result.
