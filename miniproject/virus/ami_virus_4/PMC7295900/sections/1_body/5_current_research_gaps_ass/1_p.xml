<p>After the identification of SARS-CoV-2, debates started among scientists on its sources of origination and zoonotic source of transmission to humans (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). The identity of the animal source of SARS-CoV-2, is still one of the key missing gaps that scientists are being racing to investigate. It is a known fact that coronaviruses circulate in mammals and birds (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and researchers have already suggested bats to be the source of origination for SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). However, an intermediate animal was probably the source of transmission of the virus to humans. Early claims came from researchers related to intermediate sources of transmission faced controversies (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). A recent report discredited an earlier statement that pangolin could be the possible intermediate source that might have received the virus from the bat and transferred it to humans (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). According to more recent study on molecular and phylogenetic analyses, it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 emerged directly from the pangolin coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), suggesting that pangolins may not be responsible for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans.
