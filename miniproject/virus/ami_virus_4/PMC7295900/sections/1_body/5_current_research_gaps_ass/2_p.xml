<p>With further spread of the virus after its outbreak in Wuhan, more people became infected, thus, human to human transmission became more evident. One of the reasons for the high rate of infectiousness in humans is thought to be the higher affinity of RBD for binding to ACE2 receptors (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In addition, the determination of host range and binding to the ACE2 are highly dependent on six RBD amino acids “L455, F486, Q493, S494, N501, and Y505 in SARS-CoV-2” in SARS-CoV-2, thus, RBD can also bind to ACE2 from ferrets and cats (
