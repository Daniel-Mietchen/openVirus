<p>We believe that breast milk, particularly lactoferrin, demonstrates potential antiviral effects. The challenge is how effective they are at preventing viral infections, like coronaviruses. The way lactoferrin acts on cell receptors prevents viral anchoring, surface accumulation and cell entry. Further clinical evidence is needed, but we believe that early breastfeeding provides vital prevention during viral epidemics, due to the high value of colostrum and breast milk and the specific role of lactoferrin.</p>
