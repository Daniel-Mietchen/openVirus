<p>The COVID‐19 pandemic raises issues about breastfeeding when mothers have tested positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). We do not know whether the virus can be passed to a foetus or baby during pregnancy or delivery, and it has not been found in amniotic fluid or breast milk.

 </xref> Separating babies from virus‐positive mothers make breastfeeding problematic and could prevent possible protection against viruses.

 </xref> Lactoferrin is a protective factor in mother's milk and a key component of the mammalian innate response to infections. This whey protein has several biological functions, including binding and releasing iron. It also inhibits the growth of many pathogens, by mechanisms such as disrupting cell membranes, sequestering iron, inhibiting microbial adhesion to host cells and preventing biofilm formation.

 </xref> Lactoferrin is very similar between species, and the homology between humans and cattle is 77%. It is produced and secreted by glandular epithelial cells, with a peak concentration in colostrum (8 mg/mL), lower levels in mature milk (3.5‐4 mg/mL) and even lower levels in exocrine secretions. Levels in breast milk decrease over time, and preterm infants can receive the highest concentrations for the longest periods, which could reduce the very high risk of sepsis from intestinal and respiratory tracts. Lactoferrin's antimicrobial actions have controversially demonstrated clinical efficacy in preventing sepsis in high‐risk preterm infants. Bovine lactoferrin supplements have significantly decreased late sepsis or necrotising enterocolitis in some studies,

 </xref> Lactoferrin inhibited both the attack and growth of the respiratory syncytial virus, interacting directly with the virus’ F protein, which is the most important surface glycoprotein for viral penetration. Both bovine and human lactoferrin prevented infection in vitro in a dose‐dependent manner, inhibiting the synthesis of adenovirus antigens in the first stage of infection. This happened when lactoferrin was added to cell cultures before the viral attack, interfering with the primary receptors present at the cellular level. While lactoferrin does not seem to inhibit rhinovirus replication, using bovine lactoferrin to treat influenza A virus in vitro inhibited cell apoptosis induced by viral effectors.
