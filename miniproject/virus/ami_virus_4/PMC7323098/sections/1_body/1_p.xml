<p>Lactoferrin can prevent viral infections by interacting with heparin sulphate glycosaminoglycan (HSPG) cell receptors, which allow the first anchoring site on the cell surface in the first phase of virus infections and in coronaviruses in particular. After anchoring, the viruses accumulate on the cell surface and recognise more virus‐specific receptors. These include the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, a metallopeptidase that can hook the virus terminals and facilitate entry into the cell.

 </xref> These mechanisms were seen in the 2002 SARS‐CoV epidemic and are almost the same for SARS‐CoV‐2. We know that SARS‐CoV‐2 can enter cells through ACE2 receptors on the surface of the cell membrane. Lang et al found that lactoferrin interfered with how SARS‐CoV entered human cultured cells. It inhibited the infection by competitively localising to the virus anchoring sites provided by HSPGs, preventing the preliminary contact between the SARS‐CoV and host cells. Lactoferrin blocked the interaction between spike viral protein and HSPGs in an ACE2‐independent fashion. This mechanism significantly interfered with viral anchoring and prevented the subsequent mechanisms that allow the viral concentration on the cell surface, as well as the contact with the specific entry receptors, namely ACE2, that results in the full infection.
