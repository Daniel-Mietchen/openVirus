<p>While SARS‐CoV‐2 is thought to mainly transmit via respiratory droplets, it can invade enterocytes, causing symptoms and acting as a reservoir. Gastrointestinal symptoms can be the first clinical manifestation in infants.

 </xref> Furthermore, early breast milk and lactoferrin can promote a local gut environment, namely microbiota plus tight junctions, that reinforces the innate defences of neonates. Lactoferrin promotes the growth of favourable gut microbiota and the proliferation of enterocytes with direct anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions. These maintain and reinforce mucosal immunity and the gut epithelial barrier. These effects and mechanisms have not been tested on SARS‐CoV‐2, but clinicians could consider this approach, as they have affected other coronaviruses. Most (79%) of the SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 have identical sequences, and their receptor‐binding domain structure is also very similar.
