<p>Two phase I clinical trials of experimental H7N9 VLP vaccines with, and without, adjuvant have been completed, NCT01897701 and NCT02078674. The first study enrolled 284 adults (â‰¥18 years of age) in a randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial [

Interestingly enough, significant increases in N9 neuraminidase-inhibiting antibodies occurred in up to 71.9% of recipients of the vaccine without adjuvant, 92.0% of recipients of vaccine with 30 units of adjuvant, and 97.2% of recipients of vaccine with 60 units of adjuvant. Remarkably, the vaccines that were studied were released for human use within 3 months after the availability of the HA and NA sequences. This illustrates the possibility of rapid response to the public health emergency situations, such as in the case of pandemic influenza outbreaks, as well as other health emergencies such as the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.
