<p>IAV are further sub-divided based on the antigenic properties of surface glycoproteins into 18 hemagglutinin (HA) and 11 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes. Only a few IAV subtypes have been known to infect humans, while the majority of them are harbored in their natural hosts such as waterfowl, shorebirds, and other species [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cases of H7N9 human infections caused by an avian-origin H7N9 virus emerged in eastern China in March 2013 [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This novel virus has immediately raised pandemic concerns as historically, pandemics were caused by the introduction of new subtypes into immunologically na√Øve human populations [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Phylogenetic results indicate that novel H7N9 virus was a triple reassortant derived from avian influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since 2013, surveillance of live poultry markets routinely detected H7N9 virus [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Human infections with H7N9 virus were associated mainly with the exposure to infected poultry [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and were identified in many cities in China [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Both low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) H7N9 viruses have been recorded. The first wave of H7N9 was associated with LPAI virus and lasted from March until September 2013. The following four waves occurred annually until 2017 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00518-f001">Figure 1</xref>). During the fifth wave in the 2016/17 season, the emergence of HPAI H7N9 viruses was detected. After no reported human cases of HPAI H7N9 for over a year, another HPAI H7N9 case with severe disease was reported in mainland China in late March 2019, indicating the continuing public health threat from the H7N9 subtype [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. HPAI subtype H5 and H7 proteins contain multiple basic amino acid cleavage sites between HA1 and HA2 domains within HA proteins, which can be cleaved by furin-like proteases [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in many host cells and organs that can lead to the efficient spread of the virus and severe disease in humans. In contrast, HA of LPAI viruses does not have the furin cleavage site.
