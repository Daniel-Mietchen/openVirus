<p>Influenza viruses belong to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family and comprise negative-sense, single stranded, segmented RNA genome. The RNA genome segments are loosely encapsidated by the nucleoprotein into virus particle. There are four types of influenza virusâ€”types A, B, C, and D. Influenza A viruses (IAV) and type B viruses are clinically relevant for humans.
