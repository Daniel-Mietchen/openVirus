<p>A fatality rate of up to 38% was reported for H7N9 viruses [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which highlights the need for a safe and effective vaccine [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Several candidate H7N9 vaccine viruses have been prepared and listed by WHO (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00518-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). These candidate vaccine viruses are available to vaccine developers for the preparation of H7N9 vaccine in the case of a pandemic. The majority of current vaccine manufacturers prepare vaccines either as split subvirions or live-attenuated viruses, and they are mostly dependent on fertilized chicken eggs as production “bioreactors”. This technology is unlikely to meet the vaccine production demand during the rapid pandemic spread [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Scalability issues (one vaccine dose/egg), the relatively long 6-month time period from strain isolation to final dose formulation and the requirement of biosecurity facilities for HPAI are the major obstacles for egg-based production [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, IAV can acquire adaptive mutations when grown in eggs, which can interfere with the vaccine performance and efficacy. According to the action plan published by WHO in 2006, more than 2.34 billion monovalent vaccine doses will be needed in the case of a global pandemic, which justifies the development of novel technologies capable of supporting surge demand for pandemic influenza vaccine within a short period of time [
