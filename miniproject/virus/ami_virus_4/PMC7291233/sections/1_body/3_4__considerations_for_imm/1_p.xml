<p>As noted above, immunization with VLPs have shown promising results in protecting from influenza infections with H7N9 [

For example, it has been shown that amino acid residues of HA that are related to receptor specificity can affect the protective efficacy of H5N1 and H7N9 vaccines in mice [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. H7N9 VLP vaccine that contained L226 (mammalian specificity) and G228 (avian specificity) in HA showed better immunogenicity and protection efficacy than VLP containing HA with either L226 + S228 or Q226 + S228. This observation indicated that specific HA residues could enhance a vaccineâ€™s protection efficacy and HA glycoproteins with both avian-type and human-type receptor specificities may produce better pandemic influenza vaccines for humans [
