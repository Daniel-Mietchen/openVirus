<p>One way to achieve protection against multiple strains and increase the breadth of immune response afforded by VLPs can be a blended formulation of monovalent vaccines. A vaccine was prepared by mixing VLPs that display H1, H3, H5 or H7 HA molecules. Mice vaccinated with these VLPs intranasally showed significant protection (94% aggregate survival following vaccination) against 1918 H1, 1957 H2, and avian H5, H6, H7, H10 and H11 HA subtypes [
