<p>By using Group antigen (Gag) derived from bovine retrovirus as a VLP core in place of M1 protein, quadri-subtype VLPs were prepared, which co-expressed within the VLP the four HA subtypes derived from avian-origin H5N1, H7N9, H9N2 and H10N8 viruses. VLPs showed hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities and reacted with specific antisera [

Antiserum was also evaluated for cross-reaction with multiple clades of H5N1 virus, and cross-reactivity has been confirmed. The level of immune response suggests protection against multiple influenza subtypes, which was experimentally confirmed by challenge with H10 IAV. Ferrets were protected from challenge with H10 virus [

 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="B86-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Multi-subtype mosaic VLPs combine advantages of conserved HA epitope and blended VLPs, as VLPs contain both subtype-specific head epitopes and the conserved stem epitopes.
