<p>Recently, a VLP preparation consisting of retroviral Gag-VLPs pseudo-typed with the HA was expressed using the novel 
 <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> (
 <italic>T.ni</italic>)-derived insect cell line 
 <italic>Tnms</italic>42 and tested successfully to assess the sole contribution of anti-HA immunity in limiting post-influenza secondary 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacterial infection, morbidity and mortality in a situation of a vaccine match and mismatch [
 <xref rid="B87-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The results demonstrate that matched anti-HA immunity elicited by a VLP preparation may suffice to prevent morbidity and mortality caused by lethal secondary bacterial infection.
