<p>Current annual vaccines (inactivated, live attenuated, and recombinant subunit) protect from circulating, antigenically matching IAV and influenza B virus strains. Broad protection is difficult to achieve because of the frequent emergence of new strains [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Therefore, current approved and experimental vaccines have limited protection against antigenically mismatched variants and newly emerging viral strains. For new strains, antigenically matching new vaccines have to be developed within short periods of time. Therefore, vaccines are needed that can protect from an antigenically divergent strain, especially from potentially pandemic viruses with a new HA subtype. In addition to H7N9 virus described above, multiple other viruses with pandemic potential, including H5N1, H9N2, and H10N8 subtypes, that have caused human infections in the past, continue to circulate in birds and other animals. Therefore, vaccines capable of protecting against multiple potentially pandemic influenza strains would be advantageous for pandemic preparedness and public health.
