<p>Potentially, HA molecules from different subtypes can be co-localized within recombinant VLP envelope for broader immune coverage. A multi-subtype, mosaic VLP design containing three or four subtypes of the full-length rHA within the envelope has also been described [

 <xref rid="B71-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A triple-subtype VLP contained HA proteins from the potentially pandemic H5N1, H7N2, and H9N2 subtypes [

A recombinant baculovirus vector was prepared to co-express the H5, H7, and H9 genes from A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1), A/New York/107/2003 (H7N2) and A/Hong Kong/33982/2009 (H9N2) viruses, respectively, as well as NA and M1 genes from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus. VLPs were prepared in Sf9 cells, and the immunogenicity and efficacy of the resulting H5/H7/H9 VLPs were evaluated in a ferret animal model following intranasal (i.n.) vaccination. We showed that i.n. vaccination with the H5/H7/H9 triple-subtype VLP induced immune responses and protected ferrets from experimental challenges with three subtypes of avian influenza viruses [
