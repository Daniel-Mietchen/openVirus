<p>In another study, the globular head domain (HA1-2, aa 62â€“284) of the protective H7 HA was fused to the potent TLR5 ligand, 
 <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> flagellin (FliC) [
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. The resulting fusion protein, HA1-2-fliC, which apparently did not form VLPs, was efficiently expressed in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, retained the native HA and fliC conformations, and was highly immunogenic in mice by intraperitoneal vaccination. Furthermore, highly immunogenic influenza VLPs have been prepared via the overexpression of four viral proteins, HA, NA, M1, and M2, using M2 fusion with the FliC [
