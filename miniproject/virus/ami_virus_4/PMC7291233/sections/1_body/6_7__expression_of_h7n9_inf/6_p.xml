<p>High immunogenicity in mice, even in the absence of adjuvants, was demonstrated by the M2e displayed on VLPs of

 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. This novel vaccine candidate was tested by the H1N1 and H3N2 challenge in mice, and potentially, it can be universal and applicable to H7N9 virus. In another example, the M2e proteins, as well as NA, were expressed on recombinant
