<p>Other universal influenza vaccine approaches applicable to H7N9 were based on ion channel protein M2. Extracellular part of M2 protein, ~23 aa residues, is highly conserved among human IAV strains, suggesting its potential utility as a broadly protective immunogen for the development of broadly protective influenza vaccines. Tandem repeats of heterologous M2e sequences (M2e5x) derived from human, swine, and avian origin influenza A viruses were expressed on influenza VLPs in a membrane-anchored form. Immunization of mice with M2e5x VLPs induced antibodies that were cross-reactive to antigenically distinct influenza A viruses and conferred cross-protection [
