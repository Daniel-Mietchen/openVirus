<p>The emerging strains potentially can be also targeted by “universal” vaccines consisting of conserved viral proteins or epitopes, such as stem region of HA, or extracellular domain M2e of the ion channel protein M2, which are both considered capable of inducing cross-reactive immune responses. Targeting the stem region of HA for antibody production could be a promising approach to generate a broadly protective influenza vaccine. The immune response can be elicited against both the head and stem region of HA protein. However, because of the constantly changing nature of the head region due to the antigenic drift, new vaccine candidates need to be updated frequently. Since the stem region is evolutionally more stable and more conserved among different influenza strains, vaccine candidates targeting the stem region might not need to be updated every year and could induce a broad range of protective immunity against different influenza strains [

 <xref rid="B93-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. However, the stem region is less immunogenic in the virus. Therefore, chimeric VLP approaches have been used to elicit antibodies to the stem region of HA. The long alpha-helix (LAH) region located in influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) shows conservation among different influenza A strains, and could be used as a candidate target for influenza vaccines. The hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) was used as a carrier for heterologous LAH epitopes to elicit effective immune responses [

Intranasal immunization of the LAH-HBc VLP in combination with chitosan adjuvant or CTB∗ adjuvant in mice induced both humoral and cellular immune responses effectively and conferred complete protection against lethal challenge with homologous H7N9 virus or heterologous H3N2 virus, as well as partial protection against lethal challenge of heterologous H1N1 virus. These results provide a proof of concept for LAH-HBc VLP vaccine that can be rapidly produced and potentially can serve as an antigen against a future influenza pandemic [
