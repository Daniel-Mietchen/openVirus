<p>To overcome manufacturing challenges, technological improvements to production of H7N9 VLPs in baculovirus-Sf9 insect cell cultures have been reported [

 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. The yield and quality of influenza VLPs produced in insect cells could be improved by inhibiting cytopathic effects of the protein M2 [
 <xref rid="B62-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. The ion channel activity of M2 induces significant cytopathic effects in Sf9 insect cells. These effects include altered Sf9 cell morphology and reduced baculovirus replication, resulting in impaired influenza protein expression and thus VLP production. The use of the M2 inhibitor amantadine indeed improved Sf9 cellular expression not only of M2 (∼three-fold), but also of HA (∼seven-fold) and of matrix protein M1 (∼three-fold) when co-expressed to produce influenza VLPs. This increased cellular expression of all three influenza proteins further led to ∼two-fold greater VLP yield. The quality of the resulting influenza VLPs was significantly improved, as demonstrated by the ∼two-fold, ∼50-fold, and ∼two-fold increase in the antigen density to approximately 53 HA, 48 M1, and 156 M2 per influenza VLP, respectively [
