 <italic>Tnms</italic>42 insect cells using the baculovirus insect cell expression vector system [
 <xref rid="B116-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. The absence of the baculovirus capsid protein p39 in the product fraction was confirmed by HPLC-MS. The process is simple and includes only a few handling steps, which has promising characteristics to become a platform for purification of these types of VLPs [
