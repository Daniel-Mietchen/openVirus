<p>Heterogenous composition is one of the challenges associated with the use of influenza VLPs as a vaccine candidate. VLPs produced by using baculovirus expression system contain live baculovirus vector as impurity. Moreover, considerable fraction of HA protein is bound to viral envelope of baculovirus [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish whether the HA activity is associated with influenza VLP or with baculovirus-displayed HA in the unpurified samples during vaccine manufacturing, which also causes difficulty for HA quantification. VLPs produced from mammalian expression system do not contain baculovirus contamination but they contain extracellular particles and produce low yields, with VLPs needing to be concentrated up to 200 times to reach measurable titers [

The current methods that are used for quantification are mostly applicable to concentrated and purified VLPs; however, better methods need to be developed to characterize the materials at the different stage of bioprocessing during the manufacturing process. Other potential challenges include the presence of endogenous rhabdovirus in standard Sf9 cell lines [
