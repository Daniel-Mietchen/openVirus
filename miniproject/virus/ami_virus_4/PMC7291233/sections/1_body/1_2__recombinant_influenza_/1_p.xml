<p>Recently, several new platform technologies including recombinant VLPs have been developed in order to facilitate the scale-up of vaccine production including overcoming the drawbacks of the egg-based vaccine production method. The first recombinant influenza vaccine FluBlok based on HA antigen has received FDA approval [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The surface envelope glycoproteins such as influenza HA and NA generally are viewed as the primary targets for vaccine development. HA currently represents the major target for vaccine development including approved and experimental vaccines [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Recombinant HA-based vaccines have been shown to be efficacious against influenza including H7N9 [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Experimental NA-based vaccines have been reported [

The induction of immune responses against the surface envelope proteins has advantages, because virus-neutralizing antibody response to the viral envelope proteins can prevent early steps of viral infection. Human monoclonal antibodies targeting the HA glycoprotein can neutralize H7N9 influenza virus [
