<p>As VLPs closely resemble viruses, they contain immunological epitopes in the natural conformation, are highly immunogenic, but they are non-infectious because they are prepared in the absence of viral genomic RNA segments. Each VLP represents a repetitive and highly organized molecular array of antigens displayed on the VLP surface. VLPs have been shown to be better immunogens than subunit vaccines because of their self-adjuvant properties [
