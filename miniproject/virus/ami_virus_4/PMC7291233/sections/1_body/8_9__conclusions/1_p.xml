<p>Recombinant VLPs were developed with the purpose of rapidly preparing influenza vaccines including against pandemic threat viruses such as H7N9 virus. Multiple designs of VLPs have been evaluated including the use of multivalent VLPs, multi-subtype mosaic VLP, and rationally designed VLPs containing conserved influenza virus epitopes. The use of highly conserved epitopes remains a promising approach for the improved design of highly immunogenic VLPs. Blended VLPs have been used as a classic approach to broaden immune coverage. Multi-subtype mosaic VLPs potentially combine the conserved epitope and blended approaches, as VLPs contain both subtype-specific head epitopes and the conserved stem epitopes. In addition to VLPs, other novel technologies have been used to develop improved influenza vaccines including DNA vaccines, viral vectors, advanced adjuvants, and other approaches. Potentially, the combination of various technologies can prove beneficial for the development of next-generation influenza vaccines including H7N9.</p>
