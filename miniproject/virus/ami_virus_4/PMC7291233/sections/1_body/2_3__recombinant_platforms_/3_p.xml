<p>H7N9 VLPs have been prepared from the full-length HA, NA, and matrix M1 genes in Sf9 cells. The H7 HA was derived from A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9) virus, while both NA and M1 proteins were derived from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) virus, a standard donor virus that is often used for preparation of influenza reassortant viruses used in human influenza vaccine production [
