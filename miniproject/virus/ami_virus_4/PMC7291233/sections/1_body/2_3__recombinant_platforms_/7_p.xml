<p>Another recombinant influenza vaccine was developed by expressing H7 from H7N9 (A/Shanghai/2/2013) on the surface of recombinant baculovirus. Although this approach would not result in a typical influenza VLP morphology, the spatial conformation of H7 in the resulting vaccine is expected to be similar to that in an influenza virion or in a cognate VLP. Mice were immunized twice, either intranasally or subcutaneously, with the vaccine. The immunogenicity and cross-protective efficacy of the vaccine were evaluated against H7N9 or H7N7 subtype challenges. The authors concluded that intranasal administration of H7 protein expressed on the baculovirus envelope can be an alternative way to prime the immune system against influenza infection during a pandemic situation [

The recombinant baculovirus-HA generated in this study showed favorable growth characteristics in insect cells, good safety profile, and induced high-level hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer. Moreover, this vaccine demonstrated better efficacy than inactivated whole-virus vaccine JX148, provided complete protection of chickens against challenge with HPAI H7N9 virus, and effectively inhibited viral shedding.
