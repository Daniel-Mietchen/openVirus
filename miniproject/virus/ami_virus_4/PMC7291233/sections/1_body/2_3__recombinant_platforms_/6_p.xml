<p>The immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a H7N9 VLP vaccine were evaluated in the ferret challenge model considered the most appropriate animal model for influenza [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00518" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Purified recombinant H7N9 VLPs morphologically resembled influenza virions and elicited high-titer serum HAI and neutralizing antibodies to A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus. H7N9 VLP-immunized ferrets were challenged with homologous virus. After challenge, VLP-vaccinated animals displayed reductions in fever, weight loss, and virus shedding as compared to the same parameters in the unimmunized control ferrets. H7N9 VLP was also effective in protecting against lung and tracheal infection. The addition of either ISCOMATRIX or Matrix-M1 adjuvant further improved immunogenicity and protection of the VLP vaccine against H7N9 virus [
