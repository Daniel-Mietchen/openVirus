<p>The recombinant platforms using either mammalian, insect, or plant cells have many potential advantages including scalability and intrinsic safety, especially for HPAI viruses such as H7N9 (

Mammalian cells, such as MDCK, Vero and PERC.C6 cell lines have been extensively studied and applied to influenza vaccine production. The use of VLPs expressed from mammalian cell platform has advantages for VLP production such as flexibility and a similar glycosylation pattern to the human virus. In some reports, VLPs expressed from HEK293T cells containing HA and NA proteins on their surface with a HA:NA ratio of 1:1, which is higher than natural influenza viruses, where the HA:NA ratio is 4:1 [

However, production of VLPs in mammalian cell expression system is difficult to scale up to the commercial scale, especially when using the transient transfection method. This limitation can be addressed by preparing stable cell line of corresponding genes. For example, a stable cell line expressing H1 and N1 genes under the cumate inducible promoter was generated to create 293HA-NA cells. Plasmid with either Gag or M1 gene was transiently transfected in 293HA-NA cells and VLP yield was compared with Gag or M1 protein. 293HA-NA cells produced seven times more HA and NA with Gag plasmid transfected cells than its counterpart matrix M1-encoding plasmid [

Gag VLPs produced by this approach elicited strong antibody response and provided complete protection against the homologous virus strain. Optimization of cell density at the time of induction in inducible stable HEK293 cell lines also increased VLP yield by five-fold [
