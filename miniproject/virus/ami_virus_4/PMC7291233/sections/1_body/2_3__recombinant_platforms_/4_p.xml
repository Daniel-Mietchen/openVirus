<p>In another study, recombinant H7N9 VLP vaccine was prepared from HA and NA derived from the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus and the matrix M1 protein derived from the H5N1 virus (A/Indonesia/05/2005) [

The H7N9 VLPs elicited hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) antibody response against the homologous H7N9 virus, cross-reactive HAI against the heterologous H7N3 virus, and three- to four-fold higher HAI response if VLPs were administered with ISCOMATRIXâ„¢ saponin-based adjuvant. Similarly, all doses of H7N9 VLP elicited anti-NA antibody, with three- to four-fold higher responses measured in the corresponding ISCOMATRIX subgroups. A lethal murine wild-type A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) challenge demonstrated 100% survival of all animals receiving H7N9 or H7N3 VLP vaccines, versus 0% survival in A(H5N1) vaccine and placebo groups [
