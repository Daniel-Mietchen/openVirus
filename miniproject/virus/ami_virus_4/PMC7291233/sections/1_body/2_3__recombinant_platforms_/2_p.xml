<p>Insect cells such as Sf9 can be maintained in serum-free suspension cultures and have been often used to prepare recombinant VLPs including H7N9. When influenza VLPs were compared between insect Sf9 cells and mammalian HEK293 suspension cells, Thompson et al. found that Sf9 cells produce approximately 35 times more VLP than HEK293 cells [

However, VLPs generated in HEK293 cells contained extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes and microvesicles. VLPs produced from Sf9 insect cells may have a safety advantage over other expression system because insect cells are unlikely to contain human pathogens, and baculovirus vector cannot replicate in human cells. VLPs produced from insect cells show higher yields as compared to mammalian cell-produced VLPs, which is beneficial for commercial production. In the above study, Sf9 cells produced up to 35 times higher yield than the HEK293 cellsâ€™ expression system [
