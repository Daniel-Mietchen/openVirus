  <p>Electron microscopy images of influenza VLPs prepared in Sf9 cells using baculovirus expression system. Recombinant VLPs contain three subtypes (H5, H7, H9), morphologically and biochemically are similar to the wild type influenza virus, and can be found as individual particles (left) or groups of particles (right). Characterization of triple-subtype VLPs was done by negative staining transmission electron microscopy. (Adapted from [
