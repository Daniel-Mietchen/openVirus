 <caption>
  <p>An example of expression of influenza epitope using chimeric VLP based on recombinant LAH3-HBc gene. Design (
   <bold>a</bold>) and cartoon (
   <bold>b</bold>) of the LAH3-HBc dimer. Individual hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) monomers are shown in green and orange. The first major immunodominant region (MIR) contains the LAH domain (the 55 amino acid long influenza H3N2 virus (A/Hong Kong/1/1968, Accession No. AAK51718) HA stalk domain, corresponding to HA amino acids 420â€“474, shown as pink spheres) while the second MIR contains lysine linker (blue spheres)). The model was created using PyMOL version 1.7rc1. The tandem core dimer is based on the structure from PDB-1QGT, with the linker shown in black.
