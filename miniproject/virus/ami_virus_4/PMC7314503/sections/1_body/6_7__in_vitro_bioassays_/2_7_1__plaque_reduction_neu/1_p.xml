<p>Plate-reduction neutralization test is used to titer neutralizing antibody for a virus. The serum or antibody to be screened is diluted and combined with a viral suspension. The antibody is incubated with the isolated virus and then transferred on host adhering cells. The surface of the cell layer is coated with a layer of agar or carboxymethyl cellulose to prevent the indiscriminate spread of the virus (Schmidt et al., 1976). The concentration of plaque-forming units can be estimated by the number of plaques (regions of infected cells) formed after a few days. Depending on the virus, the plate builder units may be determined through microscopic examination, or with specific dyes that react with fluorescent antibodies or infected cells. The concentration of serum indicates how many antibodies are detected or how effective it is in the reduction of the number of plaques by 50% compared to the serum-free virus. This calculation is defined as the value of PRNT50.</p>
