<p>In a standard CPE (cytopathic effects) assay, a monolayer of cells is infected with a virus and then monitored for several days (or weeks) of morphological changes. The changes are expressed in distinct points corresponding to the sites of infection. Plaque assay has been the method of choice for several decades, where, shortly after the infection, the monolayer of cells is overlaid with semisolid material such as agarose. There are some variations in the plaque assays (with or without staining cells, for example), however, all of them are labour-intensive, human dependent and hands-on jobs; thus, the determination of CPE is difficult. Therefore, it would be helpful to opt for using a more efficient and higher throughput alternative to traditional CPE assays: a real-time cell analysis (RTCA) system which is based on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing technology that can monitor cytopathic effects.</p>
