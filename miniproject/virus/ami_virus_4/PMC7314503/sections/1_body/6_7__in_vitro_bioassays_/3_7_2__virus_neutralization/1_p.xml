<p>Virus neutralization assay is used in combination with an infection experiment, such as PRNT. This assay detects a neutralizing antibody that can stop virus replication. Sera or culture supernatants are diluted and mixed with the virus (the virus titer can be determined per PRNT50, etc.). The mixtures are incubated approximately for 45 minutes at room temperature, and then the mixture is added on suitable cell lines (Vero, Vero6, etc.) and the cells are incubated for 3 days at 37 Â°C (Traggiai et al., 2004; Xiong et al., 2020).</p>
