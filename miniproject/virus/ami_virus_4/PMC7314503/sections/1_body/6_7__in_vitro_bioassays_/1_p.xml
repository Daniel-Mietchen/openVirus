<p>Once NAbs are developed, it is vital to test them for their neutralizing efficiency. In other words, it is crucial to show that the virus, which has the power to create an infection, is effectively eliminated/neutralized by in vitro and in vivo systems. To this end, easy and safe screening methods –like ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR)– could be helpful in decreasing the number of NAbs to be tested in neutralization assays. These screening methods would give an idea about the blocking capability of the NAbs on the viral spike protein and ACE2 interaction. Thus, the neutralization assays would be concentrated on the most potent NAbs.</p>
