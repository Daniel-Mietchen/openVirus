<p>There are many methods available for the development of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), including the transformation of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the use of phage-display libraries, the mammalian cell systems (i.e. CHO or NS0 transfectomas) to recombinantly produce mAbs by the immunization of transgenic mice carrying human Ig genes (xenomice), the molecular techniques focused on antigen-specific B cell isolation of Ig genes and finally the hybridoma technology. Each of these methods has certain advantages and restrictions that determine their use for other purposes which is described elsewhere (Li et al., 2006; Gorny, 2012).</p>
