<p>Classical hybridoma technology includes the vaccination of mice with specific antigens and the development of hybridoma cells by the fusion of antibody-producing B lymphocytes and immortal myeloma cells. The fusion merges the cytoplasms of the 2 beneficial somatic cells with the help of a chemical agent (polyethylene glycol) (Galfre and Milstein, 1982). Effective immunization is essential to obtain a strong and target-specific antibody response from mice. Immunization is done either by using the whole/a part of an antigen or antigenic peptides for which immunogenicity is enhanced by conjugating them to a larger and immunogenic carrier molecules such as KLH, BSA or ovalbumin (Fuentes, 2005; Ertekin, 2013). </p>
