<p>Wang et al., 2020, screened the supernatants of 51 SARS-S hybridomas derived from immunized transgenic H2L2 mice that encode chimeric immunoglobulins (human variable regions and rat constant regions) against SARS-CoV-2 S2-S1 region. Four of the supernatants displayed cross-reactivity with the subunits S2 and S1 of SARS-CoV-2. One of these hybridoma supernatants (47D11) revealed neutralizing activity in pseudotyped virus neutralization assay. The chimeric 47D11 was then reformatted into a fully human antibody. They hypothesized that this antibody is neutralizing both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through a different binding region than the expected RBD-ACE2 binding. </p>
