<p>B cells that produce antibodies in the spleen and lymph nodes of animals, immunized with the target antigen, are fused with myeloma cells to form immortal antibody-producing cell lines. The basis of monoclonal antibody technology is to ensure the recognition of a single epitope and the production of antibodies by hybrid cell lines. Therefore, the antibody activities after fusion are detected by indirect ELISA. Selected hybridomas are subjected to 3 rounds of cloning using limited dilution method. Cross-reactions are investigated by testing the antibody activity against similar viruses, enzymes and proteins, especially blood serum proteins, to determine the specificity of the antibodies</p>
