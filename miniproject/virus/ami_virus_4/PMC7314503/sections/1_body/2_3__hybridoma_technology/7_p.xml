<p>Using neutralizing mouse antibodies developed by the hybridoma technology may cause unfortunately the production of antimouse antibodies in humans (HAMA). Therefore, an antibody humanization step is necessary to reduce HAMA responses (Kim, 2012; Safdari, 2013; Ahmadzadeh, 2014). However, with the increased number of convalescent patients, the development of human mAbs from the covalescent patients has gain interest because no HAMA response is expected and the antibody humanization step is not needed.</p>
