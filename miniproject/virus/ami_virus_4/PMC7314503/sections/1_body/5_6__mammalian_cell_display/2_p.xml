<p>Ho et al. (2006), transferred single chain variable fragments (scFv) of an antibody through transient (temporary) transfection to human embryonic kidney cells and expressed them on the cell surface. ScFv DNA was collected and analyzed using FACS (Ho et al., 2006) until scFv clones with the desired specificity were identified for the selection of the original antibody to the target antigen (Akamatsu et al., 2007). In the report, they showed that all IgG antibodies could temporarily be produced on the cell surface and cells that synthesize antibodies against the target antigen could be selected through selection cycles based on FACS (Akamatsu et al., 2007). Ho and Pastan (2019), announced that scFvs could also be transferred to the mammalian cell surface for affinity maturation. In the abstract of the report, the strategy for isolating high-affinity scFv specific to the CD22 antigen was identified as “mammalian cell display”. The strategy they have formed consists of the transient expression of antibodies on 293 T (HEK-293T) human embryonic kidney cell surface allowing clone selection by flow cytometry (Pastan et al., 2009).</p>
