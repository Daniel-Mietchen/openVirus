<p>Zhou et al., 2010, reported the display of full size IgGs on CHO cell surface. An important feature of the developed library was that recombinant DNA transfection was performed to include a single antibody replica gene in the genome of each cell. The use of the gene integration zone allowed the comparison of clones by a signal point. Along with the FACS system, this function proved to be capable of screening clones with high affinity and a high expression rate. </p>
