<p>Mammalian cell screening technology can also be used for antibody-based drug development for COVID-19 treatment. For this purpose, VH and VL antibody libraries can be generated with the blood samples of COVID-19 patients. Then, the libraries generated can be screened in mammalian cells against COVID-19 antigens (Beerli et al., 2008). Up to our knowledge mammalian cell screening hasnâ€™t been applied for the development of NAbs for SARS-Cov-2. </p>
