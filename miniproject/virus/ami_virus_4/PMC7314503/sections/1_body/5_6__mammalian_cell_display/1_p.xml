<p>The basis of display technologies is the use of genotype-phenotype relations. These technologies frequently use microbial systems like phage, bacteria, and yeast. In recent years, mammalian cell display technology has been introduced with some advantages such as improved efficiency in protein folding and posttranslational modifications. Compared to other display technologies, mammalian cell display technology comes to the fore by allowing the scanning of functional antibody structures and making use of FACS and in situ scanning methods. The highlight is that the library size that can be used for scanning is smaller than that of other systems (Ë‚109) (King et al., 2004).</p>
