<p>Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) target viral surface proteins for blocking the attachment of virus to host cell (Klasse, 2014). Therefore, in SARS-CoV-2 studies, amongst all structural proteins, neutralizing antibodies primarily target the S (spike) protein, which mediates entry into cells. The structural protein S is a transmembrane glycoprotein that has 2 functional subunits: the subunit S1 that is involved in cell attachment and the subunit S2 that mediates cell membrane fusion (Siu et al., 2008). S1 also breaks down into 2 domains, a receptor-binding domain (RBD) and an N-terminal domain (NTD). The S protein binds the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through its S1 subunit. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be using the same receptor, ACE2, for cell entry as SARS-CoV with a 10 to 20-fold higher affinity (Wrapp et al., 2020). As shown in Table, all currently developed anti-SARS-CoVNAbs target the S protein, predominantly target the RBD, while some target regions in the S2 subunit or the S1/S2 proteolytic cleavage site. S1 RBD is the most crucial target for SARS-CoV NAbs, which may interrupt the interaction of RBD and its ACE2 receptor (Wong et al., 2004).</p>
