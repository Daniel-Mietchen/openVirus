<p>There are currently no approved targeted therapies available for COVID-19. Researchers worldwide are exploring COVID-19 prevention strategies and therapeutic options, including convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, peptides, interferon, small molecule drugs, as well as exploring the repurposing of proven drugs (Li and De Clercq, 2020). Vaccination may provide a strong and sustainable protection, however, vaccine development is a long and challenging process, and vaccination is only useful in a preventive environment. On the other hand, an antibody-based therapy can provide immediate effect for patients.</p>
