<p>Here in this review, we discuss reverse engineering from convalescent plasma, classical hybridoma technology, human hybridoma technology, phage display technology, and mammalian cell surface display technology to develop human antibodies, humanized antibodies and human scFv and single domain antibodies against SARS-COV-2 (Figure). Later we provide brief summary of in vitro and in vivo neutralizing assays including animal models for SARS-CoV-2. </p>
