<p>Therefore, as a precursor of the median lethal dose, in vitro studies should be started to determine the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50). Day et al. (2009) studied 3 different SARS-CoV virus strains (v2163, MA15 and Urban) with 3 different (103.5, 104.5, 105.5) median tissue culture infection doses (TCID50) in BALB/C mice. They observed the effects of these strains with different virulence factors on young and aged BALB/C through a 21-day challenge experiment. The survival rates of the animals per infection dose they received at different postinjection times and survival between the days of the defect were determined, and the virus titers in the lungs of the sacrificed animals were compared (Barnard et al., 2006; Roberts et al., 2007; Day et al., 2009). These studies revealed that the hypotheses on the median tissue culture infection doses (103.5, 104.5, 105.5) were valid for SARS-CoV (Day et al., 2009). Even if these doses are already determined, it is needed to conduct similar studies on animals to better calculate the virulence factor in terms of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
