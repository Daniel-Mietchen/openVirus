<p>In mice immunized with SARS-CoV, the peaks of the virus titer in lungs occur at days 2–3 postinjection. However, at days 5–7 postinjection, the virus is cleared in most mice (Roberts et al., 2008). In young mice, replication of SARS-CoV is not specifically associated with clinical symptoms and pathology of the disease. However, 129S6 mice were found to be more susceptible to SARS-CoV infection than BALB/C or B6 mice, with weight loss and early onset of pneumonia (Hogan et al., 2004; Roberts et al., 2008).</p>
