<p>The referred publications indicate that the mouse models for SARS with these animals, except for aged or immunocompromised ones, did not develop significant clinical symptoms or reasonable mortality rates. For this reason, in recent studies, a new transgenic mouse model has been introduced to mimic human disease, to conduct pathogenesis studies and to develop antiviral treatments for SARS: K18-hACE2 transgenic mice, which express human ACE2, the receptor used by SARS-CoV (McCray et al., 2007). It has been shown that the K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model may also be useful in studies on the outbreak and pathogenesis of the disease by novel coronavirus-2019 (SARS-CoV-2). In this context, Linlin et al. (2020) have studied hACE2 transgenic and wild-type (WT) mice to investigate SARS-CoV-2 virus pathogenicity.</p>
