<p>In BALB/C mice, old ones experience a more severe disease, which results in increased mortality, than young ones, just like the case in SARS-CoV infection in humans (Roberts et al., 2005a). Therefore, being susceptible to age-related factors in diseases, aged BALB/C mice might also be an ideal animal model for SARS-CoV studies. The clinical symptoms of BALB/C mice include weight loss, dehydration, fur structure deterioration and histopathological damages such as viral replication in respiratory tissues and pneumonia (Roberts et al., 2005a; Roberts et al., 2008).</p>
