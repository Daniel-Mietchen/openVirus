<p>Roberts et al. (2008) investigated the susceptibility of various types of aged mice to SARS-CoV infection. They reported significant weight losses by aged B6, 129S6 (12–14 months) and BALB/C mice at days 3–5 postinjection being immunized with 105 TCID50 SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) (Roberts et al., 2005a). The same study also revealed similar results in terms of viral replication levels and kinetics in the lungs of aged B6 and BALB/C mice. At days 5 and 6 postinjection, B6 mice infected with SARS-CoV were observed to have 10–70 times lower virus titers than BALB/C mice (Roberts et al., 2008).</p>
