<p>Unfortunately, common small laboratory animals such as mice, ferrets, guinea pigs and hamsters were found not susceptible to MERS-CoV infection; because MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is a multifunctional transmembrane endopeptidase that breaks down insulin and other peptide hormones. For this reason, hDPP4 transgenic mouse model was created with C57BL/6 mice for MERS-CoV infection (Luke et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018; Li and McCray, 2020).</p>
