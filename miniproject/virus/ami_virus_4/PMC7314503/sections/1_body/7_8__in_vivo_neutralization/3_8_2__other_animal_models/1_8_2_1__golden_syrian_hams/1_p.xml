<p>The golden Syrian hamster is an excellent model for SARS-CoV infection because viral replication is accompanied by pathological changes in the lungs including pneumonitis (Roberts A et al., 2005b). Following intranasal inoculation with 103 TCID50 SARS-CoV, hamsters support viral replication in the nasal turbinates and lungs. Viremia is detected at days 2-3 post-injection, and the virus can be recovered from the spleen and liver (Roberts et al., 2008). Although the disease produces histopathological symptoms in hamsters, clinical symptoms are not evident. The most striking example of this is reduced night movements in 5-10-week-old hamsters infected with SARS-CoV.</p>
