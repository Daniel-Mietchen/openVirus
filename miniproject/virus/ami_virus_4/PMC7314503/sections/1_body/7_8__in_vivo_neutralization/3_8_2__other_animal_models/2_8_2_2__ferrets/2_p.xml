<p>It has been demonstrated that Ferrets support SARS-CoV replication and develop multifocal pulmonary lesions that contain 5%–10% of the lungs’ surface area (Ter Meulen et al., 2004). It was determined that populations immunized with 103 or 104 TCID50 SARS-CoV caused virus replication in the lungs at 106 TCID50/mL on the fourth day (Martina et al., 2003; Ter Meulen et al., 2004). Compared to other vaccine studies for SARS-CoV, this model revealed poor efficacy. Therefore, more studies were needed to understand its immunogenicity (Bisht et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005). </p>
