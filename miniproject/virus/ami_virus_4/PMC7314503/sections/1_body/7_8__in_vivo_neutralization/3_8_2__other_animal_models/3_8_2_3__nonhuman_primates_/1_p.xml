<p>Nonhuman primates (NHPs) support viral replication and pneumonitis with variable clinical symptoms and pathology, depending upon the species. Various strains of SARS-CoV were tested on rhesus macaques (McAuliffe et al., 2004; Rowe et al., 2004; Qin et al., 2005), cynomolgus macaques (Kuiken et al., 2003; Lawler et al., 2006), common marmosets (Greenough et al., 2005), African green monkeys (McAuliffe et al., 2004), squirrel monkeys and mustached tamarins. Studies revealed that squirrel monkeys and mustached tamarins are not susceptible to SARS-CoV Urbani infection. Among nonhuman primate models, rhesus and cynomolgus macaques were found to be the best NHPs in SARS-CoV studies.</p>
