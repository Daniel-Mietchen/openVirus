<p>In vaccine and drug research, preclinical studies must be conducted on animals. The efficacy of a candidate vaccine or drug is investigated first on mice, and then gradually on larger animals. The most critical stage on the way to a product is in vivo challenge experiments. To this end, the candidate molecule is given to mice with target microorganism and its effectiveness is tested. During the global fight with SARS-CoV-2, vaccine and drug development studies have gained a momentum. However, there are not much in vivo results for this virus in the literature yet. On the other hand, model animal studies were conducted on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV diseases that caused infections in the past years. Therefore, in vivo studies of these viruses from the same family as SARS-CoV-2 will constitute a reference for new studies.</p>
