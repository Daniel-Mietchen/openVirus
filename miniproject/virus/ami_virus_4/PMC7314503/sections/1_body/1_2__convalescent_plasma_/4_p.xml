<p>Shen et al. (2020) reported another CP transfusion study on 5 severe COVID-19 patients who were receiving mechanical ventilation during treatment, and all of whom had received antiviral agents and methylprednisolone. Following the transfusion of CP with a neutralizing titer more than 1:40, the body temperatures decreased within 3 days. Within 12 days, the SOFA scores were reduced, the PAO2/FIO2 ratios were increased, and the viral loads became negative. Neutralizing antibody titers of all 5 patients increased by scores ranging from 80 to 320. </p>
