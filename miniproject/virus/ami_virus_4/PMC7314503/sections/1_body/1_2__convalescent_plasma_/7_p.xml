<p>Ju et al. (2020), are the first group which characterized 206 RBD-specific human mAbs isolated from single B cells by FACS from eight SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. They have cloned the genes of these B cell into an expression vector for further analysis. Then they showed the potential binding and neutralizing effect of the antibodies by surface plasmon resonance assay and neutralization assay with pseudovirus and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. They found 2 potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (P2C-1F11 and P2B-2F6). </p>
