<p>There are also some known and theoretical risks of passive administration of convalescent sera. Transfusion transmitted infections (TTI), allergic transfusion reactions like serum sickness; transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO), transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) are the known risks of convalescent sera transmission. While, TRALI is of particular concern in severe COVID-19 given potential priming of the pulmonary endothelium the risk of TRALI is less than 1/5000 transfused units. With the development of modern blood banking methods, the risk of accidental transmission of known infectious agents or triggering transfusion reactions becomes very low (Casadevall and Pirofski, 2020). There is a theoretical risk of antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon of infection after transfusion. ADE refers to a process in which antibodies that target one serotype of coronavirus could enhance infection to another viral serotype. Wan et al. (2020), showed a novel mechanism for ADE in which a NAb that binds coronavirus surface spike protein like a viral receptor, activates spike conformation and mediates viral entry into receptor-expressing IgG Fc cells via canonical viral receptor-dependent pathways. Also, it is still unknown to what extent convalescent plasma represses the development of a natural immune response, especially when administered for prophylaxis and makes such individuals vulnerable to reinfections. Risk-benefit assessment must be investigated carefully and must be supported with scientific data. Although CP therapy is a fast and effective form of treatment that can be applied in difficult situations, is not a real solution for diseases. Since it is associated with the amount of antibody titers in the blood of patients who recover, which is not an infinite source. Therefore, reverse engineering is needed for the development of neutralizing antibodies. </p>
