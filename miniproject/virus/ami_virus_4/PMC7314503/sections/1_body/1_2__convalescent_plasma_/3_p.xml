<p>Some clinical CP therapy experiments have already been reported on SARS-CoV-2. In China, 245 COVID-19 patients received pilot convalescent plasma therapy in February, and 91 cases demonstrated improvements in terms of clinical indicators and symptoms. Duan et al. (2020) reported the results of CP transfusion on 10 severe adult cases confirmed by a real-time viral RNA test. A single dose of 200 mL CP derived from 39 recovered donors having neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused to the patients, and their clinical symptoms such as the oxyhemoglobin saturation, the level of neutralizing antibodies, the lymphocyte counts and the decrease of C-reactive were significantly improved. </p>
