<p>For CP therapy evaluation, the level (titers) of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus is critical, and the plasmas containing NAbs must be obtained from recovered patients when the titers of NAbs reach their peak after the onset of disease. Wu et al. (2020) screened plasma samples collected from 175 COVID-19 recovered patients using pseudotyped lentiviral vector based neutralization assay. The domain RBD, the subunit S1, and the subunit S2 of SARS-CoV-2 were used in ELISA to determine the level and time-course of spike-binding antibodies in plasma. They revealed that SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were detected from the day-10-15 after the onset of disease and remained thereabouts afterward. The titers of patients varied depending on age. Elderly and middle-aged patients had significantly higher plasma-NAb rates (P &lt; 0.0001) and spike-binding antibodies (P = 0.0003) than young patients.</p>
