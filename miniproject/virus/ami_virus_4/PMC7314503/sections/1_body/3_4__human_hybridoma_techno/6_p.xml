<p>The most critical and challenging step in manufacturing human hybridomas is the fusion of desired lymphocyte populations with a myeloma partner effectively. There are 3 basic techniques used in mAb production to generate hybridomas: the use of (i) chemical agents such as PEG, (ii) fusogenic viruses, and (iii) electrical cytofusion. The most popular method used to generate hybridomas takes advantage of PEGâ€™s fusogenic properties, while electric cytofusion is the most effective method of generating cell fusion and hybridoma (Wilson and Andrews, 2012; Scott and Crowe, 2015). There are several myeloma cell lines that are suitable for fusion with human B cells and are available in the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Two of those cell lines, SHM-D3327 and HMMA 2.5, are frequently used for development of human mAbs (Gorny, 2012).</p>
