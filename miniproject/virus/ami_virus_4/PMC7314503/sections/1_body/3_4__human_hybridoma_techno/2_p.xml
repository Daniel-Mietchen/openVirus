<p>One major obstacle to the development of human hybridomas over the years was the difficulty in collecting antigen-specific B cells to extend target populations. Antigen-specific memory B cells normally circulate in the peripheral blood at low concentrations, usually within a range centering about 1, or less, in 10,000 B cells. Therefore, it was difficult to generate human hybridoma cells, which would secrete desirable human mAbs. Recent technological developments in increasing the starting number of human antigen-specific B cells, improving the fusion efficiency and isolating new myeloma partners, and new cell cloning methods have allowed the development of protocols that make it possible to isolate B cells from blood samples and develop mAbs (Scott and Crowe, 2015). Despite technical improvements in human hybridoma technology, there are no available human hybridoma cell lines developed against SARS-CoV-2. </p>
