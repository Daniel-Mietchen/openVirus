<p>The final step in human hybridoma generation is the isolation of successful fusion products in the form of single-cell clones, which is a method also referred to as biological cloning. (Scott and Crowe, 2015). There are now many approaches that can be used for biological cloning of human hybridomas. Traditionally, this was done by limiting dilution plating. More recently, advances in automated single-cell flow cytometric sorting, with indexing capabilities, have allowed fast, accurate and versatile single-cell plating. Finally, semisolid medium preparations can be used to grow single hybridoma cells as isolated, suspended colonies. This process can be highly automated with special clone picking devices and can also be carried out in an antigen-specific and semiquantitative fashion for the selection and biological cloning of high-producing human hybridomas (Scott and Crowe, 2015).</p>
