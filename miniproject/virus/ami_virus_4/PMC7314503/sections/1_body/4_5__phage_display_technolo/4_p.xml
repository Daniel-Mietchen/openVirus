<p>Since the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in December 2019, phage display technology has been intensively used for the development of neutralizing antibodies. Many different antibody libraries of different formats and strategies have been screened against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its receptor binding domain (RBD). Some of the studies have focused on screening previously developed libraries against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and finding cross-reactive antibodies. Others have performed screenings against semisynthetic or synthetic antibody libraries. Wrapp et al. (2020) reported that a previously developed a phage displayed single-domain antibody from llama, neutralizing the S antigen of SARS-CoV was also neutralizing the S antigen of the pseudotyped virus SARS-CoV-2 as a bivalent human IgG Fc-fusion protein. Zeng et al. 2020, constructed a phage displayed synthetic human Fab library (with an estimated size of 1 × 1012). The library was screened against the RBD domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen. They selected 2 antibodies with high affinity to RBD, however, only 1 showed neutralizing effect in competitive/blocking ELISA and pseudotyped virus neutralization assay. Wu et al. (2020) developed a phage-displayed single-domain antibody library by grafting naive CDR regions into the framework region of an allele in the human antibody heavy chain variable region. They made affinity selection against the RBD domain and the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 and chose several neutralizing antibodies, including a “cryptic” epitope located in the spike’s trimeric interface. Liu et al. 2020, performed site-directed screening in a naive human scFv antibody library and domain antibody library by phage display against SARS-CoV-2 RBD. After several rounds of screening, they obtained 9 enriched clones from the domain antibody library and a single clone from the scFv antibody library. The scFv clone was reformatted into a human IgG1 antibody, while the domain antibody clones were fused with human Fc tag. By this way, Liu et al. revealed a potential neutralizing effect of these recombinant antibody structures with pseudotyped virus neutralization assay.</p>
