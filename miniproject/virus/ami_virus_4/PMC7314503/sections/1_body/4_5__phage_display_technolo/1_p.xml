<p>Phage display technology was discovered in 1985 by the 2018 Nobel prize laureate George P. Smith. He successfully integrated a foreign DNA into a filamentous M13 phage genome such that he could display the gene product on the surface of the phage (Smith, 1985). Today, M13 phage has been widely used in phage display technology applications because of its ease of use in the laboratory. It is a virus infecting specifically E. coli bacteria. M13 phage also differs from other phages by its unusual mechanism of producing progeny by continually releasing new phages from the bacterium without killing it (Nancy and Janine, 2004; Ledsgaard et al., 2018). These 2 advantages made the M13 phage based display technology step forward amongst other phage display technologies.</p>
