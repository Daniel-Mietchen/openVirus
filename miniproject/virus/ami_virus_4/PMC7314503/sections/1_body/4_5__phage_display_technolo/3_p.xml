<p>Antibody libraries have been displayed on phages in very different antibody formats. The main ones consist of Fab domain of antibodies, single chain Fv (scFv) which is the linear form of the variable domain of heavy and light chains, and single domain antibodies (nanobodies). The latter includes camelid VH domain and shark vNAR (new antigen receptor) domain (Cheong et al., 2020). There are 4 types of antibody phage libraries, naive library, semisynthetic, synthetic and immune libraries (Carmen and Jermutus, 2002). Naive libraries are generated from the natural antibody repertoire of donors or nonimmunized animals. Semisynthetic and synthetic libraries are generated from low diversity natural antibody repertoires by increasing the diversity with mutations in the CDR (complementarity determining region). Lastly, the immune library is generated from the antibody repertoire of immunized animals (Erdag et al., 2011) or diseased or vaccinated humans (Omar and Lim, 2018). The selection of a target specific antibody from the phage libraries is made with a method called biopanning or affinity selection. The method consists of exposing the antibody phage library to the target antigen which is immobilized on a solid surface. The phages displaying antibodies specific to the target, bind to the antigen and the nonbinders are washed away from the media. Then the target specific phages are recovered by elution for a phage amplification step by infecting fresh bacterial cells. The phages are collected for a second round of biopanning. Generally, 3â€“4 biopanning cycles are sufficient to select antigen-binding antibodies (Smith and Petrenko, 1997).</p>
