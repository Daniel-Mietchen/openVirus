<p>The phage display technology is based on the integration of a gene encoding a peptide or a protein fused with the phage coat proteins. The most extensively used coat proteins for display are the PVIII and PIII proteins; however, other coat proteins have also been used for display (Smith and Petrenko, 1997). Because of its high copy number (-2700 copies), the PVIII protein has been only used for the display of small peptides due to conformational problems hampering capsid formation (Iannolo et al., 1995). The PIII system, on the other hand, with its low copy number (5 copies), allows the display of larger molecules such as recombinant antibodies. The first phage display system displaying antibodies was described by McCafferty et al. (1990). They successfully displayed antibody variable regions on phages by using immunoglobulin variable genes of hybridomas and B cells. Since then, phage display technology has been extensively used for the discovery of antibodies or peptides against a large variety of antigens in many fields of application such as toxiconology (Ledsgaard et al., 2018), drug discovery (Erdag et al., 2007; Mimmi et al., 2019), immunization (BahadÄ±r et al., 2011), epitope mapping (Folgori et al., 1994) and virus or toxin neutralization (Lim et al., 2019) by using phage peptide and antibody libraries.</p>
