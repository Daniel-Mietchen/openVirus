<p>During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Chen 
 <italic>et al.</italic>[
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported that 19 AIDS patients treated for opportunistic infections in the same ward of SARS-infected patients did not develop nosocomial SARS infection despite long stay. This was in contrast with the high rate of infection in health-care workers (HCW) working on the same ward (21%). It could be hypothesized that distinct immune response might have impacted susceptibility to SARS infection. However, no definite conclusion regarding the possible interaction between HIV-infection and SARS can be drawn as exposure to infective viral particles is probably different between HCW and patients.
