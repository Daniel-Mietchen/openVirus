<p>In order to identify previous clinical studies reporting outcome of PLWH following SARS or MERS-Cov infection, a PubMed search was performed using the MeSH terms ‘Coronavirus’ or ‘Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus’ or ‘SARS Virus’ and ‘HIV’ or ‘Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome’. Large cohort studies of SARS-infected and MERS-CoV-infected patients were also reviewed for associated risk factors. References of relevant articles were screened. HIV-infection was not reported as a risk factor in large cohorts of SARS and MERS-CoV-infected patients [

 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The patient was on antiretroviral therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) and tenofovir, had a low CD4
 <sup>+</sup> count (134/μl) and a detectable viral load (470 copies/ml). The patient was treated with ribavirin and steroids and experienced a mild course, not requiring mechanical ventilation. The authors hypothesized that ART regimen could have influenced the course of the disease. Both in-vitro and historical studies suggested a possible antiviral activity of the protease inhibitor LPV/RTV against SARS infection. In a nonrandomized study, addition of LPV/RTV to ribavirin was associated with better outcome as compared with ribavirin alone [

 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, recent in-vitro and animal studies in the MERS-CoV model indicated that LPV/RTV in combination with IFN-β is inferior to the antiviral agent remdesivir [
