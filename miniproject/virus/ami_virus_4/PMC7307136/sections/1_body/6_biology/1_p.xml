<p id="p0235">The family 
 <italic>Bromoviridae</italic> is one of the most important families of plant RNA viruses, with some members widely distributed in the world. In its entirety, the family has a wide host range (more than 10,000 species) and some members are causing agronomically important diseases. However, the host range of members of individual genera ranges from significantly narrow (genera 
 <italic>Bromovirus, Oleavirus</italic>) to extremely broad (genus 
 <italic>Cucumovirus</italic>). CMV can infect one of the largest number of plant species among plant viruses. Some of these viruses cause major disease epidemics in vegetables, fodder and fruit crops, e.g., in tomato, cucurbits, bananas, or alfalfa, and in fruit trees (ilarviruses). Different virus species are transmitted mechanically, via pollen/thrips, through seeds or by insect vectors like aphids or beetles. It has been speculated that lack of inefficient vectors evolved some bromovirids toward producing larger concentration of viral particles. For CMV, although the virus is prone to recombination, the recombinants are rare during infection, suggesting the presence of strong selection bottlenecks. No direct correlation between virus yield and symptom severity have been observed, but rather the symptoms seem to be associated with changes in specific regions in the RNA genome, as it has been mapped by using the natural strains of BMV, BBMV or CCMV.
