<p id="p0190">The packaged RNAs interact with the basic N-terminal aa of the CP in the torus-shaped sub-shell inside the BMV capsid so to neutralize the phosphate groups. Other sites of RNA interaction localize to the internally-proximal basic aa of the CP subunits. The RNA encapsidation signals have been mapped on BMV RNAs, especially to both the 3â€² UTR and a central sequence in RNA3. The co-packaging of sgRNA4 is contingent upon both RNA replication and translation of CP.</p>
