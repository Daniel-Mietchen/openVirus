<p id="p0225">Both homologous and non-homologous RNA-RNA crossovers has been demonstrated between bromoviral RNAs during infection. Homologous recombination has also been shown during co-infection between two strains of BMV, with some distinct hot spots localized within both the coding and non-coding regions. The role in recombination of proteins 1a and 2a as well as of the CP have been demonstrated in BMV, suggesting the template switching as a likely mechanism for RNA recombination. For the cucumoviruses, the control of recombination frequency resides mainly in the 2a gene.</p>
