<p id="p0205">RNA3 encodes the movement (MP) and coat (CP) proteins, the latter being translated from the subgenomic (sg)RNA4. BMV CP is a multi-functional protein. In addition to its structural/encapsidation role, it also coordinates the viral infection processes including (1) participation in the formation of replication factories, (2) repression of RNA replication but also translation, and (3) stimulation of BMV RNA accumulation at lower CP levels. Moreover, the BMV CP participates in RNA recombination events; an analogous function to that of BMV CP was assigned to nucleocapsid proteins in retroviruses and coronaviruses. The multiple functions of CP are exercised by effective binding to several distinct sites in RNA3, including the 3′ non-coding hairpin, two central regions, and possibly at the 5′ end. The contact BMV CP amino acids have been mapped at distinct parts of the CP monomers. Since BMV replicase complex also binds to most of these sites it has been postulated that the CP is involved in the regulation of BMV RNA replication such that the repression of RNA accumulation and translation occurs at higher levels of BMV CP, while stimulation of BMV RNA accumulation at the lower CP levels. While CP is usually translated from the encapsidated 3′ sgRNA4, Olive latent virus 2 encapsidates a sgRNA with no apparent messenger activity whereas CP is translated from another non-encapsidated sgRNA4. The purified genomic RNAs are directly infectious but for some bromovirids the presence of CP is necessary (e.g., for AMV or ilarviruses).</p>
