<p id="p0200">The total length of the Bromoviridae RNA genome is approximately 8 kb, with three RNA segments capped at the 5′ terminus. Whereas the highly conserved within members, the not polyadenylated 3′ termini fold into strong secondary structures. These structures are either aminoacylable tRNA-like (genera 
 <italic>Bromovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cucumovirus</italic>) or forming other not aminoacylated arrangements (genera 
 <italic>Alfamovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Anulavirus, Ilarvirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Oleavirus</italic>) (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). RNAs 1 and 2 are monocistronic and they code, respectively, for viral replicase proteins 1a and 2a (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ). Protein 1a has two distinct domains of guanylyl transferase and helicase, and it is involved in anchoring the replicase complex to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and induces the formation of membranous vesicular mini-organelles called spherules where RNA replication occurs. In AMV the replicase proteins interact with the tonoplast. Protein 2a is the actual RNA-dependent RNA polymerase enzyme that interacts with protein 1a and synthesizes the vRNAs. Mutations and deletions in 1a/2a ORFs helped to identify the regions active in BMV RNA replication as well as regions responsible for interaction with the cellular membrane or for interactions between 1a/2a polypeptides. An active BMV replicase preparation has been extracted. The anulavirus encodes the smallest RdRp (2a) protein within the family. For cucumoviruses and in some ilarviruses RNA2 is dicistronic encoding a protein 2b, that is part of the C-terminal region of the protein 2a. Protein 2b was found to act as suppressor of RNA interference, being involved in the inhibition of viral gene silencing but also in systemic movement and affecting the symptoms.
