<p id="p0215">For long distance transport, most viruses require the CP which suggests that they are transported in the form of viral particles (virions). This has been demonstrated by showing that bromovirids require unmodified CP and the wild type C-terminus of MP for long distance spread, such as AMV, BMV and CMV. Very likely the CP-MP interactions enhance the systemic transport, independently of the mechanism of short distance (cell-to-cell) transport.</p>
