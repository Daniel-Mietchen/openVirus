<p>To explore the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of these and possibly other unknown influenza-A-like viruses, further prevalence and serological studies in Neotropical bat populations are required coupled with the surveillance of bat-exposed humans and livestock. Surveys of bat colonies have previously led to identification of other zoonotic viruses, including HeV in Pteropus sp. in Australia, NiV in Pteropus lylei in Thailand, and MARV in Rousettus aegyptiacus in Uganda (Wacharapluesadee et al.,

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). A computational study which used spatial empirical models to trace the steps of emergence of bat viruses and the transmission opportunities to humans pinpointed sub-Saharan Africa as the top-priority location for pathogen discovery in wildlife (Brierley et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). West Subsaharan Africa, in particular, hosts enormous populations of sedentary and migrating bats living in proximity to human and animal populations. Considering the number, the morbidity and mortality of emerging viruses that are hosted in African bats as well as the serological evidence against IAVs (Freidl et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), future surveillance and serological studies could lead to the identification of novel bat influenza subtypes.
