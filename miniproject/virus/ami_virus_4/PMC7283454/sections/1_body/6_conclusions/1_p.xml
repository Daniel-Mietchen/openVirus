<p>In summary, BatIVs are unconventional influenza viruses that resemble to some extent more paramyxoviruses rather than typical orthomyxoviruses. Despite the recent findings on the cell entry factors and NAs of these viruses, it is clear that we only scratched the surface in terms of characterization of these viruses. The scientific evidence so far indicate a limited spillover risk but data is not conclusive enough to dismiss out of hand the possibility of zoonotic transmission. Forecasting viral spillover is a challenging task and additional interdisciplinary and more up-to-date approaches are warranted to fully appreciate the ecology and the implications of these viruses for public health. Future studies on BatIVs hold extra value as they can provide broader mechanistic insights into the molecular biology of influenza viruses and might inform translational studies.</p>
