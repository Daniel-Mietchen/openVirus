<p>MHC-II molecules occur as three highly polymorphic isotypes (HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ). They are selectively expressed on the surface of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs), act as ligands for the T-cell receptor (TCR), and play a key role in the presentation of foreign antigens to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T helper cells and immune surveillance (Jones et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Roche and Furuta, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Bats contain all classical MHC class II gene families that are responsible for antigen presentation with an extra 
 <italic>DRB2</italic> gene copy located outside the MHC-II region in 
 <italic>P. alecto</italic> (Ng et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The MHC-II dependent cell entry suggests that BatIVs might hijack APCs such as B lymphocytes and dendritic cells for viral dissemination and/or survival perhaps in the early stages of infection. It is unknown to what degree their binding to APCs might influence the global outcome of the host immune responses. A blockade of TCR recognition by steric hindrance as described for Epstein-Barr virus (Ressing et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Wiertz et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), could explain the asymptomatic status of the infection in the captured New World bats.
