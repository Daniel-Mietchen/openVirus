<p>Crystal structure analyses revealed that the bat haemagglutinins display typical HA protein folds but lack any obvious cavity to accommodate SA, which are the conventional receptors of IAVs. Recently, two independent studies demonstrated that the cell-entry of H17N10 (Giotis et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and H18N11 (Karakus et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) is mediated by MHC-II receptors that are well-conserved in many species. Hence, immortalized cell lines that express MHC-II receptors on their surface such as several human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines Raji, Ramos, and BJAB B-lymphocytes could be used for the study of the viruses' biology (Giotis et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Interestingly, ectopic expression of pig, mice, and chicken MHC-II have been shown to confer susceptibility to H18N11 in non-susceptible cells (Karakus et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) implying a potential role for the respective animals as intermediary hosts. It is as yet unclear whether MHC-II receptors function with other unknown factors to facilitate virus internalization and also whether the viruses remain cell associated following cell-entry and are being passed on by direct cell-cell contact.
