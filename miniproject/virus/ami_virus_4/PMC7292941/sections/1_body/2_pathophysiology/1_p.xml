<p id="Par6">SARS-CoV-2 is a novel RNA coronavirus that has emerged as the causative infection responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Other viruses from the coronavirus family include the MERS-CoV virus, responsible for the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, and the SARS-CoV virus, responsible for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Initial infection with SARS-CoV-2 is a process that is still being understood but is known to involve viral S proteins and host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS). SARS-CoV-2 expresses numerous spike (S) proteins on the surface of the viral envelope, which facilitates viral entry into the host cell. TMPRSS, a serine protease expressed on the host cell, primes the viral S proteins to enable interaction with the host ACE2 receptor [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The role of the ACE2 receptor in human physiology remains under investigation but it is believed to provide counter regulation to the renin–angiotensin system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The ACE2 receptor is commonly found in the lungs in type 2 alveolar cells but is also expressed in vascular endothelium, gut epithelium, and in the proximal tubule in the kidneys [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The location of the ACE2 receptor is implicated in a multitude of disease presentations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. After binding the ACE2 receptor, the virus is internalized, and the viral RNA is released. Immediately, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is translated, which allows for viral replication and spread of the infection. The role of the ACE2 receptor expression and blockade within both SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity remains controversial, with both protective and deleterious effects hypothesized.
