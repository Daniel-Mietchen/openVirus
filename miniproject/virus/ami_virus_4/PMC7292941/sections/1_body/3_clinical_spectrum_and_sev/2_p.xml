<p id="Par8">COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of severity and phenotypic presentation. The most typical presentation involves consequences of direct respiratory infection ranging from cough and dyspnea to hypoxia to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The initial cohort study of COVID-19 patients included data from 552 hospitals in China with 1099 patients with COVID-19 disease [

In the largest published cases series of sequential COVID-19 cases from the United States in New York City, of the 5700 patients admitted to 12 different hospitals, 30% of patients presented with an initial fever and 20% presented with hypoxia [

Mechanical ventilation was required in 12.2% of patients and early mortality was seen in 24.5%, with 3.2% of patients surviving to discharge and 72.2% remaining in the hospital. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection most commonly causes respiratory illness with a wide range of severity and outcomes that is relatively consistent in presentation (cough, dyspnea, fever, and hypoxia) across the globe.
