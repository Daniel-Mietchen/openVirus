<p id="Par25">The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic poses an enormous threat globally. Given the high prevalence of existing cardiovascular disease worldwide, it is not surprising that cardiovascular comorbidities significantly impact disease severity. The unique properties of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathophysiology further raise concern for de novo cardiac injury with COVID-19. The cardiovascular presentations of COVID-19 are still being elucidated, but appear to at least include decompensated heart failure, myocarditis, ACS, arrhythmia, and thrombosis. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiovascular systems of care and whether patients are delaying necessary treatment will be of great importance to understand as the pandemic progresses in the months and years to come. Lastly, emerging therapeutic approaches have expected and unexpected cardiac effects that must be monitored as treatment algorithms expand. Cardiologists will play a vital role in the care of COVID-19 patients worldwide and in the ongoing research into the pathophysiology and population-based effects of the SARS-CoV2 virus.</p>
