<p id="Par9">The preexisting burden of comorbid chronic disease is well recognized to contribute to the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection and there are concerns that underlying comorbid illnesses play a role in the diverse spectrum of phenotypic presentation. The initial study of 41 patients in Wuhan, China, demonstrated a predominance of male patients (73%) with pre-existing comorbidities including diabetes (20%), hypertension (15%), and cardiovascular disease (15%) [

However, since these initial studies, a number of prospective and retrospective studies out of China have demonstrated higher rates of underlying comorbid conditions. Common underlying comorbidities include hypertension (30–32%), diabetes (10–28%), and cardiovascular and coronary artery diseases (11–15%) [

In these studies, these comorbidities were associated with worse severity of illness and mortality. A review of 44,672 confirmed COVID-19 cases from Wuhan, China, demonstrated increased mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease (10.5%), diabetes (7.3%), and hypertension (6%), which was significantly higher than the overall case-fatality rate of 2.3% [
