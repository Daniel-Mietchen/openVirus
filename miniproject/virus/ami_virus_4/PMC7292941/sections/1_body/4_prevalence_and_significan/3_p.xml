<p id="Par11">A concerning trend is the alarming rate at which black and Hispanic/Latino Americans are being infected and dying from COVID-19 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There were early data from cities and states across the country indicating higher mortality from COVID19 in black and Hispanic/Latino populations. These included Milwaukee, WI, experiencing a 73% mortality rate in black patients who make up 26% of the population; Chicago, IL (67% of the mortality with 32% of the population); and the states of Louisiana (70% of the mortality with 32% of the population) and Michigan (41% of the mortality with 14% of the population). In the COVID-NET catchment population of the USA, a higher percentage of black patients were infected (33%) compared to the percentage of overall population being black (18%) [

While it is well known that black and Hispanic/Latino patients have a higher incidence of diabetes and hypertension, this alone does not explain the increased infected and mortality rates. Studies during prior epidemics have continued to demonstrate similar healthcare disparities on smaller scales likely related to multiple factors including access to care, racial and ethnical stigmas among medical professionals, crowded living conditions, income instability, and continued rates of exposure and protection [
