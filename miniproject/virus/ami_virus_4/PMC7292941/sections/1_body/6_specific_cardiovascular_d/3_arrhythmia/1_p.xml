<p id="Par23">Among 187 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China, arrhythmia occurred in 5.9% of all patients admitted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Elevated troponin T was a statistically significant prognostic marker with 82% having either ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. It is unclear whether elevated troponin preceded or succeeded the arrhythmic events. Furthermore, among 138 patients admitted to a single hospital in Wuhan, China, arrhythmia (type not specified) was reported in 17% with the majority (44%) occurring in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Among patients who suffered a cardiac arrest, the predominant rhythm was asystole/pulseless electrical activity (94%), followed by shockable ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (6%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Similar rates in the New York City population were reported by Goyal et al. Arrhythmia was seen in 7.4% of the entire cohort, with higher rates in the patients receiving ICU care (18.5%) as compared to non-ICU care (1.8%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Arrhythmias may be induced by the presence of acidosis and metabolic disturbances, as seen in critical illness with multiorgan dysfunction or catecholaminergic pressor infusion for hypotension and shock. Finally, QT-prolonging agents given to some COVID-19 patients may increase the susceptibility to arrhythmia as discussed below [
