Targets for COVID-19 therapies are therefore not only focused on the intrinsic viral make up (including proteins such as ACE-2 cell surface receptor, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, Spike, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and papain-like protease) but also the human immune system [

There are currently over 350 active clinical trials searching for treatment options for COVID-19 both in novel therapies as well as repurposed existing therapies, which has the benefit of having a known safety profile. The following table summarizes a selection of these drugs, their mechanisms, known and proposed cardiotoxicities, and ongoing clinical trials (Table
