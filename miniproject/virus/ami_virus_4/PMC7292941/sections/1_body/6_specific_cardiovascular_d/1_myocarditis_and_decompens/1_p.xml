<p id="Par14">SARS-CoV2 has been implicated in cases of myocarditis and acute decompensated heart failure. Initial reports of myocarditis from China described cases of cardiogenic shock and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction among COVID-19 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These patients had extremely elevated levels of cardiac biomarkers (namely troponin, CK-MB, and BNP) and required inotropy or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to maintain adequate cardiac output. Based on the clinical presentation and on these elevations in biomarkers, these cases were deemed “fulminant myocarditis” and were treated with a combination of steroids, IVIG, antivirals, antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, renal replacement, and mechanical ventilation.
