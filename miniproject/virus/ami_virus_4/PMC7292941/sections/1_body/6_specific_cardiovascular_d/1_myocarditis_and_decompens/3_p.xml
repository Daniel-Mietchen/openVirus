<p id="Par16">There is now additional evidence that SARS-CoV2 has a similar effect on the myocardium as SARS-CoV and MERS. Myocardial involvement has been confirmed in SARS-CoV-2-positive patients via MRI and endomyocardial biopsy [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Cardiac biopsy findings in COVID-19 patients have shown inflammatory infiltration of the myocardium with T-lymphocyte and macrophages, interstitial edema, and in some cases, evidence of cytoplasmic vacuoles indicating direct viral involvement of myocardial cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In a post-mortem case series of 68 patients from China, 7% of COVID-19 patients died of circulatory failure with some degree of myocardial involvement, as marked by elevations in troponin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, it is unclear if these cases can truly be classified as myocarditis given the lack of ejection fraction assessment via TTE, MRI, or biopsy. From a different case series in Seattle, WA, troponin elevation was seen in 15% of patients, but none of the patients who underwent TTE had evidence of a reduced ejection fraction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. There is currently no standardized approach to treatment of COVID-19 cardiomyopathy. In cases of more severe “fulminant” myocarditis resulting in cardiogenic shock, treatments with immunomodulating drugs, namely steroids and IVIG, but also more specific agents like tocilizumab to inhibit IL-6, are being used. Clinical trial data is as of yet lacking on the efficacy of such therapies in COVID-19-related myocarditis and are being extrapolated from other causes of fulminant myocarditis, namely giant cell subtype.
