<p id="Par15">During other outbreaks of similar coronaviruses in the last 20Â years, namely SARS-CoV and MERS, there was evidence to support direct myocardial involvement. Among patients who died from SARS-CoV in Toronto, Canada, viral RNA was detected in 35% of samples and the presence of viral RNA was associated with increased levels of interstitial fibrosis and macrophage activity within the myocardium, thus potentially leading to a more rapid clinical course compared to patients without viral RNA in the myocardium [
