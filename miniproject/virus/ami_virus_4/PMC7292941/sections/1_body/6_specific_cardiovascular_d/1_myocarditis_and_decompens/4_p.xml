<p id="Par17">Decompensation of pre-existing heart failure appears to be a more common cardiovascular manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection than clinically significant myocarditis. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, influenza-like respiratory infections significantly increased the risk of hospitalization for decompensated heart failure, and in high influenza activity months, may contribute to 19% of heart failure hospitalizations across the United States [

In two retrospective case series from China of 113 and 191 patients, heart failure was observed in 49% and 52% of deaths, respectively [

There appears to be a broad spectrum of disease severity, ranging from stable to fulminant heart failure requiring inotropes, and potentially mechanical circulatory support for refractory shock and or hypoxia. The use of ECMO in COVID-19 cases is being studied in a prospective manner as part of the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) Registry. As of June 1, 2020, ECMO has been used in 1135 COVID-19-confirmed cases worldwide, with 52% discharged alive, and the vast majority of patients receiving veno-venous ECMO for respiratory support [
