<p id="Par19">COVID-19 has been hypothesized to increase the risk of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and systemic thrombosis. This premise is based on prior experience with viral infections such as influenza, which predisposes patients to developing ACS, and may increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) by at least sixfold in the week following infection [

This increase in MI incidence is also seen following infection with other respiratory infections such as respiratory syncytial virus, and for non-viral respiratory illnesses such as bacterial pneumonia. Many MIs due to COVID-19 disease are likely related to supply–demand mismatch from hypoxia resulting in myocardial injury and troponin release. However, MI from acute atherothrombotic events were first reported in Wuhan, China, soon after the onset of the pandemic. As such, Chinese hospitals soon developed treatment algorithms aimed at providing urgent reperfusion to COVID-19-suspected patients while maintaining the safety of catheterization lab staff. In the setting of ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, thrombolytics were often the first choice for acute reperfusion therapy in China [

This document highlights the need for adequate personal protective equipment for catheterization lab staff, the need to differentiate true ACS from supply–demand mismatch, consideration of deferring invasive angiography in low-risk non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients until hospital resources improve, and the potential use of thrombolytics for ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) cases where the risks of exposing staff to SARS-CoV2 outweigh the benefits of a primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)-based approach. However, the authors still expect primary PCI to remain the standard of care for patients with STEMI and possible COVID-19 and thrombolytics reserved for non-PCI-capable hospitals [
