<p id="Par21">While COVID-19 may potentially increase the risk of ACS, activations for STEMI in the United States have decreased significantly during the pandemic. Among nine high-volume centers in the US, there was a 38% reduction in STEMI activations compared to the 14-month period before the pandemic [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. It is unclear what is responsible for the significant reduction in STEMI activations, but it may be related to patients’ fear of exposure to SARS-CoV2 when presenting to the hospital. In Hong Kong, China, patients who presented with STEMI during the height of the outbreak presented to the hospital significantly longer after onset of symptoms compared to a year prior (318 vs. 83 min) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. It is currently unknown how many people worldwide may not be seeking medical care for possible ACS due to fear of COVID-19. It is possible that due to delays in seeking appropriate medical care, patients may eventually present to the hospital with heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or mechanical complications from ACS. Studies must be performed to assess the impact COVID-19 could have on cardiovascular mortality through such indirect mechanisms.
