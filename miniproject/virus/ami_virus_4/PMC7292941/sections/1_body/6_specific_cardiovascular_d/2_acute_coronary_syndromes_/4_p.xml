<p id="Par22">SARS-CoV2 infection is theorized to predispose to a hypercoagulable state through inflammation, immune dysregulation, and activation of cytokines. This process has been implicated in ACS, but also in cases of thrombosis outside the coronary arteries. Among 184 ICU patients in the Netherlands, 31% were diagnosed with pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, or systemic embolism—all while receiving standard prophylactic doses of anticoagulation as recommended by the WHO [

 <sc>D</sc>-dimer levels above 1500 ng/ml had a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 89% for detecting venous thromboembolism in a cohort from China [

 <sc>D</sc>-dimer levels, however this practice has yet to be well validated.
