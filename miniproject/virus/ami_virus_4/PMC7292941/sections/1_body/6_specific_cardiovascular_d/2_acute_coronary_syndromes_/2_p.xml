<p id="Par20">Further adding to the complexity of treating these patients, ST-segment elevations are seen in COVID-19 patients who are then found to have non-obstructive coronary disease. In a case series of 18 patients in New York, NY, who developed ST-segment elevations, nine patients underwent invasive angiography. Of these nine patients, three had no obstructive coronary artery disease and 5/6 with obstructive disease underwent PCI (1 after receiving thrombolytics) [

These cases of ST-segment elevation with no obstructive coronary disease on angiography may be related to peri-myocarditis, although the pathophysiology remains under investigation. Importantly, the mortality among patients without no obstructive coronary lesion was higher (90%) than among those with obstructive coronary lesions (50%), although the absolute numbers were limited. A similar incidence of obstructive to non-obstructive coronary lesions was reported in a population of Italian patients with STEMI [

The high prevalence of STEMI mimics in this population further emphasizes the need for angiography (either invasive or non-invasive) as opposed to empiric fibrinolytic therapy given the potential for harm when administering fibrinolytics for non-ACS presentations.
