<p id="Par4">Since the initial presentation of COVID-19, much has been learned about the pathophysiology and specific cardiovascular manifestations of the disease. Early in the pandemic, there was evidence that those with preexisting cardiovascular conditions were over-represented in cases of severe infection [

Additionally, COVID-19 appears to have several unique cardiovascular manifestations that cardiologists must understand, including worsening of heart failure, myocarditis, a proclivity for thrombosis, and arrythmia. Finally, the speed at which clinical trials for COVID-19 are being conducted, using both repurposed and new therapies, means that cardiologists must be aware of potential cardiovascular side effects for agents that are not commonly used in cardiovascular practice.
