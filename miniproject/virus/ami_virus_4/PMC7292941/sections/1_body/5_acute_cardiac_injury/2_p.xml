<p id="Par13">The mechanism of this acute cardiac injury remains elusive. Data from Zhou et al. and Guo et al. have shown that the rise in troponin typically occurs late in the disease process, typically occurring 10–14 days after the onset of symptoms and coincides with progressive respiratory decline and multiorgan failure [

However, there are few reports of systematic cardiac testing of patients with COVID-19 disease, and cardiac injury limited our ability to understand causal associations. A number of mechanisms have been proposed including direct myocardial injury and myocarditis, systemic hyperinflammatory response leading to cytokine storm and myocardial injury, microvascular thromboses, acute plaque rupture physiology, stress cardiomyopathy, and extreme oxygen supply–demand mismatch due to critical illness [

The relative mystery surrounding the pathophysiology of acute cardiac injury has resulted in conflicting recommendations regarding the use of troponin to screen and evaluate cardiac dysfunction in patients with COVID-19 disease. A communication by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) recommended against routine cardiac biomarker testing in patients presenting with COVID-19 disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, this risk prediction strategy has not yet been evaluated prospectively.
