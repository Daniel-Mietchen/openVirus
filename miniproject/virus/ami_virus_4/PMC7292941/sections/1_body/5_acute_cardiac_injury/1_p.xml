<p id="Par12">De novo cardiac injury has also been described in patients presenting with COVID-19 disease. Initial studies provide insight into the prevalence and incidence of acute cardiac injury patients presenting with COVID-19. Early studies reported a prevalence of acute cardiac injury of 12% in the entire cohort as defined by either high sensitivity troponin (Hs Tn) or the MB fraction of creatinine kinase (CK-MB) &gt; 99th percentile or new echocardiographic or electrocardiographic abnormalities with greater elevations in cardiac biomarkers among patients requiring ICU care [

Case cohort studies included data in patients for whom the outcome and illness course helped further elucidate the role of cardiac injury in COVID-19 disease. Zhou et al. showed that the initial Hs Tn was not dramatically elevated at illness onset, but that in non-survivors there was a rapid rise starting after day 10 that was not seen in survivors [

Based on these studies, the authors hypothesize that myocardial injury occurs frequently in patients with severe COVID disease and that myocardial dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of severe disease. As the pandemic progressed and patient outcomes were defined, investigators sought to evaluate the association of myocardial injury with mortality. In a multivariable Cox regression, acute cardiac injury at any point during hospital stay was associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 4.26, 95% confidence interval 1.92–9.49). Guo et al. examined the association of cardiac comorbidities and acute cardiac injury as defined by Hs Tn above the 99th percentile with mortality in a retrospective cohort of 187 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In this cohort, 28% of patients had acute cardiac injury. The proportion of non-survivors was increased in the groups with underlying cardiac comorbidities (hypertension, coronary artery disease, and cardiomyopathy) or myocardial injury and highest in groups with both. The authors did not assess measures of association beyond descriptive statistics. Thus, myocardial injury occurs not infrequently with COVID-19 disease and that the presence of myocardial injury portends both more severe disease and higher mortality.
