 </xref> has reached pandemic proportions requiring unprecedented actions. One established resource for national emergencies has been our nation’s military. The Department of Defense mobilized National Guard, Reserve, and Active Duty service members to support the COVID-19 response and thereby accessed the nation’s largest source for medical surge capacity. Our purpose for this commentary was to review over 80 years of publications in Military Medicine and identify a collection of relevant articles to the topic of COVID-19. These selected articles examine various aspects of infectious diseases, epidemics, and pandemics as analyzed through the lens of military medical experts. Our objective was to identify a selection of pertinent published military medical articles readily accessible with free access on the Military Medicine website.
