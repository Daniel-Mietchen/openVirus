<p>Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian phylogenies were inferred using RAxML (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B45" ref-type="bibr">Stamatakis 2014</xref>) and MrBayes V3.2.6 (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B42" ref-type="bibr">Ronquist et al. 2012</xref>), respectively. The best-fit substitution model for our datasets was determined by both the AIC and BIC tests in jModelTest2 (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B10" ref-type="bibr">Darriba et al. 2012</xref>) as the general-time reversible model with gamma distribution (GTR+ G). This model was applied in both analyses. RAxML was performed for 2000 bootstrap replications and MrBayes implemented the Metropolis-coupled Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) method, with three hot chains and one cold chain, and the analysis was run for 5 million generations with 25% burn-in. The analysis was performed in duplicate and the convergence of runs was determined by the average standard deviation in split frequencies of less than 0.01. Because majority of the additional DENV-2 genomes from the 2013 to 2014 outbreak period were only sequenced on their capsid/premembrane (C/PrM) gene region, we also inferred the phylogenetic tree for the partial C/PrM region. All the additional C/PrM sequences from Kenya as well as other closely related C-I and C-II sequences were downloaded and combined with the BEAST dataset (C/PrM region only). ML trees were then inferred, using the GTR+G, as determined by jModelTest2.
