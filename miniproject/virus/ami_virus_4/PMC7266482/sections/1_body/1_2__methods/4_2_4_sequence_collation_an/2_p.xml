<p>Alignments were obtained using MAFFT v7.428 (

 <xref rid="veaa026-B52" ref-type="bibr">Waterhouse et al. 2009</xref>) was used to manually edit the alignments. The sequences were then trimmed to only remain with the open reading frames of DENV-2, with further trimming being performed to remove sites that had long stretches of missing bases, leading to a final alignment of 7,040 nt. Recombination detection was performed on each of these alignments in the RDP4 software suite (
 <xref rid="veaa026-B28" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al. 2015</xref>) using RDP, GENECOV, and MAXCHI methods. RECSCAN and SISCAN methods were used for confirmatory recombination scans. Significant recombination was considered when it was detected by all the three methods and at least one confirmatory method. We removed the sequences that were detected to be recombinants based on these criteria. Each of the alignments was further confirmed by using the Genetic Algorithm for Recombination Detection (GARD) (
