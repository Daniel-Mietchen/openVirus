<p>Considering the role of DENV-2 in the epidemiology of dengue disease in Kenya, we investigated the spatial origin and evolutionary inferences of the Kenyan DENV-2 lineages collected during the 2013â€“4 and 2017 outbreaks. The findings from this study extend our understanding of the origin of the two circulating lineages of DENV-2, C-I and C-II, in Kenya. Furthermore, the newly generated sequences add to the number of DENV-2 genomes currently available from Africa, where the number of genomes remains limited despite the numerous reported outbreaks.</p>
