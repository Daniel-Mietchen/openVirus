<p>The MRCA of the Wajir/Mombasa strain existed in Kenya in early 2013 (2013.31; 95% HPD: 2013.07, 2013.38) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="veaa026-F2">Fig. 2</xref>) with the discrete state reconstruction putting the origin location of this strain’s MRCA in Africa (PP = 0.7). This strain shared an ancestor with genomes from Burkina Faso, which were isolated since 1983 and the ancestor existed in late 1979 (1979.82; 95% HPD: 1978.22, 1981.39). This strain was, therefore, introduced to Kenya between September 1979 and March 2013.
