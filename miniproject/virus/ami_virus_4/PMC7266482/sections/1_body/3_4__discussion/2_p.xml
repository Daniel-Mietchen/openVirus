<p>The most significant finding from this study is the revelation of the presence of two different lineages of DENV-2 Cosmopolitan genotype, C-I and C-II, in Kenya. It is important to note that after the initial emergence of the Cosmopolitan genotype, there was early separation of C-I and C-II/C-III lineages, leading to emergence of the two clearly defined lineages. Our findings show that this early separation occurred by April 1958 (95% HPD: 1950.46, 1963.89), with the C-II and C-III lineages separating by January 1961 (95% HPD: 1956.85, 1964.63) (

Our phylogenetic analysis show that the majority of the isolates from the coastal Kenya outbreak (Coastal Kenya strain) fell within the C-I lineage and the isolate from Wajir, together with two isolates from Mombasa (Wajir/Mombasa strain), fell within the C-II lineage. This, therefore, points to a more significant impact of the C-I lineage during the recent DENV-2 outbreaks in Kenya as compared with the C-II lineage.
