  <p>(A) Mid-point rooted ML phylogenetic Tree of 154 genome sequences isolated globally. Sequences from Kenya are highlighted with red tips representing sequences from 2017 outbreak and blue tips representing the 2013/4 outbreak sequences. The annotations shown are represented by; C, Cosmopolitan genotype; C-I, Cosmopolitan-I lineage; C-II, Cosmopolitan-II lineage; C-III, Cosmopolitan-III lineage; AA, Asian-American genotype; AI, Asian I genotype; AII, Asian II genotype; AM, American genotype. (B) ML phylogenetic tree generated using 129â€‰C/PrM gene sequences of the Cosmopolitan genotype only. The additional Kenyan sequences that were included in this dataset are colored with blue tip-labels.</p>
