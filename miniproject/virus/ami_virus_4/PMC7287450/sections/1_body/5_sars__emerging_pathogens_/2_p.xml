<p id="p0075">It was, however, not until the 2002 SARS-CoV-1 (SARS) crisis that anaesthesiologists recognised their field-specific vulnerabilities. Similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, globalisation facilitated rapid transmission of SARS, which uniquely concentrated within hospital settings. In Toronto, Canada, the North American epicentre of SARS, more than half of infected patients were healthcare workers.

 </xref> Anaesthesiologists were tasked with sedation and airway management of SARS patients, and were particularly at risk for infection because of exposure to the high viral loads of respiratory secretions. Whilst transmission of SARS was incompletely understood, the medical community recognised the need for infection control policies. A 2003 editorial in the 
 <italic>British Journal of Anaesthesia</italic> noted that, ‘our current infection control practices may have been adequate in the past, but they have been exposed as entirely inadequate in the presence of the highly infectious SARS virus. Anaesthetists must be rigorous about the application of standard precautions in everyday practice. In the presence of a known or suspected SARS patient, full droplet and contact precautions must be applied. For additional safety, until the exact nature of transmission of the coronavirus is elucidated, airborne precautions should be taken with high-risk procedures’.

 </xref> Although nearly 20 yr old, these recommendations for routine handwashing, double-gloving, and face-mask use remain the current recommended practices for COVID-19 management. Drawing upon the lessons from SARS, anaesthesiologists are advocates for planned intubations, negative-pressure operating theatres, and consistent use of personal protective equipment.
