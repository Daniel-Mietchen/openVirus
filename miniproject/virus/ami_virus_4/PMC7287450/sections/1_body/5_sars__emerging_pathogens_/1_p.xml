<p id="p0070">With the emergence of new pathogens, anaesthesiologists have become increasingly cognisant of infection prevention and control. Even before COVID-19, the risks of anaesthesiologists involve exposure to blood, secretions, and needle-stick injury. Before the onset of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) in the 1980s, anaesthesiologists routinely worked barehanded, using reusable masks, airways, and laryngoscopes. Anaesthesia breathing circuits were also reusable and sometimes not washed between patients. The HIV/AIDS epidemic provided an impetus for the specialty to develop safer practices. Anaesthesiologists began emphasising double-gloving, eye protection, and proper sharps disposal.</p>
