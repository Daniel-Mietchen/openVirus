<p id="p0085">Pandemics of cholera, polio, and SARS are not entirely relegated to history. Each has durably reshaped the roles and practice of anaesthesiology. The contributions of anaesthesiologists to these diseases prepared us for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. How might COVID-19 in turn shape the future practice of anaesthesiology? With resumption of elective procedures, anaesthesiologists will remain conscientious about respiratory precautions and aerosolization risks, and the occupational hazards of the specialty. The vital role of anaesthesiologists will also be better appreciated by both colleagues and the public, with the realisation that anaesthesiologists are indispensable and adaptable physicians beyond the operating theatre.</p>
