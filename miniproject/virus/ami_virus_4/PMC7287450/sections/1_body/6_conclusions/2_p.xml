<p id="p0090">Coronavirus disease 2019 has undoubtedly challenged the medical profession in innumerable ways. Anaesthesiologists have been thrust to the front lines and are often responsible for the most vulnerable patients. The practice of anaesthesiology, however, retains its fluidity, readily merging knowledge from the operating theatre, ICU, and medicine/surgical ward. This uniquely interdisciplinary skill set has enabled our colleagues to continue researching treatments and improvising equipment whilst facing shortages and uncertainty. These may be unprecedented times, but the specialty has had a long and consistent history of confronting and overcoming epidemics. Anaesthesiologists are uniquely positioned to influence the resumption of normal hospital activities and the preparation for future public health threats.</p>
