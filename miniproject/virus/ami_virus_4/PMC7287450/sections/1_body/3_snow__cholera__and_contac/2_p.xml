Contact tracing may be of greater practical value at waning caseloads. If privacy concerns are adequately addressed, digital contact tracing may be a significant tool to aid efforts at reopening. It is remarkable that a technique developed by this anaesthesiologist more than 170 yr ago remains so relevant today.
