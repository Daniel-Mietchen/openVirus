<p id="p0035">As for the governmental policies regarding the pandemic, we may also borrow some of Snow's scepticism. He was convinced by the science of his epidemiological studies, rather than by popular sentiment. Just as germ theory overcame miasma theory through hard data, COVID-19 policies have increasingly turned to scientific evidence. Social distancing and contact precautions now reflect our growing understanding of droplet transmission and aerosolization risk. Support of unsubstantiated therapies, such as hydroxychloroquine, has been questioned by large-scale studies.
