<p id="p0025">As a pioneer of anaesthesiology, John Snow (1813–58) elucidated the science behind the fledgling field. His methodical work with inhalational anaesthetics, such as his development of the dose-titrated delivery of chloroform, was amongst the first to characterise the stages of anaesthesia.

 </xref> John Snow applied the same rigorous science in his research of the 1848 London cholera epidemic. He rejected the prevailing miasma theory, which postulated that cholera was transmitted through the ‘bad air’ of decomposing organic matter. By mapping the density of cholera cases, Snow traced the most significant caseload to a certain water company, and then to a specific Broad Street water pump. Snow effectively deduced the true waterborne transmission of cholera, all before the advent of germ theory. The removal of said pump handle saw the decline of the cholera epidemic.
