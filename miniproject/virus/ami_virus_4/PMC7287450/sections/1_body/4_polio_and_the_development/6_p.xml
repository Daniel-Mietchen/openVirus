<p id="p0065">The respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 has been observed to differ from conventional acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because of the unique disruption of pulmonary vasoregulation, COVID-19 patients are often refractory to conventional ARDS protocols.

 </xref> We must therefore resort to our clinical acumen to modify ventilation protocols. Low-grade evidence suggests that prone positioning may improve oxygenation and decrease mortality in awake, non-intubated COVID-19 patients with severe acute respiratory distress.

 </xref> There is also some evidence that early intubation and effective sedation may reduce inspiratory drive and prevent further lung injury.

 </xref> Anaesthesiologists provide this crucial airway management, resuscitation, and ventilation support. In the absence of effective pharmacological treatment, respiratory support is essential to treating the often fatal COVID-19 respiratory distress syndrome.
