<p id="p0050">It was under these circumstances that anaesthesiologist Bjørn Ibsen (1915–2007) confronted the 1952 Copenhagen polio epidemic. His actions, in turn, set in motion development of intensive care medicine. Through his training in anaesthesiology, Ibsen was acutely aware of the benefits of positive-pressure ventilation. His clinical intuition regarding physiological abnormalities helped him deduce the cause of the ‘mysterious alkalosis’ of bulbar polio patients. This challenge was compounded by limitations of existing apparatus, which could only report increased CO
