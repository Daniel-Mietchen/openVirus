<p id="p0045">The disease processes of COVID-19 and polio are fundamentally distinct, as are their respiratory implications. Until 1953, polio seasonally ravaged populations with partial paralysis. The deadlier bulbar variety targeted motor neurones and rendered patients unable to breathe. Coronavirus disease 2019 provokes insidious inflammatory damage to the lung parenchyma itself. Polio and COVID-19 require different approaches in respiratory support; striking parallels, however, remain in the management of these two diseases. Both have challenged the brightest clinicians of their times. Although the pathology was poorly understood, bulbar poliomyelitis spurred advances in ventilator support. The former standard of negative-pressure ventilation with ‘iron lungs’ was largely incompatible with the irregular breathing associated with bulbar poliomyelitis, and mortality was up to 90%.

 </xref> Physicians sought better outcomes with other ventilation modalities. The renowned anaesthesiologist Arthur Guedel (1883–956) is credited with introducing the cuffed tracheal tube in 1932. Originally intended to reduce aspiration risk, cuffed tubes enabled administration of positive-pressure ventilation.

 </xref> Positive-pressure interventions demanded expertise in cardiorespiratory physiology, skills towards which anaesthesiologists were already primed.
