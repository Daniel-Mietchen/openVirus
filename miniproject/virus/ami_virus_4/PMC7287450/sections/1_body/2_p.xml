 </xref> Just as the COVID-19 pandemic has tested our specialty, previous epidemics revealed anaesthesiologists' unique skill set to our medical colleagues. Here, we focus on how historical cholera, polio, and SARS epidemics redefined the role of anaesthesiology, and how anaesthesiologists in turn helped develop contact tracing, intensive care, and infection control. Lessons learnt from these previous epidemics provide guidance in our management of COVID-19 today. Anaesthesiologists continue to lead in the front lines, maintaining a tradition of ingenuity and dedication.
