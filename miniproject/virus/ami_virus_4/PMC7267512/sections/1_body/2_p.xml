<p>To fill this knowledge gap about the potential neuroinvasiveness and route of central nervous system (CNS) entry, Silvia Natoli and collaborators went back to the scientific literature on animal models of SARS‐CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus [
 <xref rid="ene14278-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>]. They studied whether there is evidence for neuropathogenesis in experimental studies of these structurally similar CoVs, which were responsible for the epidemics with severe respiratory disease in 2002 and 2012, respectively. SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 share 79.6% sequence homology [
 <xref rid="ene14278-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>]. CoVs utilize distinct receptors for cell invasion and there are structural differences in human vs. murine receptors. SARS‐CoV and SARS‐CoV‐2 utilize the human angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) receptor, whereas the receptor of Middle East respiratory syndrome‐CoV is dipeptidylpeptidase‐4 (CD26) [
 <xref rid="ene14278-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>]. There are also differences in the binding site of ACE2 receptor for CoV and CoV‐2 [
 <xref rid="ene14278-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>]. ACE2 is not only expressed in the lung and small intestine, but also in the vasculature and in the cytoplasm of neurons. Animal studies in human ACE2 transgenic mice confirmed neuronal vulnerability for infection by CoV and tropism for the brainstem [
 <xref rid="ene14278-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>]. The animal studies also provided hints for the potential routes of CNS entry, i.e. olfactory bulbs, peripheral nerves, synapse‐connected route from the lungs to the medullary cardiorespiratory center and hematogenic spread [
 <xref rid="ene14278-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>]. The animal experiments furthermore identified that features of CoV CNS infection include a key role for the innate immune system, impact of aging and an earlier viral clearance in animal models. The experimental work on CoVs was not only conducted in mice but also non‐human primates, hamsters and ferrets; the most suitable animal model has not been found so far.
