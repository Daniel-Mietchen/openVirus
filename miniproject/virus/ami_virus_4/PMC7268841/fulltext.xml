In the context of the present coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic there is significant controversy as to what forms of PPE are appropriate or adequate. This review aims to describe the pathogenic mechanism and route of spread of the causative virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, as it pertains to accumulated published data from experienced centers globally. The various forms of PPE that are both available and appropriate are addressed. There are options in the form of eyewear, gloves, masks, respirators, and gowns. The logical and practical utilization of these should be data driven and evolve based on both experience and data. Last, situations specific to surgical populations are addressed. We aim to provide granular collective data that has thus far been published and that can be used as a reference for optimal PPE choices in the perioperative setting for surgical teams.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>coronavirus disease 2019</kwd><kwd>operation</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>surgery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>PUBSTATE</meta-name><meta-value>POST-ACCEPTANCE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The concept of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the surgeon has been in place for greater than 100 years. The aim has been to protect both the surgeon and the patient. As zoonotic respiratory pathogens emerge, surgeons, and their teams will, however, need to adapt quickly to what will adequately protect them and their patients. There has been a generalized call for more PPE; however, there is a wide array of PPE available. High-quality evidence related to the epidemiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>; therefore, inferences based on existing data will need to be made to make decisions moving forward. Physicians need to be knowledgeable about transmission of the virus, as well as the capabilities and limitations of their respective PPE. This review aims to address both the mechanism of the contagion and the capabilities of PPE in the perioperative setting in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p><sec><title>THE CORONAVIRUS SARS-COV-2 AND ROUTES OF PATHOGENESIS</title><p>Coronaviruses are spherically enveloped RNA viruses that have club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface, giving them the appearance of a solar corona.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Before the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, these were primarily thought to be mild seasonal pathogens.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic is SARS-CoV-2,<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> which has 79% homology with SARS-CoV, and a similar receptor-binding domain.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The particle core diameter is 82 to 94&#x0200a;nm, and spikes extend another 19&#x0200a;nm, giving a total average size of 101 to 113&#x0200a;nm (0.1&#x0200a;&#x003bc;m).<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Spikes are essential for infectivity,<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> which is thought to be via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor expressed in type II alveolar cells.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> During initial infection, there are also high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Transmission is believed to be predominantly via inhalation of droplets. The distinction between droplet (10&#x02013;100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;m) and aerosol (&#x0003c;10&#x0200a;&#x003bc;m) is based on diameter of the respiratory particles leading to transmission (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Droplet transmission occurs during an expiratory event (breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing) that deposits droplets onto a susceptible person's mucous membranes; because these gravitationally settle quickly, transmission is only through close contact. By comparison, aerosol transmission is through smaller respiratory droplets that can remain airborne.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Although many respiratory pathogens can behave as &#x0201c;airborne&#x0201d; in a favorable environment, relatively few (notably, tuberculosis, measles, and varicella) are thought to have the potential to be transmitted by the long-range airborne route.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Data related to transmission for COVID-19 is largely inferred from data related to SARS-CoV.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Some reports also show aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Air samples from COVID-19 patients&#x02019; rooms have, however, been very low or negative for virus therefore supporting the idea of droplet-only transmission.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> During normal breathing, the falling distance of droplets is &#x0003c;2&#x0200a;cm, but coughing and sneezing produce larger and higher velocity droplets.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> A 30&#x0200a;&#x003bc;m droplet produced during a cough travels up to 2.5&#x0200a;m from the subject.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Certain patient procedures are also considered to aerosolize respiratory secretions, including endotracheal intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, bronchoscopy, open suction of the respiratory tract, sputum induction, use of nebulizer therapy, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and high frequency oscillatory ventilation.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This is particularly relevant to surgical populations as nearly all of these procedures can be a part of standard perioperative care.</p><p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Schematic of droplet versus airborne transmission of respiratory particles produced from a cough.

</p><p>As data are forthcoming on the asymptomatic spread of this virus, each infected person on average can spread to another 2.2 people, and an epidemic will increase as long as this value is &#x0003e;1 person.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Therefore the goal of PPE is to protect the individual and limit this spread in the asymptomatic healthcare worker to their colleagues and respective patients who are disease free.</p></sec><sec><title>THE RISK TO HEALTHCARE WORKERS</title><p>A recent report by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed that only 3.8% of all cases were healthcare personnel. Although 15% were classified as severe or critical, there was a 0.2% mortality rate.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Earlier in the pandemic, infection of healthcare workers was as high as 29%,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and this dramatically decreased thereafter. This decrease in infection rate is likely a reflection of the PPE measures put in place to appropriately protect healthcare workers.</p></sec><sec><title>TYPES OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND SUPPORTING DATA</title><p>There are several different types of PPE, including eye protection, gowns, gloves, surgical face masks, nonpowered filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), and powered air-purifying respirators.

Nevertheless, eye protection is recommended when caring for a patient with known or suspected COVID-19 infection by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> in Korea in a number of different patient care situations,<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> and in Hong Kong for high-risk patient interactions.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Gowns and Gloves</title><p>Because COVID-19 is thought to spread via droplets, less data regarding the transmission of COVID-19 are focused on gowns and gloves, which are the PPE components of contact precautions. Handwashing has been unequivocally recognized as an essential measure to slow contact transmission; its frequent practice is less reliant on new or additional healthcare resources and therefore will not be discussed in further detail here. Gowns are rated by American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation PB70:2012 standards level 1 to 4, with level 4 having the greatest protection against viruses.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> During the SARS epidemic, 2 studies found that uninfected healthcare workers in Hong Kong more often wore gowns as a part of their PPE when compared to infected healthcare workers<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>; one of these studies also reported a significant difference for wearing gloves.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Both reported uninfected healthcare workers were more likely to wear all recommended PPE.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> It should be noted that in a laboratory environment, aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 has a median half-life of 5.6&#x0200a;hours on stainless steel, and 6.8&#x0200a;hours on plastic,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> and has also been detected on surfaces in patient rooms.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Therefore, the use of gown and gloves may help prevent transmission from fomites to the healthcare worker's mucous membranes. The CDC recommends both gowns and gloves when caring for a patient with known or suspected COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Full body protective suits have been used in other viral epidemics that are bloodborne and spread primarily by contact (eg, Ebola virus<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>) but the authors found no data regarding their use for SARS-CoV or COVID-19.</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical Face Masks</title><p>In the United States, surgical masks are rated by ASTM (ASTM International) F2100-19 as level 1, 2, or 3 based on their permeability to synthetic blood, bacteria (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>), particles (latex spheres), and flammability. Level 1 masks must have &#x0003e;95% filtration efficiency to bacteria and air particles 0.1 to 5.0&#x0200a;&#x003bc;m. For levels 2 and 3, this increases to &#x0003e;98%. Level 3 surgical masks do not have additional filtration efficiency but do have greater resistance to synthetic blood. Very few reports or guidelines distinguish between the different types of surgical masks though. Furthermore, these ratings apply to the materials used in manufacturing. Because surgical masks fit loosely, they cannot reliably prevent inhalation of all airborne particles,<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> but they do help to a degree. One study found that a level 1 mask reduced passage of 0.02 to 1&#x0200a;&#x003bc;m particles 2.7-fold.<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>Surgical masks appear to be helpful in decreasing the transmission of influenza, SARS-CoV, and COVID-19. Two randomized controlled trials have been performed to compare surgical masks (level 3)<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> or unspecified<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> to N95 masks regarding transmission of influenza to healthcare workers. The results showed no difference in the influenza infection rates between the surgical mask and N95 groups.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Another study by Yen et al<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> compared hospitals with and without SARS-CoV healthcare worker infections. These authors found that zero healthcare worker infections were more likely in hospitals where surgical masks were worn upon entering the hospital, on the wards, and in outpatient clinics.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> This is the same plan of action currently being used in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> A recent study from Singapore of 41 healthcare workers in close contact (10+ min, &#x0003c;2 m away) with a critically ill COVID-19 patient showed zero transmissions.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Of these healthcare workers, 35 of 41 (85%) were using a surgical mask for respiratory protection.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Thus, since surgical face masks filter particles larger than 0.1 to 5.0&#x0200a;&#x003bc;m and the droplets that carry Sars-CoV-2 are larger, it stands to reason that there should be adequate protection from transmission of COVID-19 in low risk circumstances. These findings have led many institutions to promote use of surgical face masks in lower risk patient interactions, and advocate for the futility of N95 respirator masks especially during times of scarcity. It should be noted, however, that the CDC recommends use of a surgical face mask if a respirator is not available when caring for a patient with known or suspected COVID-19.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Filtering Facepiece Respirators&#x02014;Nonpowered</title><p>FFRs are PPE designed to protect against respirable particulate matter (irrespective of whether they are inert or biologic particles). The most commonly used FFR do not require electricity (nonpowered), and function simply as a mask. They are classified by the percentage of challenge particles &#x0003e;0.3&#x0200a;&#x003bc;m filtered out during testing (95%, 99%, 99.9%) and by the type of particles filtered out. &#x0201c;R&#x0201d; rated FFR are somewhat resistant to oil, &#x0201c;P&#x0201d; rated FFR are more strongly resistant to oil, whereas &#x0201c;N&#x0201d; rated FFR are not resistant to oil. FFRs have an assigned protection factor (APF) of 10 meaning they can reduce aerosol concentration to one tenth of the ambient air (ie, blocking 90% of airborne particles). They must meet certification tests established by National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health; however, the FDA does not perform independent testing of any FFR other than surgical N95 masks.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Surgical N95 masks are constructed to prevent contamination of the sterile field while providing the same protection of conventional N95s. The FDA publishes certified vendors of surgical N95s as a resource for individuals and for purchasing institutions.<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> The different types of FFRs are presented in Table <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of Nonpowered Filtering Facepiece Respirators That Cover the Mouth and Nose</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ansu-publish-ahead-of-print-10.1097.sla.0000000000003991-g003"/></table-wrap><p>FFRs have been tested against ultrafine viral particles (0.02&#x02013;0.5 &#x003bc;m).<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Results varied slightly by the type of viral particle, but with airflow rates for nonstrenuous breathing, N95 penetration was 0.23% to 1.68%, and N99 penetration was 0.96% to 1.03%. Of note, viral penetration did increase with moderate airflow (simulating strenuous breathing), up to approximately 5% for N99 and N95 FFRs.<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Another study compared viral penetration of N95 masks to surgical masks, and showed that while N95 penetration was 5%, level 2 surgical mask penetration was 21%, and level 1 surgical mask penetration was 85% for moderate airflow.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The extrapolation of these data to infection by droplet transmission may be flawed, however, due to the larger size of the droplets (10&#x02013;100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;m) that carry SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in a nonexperimental setting. An example of this is the similar transmission rates of influenza to healthcare workers using N95 or surgical masks described above.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>There are several studies that examine N95 use as it relates to transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.

They have components which can be reused, and an APF of 25.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> More advanced forms of PPE used in industry and firefighting include supplied air respirators (APF = 1000) and self-contained breathing apparatus (APF = 10,000).<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> The authors could not find specific data regarding these types of respirators as they pertain to the protection or transmission of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>COVID-19 AND SITUATIONS SPECIFIC TO SURGERY</title><p>As of March 30, 2020 the authors were unable to find published cases of transmission of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 from patients to surgeons or operating room staff, but news sources that have reported this during transsphenoidal surgery.<sup><xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> All protocols for PPE use in the operating room must therefore be inferred. Operating rooms and airborne infectious isolation rooms must have a minimum of 20 air changes per hour and do not recirculate to other rooms, which translates into 99.9% efficiency for the removal of air in 21 minutes.<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> By comparison, nonisolation patient rooms have a minimum of 4 air changes per hour and may recirculate air.<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> It is known that aerosol transmission of infectious diseases can be influenced by ventilation,<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> which suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 may be lower in an operating room. This must be weighed, however, against the fact that aerosolizing procedures are much more likely to take place in an operating room.</p><p>Intubation is thought to be a particularly high-risk aerosolizing procedure. Viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 are known to be high in the upper respiratory tract of infected patients,<sup><xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref></sup> and a study of critical care nurses from Toronto during the SARS-CoV epidemic found that these nurses were more likely to become infected when present during intubations.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> For this reason, specific recommendations regarding PPE for intubation of patients with COVID-19 have been made.<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> SARS-CoV-2 is also present in bodily tissues; although nearly all patients (93%) have evidence of virus in their sputum, some (29%) also have virus in the stool.<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> Only 1% have evidence of virus in the blood.<sup><xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref></sup> Taken together, this suggests that pulmonary and upper respiratory surgeries are likely to be higher risk, but that colorectal and gastrointestinal surgeries may also have greater risk of transmission. Questions have been raised regarding risk during laparoscopic surgery, and if cauterization can aerosolize SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></sup> There is evidence that hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus may become aerosolized during electrocautery,<sup><xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref></sup> although they both are DNA viruses that have different mechanisms of transmission and sites of infection compared to SARS-CoV-2, challenging this inference. Nevertheless, given the paucity of data, and since it is known that virus RNA may be within the stool, every attempt should be made to minimize the evacuation of cautery smoke into the operating room per current guidelines from the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons.<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup> This can be done using devices that filter released carbon dioxide.<sup><xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref></sup></p><p>A study of 3 patients with SARS-CoV who underwent caesarean sections reported that no healthcare workers in the operating room were infected when using the following PPE: powered air-purifying respirator with a hood covering the face and shoulders, goggles, gown, gloves, and cap.<sup><xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> Of note, 2 out of 3 of these patients developed wound infections, but their being treated with high-dose steroids may have been a confounder.<sup><xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></sup> Before the COVID-19 pandemic, use of PAPRs in combination with body suits was already popular in orthopedic surgery. A randomized controlled trial that accrued from 1974 to 1979 demonstrated that orthopedic surgeons who used PAPRs had significantly decreased aerosolized bacterial counts in the operating room and decreased incidence of deep joint sepsis<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>; the application of this study to modern operating rooms, however, has come into question.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> A study of simulated joint surgery using fluorescein demonstrated that spread of respirable particulate matter to the proceduralist was eliminated with a powered air-purifying respirator and a level 4 gown.<sup><xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></sup> A similar study also showed that individuals wearing surgical masks without a PAPR had evidence of particulate matter within their nostrils, eyebrows, and eyelashes.<sup><xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></sup> Although certainly not definitive, these studies suggest that PAPR may be effective in reducing aerosolized transmission of COVID-19.</p><p>Protocols for running an operating room during the COVID-19 pandemic have emerged in the last month.<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> Wong et al<sup><xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> recommended reviewing the patient, inducing anesthesia, operating, and recovering all within the operating room itself. In contrast, Ti et al<sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> recommended anesthesia inductions in a separate negative pressure room. Both authors recommend OR staff wear at minimum N95 masks, goggles, or face shield, gown, and boot covers, with a powered air-purifying respirator for intubation and aerosol-generating procedures.<sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> Ti et al<sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> recommended a runner be stationed outside the operating room to get supplies and deliver them to a trolley which is pushed into an anteroom, that is then accessed by a member of the operating room team. This may limit the amount of PPE used with every entry and exit from the operating room.<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></sup> It has also been recommended that postoperatively all team members shower.<sup><xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref></sup> A COVID-19 operating room coordinator and a team huddle before surgery may be used to facilitate smooth transitions of care and appropriate use of PPE.<sup><xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></sup> We have compiled a list of recommendations from our institution regarding operating room PPE use during the COVID-19 pandemic (Table <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 3</label><caption><p>Our Hospital's Recommendations Regarding Operating Room Personal Protective Equipment During the COVID-19 Pandemic</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ansu-publish-ahead-of-print-10.1097.sla.0000000000003991-g004"/></table-wrap><p>There is a paucity of data on the optimal postoperative management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. We were unable to find reliable guidance on the risks of deep breathing, incentive spirometry, ambulation outside the room, or other maneuvers as part of pulmonary hygiene. A single report, in press, describes 3 patients who underwent elective operations (incisional hernia repair, cholecystectomy, hysterectomy), and were found to have COVID-19 in the postoperative period; 2 out of these 3 patients died.<sup><xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref></sup> Although this small series cannot truly tell what a patient's risk is if they contract COVID-19 in the perioperative period, it suggests that strong consideration should be taken for nonemergency operations at this time.</p><p>If elective or semielective surgery is not being performed on patients with COVID-19, this is an additional modality to protect surgeons and operating room teams. To this end, many institutions, including ours, are utilizing multidisciplinary teams to determine which procedures can be delayed. Protocols are evolving to allow for preoperative testing of patients in the semielective surgical setting to ascertain the safest scenarios both for the healthcare team and for the patient. As resources are made available (specifically testing mechanisms) this approach will certainly be adopted by mirroring the approach of countries such as China, who were first to experience this pandemic. Ultimately, the most effective mitigation of risk for the entirety of the population will be the generation of viable effective vaccines that will provide protection for the at-risk population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Use of PPE is but one of myriad factors in the effort to mitigate the transmission of hospital acquired infections. Other factors in transmission, some mentioned above, include aerosol and droplet dynamics, infectious particle settling rate, ventilation and air distribution patterns, humidity and temperature, number of infected, number of susceptible, length of exposure, type and degree of invasive procedures, UV light and chemical exposure, and persistence of pathogens within a host.<sup><xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup> Use of PPE and to what extent PPE are used, however, can often be individually decided upon by physicians. The premise of this review was not so much to make recommendations, because many hospitals, organizations, and societies have already done so. It was rather to explain the data that exist, and we presume, how these recommendations came to be made. Furthermore, this body of work can serve as a reference for decision making regarding how and when PPE are used when healthcare providers feel they have a choice, or when they are requesting more PPE. Additional data will be needed to better allocate these now very valuable resources.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Y.F. has the following disclosures, all unrelated to the writing of this manuscript: Scientific consultant for Intuitive, Medtronic, Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, and Olympus.
