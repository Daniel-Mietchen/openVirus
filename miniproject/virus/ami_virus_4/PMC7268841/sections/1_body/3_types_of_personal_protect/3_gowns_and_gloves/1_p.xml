<p>Because COVID-19 is thought to spread via droplets, less data regarding the transmission of COVID-19 are focused on gowns and gloves, which are the PPE components of contact precautions. Handwashing has been unequivocally recognized as an essential measure to slow contact transmission; its frequent practice is less reliant on new or additional healthcare resources and therefore will not be discussed in further detail here. Gowns are rated by American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation PB70:2012 standards level 1 to 4, with level 4 having the greatest protection against viruses.

 </sup> During the SARS epidemic, 2 studies found that uninfected healthcare workers in Hong Kong more often wore gowns as a part of their PPE when compared to infected healthcare workers

 </sup> It should be noted that in a laboratory environment, aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 has a median half-life of 5.6 hours on stainless steel, and 6.8 hours on plastic,

 </sup> Therefore, the use of gown and gloves may help prevent transmission from fomites to the healthcare worker's mucous membranes. The CDC recommends both gowns and gloves when caring for a patient with known or suspected COVID-19.

 </sup> Full body protective suits have been used in other viral epidemics that are bloodborne and spread primarily by contact (eg, Ebola virus
