<p>FFRs have been tested against ultrafine viral particles (0.02–0.5 μm).

 </sup> Results varied slightly by the type of viral particle, but with airflow rates for nonstrenuous breathing, N95 penetration was 0.23% to 1.68%, and N99 penetration was 0.96% to 1.03%. Of note, viral penetration did increase with moderate airflow (simulating strenuous breathing), up to approximately 5% for N99 and N95 FFRs.

 </sup> Another study compared viral penetration of N95 masks to surgical masks, and showed that while N95 penetration was 5%, level 2 surgical mask penetration was 21%, and level 1 surgical mask penetration was 85% for moderate airflow.

 </sup> The extrapolation of these data to infection by droplet transmission may be flawed, however, due to the larger size of the droplets (10–100 μm) that carry SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in a nonexperimental setting. An example of this is the similar transmission rates of influenza to healthcare workers using N95 or surgical masks described above.
