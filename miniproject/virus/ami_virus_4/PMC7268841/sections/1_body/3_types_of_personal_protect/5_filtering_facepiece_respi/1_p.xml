<p>FFRs are PPE designed to protect against respirable particulate matter (irrespective of whether they are inert or biologic particles). The most commonly used FFR do not require electricity (nonpowered), and function simply as a mask. They are classified by the percentage of challenge particles &gt;0.3 μm filtered out during testing (95%, 99%, 99.9%) and by the type of particles filtered out. “R” rated FFR are somewhat resistant to oil, “P” rated FFR are more strongly resistant to oil, whereas “N” rated FFR are not resistant to oil. FFRs have an assigned protection factor (APF) of 10 meaning they can reduce aerosol concentration to one tenth of the ambient air (ie, blocking 90% of airborne particles). They must meet certification tests established by National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health; however, the FDA does not perform independent testing of any FFR other than surgical N95 masks.

 </sup> Surgical N95 masks are constructed to prevent contamination of the sterile field while providing the same protection of conventional N95s. The FDA publishes certified vendors of surgical N95s as a resource for individuals and for purchasing institutions.
