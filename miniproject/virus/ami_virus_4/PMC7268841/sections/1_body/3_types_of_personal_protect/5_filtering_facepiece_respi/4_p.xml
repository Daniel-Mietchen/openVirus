<p>Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, resource scarcity has raised the prospect of reuse of FFRs. Extended single use of FFR is favored over limited reuse because of the risk of self-inoculation.

 </sup> For extended single use, this is most practical when patients are cohorted (patients with a common diagnosis in the same unit).

 </sup> It has been shown that donning an FFR up to 20 times maintains good fit; however, quality of fit decreases with subsequent uses and best fit was seen after the first 5 donnings.

 </sup> A Veterans Administration study also revealed the median tolerance time for FFR masks to be 6 to 7 hours due to heat and facial discomfort, suggesting that healthcare workers cannot be expected to work prolonged shifts (≥12 hours) in an environment which requires continuous FFR.

 </sup> It should also be noted that bleach and microwave decontamination of FFRs may damage or render masks unsafe.

 </sup> Conversely, ultraviolet irradiation and ethylene oxide may be more suitable for decontamination.

 </sup> Researchers at Duke University recently published a verifiable decontamination protocol for N95 respirators using hydrogen peroxide vapor.

 </sup> Unpublished data from Stanford University suggests that heating N95 masks to 70°C for 30 minutes is sufficient to destroy coronavirus particles and does not diminish filtration efficiency.
