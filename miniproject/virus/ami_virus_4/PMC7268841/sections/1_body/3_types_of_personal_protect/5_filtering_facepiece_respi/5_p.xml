<p>Alternate types of nonpowered FFR include elastomeric facepiece respirators (EFR, either half- or full-face versions) commonly known as “gas masks.” EFRs employ a reusable facepiece which covers the mouth and nose (half-face) or mouth, nose, and eyes (full-face) with disposable filter cartridges which can filter particulates as well as vapors and gasses (when using appropriate filters). Advantages of EFR include reusability and expanded applicability; however, they require adequate cleaning and are known to significantly limit verbal communication between healthcare providers.
