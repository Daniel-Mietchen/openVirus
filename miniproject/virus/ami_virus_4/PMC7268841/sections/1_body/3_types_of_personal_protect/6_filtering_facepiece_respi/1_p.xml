<p>Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPR) and atmosphere supplying respirators provide additional protection through fan powered and filtered airflow coupled with complete enclosure of the head. One specific advantage of PAPRs is they may be used by individuals with facial hair or those who fail standard fit tests for FFR. They also provide low-resistance breathing and often do not touch the face which may be more comfortable. They have components which can be reused, and an APF of 25.

 </sup> More advanced forms of PPE used in industry and firefighting include supplied air respirators (APF = 1000) and self-contained breathing apparatus (APF = 10,000).
