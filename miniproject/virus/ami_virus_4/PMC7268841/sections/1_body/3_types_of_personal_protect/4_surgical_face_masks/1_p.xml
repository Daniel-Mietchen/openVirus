<p>In the United States, surgical masks are rated by ASTM (ASTM International) F2100-19 as level 1, 2, or 3 based on their permeability to synthetic blood, bacteria (
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>), particles (latex spheres), and flammability. Level 1 masks must have &gt;95% filtration efficiency to bacteria and air particles 0.1 to 5.0 μm. For levels 2 and 3, this increases to &gt;98%. Level 3 surgical masks do not have additional filtration efficiency but do have greater resistance to synthetic blood. Very few reports or guidelines distinguish between the different types of surgical masks though. Furthermore, these ratings apply to the materials used in manufacturing. Because surgical masks fit loosely, they cannot reliably prevent inhalation of all airborne particles,
