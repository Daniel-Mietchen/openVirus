<p>On January 23, 2020, Dr. Wang Guangfa of Peking University First Hospital reported that he had COVID-19 and believed it was transmitted through his conjunctiva because he wore an N95 mask.

 </sup> There is evidence that ACE2 receptors are present in the aqueous humor of the eye,

 </sup> Laboratory studies also show that influenza can enter the nasopharynx with only ocular exposure,

 </sup> Thus, at this time, there is limited data that transmission of COVID-19 can occur through the mucous membranes of the eyes, or that eye protection beyond what is already routine is helpful in preventing transmission. Nevertheless, eye protection is recommended when caring for a patient with known or suspected COVID-19 infection by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
