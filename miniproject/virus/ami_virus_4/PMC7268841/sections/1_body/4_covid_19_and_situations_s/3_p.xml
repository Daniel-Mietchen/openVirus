<p>A study of 3 patients with SARS-CoV who underwent caesarean sections reported that no healthcare workers in the operating room were infected when using the following PPE: powered air-purifying respirator with a hood covering the face and shoulders, goggles, gown, gloves, and cap.

 </sup> Of note, 2 out of 3 of these patients developed wound infections, but their being treated with high-dose steroids may have been a confounder.

 </sup> Before the COVID-19 pandemic, use of PAPRs in combination with body suits was already popular in orthopedic surgery. A randomized controlled trial that accrued from 1974 to 1979 demonstrated that orthopedic surgeons who used PAPRs had significantly decreased aerosolized bacterial counts in the operating room and decreased incidence of deep joint sepsis

 </sup> A study of simulated joint surgery using fluorescein demonstrated that spread of respirable particulate matter to the proceduralist was eliminated with a powered air-purifying respirator and a level 4 gown.

 </sup> A similar study also showed that individuals wearing surgical masks without a PAPR had evidence of particulate matter within their nostrils, eyebrows, and eyelashes.

 </sup> Although certainly not definitive, these studies suggest that PAPR may be effective in reducing aerosolized transmission of COVID-19.
