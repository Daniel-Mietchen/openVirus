<p>There is a paucity of data on the optimal postoperative management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. We were unable to find reliable guidance on the risks of deep breathing, incentive spirometry, ambulation outside the room, or other maneuvers as part of pulmonary hygiene. A single report, in press, describes 3 patients who underwent elective operations (incisional hernia repair, cholecystectomy, hysterectomy), and were found to have COVID-19 in the postoperative period; 2 out of these 3 patients died.

 </sup> Although this small series cannot truly tell what a patient's risk is if they contract COVID-19 in the perioperative period, it suggests that strong consideration should be taken for nonemergency operations at this time.
