  <xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>
 </sup> recommended reviewing the patient, inducing anesthesia, operating, and recovering all within the operating room itself. In contrast, Ti et al
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>
 </sup> recommended anesthesia inductions in a separate negative pressure room. Both authors recommend OR staff wear at minimum N95 masks, goggles, or face shield, gown, and boot covers, with a powered air-purifying respirator for intubation and aerosol-generating procedures.

 </sup> Ti et al
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>
 </sup> recommended a runner be stationed outside the operating room to get supplies and deliver them to a trolley which is pushed into an anteroom, that is then accessed by a member of the operating room team. This may limit the amount of PPE used with every entry and exit from the operating room.

 </sup> It has also been recommended that postoperatively all team members shower.
