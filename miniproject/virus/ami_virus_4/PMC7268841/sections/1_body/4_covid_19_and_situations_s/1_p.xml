<p>As of March 30, 2020 the authors were unable to find published cases of transmission of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 from patients to surgeons or operating room staff, but news sources that have reported this during transsphenoidal surgery.

 </sup> All protocols for PPE use in the operating room must therefore be inferred. Operating rooms and airborne infectious isolation rooms must have a minimum of 20 air changes per hour and do not recirculate to other rooms, which translates into 99.9% efficiency for the removal of air in 21 minutes.

 </sup> By comparison, nonisolation patient rooms have a minimum of 4 air changes per hour and may recirculate air.
