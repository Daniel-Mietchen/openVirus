<p>Intubation is thought to be a particularly high-risk aerosolizing procedure. Viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 are known to be high in the upper respiratory tract of infected patients,

 </sup> For this reason, specific recommendations regarding PPE for intubation of patients with COVID-19 have been made.

 </sup> SARS-CoV-2 is also present in bodily tissues; although nearly all patients (93%) have evidence of virus in their sputum, some (29%) also have virus in the stool.

 </sup> Only 1% have evidence of virus in the blood.

 </sup> Taken together, this suggests that pulmonary and upper respiratory surgeries are likely to be higher risk, but that colorectal and gastrointestinal surgeries may also have greater risk of transmission. Questions have been raised regarding risk during laparoscopic surgery, and if cauterization can aerosolize SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> There is evidence that hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus may become aerosolized during electrocautery,

  <xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
  <xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>
 </sup> although they both are DNA viruses that have different mechanisms of transmission and sites of infection compared to SARS-CoV-2, challenging this inference. Nevertheless, given the paucity of data, and since it is known that virus RNA may be within the stool, every attempt should be made to minimize the evacuation of cautery smoke into the operating room per current guidelines from the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons.
