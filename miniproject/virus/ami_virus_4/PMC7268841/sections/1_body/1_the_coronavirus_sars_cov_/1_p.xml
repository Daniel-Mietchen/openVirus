<p>Coronaviruses are spherically enveloped RNA viruses that have club-shaped spike projections emanating from the surface, giving them the appearance of a solar corona.

 </sup> Before the appearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, these were primarily thought to be mild seasonal pathogens.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
 </sup> The virus causing the COVID-19 pandemic is SARS-CoV-2,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
 </sup> which has 79% homology with SARS-CoV, and a similar receptor-binding domain.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
 </sup> The particle core diameter is 82 to 94 nm, and spikes extend another 19 nm, giving a total average size of 101 to 113 nm (0.1 μm).

 </sup> Spikes are essential for infectivity,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
 </sup> which is thought to be via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor expressed in type II alveolar cells.

 </sup> During initial infection, there are also high viral loads in the upper respiratory tract.

 </sup> Transmission is believed to be predominantly via inhalation of droplets. The distinction between droplet (10–100 μm) and aerosol (&lt;10 μm) is based on diameter of the respiratory particles leading to transmission (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 </sup> Droplet transmission occurs during an expiratory event (breathing, talking, coughing, sneezing) that deposits droplets onto a susceptible person's mucous membranes; because these gravitationally settle quickly, transmission is only through close contact. By comparison, aerosol transmission is through smaller respiratory droplets that can remain airborne.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
 </sup> Although many respiratory pathogens can behave as “airborne” in a favorable environment, relatively few (notably, tuberculosis, measles, and varicella) are thought to have the potential to be transmitted by the long-range airborne route.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 </sup> Data related to transmission for COVID-19 is largely inferred from data related to SARS-CoV.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
 </sup> Some reports also show aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV.

  <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
  <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
 </sup> Air samples from COVID-19 patients’ rooms have, however, been very low or negative for virus therefore supporting the idea of droplet-only transmission.

  <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
 </sup> During normal breathing, the falling distance of droplets is &lt;2 cm, but coughing and sneezing produce larger and higher velocity droplets.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
  <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
 </sup> A 30 μm droplet produced during a cough travels up to 2.5 m from the subject.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
 </sup> Certain patient procedures are also considered to aerosolize respiratory secretions, including endotracheal intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, bronchoscopy, open suction of the respiratory tract, sputum induction, use of nebulizer therapy, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation, and high frequency oscillatory ventilation.

 </sup> This is particularly relevant to surgical populations as nearly all of these procedures can be a part of standard perioperative care.
