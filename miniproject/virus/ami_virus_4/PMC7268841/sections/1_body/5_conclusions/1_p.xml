<p>Use of PPE is but one of myriad factors in the effort to mitigate the transmission of hospital acquired infections. Other factors in transmission, some mentioned above, include aerosol and droplet dynamics, infectious particle settling rate, ventilation and air distribution patterns, humidity and temperature, number of infected, number of susceptible, length of exposure, type and degree of invasive procedures, UV light and chemical exposure, and persistence of pathogens within a host.

 </sup> Use of PPE and to what extent PPE are used, however, can often be individually decided upon by physicians. The premise of this review was not so much to make recommendations, because many hospitals, organizations, and societies have already done so. It was rather to explain the data that exist, and we presume, how these recommendations came to be made. Furthermore, this body of work can serve as a reference for decision making regarding how and when PPE are used when healthcare providers feel they have a choice, or when they are requesting more PPE. Additional data will be needed to better allocate these now very valuable resources.
