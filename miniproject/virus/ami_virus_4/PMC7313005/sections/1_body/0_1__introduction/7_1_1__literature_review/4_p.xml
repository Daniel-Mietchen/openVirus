<p>Kwok et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-17-04124" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] examined the community’s psychological and behavioral responses during the early phase of the Hong Kong epidemic of COVID-19. Analysis of 1715 complete responses indicated high perceived susceptibility (89%) and high perceived severity (97%). Most of the respondents were worried about COVID-19 (97%), and had their daily routines disrupted (slightly/greatly: 98%). The level of anxiety, measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, was borderline abnormal (9.01). Almost all respondents were alert to the disease progression (99.5%). The most reliable sources of information were doctors (84%), followed by broadcasts (57%) and newspapers (54%), but they were not common sources of information (doctor: 5%, broadcast: 34%, newspaper: 40%). Only 16% respondents found official websites to be reliable. Enhanced personal hygiene and travel-avoidance practices to China have frequently been adopted (&gt;77%) and considered effective (&gt;90%). The adoption of social-distancing measures was lower (39–88%), and their drivers for increased adoption include: being female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]:1.27), living in the New Territories (aOR:1.32–1.55), perceived as having good understanding of COVID-19 (aOR:1.84) and being more anxious (aOR:1.07).
