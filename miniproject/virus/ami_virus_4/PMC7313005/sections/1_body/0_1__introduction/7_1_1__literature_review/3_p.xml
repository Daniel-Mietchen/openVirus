<p>The survey was completed on a representative sample of 2081 adults. In the event of a flu pandemic, the majority of the population was willing to be vaccinated (75.4%), be isolated (70.2%), and wear a face mask (59.9%). People with higher levels of risk perception are significantly more likely to be willing to comply with specific public health behaviours. While only 14.9% of the New South Wales (Australia) population thought that a pandemic influenza was very or extremely likely to occur, a significantly higher proportion of the population and the family were concerned if a pandemic actually occurred. Ibuka et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-04124" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] assessed temporal changes and geographical differences in risk perceptions and precautionary behaviors in response to H1N1 influenza. An online survey of risk perceptions, interests in pharmaceutical interventions (preventive intervention and curative intervention), and involvement in precautionary activities (information seeking activities and taking quarantine measures) in response to H1N1 influenza was conducted in 2009. Geographical differences in risk perception and precautionary behaviors have been evaluated. Predictors of willingness to take part in a pharmaceutical intervention were analyzed. The perceived likelihood of influenza infection, willingness to take drugs, and involvement in information seeking activities was higher for women than men. The perceived risk of infection and precautionary behavior can be dynamic over time, and differ by demographic characteristics and geographical locations. These patterns are likely to influence the effectiveness of disease control measures. Park et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-04124" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] conducted a study to assess the perceptions, motivational factors and behaviors associated with the use of hand washing to prevent H1N1 influenza transmission during the peak pandemic period in Korea. They reached the point that Korean students increased their frequency of hand hygiene practices during the pandemic, with significant gender differences existing in the attitudes and behaviors related to the use of hand hygiene as a means of disease prevention. The factors that affected hand washing behavior were similar to those identified at the beginning of the H1N1 or SARS pandemics, suggesting that public education campaigns regarding hand hygiene are effective in altering individual hand hygiene habits during the peak periods of influenza transmission.
