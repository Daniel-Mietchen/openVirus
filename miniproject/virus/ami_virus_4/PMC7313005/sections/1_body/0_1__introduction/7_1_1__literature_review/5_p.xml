 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-17-04124" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] assessed the preparedness and vulnerability of African countries to their risk of importation of COVID-19. The risk of importation from China of cases of COVID-19 to Africa was estimated on the basis of the origin–destination air travel flows from January 2019; number of cases in Chinese provinces; and the population in each of the Chinese provinces that reported transmission. They identified the country’s capacity to detect and respond to cases with two indicators: preparedness, and vulnerability. Countries were clustered according to the Chinese regions that contributed most to their risk. The authors identified three clusters of countries (i.e., Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa) that share the same risk exposure from the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and Beijing. Countries at moderate risk (i.e., Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Angola, Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya) have variable capacity and high vulnerability.
