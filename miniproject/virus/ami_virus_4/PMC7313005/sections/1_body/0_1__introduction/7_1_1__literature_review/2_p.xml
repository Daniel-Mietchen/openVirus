<p>There are some scientific studies related to perceptions of people about pandemic diseases, their precautions and preparations. Balicer et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-04124" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] conducted a study to understand local public health workers’ perceptions of pandemic influenza response. They surveyed 308 staff at three health departments in Maryland from March–July 2005, about factors that could influence their ability and willingness to report to duty in this event. The study demonstrated that almost half of the local health department workers were likely not to report to duty during a pandemic. The perceived risk among public health workers has been shown to be associated with several factors that are peripheral to the actual hazard of this event. These changes in the risk perception and the knowledge gaps identified serve as barriers to the response to a influenza pandemic and must be specifically addressed to enable effective local public health response to this significant threat. Barr et al. [
