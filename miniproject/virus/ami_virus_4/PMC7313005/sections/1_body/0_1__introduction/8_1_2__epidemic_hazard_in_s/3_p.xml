<p>Although the first human infection in SFRY was reported in 1947 and the disease occurred sporadically in Serbia, the first outbreak of tularemia in Serbia was recorded in late 1998 in the Sokobanja region. The epidemic lasted until 1999 and 2000, with oropharyngeal tularemia as the dominant form of the disease. Subsequently, minor tularemia outbreaks occurred in the district of Pčinja in 2010, Gazdin Han in 2014 and in 2015 in the natural foci of the disease—Stara planina, Suva planina, and Rtanj and Kopaonik mountains [

The population surveillance reported 190,563 (2.5%) of patients with clinically manifest flu symptoms between 26th week of 2009 and the 13th week of 2010. 6021 patients were hospitalized for influenza-like illnesses, among which influenza was laboratory confirmed at 553. Among those hospitalized, 137 deaths were reported (mortality rate—2.3%), 122 of which had influenza as the cause of death, and 15 died as a result of complications of chronic illness following influenza [

In the context of general publics’ preparedness for epidemics, Cvetković et al. [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-04124" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have shown that “less than half of respondents know what epidemics are and how to protect themselves against epidemics”. Another interesting testimony about Serbia’s poor public knowledge of infectious diseases was found.
