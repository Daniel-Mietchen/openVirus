<p>The research was designed to identify adultsâ€™ preparedness behaviours during the epidemic of COVID-19 in Serbia, with the result that all participants were Serbian residents over 18 years of age. Due to the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular the restriction of movement and the need for social distance, the data collection for this study had to be conducted via the on-line survey platform (google.doc). Namely, the study was conducted in April, 2020, only two weeks after the state of emergency was declared, ensuring that the researchers complied with movement restrictions and the need for social distancing. The participants were invited to complete the on-line questionnaire in their native language by using the snowball sampling method. </p>
