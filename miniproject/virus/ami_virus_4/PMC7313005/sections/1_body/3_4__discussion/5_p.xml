<p>Multivariate regression results demonstrated that some type of disability (invalidity and/or chronically disease) is the most important predictor of individual preparedness, although those with higher educational levels and between 38 and 49 years of age were most certain of their preparedness. In previous epidemic preparedness study in Serbia, males with higher educational level and non-disability perceived their individual preparedness higher than other respondents [

Males from Belgrade were most confident in individual, household and community preparedness for terrorist attacks, and respondents with high school degree in household and community preparedness. Various age categories demonstrated different terrorism preparedness perception: younger respondents perceived household preparedness greatly, middle aged individual, while elderly believed most in community preparedness [

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-17-04124" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Given that perception of preparedness is significantly different in the event of various disasters, this study finding could be explained by proactive approach of more educated and middle aged respondents towards information gathering, since they have mostly reported internet, websites of medical institutions, scientific journals, etc. as sources of information and believed that they have information needed to critically evaluate the situation they are in. The higher preparedness level of local community and state was perceived by those with high school and junior college degrees, respectively, and women for both. These findings could be the result of frequent television monitoring for respondents with high school degree and higher levels of trust among women towards experts which were addressing to the public on a daily basis.
