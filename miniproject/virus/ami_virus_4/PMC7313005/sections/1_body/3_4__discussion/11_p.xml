<p>Respondents reported significant behavioral changes in hand hygiene, social distancing (recommended distance, movement restriction, avoiding elderly and family members). On the other hand, significant lack of protective masks and gloves, as well as disinfectants, could be considered as a cause of poorer adherence to these measures. This conclusion is further supported by the respondents’ perception of having enough of required protective equipment since lack of it could have an impact on their usage. Additionally, the efficacy of protective masks for healthy people was advocated to be low by WHO and national health experts at the time of this research. However, the respondents have perceived that preventive measures were effective. Hong Kong citizens also reported significant behavioral changes when it comes to hygiene practices, but lower adoption of social distancing measures, although they have considered them useful in preventing COVID-19 [

On the other hand, UK residents have reported low levels of precautionary measures during H1N1 epidemic, with 62% of respondents reporting no change in the frequency of hand washing (72%), cleaning or disinfecting (83%) or discussing plans with people who should take care of them if they get ill (83%) [

Finally, all countries should urgently take all necessary measures to slow further spread and prevent their health systems from becoming overwhelmed by seriously ill patients with COVID-19. Also, respondents have reported significant attention to nutrition plans and food supplies, despite frequent assurances from officials that food supplies are not a problem, or because of them? Respondents with masters or doctoral degree were most likely to report stockpiling more than a month’s worth of food supplies in their homes even though it has previously been shown that educational levels indicate a wider range of information sources and perceived individual and household preparedness. Until the declaration of the state of emergency, it should be remembered that the products were “disappearing” from the raffles, in particular wheat, yeast, oil and toilet paper. While this may be a legacy of the past (inflation, civil war and NATO bombing), it should be further examined whether more educated citizens acted on the basis of information they’ve gathered (and critical evaluation of them) or on general distrust of statements made by officials.
