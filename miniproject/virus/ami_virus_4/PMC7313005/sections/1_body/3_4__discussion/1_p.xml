<p>The results of this study showed that the respondents had knowledge gaps three weeks after the state of emergency was declared. It was not expected that 84.6% of respondents would state that they had knowledge of epidemics and how to prevent them, since 43.1% of respondents agreed, 26.6% were not sure and 24.7% disagreed with the same statement in 2015 [

This finding is even more confusing when we look at the results of perceived sufficient knowledge and training to respond properly to epidemic emergencies. Respondents expressed the highest degree of understanding that COVID-19 is a contagious disease and that most commonly manifests symptoms such as fever, fatigue and dry cough. In addition, most of them even recognized that symptoms could manifest within 28 days of exposure to virus at a time when the possibility of incubation period longer than 14 days was newly introduced to the public. In contrast to health information, respondents were less receptive to “technical” information on the novel coronavirus, its nature and first occurrence. These findings could be the result of greater monitoring of health experts broadcasted on television and online every day, focusing on health information. Additionally, at the time of this research respondents could find many “conspiracy theories” online, even in national media and social networks, which could led to theirs suspicion and lower level of agreement with these statements. Nevertheless, this general publics’ more responsiveness to health information in the event of an epidemic should be considered when informational campaigns are launched, since this finding is congruent with some of identified publics’ need for information in the case of bioterrorism—infection, transmission prevention and exposure detection [
