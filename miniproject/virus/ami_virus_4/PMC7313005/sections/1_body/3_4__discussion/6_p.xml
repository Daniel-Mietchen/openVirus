<p>Although television and continuous broadcasting of experts’ addresses were among the most frequently selected information sources, the results of our study demonstrated that most citizens received most of their information about novel coronavirus online via the internet and used radio only infrequently.

Obtained results could be explained by the fact that since all respondents were recruited online, they represent preselected internet users. Nevertheless, Serbian public expressed an increasing tendency to turn away from television and, especially, from radio, and to the internet and social networks with only 9.4% of participants, with media confidence on average ranging from 23.3% among the elderly to 5.3% among the youngest participants [

It is important to note that the independent journalist Ana Lalić was arrested on the night of 1 April 2020 for releasing the story about significant shortage of equipment in the Vojvodina Clinical Center [
