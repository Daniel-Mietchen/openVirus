<p>The results of Chi-square test showed that there was no relationship between self-perceived knowledge of COVID-19 and the variables examined. Contrarily, the relationship between COVID-19 was found to be zoonotic disease and educational level. Specifically, the respondents with completed masters/doctoral studies (75.7%) were more likely to have the above assertion compared to the respondents who graduated from junior college (37%). In addition, in relation to the argument that the coronavirus appeared first in China, a statistically significant association with education was found in such a way that university level respondents (75.8%) agreed with the above-mention statement, mainly in relation to high-school level respondents (56.6%). A significant statistical correlation was found between this belief that COVID-19 was contagious and gender that women (96.4%) were more likely to agree with this statement than men (89.7%). A statistically significant correlation was observed between the opinion that the symptoms of COVID-19 would occur only after 14 days and the majority of respondents aged 49 to 58 years of age (50%) support this statement. On the other hand, the statement that symptoms may occur between 0 and 28 days after exposure to COVID-19 showed significant statistical association with the level of education and age of respondents. Elderly (55%) and high-school respondents (18.3%) agree to a greater extent than younger respondents (16%) and university graduates (15%). Finally, it was also found that agreement with the statement that other symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain, diarrhoea, nausea and runny nose were associated with educational level and age. Respondents with a university degree (83.8%) and elderly respondents (73.3%) support this statement to greater extent than those with high-school degree (71.4%) and younger respondents (65%) (
