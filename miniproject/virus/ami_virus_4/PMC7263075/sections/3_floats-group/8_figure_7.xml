  <p>(a) Comparison of response of the Au-ASO
   <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles toward the RNA (1 ng/μL) isolated from noninfected Vero cells, Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV, and Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. Relative change in absorbance at 660 nm wavelength for the Au-ASO
   <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticle treated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA (1 ng/μL) followed by the addition of RNase H has been plotted in (b) when the mixture was incubated at different temperatures for 5 min. The schematic representation for the visual naked-eye detection of SARS-CoV-2 with the treatment of RNase H at 65 °C for 5 min is shown in (c). The error bar indicates the average results obtained from three such independent experiments performed in triplicate.
