  <p>(a) Normalized change in absorbance of the gold nanoparticles before and after the addition of total RNA containing the SARS-CoV-2 viral load. (b) Comparative change in average hydrodynamic diameter of the composite of Au-ASO
   <sub>mix</sub> before and after the addition of RNA containing SARS-CoV-2 where the RNA concentration was varied from 0.1 to 0.5 and 1 ng/μL. Error bar indicates the measurements of hydrodynamic diameter from three such independent experiments. (c–f) TEM images of the Au-ASO
   <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles after addition of RNA containing SARS-CoV-2. (g) The percent change in absorbance at 660 nm of the ASO-capped gold nanoparticles at different incubation time points with a definite concentration of 1 ng/μL RNA. Here, the error bar indicates the average results obtained from four such independent experiments performed in triplicates.
