 <caption>
  <p>(a) TEM image of ASO-capped gold nanoparticles. (b) Zoomed-in TEM images of Au-ASO
   <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles with the individual ASO-capped AuNPs are shown as insets. (c) Comparative change in hydrodynamic diameter of the gold nanoparticles capped with individual ASOs and the mixture of the four Au-ASOs. Error bar indicates the measurements of hydrodynamic diameter from three such independent experiments. (d) Normalized change in absorbance of the gold nanoparticles before and after the addition of thiol modified ASOs to the citrate stabilized ones.
