  <p>Increase in absorbance at 660 nm for the gold nanoparticles coated with different concentrations of (a) ASO
   <sub>1</sub>, (b) ASO
   <sub>2</sub>, (c) ASO
   <sub>3</sub>, and (d) ASO
   <sub>4</sub> upon the addition of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The RNA concentration kept constant at 1 ng/Î¼L throughout the experiment. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature prior to recording the change in absorbance in each case. Error bar indicates the average results obtained from three independent experiments performed in triplicate.
