 </sup> providing precise information about mandatory quarantine for a carrier of the virus and rigorous contract tracing which in turn results in greater control in slowing the spread of the disease. Downmodulating the infection rate will therefore help to minimize the risk of overwhelming health facilities, allowing faster care of existing cases and delaying new cases before therapeutics or a vaccine are available.

 </sup> At present, COVID-19 is being primarily diagnosed by three techniques: (1) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and gene sequencing; (2) a lateral flow immunoassay, which is a common point-of-care (POC) diagnostic approach that detects antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples; and (3) chest computed tomography (CT). Out of these, chest CT has been identified as a major screening tool, if available.

 </sup> Moreover, the current gold standard approach for screening COVID-19 requires access to reverse transcriptase real-time PCR assay (RT-PCR), which can be carried out using a variety of clinical specimens, including blood, feces, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, sputum, fiber bronchoscope brush biopsies, nasal swabs, or pharyngeal swabs.

 </sup> On the basis of this technique, numerous laboratories have developed experimental protocols using quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) methods for virus identification within 4–6 h, including a test developed by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and approved under emergency use authorization (EUA) process.

 </sup> However, limitations of sample collection and transportation, as well as the performance of the kit with inadequate access to advanced instrumental techniques, often cannot report positive COVID-19 cases at its initial presentation leading to the spread of this infectious disease to a wider community. Furthermore, traveling to a clinical setting for testing increases the risk of spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus which further adds strain to a resource-limited healthcare system. Additionally, while serological tests are rapid, POC, and require minimal equipment, their efficacy may be limited in the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection only, as it may take several days to weeks after the onset of the symptom for a patient to develop a detectable antibody response.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
 </sup> Therefore, as some of the existing techniques remain laborious and technically challenging, there is an urgent unmet need for a POC, rapid, cost-effective, and selective diagnostic test for COVID-19 that can provide fast and accurate test results within a duration of less than an hour and possibly within minutes.
