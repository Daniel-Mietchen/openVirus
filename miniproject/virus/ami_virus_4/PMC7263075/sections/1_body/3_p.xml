 </sup> and utilized its exclusive features in developing a colorimetric assay based on AuNPs. These AuNPs, when capped with suitably designed thiol-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) specific for N-gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein) of SARS-CoV-2, could potentially be used for diagnosing positive COVID-19 cases within a few minutes. The methodology, described herein, utilizes an all-inclusive targeting approach mediated by four of the ASO sequences covering two regions of the viral N-gene sequence at the same time. These thiolated ASO-capped AuNPs agglomerate only in the presence of its target RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and thus demonstrate a change in its surface plasmon resonance (SPR), which is further amplified with the addition of RNaseH leading to the visually detectable precipitation of gold nanoparticles (

 </xref>). The agglomeration of ASO-capped gold nanoparticles in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was studied by UV–visible absorbance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and enhanced dark-field hyperspectral imaging technique. Thus, the current study utilizes the intrinsic optical properties of plasmonic AuNPs and targeting ability of the ASOs to develop a selective, and “naked-eye” detection platform for the current COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, without the requirement of any expensive instrumental techniques. The reliability and reproducibility of the current biosensor increases based on its design of simultaneous targeting of two of the N-gene regions of SARS-CoV-2, ensuring the feasibility of the assay even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread.
