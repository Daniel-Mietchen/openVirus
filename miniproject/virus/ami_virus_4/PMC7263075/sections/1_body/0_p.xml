<p id="sec1">An unexpected outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has collapsed many health care systems and crashed numerous economies. The disease was first identified in December 2019 and has since rapidly spread across the world, resulting in the ongoing 2019–20 pandemic.

 </sup> It has filled hospitals and emptied public spaces while disrupting a modern society on a scale that most people in the world have never witnessed in their lifetime.

 </sup> Like most of the previous modern epidemics and pandemics, this newly emerging infectious disease is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus.

 </sup> The COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have close similarities with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in terms of causing severe acute respiratory distress.

 </sup> An average of two or three people are getting infected from every already affected person because of the higher transmission rate for COVID-19.

 </sup> The efforts to contain the virus are ongoing, but considering the many uncertainties regarding the pathogen transmissibility and virulence the efficacy of these efforts is unknown. A crucial shortcoming of the healthcare systems across the globe has been the ability to rapidly and accurately diagnose the disease with contributing factors that include a shortage of test kits and specimen materials, availability of personal protective equipment and reagents, limited certified testing centers, and no established funding mechanism to support these testing facilities.

 </sup> Further, the lack of rapid diagnostic tests along with the inaccessibility of the advanced instrumental techniques to all the diagnostic centers, especially the remote ones, contribute to the confusion surrounding which individuals should be quarantined, limit epidemiological data, and the ability to track pathogen transmission within as well as across communities. Therefore, a key part for the management of COVID-19 pandemic lies in “flattening the curve”, that is, decreasing the epidemic peak, through different measures taken for reducing the rate of new infections.
