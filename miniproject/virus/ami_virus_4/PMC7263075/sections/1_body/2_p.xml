 </sup> In recent years, gold nanoparticle (AuNPs) have garnered incredible attention in the field of colorimetric-based biosensing applications due to their exceptional optical properties such as high extinction coefficient, localized surface plasmon resonance, and inherent photostability.

 </sup> They have been utilized in numerous colorimetric-based biosensing applications to detect a wide range of chemical and biological targets like small molecules, proteins, metal ions, and nucleic acids where the particle changes its color in response to the reactivity of the nanosized particles to the external conditions.

 </sup> Despite these features, however, this technique still involves the preparation of ssDNA probes and the implementation of several intermediate steps, such as time-intensive denaturation and annealing after PCR.

 </sup> Furthermore, given that both ssDNA and dsDNA stabilize the AuNPs at low salt concentrations, cationic agents are primarily required to detect the target with probes. A colorimetric bioassay was thus developed for the detection of DNA/RNA targets based on unmodified AuNP aggregation using disulfide self-assembly of terminal modified DNA.

 </sup> The products generated in this approach not only demonstrated a high affinity for the surface of AuNPs but also protected them efficiently from salt-induced aggregation. Additionally, a colorimetric assay based on a similar approach was also reported to detect the presence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
