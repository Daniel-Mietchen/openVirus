<p>The as-synthesized nanoparticles, Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> before and after the addition of RNA at a concentration of 1 ng/μL, were also monitored under the dark-field optical microscope (CytoViva), and their hyperspectra were acquired by the hyperspectral recorder from CytoViva. The hyperspectra were compared for the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles when treated with the RNA isolated from the Vero cells with or without transfected with SARS-CoV-2 separately. A 20 μL sample droplet was spotted onto a glass slide and a coverslip was placed on top of it.
