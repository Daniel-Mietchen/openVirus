<p>A solution of 2.2 mM of sodium citrate was taken in Milli-Q water (150 mL) and refluxed for 15 min under vigorous stirring. A solution of 1 mL of HAuCl
 <sub>4</sub> (25 mM) was injected to the boiling solution of sodium citrate. The color of the solution changed over a time period of 20 min. The resulting citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were well suspended in H
 <sub>2</sub>O.
