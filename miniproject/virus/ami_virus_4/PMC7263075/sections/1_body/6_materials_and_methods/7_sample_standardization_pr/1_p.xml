<p>The as-synthesized nanoparticles were taken out from the refrigerator, sonicated for 5 min in a bath sonicator (Branson 2800) at room temperature, and vortexed for 2 min prior use. To determine the sensing capability of the individually ASO-capped gold nanoparticles, the as-synthesized solution containing the AuNPs were treated with RNA samples having the concentration of 1 ng/μL. For the preparation of each 100 μL of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub>, 25 μL of each individual Au-ASO
 <sub>1M</sub>, Au-ASO
 <sub>2L</sub>, Au-ASO
 <sub>3H</sub>, and Au-ASO
 <sub>4M</sub> nanoparticles were mixed and vortexed thoroughly. The sensing and targeting capability of the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> was also validated at a RNA concentration of 1 ng/μL.
