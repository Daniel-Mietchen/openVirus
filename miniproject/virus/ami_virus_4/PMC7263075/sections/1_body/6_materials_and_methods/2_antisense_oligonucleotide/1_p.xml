 </sup> and the ASOs were predicted maintaining the folding temperature as 37 °C and ionic conditions of 1 M sodium chloride for a preferred length of ASO as 20 nucleotide bases. The filter criteria were set as follows:
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <label>1</label>
   <p>40% ≤ GC% ≤ 60%.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>2</label>
   <p>Elimination of target sequences with GGGG.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>3</label>
   <p>Average unpaired probability of the ASOs for target site nucleotides to be ≥0.5.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>4</label>
   <p>Considering the threshold probability of above 0.5, all sites targeted to the peak in the accessibility profile are ranked by their average unpaired probability (the higher the better);</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>5</label>
   <p>Among sites satisfying criteria 1–4, the top 20 ones with the highest average unpaired probability will be considered. The average unpaired probability was also used in filter criteria 3, 4, and 5 to reduce the number of reported sites in order to optimize the disruption energy calculation in the web servers.</p>

   <label>6</label>
   <p>Further, the binding energy of the ASOs were also compared with the target sequence where the binding energy cutoff for the selection of ASOs was kept at ≤−8 kcal/mol.</p>
