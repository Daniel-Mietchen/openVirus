<p>For each 100 μL of reaction, 10 μL of RNase H reaction buffer (1X) was used along with 1 μL of thermostable RNase H and incubated for a required time at a definite temperature. The 100 μL solution of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticle was first treated with RNA samples having 1 ng/μL concentration and then incubated with RNase H reaction buffer (1X) and thermostable RNase H for required time points and temperature.
