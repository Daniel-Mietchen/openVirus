<p>The as-synthesized nanoparticles, Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> before and after the addition of RNA at a concentration of 1 ng/μL, were investigated under the transmission electron microscope (FEI tecnai T12). The tungsten filament was used as the electron optics, and the voltage was kept constant at 80 kV. A 20 μL sample droplet was spotted onto a carbon-coated copper grid (400 mesh) and allowed to stay there for about 10 min before being removed.
