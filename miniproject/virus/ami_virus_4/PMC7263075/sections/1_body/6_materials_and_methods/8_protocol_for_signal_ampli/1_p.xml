 </sup> Briefly, 100 μL solution of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> was first treated with RNA containing SARS-CoV-2 at a concentration of 1 ng/μL. This solution was then incubated with CTAB, 
 <sc>l</sc>-ascorbic acid, and HAuCl
 <sub>4</sub> at a concentration of 0.1 M, 0.45 mM, and 0.225 mM, respectively, and monitored over several time points.
