<p>The hydrodynamic diameters of the individually ASO-capped gold nanoparticles and the composite nanoparticles (Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub>) were monitored on a particle tracking analyzer (Zetaview Particle Metrix). The hydrodynamic diameters of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> before and after the addition of RNA at a concentration of 1 ng/Î¼L were also observed in a similar fashion. The as-synthesized nanoparticles were diluted 50 times and 1 mL of such diluted samples were injected into the machine for the measurements. The chamber of the machine was properly cleaned prior to each measurement.
