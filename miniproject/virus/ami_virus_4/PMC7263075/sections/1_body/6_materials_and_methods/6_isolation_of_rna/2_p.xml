<p>The Vero cells with or without the viral transfection were lysed directly in a culture dish by adding 1 mL of TRIzol reagent and aspirated carefully. The total RNA was then extracted and purified for the viral RNA from the cellular lysate with a commercially available kit. The concentration of purified RNA, isolated from the SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells, was found to be 35.9 ng/μL, while the concentration of the purified RNA, isolated from the noninfected Vero cells, was 92.6 ng/μL.</p>
