<p>Citrate-stabilized AuNPs were taken at ∼3 × 10
 <sup>10</sup> particles/mL concentration as observed through zetaview software and treated with ASOs at three different concentrations, that is, 0.5, 1, and 2 μM from a stock of 200 μM for each of the four ASOs. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, centrifuged to remove any excess of uncapped ASO from the supernatant, and the pellet was then resuspended in a similar volume of Milli-Q water. Accordingly, 12 different samples for four of the ASOs at three different concentrations were prepared and nomenclatured as Au-ASO

  <italic>x</italic>L
 </sub>, Au-ASO
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>M
 </sub>, and Au-ASO
 <sub>
  <italic>x</italic>H
 </sub> where 
 <italic>x</italic> defines the number of ASO as 1, 2, 3, or 4 and L, M and H are representative of low, medium and high concentrations of ASOs respectively. The nanoparticles were kept at 4 °C for future use.
