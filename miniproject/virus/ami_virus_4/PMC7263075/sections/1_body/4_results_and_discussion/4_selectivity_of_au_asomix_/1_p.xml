<p>Another important parameter for any biosensor is the selectivity of the sensor toward its target. In this regard, the selectivity of the current SARS-CoV-2 sensor was tested when the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticle was treated against the total RNA isolated from cell lysate of Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV and the total RNA isolated from cell lysate of noninfected Vero cells. An insignificant change in absorbance at 660 nm wavelength (

 </xref>a) was observed when the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles were treated with these RNAs (1 ng/μL). Thus, both the RNAs extracted from noninfected Vero cells and Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV acted as negative controls for our experiments. Thus, the bioengineered ASO-capped gold nanoparticles, Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub>, could potentially be used for the selective detection of SARS-CoV-2. Further the selectivity of the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticle was also confirmed by the hyperspectral technique when the nanoparticles were treated with the RNA isolated from the noninfected Vero cells as a negative control.

 </xref>e illustrates the EDFM-HSI of the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> after the addition of the RNA isolated from the noninfected Vero cells. No obvious aggregates were observed in the presence of this RNA, which supports our hypothesis about the selectivity of the designed ASOs toward SARS-CoV-2. Insignificant change in hyperspectral signature was also evident from

 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles toward SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Interestingly, a significant hyperspectral shift (∼100 nm) was found for the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles treated with RNA containing the viral SARS-CoV-2 gene (
