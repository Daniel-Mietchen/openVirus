<p>During the current spread of COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, scientists have discovered three regions among the SARS-related viral genomes that had conserved sequences. These sequences are (a) 
 <italic>RdRP</italic> gene (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene) responsible for the open reading frame ORF1ab region, (b) 
 <italic>E</italic> gene (envelope protein gene), and (c) 
 <italic>N</italic> gene (nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene).

 </sup> The analytical sensitivity of both the 
 <italic>RdRP</italic> and 
 <italic>E</italic> genes was demonstrated to be quite high (technical limit of detection of 3.6 and 3.9 copies per reaction), while the sensitivity for 
 <italic>N</italic> gene was observed to be weaker (8.3 copies per reaction). This leaves an enormous area for the improvement of biosensors targeted for 
 <italic>N</italic> gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2. Statistically, a sensitive biosensor selectively targeting the 
 <italic>N</italic> gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 with a visual naked-eye response without the need for access to any sophisticated instrumental techniques would greatly benefit the current sensor development research for COVID-19. In addition to this, the analytical sensitivity of the biosensor can be improved by simultaneous targeting of multiple genetic regions within the same gene sequence, which will add to features of the biosensor. This will also increase the feasibility of the assay even if one region of the viral gene undergoes mutation during its current spread. We therefore targeted 
 <italic>N</italic> gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and undertook gold nanoparticle as one of the important anisotropic plasmonic nanostructures for the development of a COVID-19 specific biosensor.
