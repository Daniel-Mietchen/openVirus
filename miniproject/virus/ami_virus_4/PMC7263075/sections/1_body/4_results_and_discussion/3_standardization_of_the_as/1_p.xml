<p>Accordingly, the differentially functionalized thiol-modified ASOs were utilized to exchange the surface capping agent of the citrate stabilized gold nanoparticles. The TEM images (

 </xref>a,b) show that the ASO-capped AuNPs are individually dispersed with no visible aggregation. All of the four ASO-capped AuNPs exhibit a small anhydrous size of &lt;30 nm, which are well dispersed without the formation of a large entity.

 </xref>c shows the average hydrodynamic sizes of the four individual ASO-capped gold nanoparticles, which were found to be less than 60 nm. The formation of ASO-conjugated thiol-stabilized AuNPs was further confirmed from their surface plasmon bands.

 </sup> Two absorption peaks, one at ∼530 nm and the other at ∼620 nm, were observed after the thiol-modified ASO capping on the surface of the AuNPs (
