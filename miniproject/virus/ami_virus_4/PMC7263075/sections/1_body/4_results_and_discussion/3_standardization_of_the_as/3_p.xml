<p>After optimizing the ASO to AuNPs ratio to obtain the maximum sensitivity, all four of the ASO-capped AuNPs (i.e., Au-ASO
 <sub>1M</sub>, Au-ASO
 <sub>2L</sub>, Au-ASO
 <sub>3H</sub>, and Au-ASO
 <sub>4M</sub>) were mixed (Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub>) in an equivalent amount with each other to further improve the analytical sensitivity of the gold nanoparticles toward SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Transmission electron microscopy indicated the formation of distinctly dispersed AuNPs (

 </xref>b) with the average hydrodynamic diameter of about 55.4 Â± 4.5 nm as observed from Zetaview (

It was expected that the agglomeration propensity among the nanoparticles would increase when treated in a composite manner (Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub>) with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. A large redshift of about 40 nm in the aggregation band was also observed when the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles were tested against the SARS-CoV-2 RNA (

  <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>
 </xref>a). The improvement in analytical sensitivity of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles toward the detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA was further validated by monitoring the relative increase in absorbance at 660 nm in comparison with individual ASO-capped AuNPs (

The analytical performance of the sensor was also probed when two of the ASO-capped AuNPs were mixed instead of all four (Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub>). The choice of two of the ASO-capped AuNPs (either Au-ASO
 <sub>1M+2L</sub> or Au-ASO
 <sub>3H+4M</sub>) was based on their proximity to target one of the regions of 
 <italic>N</italic> gene sequence. In all cases, it was observed that Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> was the optimum formulation to target SARS-CoV-2 RNA with higher sensitivity than the other sensors tested herein.
