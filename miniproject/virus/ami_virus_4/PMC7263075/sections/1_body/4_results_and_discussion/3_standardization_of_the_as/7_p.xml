<p>In addition, it is also fundamentally important to identify the distribution and location of each type of Au-ASOs in the hybrid cluster of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> when bound with its target SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. In order to receive this valuable information, the hyperspectral data of each individual Au-ASOs (i.e., Au-ASO
 <sub>1M</sub>, Au-ASO
 <sub>2L</sub>, Au-ASO
 <sub>3H</sub>, and Au-ASO
 <sub>4M</sub>) were recorded and stored in the spectral library for further analysis. Using these data, an image “map” was generated to identify the location of each individual Au-ASOs in the hybrid cluster.

 <sub>1M</sub> and Au-ASO
 <sub>2L</sub> (red and green, respectively) were found to be localized in regions close to each other which is primarily due to the proximity of their target position in the
