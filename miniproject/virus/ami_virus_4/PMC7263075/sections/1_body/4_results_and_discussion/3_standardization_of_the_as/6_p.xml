 </xref>a illustrates the EDFM-HSI image of the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles in the absence of its target SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Consistent with our previous results, the AuNPs in the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> were found to be well dispersed with insignificant aggregation propensity among the AuNPs.

 </xref>b shows the average spectrum of the hyperspectral signal of all the AuNPs that existed in the dark-field image (

After the addition of the RNA having SARS-CoV-2 viral gene, a significant number of clustered gold nanoparticles were observed in the sample indicating the enhanced propensity among the nanoparticles to aggregate which is consistent with the previous TEM, Zetaview, and optical absorbance results (

 </xref>c). The agglomeration propensity among the AuNPs in the presence of its target viral RNA can thus be related to the precise designing, targeting ability and binding affinity of the ASOs with their target gene. A significant change in the hyperspectral signature of the sample has been found where a sharp peak has been observed after the addition of the viral RNA. Further, in the presence of the viral RNA we observed broadening in the average spectral signature with a redshift in the spectrum tail (
