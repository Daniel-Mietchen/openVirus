<p>Interestingly, as per our hypothesis, the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles were confirmed to be individually dispersed in the sample in absence of the viral load, which in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA tend to agglomerate forming large clusters. The aggregation of AuNPs was confirmed from the increase in absorbance of the aggregation band at 660 nm

 </sup> when the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles were exposed to a definite concentration of total RNA (1 ng/μL) extracted from the Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 with an incubation time of 15 min at room temperature.

 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticle before and after addition of its target SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. It was evident that there was minimal change in hydrodynamic diameters when the individual ASO-capped AuNPs were mixed with each other (

 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles increased largely with the addition of its target RNA containing SARS-CoV-2 (
