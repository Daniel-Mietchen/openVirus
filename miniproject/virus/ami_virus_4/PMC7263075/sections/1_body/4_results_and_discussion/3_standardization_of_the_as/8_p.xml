<p>The increase in sensitivity of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles was also monitored at a definite concentration of RNA containing SARS-CoV-2 (1 ng/μL) with change in incubation temperature and it was observed that the optimum sensitivity was achieved at 37 °C (

 <sub>mix</sub> at 660 nm was monitored with the increase in RNA concentrations while incubating each sample for 5 min at a constant temperature of 37 °C. A constant increase in absorbance with linear response was achieved which confirms the reliable and stable response of the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticle toward the SARS-CoV-2 RNA (

The limit of detection was found to be 0.18 ng/μL with a tested dynamic range of 0.2–3 ng/μL. The analytical performance of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles toward the detection of viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA was further validated by comparing the relative limit of detection of different ASO-stabilized gold nanoparticles (

 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles can be corroborated with the analytical sensitivity of differentially functionalized AuNPs (

A prominent change in color of the solution from violet to dark blue was also observed after the addition of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA load to the solution of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles, and we tried to further improve its plasmonic signal response. Accordingly, we tried to amplify the signal response from the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticle with further deposition of more gold on the initially hybridized Au-ASO-RNA seeds.

 </sup> A solution containing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and ascorbic acid (AA) was then transferred to the already hybridized Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoconjugate with SARS-CoV-2 RNA and mixed properly. Chloroauric acid (HAuCl
 <sub>4</sub>) was then added to the mixture to initiate the chemical deposition process which amplified the signal response almost to an average of 75 times for the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticle within an incubation time of 30 min (

 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles.
