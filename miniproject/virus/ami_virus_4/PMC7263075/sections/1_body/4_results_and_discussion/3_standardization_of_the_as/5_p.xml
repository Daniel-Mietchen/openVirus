<p>This response of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticles to its target viral RNA was further corroborated by the TEM images. A significant amount of clustering was found among the nanoparticles in the presence of their target viral RNA (

 </xref>c–f). The formation of both large (∼120 nm) and small (∼80 nm) gold nanoparticle entities was observed in the sample. It was also monitored that the optimum sensitivity was achieved within 4–6 min of incubation at room temperature of the nanoparticles with the total RNA (1 ng/μL) extracted from the Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 (

 </xref>g). To further investigate the sensitivity of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> and the selective agglomeration of the nanoparticles in the presence of the viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA, we visualized the particles under enhanced dark-field hyperspectral imaging microscope. The hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provided a label-free detection approach, combining both imaging and spectrophotometry, that can be used to localize nanomaterial based on their hyperspectral signature.

 </sup> The HSI system utilizes advanced optics and computational algorithms to capture a spectrum from 400 to 1000 nm at each pixel of the image with an enhanced dark-field microscope (EDFM). The obtained spectrum represents a signature of each individual material that can be used to confirm the identity of the materials of interest in a mixture of the sample. This information can further be utilized to create an image “map” to reveal the presence and location of material of interest in the targeted sample. EDFM-HSI mapping thus proves to be an accurate technique that could locate and identify nanomaterials in samples more efficiently when compared to other conventional techniques.
