<p>The relative sensitivity of the various ASO-capped gold nanoparticles toward the target SARS-CoV-2 RNA was then monitored with the comparative increase in absorbance at 660 nm. It was observed that the surface capping of thiol-modified ASOs together with the comparative ratio of the ASOs to the AuNPs (ASO/AuNPs) play a major role in determining the sensitivity of the gold nanoparticles toward SARS-CoV-2 RNA. To investigate the effect of the ASO/AuNPs ratio on the sensitivity of the sensing platform, three different ratios of ASO/AuNPs have been tested. The ratios are named as the following: high (ASO
 <sub>H</sub>), medium (ASO
 <sub>M</sub>), and low (ASO
 <sub>L</sub>) concentrations for the four ASOs; see 
 <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="other">Materials and Methods</xref> for details. Among these 12 different combinations of the ASO-conjugated AuNPs, which vary in the ratio of ASO/AuNPs, ASO
 <sub>M</sub> was found the most sensitive ratio for the AuNPs capped with ASO1 (i.e., Au-ASO
 <sub>1M</sub>). However, among ASO2
 <sub>,</sub> the low ratio was found to be the most sensitive in detecting the viral RNA (Au-ASO
 <sub>2L</sub>), the high ratio in ASO3 (Au-ASO
 <sub>3H</sub>), and finally the medium in ASO4 (Au-ASO
 <sub>4M</sub>) (
