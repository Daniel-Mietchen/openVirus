 <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="other">Materials and Methods</xref>. Among the predicted ASO sequences, four of the ASOs were selected based on their comparative binding disruption energies and binding energies with the target sequence (

  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>). One of the other parameters behind the selection of these four ASO sequences was their closely following target position. The ASOs were then differentially functionalized: ASO1 and ASO3 were functionalized with thiol moiety at the 5′ end, whereas ASO2 and ASO4 were functionalized with thiol moiety at the 3′ end (

 <italic>N</italic> gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 which can be corroborated with their complementary binding followed by aggregation propensity among the nanoparticles (
