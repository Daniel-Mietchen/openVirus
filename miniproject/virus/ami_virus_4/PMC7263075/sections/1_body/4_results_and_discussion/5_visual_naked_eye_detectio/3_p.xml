<p>Thus, the present study describes the isolation of total RNA from a biosample infected with the COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, and selective naked-eye detection of the virus mediated by suitably designed antisense oligonucleotide capped gold nanoparticles. The sensing mechanism initiates with the initial 5 min room temperature incubation of the RNA samples having the viral load with a composite of ASO-capped AuNPs which is followed by the treatment of RNase H at 65 Â°C for 5 min to generate a visual precipitate from the solution. Furthermore, the present method describes the selective naked-eye instrument-less detection of SARS-CoV-2 which can also be correlated with the concentration of viral RNA present in the sample as the assay relies on the target-induced aggregation and precipitation of the ASO-capped AuNPs. We have also compared the features of our COVID-19 biosensor with the competing commercially available FDA approved or under revision diagnostic approaches (

The reliability of many diagnostic tests fail when they are tested either to a viral load at its early representation or to a viral gene mutated during its current spread, but our sensor design attempts to compensate for these drawbacks by directly targeting the
