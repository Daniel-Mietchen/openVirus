<p>In this regard, we thought of a bioassay with the addition of thermostable RNase H to the mixture containing Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> and total RNA having the SARS-CoV-2 gene. It has been envisaged that the thermostable RNase H will specifically recognize and cleave the phosphodiester bonds of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA (N gene) strand hybridized with the Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoconjugate while leaving the ASO strands intact. It has been presumed that this treatment of RNase H may greatly influence the agglomeration propensity among the gold nanoparticles that are already hybridized along the RNA strand which might also fulfill our aim of achieving an immediate change in visual appearance of the solution. To our expectation, no change in absorbance at 660 nm from the base absorbance of Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoparticle was observed when the hybridized Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> nanoconjugate with SARS-CoV-2 RNA was treated with RNase H with an incubation of 5 min at room temperature (

A further decrease in absorbance was observed when the mixture was incubated at higher temperatures indicating the increased activity of RNase H at elevated temperature levels (

 </xref>c. This phenomenon may therefore be explained from the activity of RNase H to selectively cleave the RNA strand from the RNA conjugate with Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> which leads to further agglomeration among the AuNPs those are attached to the RNA strand followed by precipitation of AuNPs from the solution. The test was also found to be selective to the presence of viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA load as the treatment of RNase H to the sample containing Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub> and RNA from Vero cells infected with MERS-CoV and caused no change in absorbance. Overall, this study reports the naked-eye detection of COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2 within a minimal time frame of ∼10 min from the total RNA derived from the virus infected cells.
