<p>Briefly, we report herein the development of a colorimetric bioassay utilizing the efficient targeting and binding ability of the antisense oligonucleotides specific for 
 <italic>N</italic>-gene of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in conjugation with the anisotropic plasmonic properties of gold nanoparticles. The methodology, described herein, further utilizes an all-inclusive targeting approach mediated by four of the ASO sequences covering two regions of the viral genome sequence, that is, 
 <italic>N</italic>-gene of SARS-CoV-2, at the same time. The gold nanoparticles when capped with the ASOs have been utilized for diagnosing positive COVID-19 cases within 10 min from the total RNA isolated from the infected biosamples. The thiol-modified ASO-capped AuNPs agglomerate selectively in the presence of its target RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and demonstrate a change in its SPR with a redshift of ∼40 nm in their absorbance spectra. The agglomeration of ASO-capped gold nanoparticles in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was studied by UV–visible absorbance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and hyperspectral microscopy. Further, the addition of RNase H cleaves the RNA strand from the composite hybrid of RNA and Au-ASO
 <sub>mix</sub>, leading to a visually detectable precipitate from the solution mediated by the additional agglomeration among the AuNPs. The selectivity of this COVID-19 biosensor has also been tested against MERS-CoV viral RNA load where no distinct change in absorbance was found with MERS-CoV RNA. Thus, the current study reports a reliable, reproducible, selective, and visual naked-eye detection of COVID-19 causative virus, SARS-CoV-2 which is devoid of the requirement of any sophisticated instrumental techniques. In addition to this, the current methodology ensures its feasibility even with the mutated 
 <italic>N</italic> gene forms of the virus during its spread as the assay has been designed to simultaneously target two separate regions of the gene. We also complied our SARS-CoV-2 specific sensor with the ASSURED criteria, mentioned by WHO, where the biosensor should have the following characteristics of (i) Affordable, (ii) Sensitive, (iii) Specific, (iv) User-friendly, (v) Rapid and robust, (vi) sophisticated Equipment-free, and (vii) Delivered to the end-users. Furthermore, the developed colorimetric bioassay could be modified to target other regions of the viral genomic material, such as 
 <italic>S</italic>-gene (surface glycoprotein), 
 <italic>E</italic>-gene (envelope protein) and 
 <italic>M</italic>-gene (membrane glycoprotein), for potential preclinical screening and high sensitivity with minimal false positives.
