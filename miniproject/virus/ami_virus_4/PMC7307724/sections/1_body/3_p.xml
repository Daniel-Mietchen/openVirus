<p>The SARS-CoV-2 is able to survive for prolonged periods on materials that are highly prevalent in custodial settings including nonporous surfaces and metallic surfaces complicating disinfection practices. It is exceedingly difficult to comply with established infection prevention protocols recommending repeated disinfection and decontamination of all surfaces in jails and prisons, resulting from the large number of inmates and complex human patterns of interactions between inmates and with the staff [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008409.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In contrast to influenza viruses, transmission of this coronavirus occurs by those with undetected infection having mild symptoms or asymptomatic infection in up to 20% of cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008409.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, transmission of this viral pathogen in closed spaces with a large presence of individuals increases the frequency of exposure and infection. Without complete social distancing in imprisonment settings, our ability to reduce the transmission dynamics to achieve an R
