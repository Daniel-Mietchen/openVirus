  <p>The targets of the different drug candidates against the three coronaviruses. Common targets against the three coronaviruses are mainly the S protein and the S1/S2 subunits, PL protein, RdRp, 3CL protein, and Helicase. The figure shows drug candidates (in black) and vaccines (in red). Among them, Remdesivir has been trending in the news recently. It inhibits the RdRp, is in phase III for SARS-CoV-2, and may have an effect on the three viruses. Ribavirin in combination with a pegylated interferon may also have an effect against the three viruses. Ritonavir and Lopinavir, which inhibit the 3CLpro and are in phase III for SARS-CoV-2, have an effect on both SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. DNA vaccines and vaccines based on the S protein or subunits of the S protein are in development</p>
