  <p>Clustering of the spike protein of each coronavirus. Fifty-four spike protein sequences filtered from each coronavirus coding sequences were clustered using the CLANS (CLuster ANalysis of Sequences) program on the website of MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit. Each colored dot represents the spike protein sequence of each coronavirus. Dots in the same color mean they are of the same genus, and each line shows the similarity of two sequences, with darker lines indicating higher similarity (lower 
   <italic>E</italic> values). The Coronaviridae family includes the following genera: Alphacoronavirus (colored in green); Betacoronavirus (red); Gammacoronavirus (orange), and Deltacoronavirus (blue). The indicated SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 belong to the genus of Betacoronavirus
