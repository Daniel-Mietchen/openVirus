 <caption>
  <p>Phylogenetic tree of coronaviruses based on full-length genome sequences. All complete genome sequences of coronavirus were downloaded from the NCBI reference sequence database, RefSeq. The tree was constructed using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) by MEGA X, with Clustal Omega as the multiple sequence alignment method, and 1000 bootstrap replicates. Only bootstraps â‰¥50% values are shown. The seven known human-infecting coronaviruses are indicated with a red star</p>
