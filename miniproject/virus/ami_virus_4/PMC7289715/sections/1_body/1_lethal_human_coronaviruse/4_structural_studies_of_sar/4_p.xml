<p id="Par22">The MERS-CoV S protein can recognize dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on the cell surface, promoting the fusion of the viral envelope and the cell membrane. The MERS-CoV S protein, a 1353-amino acid type I TM glycoprotein located on the viral envelope surface, is composed of S1 and S2 subunits.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>
 </sup> The structure of the S protein consists of four parts: an SP located at the N terminus (amino acids 1–12), an extracellular domain (amino acids 13–1195), a TM domain (amino acids 1196–1215), and an intracellular domain (amino acids 1216–1255).

 </sup> The S1 subunit contains two independent domains, an N-terminal domain (NTD, amino acids 18–353)
 <sup>

 </sup> and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 367–588), both of which may function as receptor-binding domains (RBDs);

 </sup> and facilitate the involvement of the S1 subunit in cell receptor (DPP4) binding. The core structure of the MERS-CoV S protein RBD is a five-stranded antiparallel sheet with several short helices, in which three disulfide bonds stabilize the core by connecting C383 to C407, C425 to C478, and C437 to C585.

 </sup> The accessory subdomain of the C-domain is a hypervariable region for receptor recognition and is called the receptor-binding motif (RBM). The accessory subdomains in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV differ, resulting from divergent evolution and leading to the use of different receptors.

 </sup> DPP4 consists of an N-terminal hydrolase and a C-terminal β-propeller domain composed of eight lancets

 </sup> and the RBD. The S2 subunit of MERS-CoV contains an FP (residues 943–982), an HR1 domain (residues 984–1104), an HR2 domain (residues 1246–1295), a TM domain (residues 1296–1317), and an intracellular domain (residues 1318–1353).
 <sup>

 </sup> The S2 subunit is responsible for fusion between the virus and the target cell membrane. After the S1 subunit binds to DPP4, the S2 subunit inserts its FP into the target cell membrane to change its conformation. Its HR1 helix then forms a homotrimer with an exposed surface that has three highly conserved hydrophobic grooves, and binds with HR2 to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) core structure, which facilitates fusion by bringing the viral and cell membranes into close proximity.
 <sup>

 </sup> The genetic material of MERS-CoV then enters the host cell via the fusion pore.
