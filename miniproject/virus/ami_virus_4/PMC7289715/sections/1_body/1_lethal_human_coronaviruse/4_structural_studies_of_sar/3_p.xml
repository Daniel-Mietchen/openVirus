<p id="Par21">MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C of the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> (
 <italic>β</italic>CoV) in the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, and it is the first lineage C CoV and the sixth CoV known to cause human infection. MERS-CoV is an enveloped +ssRNA virus similar to other CoVs, but the amino acid sequence homology between MERS-CoV and other known CoVs is less than 90%.

 </sup> ORF1a and ORF1b located in the first two-thirds of the MERS-CoV genome are involved in virulence and encode NSPs (NSP1–16). The remaining third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, the S, E, M, and N proteins, as well as five accessory proteins (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5, and ORF8b).

 </sup> The flanking regions of the genome contain the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs).

 </sup> Most MERS-CoV proteins are found in the cytoplasm.

 </sup> To date, the NS4b protein and the ORF3a-encoded protein are the only known coronavirus proteins to be detected in the nucleus.

 </sup> NSP1 suppresses host gene expression in infected cells, and its RNA cleavage-inducing function promotes virus assembly/budding.

 </sup> NSP16 is a viral 2′-
 <italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (2′-
 <italic>O</italic>-MTase) that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection, suggesting that NSP16 is a conserved universal candidate for rapid design of a live attenuated vaccine.

 </sup> ORF4a’s protein can mask viral dsRNA to play a role in immune evasion, including type 1 IFN and protein kinase R-mediated antiviral stress responses.

 </sup> MERS-CoV NSP13 is a full-length coronavirus helicase that contains multiple domains, including an N-terminal Cys/His rich domain with three zinc atoms, a beta-barrel domain and a C-terminal superfamily (SF) 1 helicase (SF1) core with two RecA-like subdomains. This protein might interfere with the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway to avoid degradation of viral RNA.
