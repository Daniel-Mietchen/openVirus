<p id="Par20">The 3′ end of the SARS virus genome encodes 12 structural proteins and helper proteins, of which ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF7b have been proven to be viral structural proteins involved in the formation of viral particles. The 5′ end of the genome encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs), which are important for virus assembly, and may enable the design of small molecule drugs and/or vaccines.</p>
