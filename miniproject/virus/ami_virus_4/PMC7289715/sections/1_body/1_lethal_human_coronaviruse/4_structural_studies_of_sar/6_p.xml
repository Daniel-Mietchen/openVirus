<p id="Par24">In conclusion, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are similar in structure. Their major proteins are structural proteins, including the S, E, M, and N proteins, accessory protein, and NSPs (NSP1â€“16). All these viruses rely on the S protein to identify cell targets and fuse with membranes. Their S proteins are composed of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit contains an NTD and a C-domain, in which there is an RBD. The accessory subdomain of the C-domain is a hypervariable region for receptor recognition and is called the RBM. The difference is that SARS-CoV recognizes ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes ACE2 and CD147, but MERS recognizes DPP4, which results from the difference between the accessory subdomains of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. The function of the accessory and nonstructural proteins of these three viruses is related to viral replication and assembly, hence linked to virulence.</p>
