<p id="Par15">Histopathologically, symptoms such as diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), loss of cilia, squamous metaplasia, denudation of bronchial epithelia, and giant-cell infiltrate often occur in the lungs of patients with SARS. The number of macrophages increases prominently in the alveoli and the interstitium.

 </sup> According to the morphological changes, observed, most authors have subclassified lung lesions in SARS into two or three consecutive phases: an acute exudative inflammatory phase, a fibrous proliferative phase, and a final fibrotic stage, although there is considerable overlap in histological findings among these phases.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup> The main features of the first phase include extensive hyaline membrane formation, edema, alveolar hemorrhage, and fibrin exudation in alveolar spaces. The second phase includes widening of septae, pneumocyte hyperplasia, and organizing fibromyxoid and cellular exudates.

 </sup> The third phase includes septal and alveolar fibrosis.

 </sup> Several autopsies of SARS patients have demonstrated secondary bronchopneumonia, and the pathogens identified mainly consist of

 </sup> SARS-CoV also greatly affects the immune system. For example, hemorrhagic necrosis is usually obvious in the lymph nodes and spleen.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup> As described above, SARS-CoV attacks immune cells, especially T cells and macrophages, with approximately 50% of lymphocytes and 30% of monocytes in the circulation becoming infected.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>
 </sup> Under the influence of the virus, the patient’s germinal centers disappear, and both T and B lymphocytes are depleted. In the spleen, the white pulp shrinks, hemorrhage and necrosis occur in the red pulp, and the periarterial lymphatic sheaths decrease.

 </sup> With regard to the immune system, SARS-CoV can infect the lymphoid component of the intestine. For this reason, the patient’s submucosal lymphoid tissue atrophies.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>
 </sup> SARS-CoV can also infect epithelial cells in the mucosa of the small and large intestines, and the digestive tract may undergo mild diffuse inflammation and atrophy of the submucosal lymphoid tissues.

 </sup> According to previous reports, symptoms in the liver include extensive hepatocyte mitosis, balloon degeneration of hepatocytes, mild to moderate lymphocytic infiltrates, fatty degeneration, and central lobular necrosis.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>
 </sup> Additionally, apoptosis of liver cells has been confirmed in some cases.

 </sup> On autopsy, the kidneys of some SARS patients showed focal bleeding and acute tubular necrosis of different degrees. One of the major complications of ARDS is acute kidney injury.

 </sup> In many other cases, the features are nonspecific, including benign hypertensive nephrosclerosis and autolysis.

 </sup> Moreover, researchers have detected viral particles and genome sequences in the cytoplasm of neurons of the hypothalamus and cortex in the brain,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>
 </sup> which suggests that the virus can cross the blood–brain barrier and cause degeneration and necrosis of neurons, edema, extensive glial cell hyperplasia, and cellular infiltration.
