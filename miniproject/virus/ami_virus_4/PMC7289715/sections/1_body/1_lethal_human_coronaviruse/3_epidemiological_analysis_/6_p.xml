 </sup> Plasma concentrations of interleukins (ILs) 2, 7, and 10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon(IFN)-γ-inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, and tumor necrosis factor α are increased in most dying patients.

 </sup> In addition, neutrophilia related to cytokine storms induced by virus invasion, coagulation activation related to a sustained inflammatory response, and acute kidney injury related to the effects of the virus, hypoxia, and shock, may be involved in mortality.

 </sup> Those who survive intensive care may experience long-term lung damage and fibrosis due to aberrant and excessive immune responses.

 </sup> Moreover, researchers found that as SARS-CoV-2 spread and changed across generations, clinical symptoms started to differentiate those infected previously from those infected more recently. The initial symptoms are becoming more insidious, which indicates that the virus may gradually evolve into an influenza-like virus and lie dormant for longer in asymptomatic patients.
