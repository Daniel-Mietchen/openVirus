<p id="Par7">MERS-CoV was first found in 2012 in a lung sample from a 60-year-old patient who died of respiratory failure in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. On 15 September 2012, a similar type of virus named human coronavirus was isolated from a patient with severe respiratory infection. Cases have also been reported in other countries.
