 </sup> Infections occurred through either direct or indirect contact with patients. By July 2003, SARS-CoV had spread to over 30 countries,

 </sup> causing 8096 reported cases and 774 deaths. After that, no additional infections were detected, and the SARS pandemic was declared over. SARS-CoV was first isolated from Himalayan palm civets (HPCs) from a live-animal market in Guangdong, China.

 </sup> Other animals, such as raccoon dogs (

 </sup> Multiple studies have demonstrated that the reservoirs of several coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-like and MERS-CoV-like viruses, were bats.

 </sup> Although palm civets might have been intermediary hosts of SARS-CoV,
 <sup>

 </sup> researchers often concluded there was no evidence that these animals were the ultimate sources of SARS-CoV, and the viruses cannot circulate directly in palm civets in the wild.

 </sup> In 2003, Guan and Zhengâ€™s team investigated a live-animal retail market in Guangdong, focusing on recently captured wild animals and human consumption. The animals sampled included seven wild and one domestic animal species. They collected nasal and fecal samples with swabs and then used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to test for viral nucleic acid from the N gene of the human SARS-CoV. The RT-PCR assay results showed that samples from four of six HPCs were positive; the other seven species (beaver, Chinese ferret-badger, Chinese hare, Chinese muntjac, domestic cat, hog-badger, and raccoon dog) sampled were negative.
