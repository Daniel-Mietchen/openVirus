 </sup> Hospital-related transmission has also been detected via infected medical workers and hospitalized patients. Main routes of transmission include respiratory droplets, close contact, and extended exposure to aerosol environments loaded with high concentrations of virions. In addition to transmission through the respiratory tract, exposure of unprotected eyes to SARS-CoV-2 might cause acute respiratory infection.
