 </sup> Based on analysis of the ACE2 RNA expression profile in normal human lungs, SARS-CoV-2 mainly infects type II alveolar (AT2) cells (only 0.64% of human lung cells can express ACE2, 83% of which are AT2 cells), and they express many other genes that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection;

 </sup> moreover, CD147 was also reported that it probably functionally facilitates cell entry of SARS-CoV-2.
