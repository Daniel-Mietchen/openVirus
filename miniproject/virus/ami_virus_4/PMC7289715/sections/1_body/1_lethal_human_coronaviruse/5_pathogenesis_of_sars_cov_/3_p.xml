<p id="Par27">SARS-CoV causes lung injury mainly by inhibiting the function of ACE2. The virus binds to ACE2 via the spike protein, downregulating its function and contributing to lung injury. ACE2 is an important component of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS). In this system, angiotensinogen is first converted to angiotensinI (AngI) by renin, and then AngIis converted to Ang II under the influence of ACE2. ACE2 downregulates the levels of AngI and Ang II, which can bind to the Ang II type I (AT1) receptor and cause certain types of lung injury, mainly pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary fibrosis, and acute lung injury.

 </sup> Ang II can directly induce pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells to grow or proliferate rapidly through AT1, thus causing pulmonary hypertension.

 </sup> Ang II contributes to pulmonary fibrosis by promoting the expression of the profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor-b1, causing fibroblasts to convert to myofibroblasts and accumulate collagen.

 </sup> Several strategies can be used by the virus to escape the innate immune response. Normally, viral pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are detected by host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PAMPs include viral dsRNA and mRNA, and PRRs include retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Production of type I IFN is induced via the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway. When IFN binds to the IFNα/β receptor, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are activated, which increases the production of other antiviral proteins and thus blocks SARS-CoV replication for further infection.

 </sup> Additionally, SARS-CoV could encode several proteins that hinder the signaling cascades downstream of PRRs.
