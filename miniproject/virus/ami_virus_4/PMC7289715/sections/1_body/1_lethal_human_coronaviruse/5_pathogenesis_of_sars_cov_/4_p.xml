<p id="Par28">The cell receptor of MERS-CoV is DPP4, which is widely expressed on epithelial cells in the prostate, alveoli, kidneys, liver, and small intestine and on activated leukocytes; thus, the range of MERS-CoV tissue tropism is broader than that of any other similar coronavirus. MERS-CoV infection of dendritic cells and macrophages can lead to the continuous production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (such as TNF-α, IL-6, CXCL-10, CCL-2, CCL-3, CCL-5, and IL-8).

 </sup> Compared to SARS-CoV infection, MERS-CoV infection can cause higher expression levels of IL-12, IFN-γ, IP-10/CXCL-10, MCP-1/CCL-2, MIP-1α/CCL-3, RANTES/CCL-5, and IL-8.

 </sup> Induction of immune cell-recruiting cytokines/chemokines might lead to the infiltration of a large number of immune cells into the lower respiratory tract, causing severe inflammation and tissue damage.

 </sup> MERS-CoV can also infect T cells and lead to apoptosis, avoiding the host immune response and facilitating faster spread.
