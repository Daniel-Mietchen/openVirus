<p id="Par26">The pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV is believed to include two parts: the virus injures target cells directly, and subsequent immune system dysfunction leads to indirect injury.

 </sup> SARS-CoV spreads via droplet and contact transmission and via the fecalâ€“oral route. Through droplet inhalation, the virus enters the respiratory tract and invades epithelial cells. Infection and replication of the virus and local inflammatory changes contribute to lung tissue damage. Subsequently, SARS-CoV infects circulating and resident immune cells. The key cells in this step consist mainly of T cells and macrophages. The viruses are then carried to other organs, including secondary lymphoid organs, by these circulating immune cells.

 </sup> SARS-CoV resembles HIV because both viruses attack immune cells and cause immunodeficiency.
