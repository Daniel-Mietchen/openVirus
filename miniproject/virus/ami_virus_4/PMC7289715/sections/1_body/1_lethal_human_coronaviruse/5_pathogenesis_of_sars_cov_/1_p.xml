<p id="Par25">SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are nearly identical in terms of invasion and self-replication, whereas MERS-CoV has different targets. The cellular receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2, plus CD147 for SARS-CoV-2, while that of MERS-CoV is DPP4. The human ACE2 protein is a typical zinc metallopeptidase that comprises 805 amino acids and contains a single catalytic domain. It is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein that is oriented with an extracellular N terminus and a catalytic site that functions in metabolizing circulating peptides.

 </sup> It is believed that there is a virus-binding hot spot on ACE2 that is not pre-existent or preorganized but is induced to form upon virus binding.

 </sup> The hot spot consists of a salt bridge surrounded by hydrophobic tunnel walls. The general structural features of the hot spot favor virus binding: it is located in a region on ACE2 that is furthest from the membrane, relatively flat, and free of glycosylation and is thereby easily accessible to viruses. The hot spot is mainly an intrinsic property of ACE2, but it is also a dynamic structure and receives structural contributions from both ACE2 and the viruses, with the contributions of ACE2 being more pronounced. DPP4 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that consists of approximately 766 amino acids. DPP4 contains an N-terminal hydrolase and a C-terminal Î²-propeller domain composed of eight lancets.

 </sup> The S protein RBD binds to the side surface of the DPP4 propeller and the amino acid residues in lancets 4 and 5, including K267, Q286, T288, R317, R336, Q344, A291, L294, and I295.
