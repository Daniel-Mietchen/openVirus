<p id="Par62">SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV belong to subgroups 2b and 2c of the betacoronaviruses, respectively, and SARS-CoV-2 is a new member of betacoronaviruses, distinct from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar in terms of invasion and self-replication, whereas MERS-CoV has different targets. The cellular receptor of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2, plus CD147 for SARS-CoV-2, while that of MERS-CoV is DPP4 (CD26). All of them evolved a mechanism to escape the host cell immune system. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 affect the RAS system by suppressing ACE2, leading to the onset of symptoms. MERS-CoV causes symptoms by producing inflammatory cytokines and invading T cells. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infections have similar symptoms, including fever, cough, myalgia, and shortness of breath, among others. Current treatments for SARS mainly include IFN-Î±, antiviral treatments (e.g., ribavirin), plasma therapy, host-directed therapies, and systemic corticosteroids. For MERS, several therapeutics are in development, including convalescent plasma, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, IFN, and novel therapies, including polyclonal antibodies, broad-spectrum antivirals, and AMPs. For COVID-19, candidates mainly include drugs targeting the S protein, nonstructural proteins (3CLpro, PLpro, helicase, and RdRp), and viral RNA synthesis blockers such as Remdesivir and Ribavirin. Vaccines such as DNA vaccine, mRNA vaccine, and recombinant vaccines are being rapidly developed.</p>
