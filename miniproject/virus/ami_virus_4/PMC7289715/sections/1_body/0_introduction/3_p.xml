<p id="Par4">The estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses (CoVs) are moderate to high compared to those of other ssRNA viruses.

 </sup> There are two gene loci that are sites of variation in SARS-CoV. One of these sites is located in the spike (S) protein gene. The second major site of variation is the accessory gene open reading frame ORF8. In MERS-CoV, the major sites of variation are located in the S, ORF4b, and ORF3 genes.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup> The major differences in the sequence of the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 are three short insertions in the N-terminal domain and changes in four out of five of the key residues in the receptor-binding motif.

 </sup> The organizations of the genome and gene expression are similar for all coronaviruses. ORF1a/b, located at the 5′ end, encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (NSPs) (named NSP1–NSP16); other ORFs at the 3′ end encode structural proteins, including the S, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins.
