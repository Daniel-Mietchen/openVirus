<p id="Par2">Coronaviruses are crown-like particles with spikes protruding from their surface. They are enveloped viruses with single-stranded, positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA) genomes of approximately 26–32 kb, which is currently the largest known genome size for an RNA virus.

 </sup> RNA viruses are divided into five branches.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup> Certain groups in a particular branch might be related to and/or share features with viruses classified in another branch. In Branch 1 are the leviviruses and eukaryotic relatives (e.g., mitoviruses, narnaviruses, ourmiaviruses); Branch 2 represents several +RNA virus families (of eukaryotes) (e.g., orders 
 <italic>Picornavirales</italic> and 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, and the families 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Potyviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Astroviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Solemoviridae</italic>) and several dsRNA viruses (e.g., partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses); In Branch 3 are certain +RNA viruses such as the supergroups of alphaviruses and offlaviviruses, the nodaviruses, tombusviruses, and many small and novel groups; In Branch 4 are dsRNA viruses such as the cystoviruses, reoviruses, and totiviruses; Branch 5 consists of −RNA viruses.

 </sup> Coronaviruses were classified as most likely related to Branch 2, and belong to the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, and the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>. In 2018, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses divided the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> into the 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic> and 
 <italic>Letovirinae</italic> subfamilies.
