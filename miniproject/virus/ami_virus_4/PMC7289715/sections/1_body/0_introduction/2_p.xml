<p id="Par3">According to their host targets, coronaviruses can also be divided into animal and human coronaviruses. Many diseases in domestic animals are related to animal coronaviruses, such as canine respiratory coronavirus, which causes respiratory disease in dogs.

 </sup> The highly pathogenic human coronaviruses belong to the subfamily 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> from the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>. The viruses in this subfamily group into four genera: 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>. The classic subgroup clusters are labeled 1a–1b for the alphacoronaviruses and 2a–2d for the betacoronaviruses. To date, including the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2, there are seven coronaviruses that infect humans. Human coronavirus (HCoV)-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, or HCoV-HKU1 cause only the common cold,
