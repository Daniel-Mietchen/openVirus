<p id="Par5">The mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have become a hot research topic. The surface proteins of SARS-CoV and BatCoV-RaTG13, the nearest potential bat precursors of SARS-CoV-2, have 76 and 97% sequence identity, respectively, to that of SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> Compared to that of SARS-CoV, the antigenic surface of SARS-CoV-2 is highly divergent compared to other CoVs. Since its outbreak began at the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has acquired mutations throughout its genome, and there are already hundreds of virus strains distributed worldwide. According to GISAID.org, as of May 8, there were 16,004 full genome sequences available, and the S clade of the full genome tree contains the largest group of viruses, indicating that mutations in ORF8-L84S are most frequent. The temporal resolution assumes an average nucleotide substitution rate of 5 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions per site per year. Based on these mutations, researchers found that SARS-CoV-2 can be divided into two subtypes. They reported that the SNPs at locations 8782 and 28,144 show strong linkage; the “CT” haplotype was defined as the “L” type because T28,144 encodes leucine, while the “TC” haplotype was defined as the “S” type because C28,144 encodes serine,

 </sup> which is in accordance with another study that divided SARS-CoV-2 into two types.

 </sup> The “L” type seems to be more prevalent and aggressive, but the “S” type may be ancestral, as sites 8782 and 28,144 were identical to the orthologous sites in the most closely related viruses.

 </sup> Patients may be infected by either or both types.

 </sup> From the GISAID update, compared with RaTG13, there are differences in the receptor-binding interface, which may have favored host switching. Data related to the sequence and mutations of SARS-CoV-2 are also available and continuously updated online through the China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB) (
