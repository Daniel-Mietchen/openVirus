 </sup> Inovio Pharmaceuticals has accumulated extensive safety and immunogenicity data for MERS-CoV vaccine studies. Because of the high degree of similarity between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, lessons from such a vaccine development process may be beneficial for the development of a DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Since January 2020, Inovio has been collaborating with several experts and companies (some in China), and has currently already begun phase I clinical trials of the DNA vaccine INO-4800.
