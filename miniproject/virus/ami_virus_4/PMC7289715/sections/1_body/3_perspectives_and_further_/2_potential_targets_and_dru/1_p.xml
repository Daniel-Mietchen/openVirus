<p id="Par54">The SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes nonstructural proteins, structural proteins, and accessory proteins. 3CLpro, PLpro, helicase, and RdRp, which belong to the first type, and the S protein, which belongs to the second, have been recognized as promising targets for developing antiviral agents against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which therefore may be applied to SARS-CoV-2. Nonetheless, the rapid identification of effective interventions against SARS-CoV-2 is a major challenge. However, the subject of using currently known antiviral drugs has been frequently brought up by the community as a potential short-term strategy to combat SARS-CoV-2.</p>
