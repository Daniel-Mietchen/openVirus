<p id="Par56">Due to the strong affinity between ACE2 receptor and the RBD of SARS-CoV-2, another opportunity might be through the development of antibodies to block ACE2. The second method is to use a large amount of soluble ACE2 to directly block the spike protein. The third method is to find a drug that directly inhibits the spike membrane fusion process, such as the AIDS drug enfuvirtide. The fourth approach is to identify an agent that inhibits the activity of disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17), which may also prevent viral release and proliferation in cells and protect ACE2 and the lungs.
