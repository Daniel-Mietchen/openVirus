<p id="Par61">Chinaâ€™s CanSino Biologics might be the leader as it was announced it has moved to phase II testing of a vaccine called Ad5-nCoV. The latter is currently often being reported as a DNA vaccine, but to be precise, it uses viral vectors (adenovirus) to deliver DNA related to SARS-CoV-2. Part of the project is carried out currently with the Chinese military medical research institute. The vaccine candidate is constructed using genetic engineering methods and defective human type 5 adenovirus as a vector that can express the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen, to stimulate the body to produce strong humoral or cellular immunity.</p>
