<p id="Par58">Modernaâ€™s vaccine model is designed to use mRNAs to safely pre-expose the immune system to a small amount of encoded proteins usually generated by the pathogen, so that the immune system becomes prepared to fight future pathogens and prevent infection. The candidate genes developed by Moderna contain mRNAs, and combining multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine might be useful to rapidly induce responses, which is an approach that may be applied for future, emerging pandemic threats too. At the same time, because the mRNA in the cell will be degraded over time, the mRNA vaccine will not continue to produce antigen components for a long time, which can avoid the risk of continued stimulation of the immune system. Generally, mRNA vaccines are also described as simple to prepare and to yield remarkable results. Additional advantages, as well as disadvantages, of nucleic acid-based vaccines were described in detail. Furthermore, the basis of traditional vaccines, proteins or polysaccharides, cannot be straight forward applied at present against many pathogens. Therefore, mRNA vaccines would be suitable for achieving rapid, mass production of emergency vaccines in the event of a major epidemic. However, because RNA is easily degraded, inducing cells to absorb mRNA quickly is a challenge. In recent years, the method for delivery of mRNA into cells has been greatly improved, and Stemirna and Moderna have adopted nanolipid (LPP or LNP (lipid nanoparticle)) drug-loading technology. However, this is still to be developed for mRNAs. Furthermore, ensuring safety and effectiveness is another challenge for viral mRNA vaccines, and clinical validation will have to be carried out carefully.</p>
