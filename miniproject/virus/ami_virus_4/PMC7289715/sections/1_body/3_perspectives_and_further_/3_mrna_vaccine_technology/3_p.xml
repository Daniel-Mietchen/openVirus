<p id="Par59">Moderna is a worldwide leader in mRNA therapy, with currently nine mRNA-type vaccine candidates (e.g., mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2). The National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the mRNA vaccine giant Moderna have teamed up to bring the new coronavirus vaccine possibly to phase II within a few months, and phase III late this year. Simultaneously, in January 2020, the Translational Medicine Platform of Dongfang Hospital affiliated with Tongji University cooperated with Stemirna (Shanghai) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. to rapidly promote the development of a new coronavirus mRNA vaccine. In February 2020, the Chinese scientific research team announced that animal testing of the newly developed coronavirus vaccine has begun. If animal testing goes well, this new vaccine will enter human clinical trials within a few months. Also in February 2020, Zhuhai Livanda Biotechnology Co., Ltd. announced that the first batch of new coronavirus mRNA vaccine standard samples completed during the Spring Festival had been delivered to relevant national authorities on for animal testing and efficacy verification. The researchers detected the production of target antibodies in mouse serum at day 12 following immunization. The company claimed that this was also the first time worldwide that new coronavirus vaccines developed based on mRNA technology have resulted in antibodies in animals. Livanda is currently pushing ahead with the project through extensive cooperation with the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Supervision, and the Macau University of Science and Technology. The antigen used in its development is the same as that used by Moderna.</p>
