<p id="Par57">SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are already under development. The mRNA and DNA vaccines are promising approaches to prevent cellular invasion by similar coronaviruses in the future. In January 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced three partnerships to develop a new coronavirus vaccine. Among them, Moderna and Inovio presented mRNA and DNA vaccine technologies, respectively. The goal of the three teams is to have at least one candidate vaccine capable of preventing coronavirus infection in 16 weeks, to be tested in a phase I clinical trial.</p>
