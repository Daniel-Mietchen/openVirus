<p id="Par53">This topic has intrigued the community. Understanding certain mechanisms about virus interactions will support drug research activities. For instance, it was found that SARS-CoV-2 has a stronger, more rapid spreading ability than many known viruses. Is it possible that it invades host cells via additional novel routes, not limited to ACE2? For example, CD147 is probably involved in virus invasion.

 </sup> Is there an S-like protein involved in invasion? The affinity of the human ACE2 protein for the RBD of the new coronavirus is 10â€“20 times higher than it is for that of the SARS virus, which likely explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads more swiftly. There is a distinct insert present in the peptide fragment spanning of S1/S2 loop of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which is not shared the similarity with SARS-CoV or any SARS-related viruses. Does this peptide loop impact on the entry pathway type of SARS-CoV-2, compared to other known betacoronavirus lineage B? Furthermore, the S protein is likely cleaved during virus assembly and delivery to the cell surface by Golgi-resident proprotein convertases such as furin,

 </sup> which is different from the behavior of its close relatives. Furin is found in a variety of human tissues, including the lungs, liver, and small intestine. Therefore, which are exactly the cell types that SARS-CoV-2 may attack? Yet, in relation to the last two questions, it should be noted that studies are also necessary to investigate any possibility of receptor-independent virus entry.
