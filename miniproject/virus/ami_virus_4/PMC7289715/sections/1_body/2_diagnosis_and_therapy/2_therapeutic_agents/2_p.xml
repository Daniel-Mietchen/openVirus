<p id="Par38">Protease inhibitors also have the potential for coronavirus therapeutics. Protease inhibitors, including disulfiram, lopinavir, and ritonavir, have been reported to be effective against SARS and MERS, and disulfiram, a drug for alcohol dependence, was reported to inhibit the papain-like protease (PLpro) of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in cell cultures.

 </sup> In vitro, SARS-CoV can be inhibited by both 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine targeting PLpro.

 </sup> When used together with ribavirin, the protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir have improved the outcomes of patients with SARS compared with those achieved with the use of ribavirin alone.

 </sup> Such inhibitors are also being tested in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but whether these inhibitors effectively suppress 3CLpro and PLpro of SARS-CoV-2 remains controversial.

 </sup> Drugs such as colistin, valrubicin, icatibant, bepotastine, epirubicin, epoprostenol, vapreotide, aprepitant, caspofungin, perphenazine, prulifloxacin, bictegravir, nelfinavir, and tegobuvir bind to the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, and thus, are potential candidates.

 </sup> Lianhua-Qingwen formula, a kind of traditional Chinese medicine, has been also recently described theoretically as a potential treatment candidate against the main virus protease.

 </sup> The serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate could partly block SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells by inhibiting TMPRSS2.
