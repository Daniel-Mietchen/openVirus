 </sup> Based on previous studies, drugs may be developed to inhibit cell entry. Several strategies have been investigated to identify specific antivirals targeting the S protein, including MERS-RBD-targeted nAbs that block viral attachment, peptide inhibitors targeting S2 to prevent the formation of the fusion core, and small molecules without defined mechanisms.

 </sup> sDPP4 has been found to bind MERS-CoV RBD with high affinity, suggesting that sDPP4 could serve as a blocker for MERS-CoV attachment to and entry into cells.

 </sup> One study reported a monoclonal antibody, 7D10, that binds to the NTD to inhibit cellular entry of MERS-CoV.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>
 </sup> Experiments have shown that 7D10 not only inhibits the binding of MERS-CoV to cells but also has effects after viral-cell attachment. 7D10 inhibits virus invasion by blocking the binding of the S1 subunit to the receptor and interfering with the conformational transformation of the S2 subunit when the virus fuses with the cell membrane.

 </sup> A peptide fragment spanning residues 736â€“761 of the S protein exerts neutralization activity by inhibiting membrane fusion and the entry of MERS-CoV, suggesting that it is possible to develop vaccines targeting this neutralizing epitope.

 </sup> Griffithsin, a lectin derived from red algae, binds to oligosaccharides on the surface of SARS-CoV S protein and may also prove effective against SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> Researchers found that antibodies raised against SARS-CoV, such as CSS-2, -3, -4, and -5, could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 by reducing S-driven cell entry, although the efficiency was lower than that observed for SARS-CoV.

 </sup> Meplazumab, an anti-CD147 humanized antibody, binds with the CD147 in competition with the S protein,

 </sup> Chloroquine could effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and hydroxychloroquine was even more potent than chloroquine.

 </sup> Hydroxychloroquine could significantly help reduce the virus load, and azithromycin could reinforce its effect.

 </sup> Arbidol could also contribute to condition improvement.
