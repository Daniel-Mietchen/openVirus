The criteria for the diagnosis of SARS from the WHO include (1) fever higher than 38 °C or history of such in the past 2 days, (2) radiological evidence of new infiltrates consistent with pneumonia, (3) chills, cough, malaise, myalgia, or known history of exposure, and (4) positive tests for by at least one assay. As for MERS, the criteria for the diagnosis according to the WHO include (1) fever, cough, and hospitalization with suspicion of lower respiratory tract lesion, (2) history of contact with probable or confirmed cases, (3) history of travel or residence within the Arabian Peninsula, and (4) positive tests by a PCR-based detection method using respiratory samples, such as nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal or tracheal aspirates, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and induced sputum, or by serological tests such as the rapid immunochromatographic assay using highly selective monoclonal antibodies at room temperature. The initial criteria for the diagnosis of SARS included (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan within 2 weeks before the onset of illness, (2) exposure to patients from Wuhan with fever and respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks before the onset of illness or the existence of clusters of diseases, (3) fever accompanied by radiographic features of pneumonia, a normal or decreased total number of white blood cells, or a decreased lymphocyte count, and (4) fluorescence PCR testing positive for nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2.
