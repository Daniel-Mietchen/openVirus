<p id="Par36">Nucleic acid tests, such as real-time PCR tests, were mostly used to detect virus in the early stage of the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, although this approach requires a relatively long time and is not conducive to accelerating diagnosis or large-scale application. Therefore, alternative, rapid diagnostic kits for SARS-CoV-2 may be used. For example, the Colloidal Gold Detection Kit uses serum, plasma, or whole blood samples to detect IgM/IgG antibodies for diagnosis on the 7th day of infection or the 3rd day after onset and requires only 15â€‰min. The nucleic acid detection kit for six respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus, uses thermostatic amplifier chips for diagnosis. By detecting different infections, it may help distinguish people with influenza from those with other viral infections. A newly developed detection method, Nanopore Targeted Sequencing, also has the potential for efficiently detecting viruses in a reasonable time. Moreover, it could identify 40 other respiratory viruses and monitor changes in virulence and transmissibility caused by viral mutations.
