 </sup> However, the highly sophisticated immune evasion mechanisms of viral pathogens and their high mutation rates make human vaccine development a major challenge.

 </sup> The four NSPs (3CLpro, PLpro, helicase, and RdRp), which are key enzymes in the viral life cycle, and the S protein, which is responsible for receptor binding during cell entry, are attractive targets for developing vaccines against coronaviruses.

 </sup> Among them, the S protein is most commonly targeted.
