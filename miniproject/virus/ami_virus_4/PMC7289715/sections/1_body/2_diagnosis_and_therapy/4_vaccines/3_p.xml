<p id="Par49">DNA vaccines are also quite promising. Specific IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV can be promoted by the S gene DNA vaccine. As mentioned above, the S protein of SARS-CoV plays an important role during the pathogenic process, and synthetic peptides induced by DNA vaccine in

 </sup> To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a plasmid DNA vaccine (GLS-5300) that expresses the S protein of MERS-CoV, a phase I clinical trial on healthy volunteers was conducted in 2016, but the results were not reported. Another phase I trial utilizing the viral vector, Chimpanzee Adenovirus, Oxford University #1 (ChAdOx1), containing the MERS-CoV S protein expression gene was started by Oxford University in January 2018.
