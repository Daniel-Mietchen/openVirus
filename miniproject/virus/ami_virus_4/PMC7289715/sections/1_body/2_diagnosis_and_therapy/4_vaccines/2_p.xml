<p id="Par48">Based on previous studies, it is believed that the S protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) located in the S1 subunit is an important target for the development of a SARS vaccine, especially the key neutralizing region, CND. Indeed, CND can induce a strong neutralizing antibody response and cross-protection against SARS-CoV mutants. One study showed that a recombinant fusion protein (designated RBD-Fc) containing the 193-amino acid RBD and a human IgG1 Fc fragment can induce highly potent antibody responses in immunized rabbits. The antibodies inhibited SARS-CoV infection (serum dilution of 1:10,240), and they are believed to be safer than other types of vaccines.

 </sup> Additionally, with chloroplast transgenic technology, it is possible to combine the fusion gene S-RBD and the carrier molecule cholera toxin B subunit into the tobacco chloroplast genome to obtain a chloroplast transgenic tobacco plant that stably expresses the oral SARS-CoV subunit vaccine.

 </sup> For MERS, vaccines based on the viral S protein include full-length S or S-trimer protein-based vaccines such as a full-length S-based simian adenovirus vector vaccine (ChAdOx1) and DNA vaccine (GLS-5300),

 </sup> RBD-based vaccines, and vaccines based on other regions. It has been confirmed that the S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are quite similar, but researchers recently found that the three monoclonal antibodies developed to bind to the S protein of SARS-CoV, S230, m396, and 80R do not cross-react with the S protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that tailored vaccines and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 must be designed.
