<p id="Par45">The host-directed strategy is another approach for limiting viral replication. Host proteases such as cathepsin B and cathepsin L can cleave the spike protein of SARS-CoV. Drugs such as camostat inhibit host serine proteases and then interfere with the entry of SARS-CoV, but they may cause many significant side effects.

 </sup> Pegylated IFN Î±-2a and -2b may be used to stimulate innate antiviral responses in patients, and chloroquine, an approved immune modulator, was reported to have inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2 under certain conditions.

 </sup> Researchers have also proposed that some commercially available drugs with suitable safety profiles, such as metformin, glitazones, fibrates, sartans, and atorvastin, as well as nutrient supplements and biologics, might reduce immunopathology, boost immune responses, and prevent or curb ARDS. In addition, ongoing cellular therapies using mesenchymal stromal cells from allogeneic donors have been shown to reduce nonproductive inflammation and affect tissue regeneration and are being evaluated in phase 1/2 trials in patients with ARDS; these therapies may be assayed in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.

 </sup> Expansion of antiviral T cells as cellular drugs could aid in preparing T cell products for adjunct treatment of patients with severe infection.
