<p id="Par5">As of April 7, 2020, a total of 81 802 COVID-19 cases had been reported in China. This total included 1190 asymptomatic cases that had been confirmed as asymptomatic after extended close follow-up. It also included a further 1095 cases that had been tentatively categorized as asymptomatic cases but were still under medical observation [

Nevertheless, this is clearly still an underestimate since testing has primarily occurred among individuals who have symptoms. Interestingly, the new widespread active testing campaign currently underway in Wuhan (~11 million residents planned to be tested over 10 days) may provide important new evidence on the prevalence of carriers. Meanwhile, asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases are beginning to be documented in other settings as well, for example, in a long-term care facility in the United States [
