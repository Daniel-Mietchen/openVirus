<p id="Par6">As for the infectiousness of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases, it is important to note that presence of viral RNA (i.e., positive viral nucleic acid test result) does not necessarily indicate the presence of viable, transmissible virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Yet, transmission events have been documented in various contexts in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and now elsewhere as well [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], wherein asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals successfully pass their infection on to close contacts. Transmission in this context is almost certainly a driver of local outbreaks and epidemics and thereby contributes to the global pandemic. The magnitude of its contribution to the epidemic was not significant in China according to the limited available data; however, it remains unknown in other countries. Large scale serological studies, which will help our understanding of transmission by carriers, are underway in China and Germany and regionally in the United States, and their results are anxiously awaited.
