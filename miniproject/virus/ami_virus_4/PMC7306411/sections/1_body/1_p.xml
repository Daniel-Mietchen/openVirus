<p id="Par3">Asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are those having positive results from either viral nucleic acid or antibody testing yet not having classical symptoms (i.e., fever, dry cough, fatigue). In a report of the first 72,314 COVID-19 cases in China, the proportion of such asymptomatic cases was 1% â€” only 889 cases had been documented [

Also, it should be noted that community transmission in China was limited primarily to Wuhan City, and to a lesser extent in Hubei Province, while the 30 other provinces/municipalities/autonomous regions only had clusters of cases. The prevalence of asymptomatic cases may differ in areas with versus without community transmission. Indeed, until recently asymptomatic cases were only being found through rapid screening of close contacts of symptomatic cases, intensive investigation of case clusters, and active testing campaigns [
