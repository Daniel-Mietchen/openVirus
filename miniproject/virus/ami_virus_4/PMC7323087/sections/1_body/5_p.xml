<p>In conclusion, the available evidence to date suggests children are unlikely to be major transmitters of SARS‐CoV‐2, the coronavirus that causes COVID‐19. In Australia and New Zealand, very few children or health‐care workers have been diagnosed with SARS‐CoV‐2 despite intense testing. Health workers who develop symptoms compatible with COVID‐19 should be tested and should stay away from work until cleared, which will protect children, their families and other staff. Hospital staff who follow infection control recommendations regarding social distancing, hand‐washing and appropriate use of personal‐protective equipment are at very low risk of catching SARS‐CoV‐2 from children.</p>
