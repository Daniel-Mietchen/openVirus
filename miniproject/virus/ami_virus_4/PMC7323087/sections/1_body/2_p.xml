<p>Child care clusters of COVID‐19 have been notable for their extreme rarity in reports from around the world, although this could be for lack of testing. A current child care outbreak in Sydney was initiated and spread by infected adults. SARS‐CoV‐2 is mainly spread by droplets and through touching contaminated surfaces. Studies show SARS‐CoV‐2 can be detected by polymerase chain reaction in the stool of affected infants for several weeks, raising the possibility of faecal–oral spread. Reassuringly, German researchers found no live virus in stool despite viral RNA being detectable, suggesting the positive test is due to dead viral debris shed from the respiratory tract rather than active virus. One would expect child care clusters to be common if asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic pre‐school children were even moderately infectious.</p>
