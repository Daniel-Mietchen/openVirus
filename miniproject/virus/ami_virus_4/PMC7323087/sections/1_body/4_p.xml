 </xref> Studies suggest school closures in China, Hong Kong and Singapore had little or no effect on control of the 2003 outbreak with the related SARS virus, which like infection with SARS‐CoV‐2 was much milder in children than adults.

 </xref> However, we should be cautious about extrapolation from SARS to SARS‐CoV‐2. Modelling studies suggest school closures would prevent fewer than 5% of COVID‐19 deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions, and would have major adverse effects on children and on the workforce, but modelling studies are only as good as the data.
