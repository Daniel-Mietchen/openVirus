<p>Our contemporaneous plaque assay controls demonstrated viable virus in each of the oral challenge blood meals, indicating that infectious virus was presented to the mosquitoes during challenge. One potential explanation for the low competence of New Orleans 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in particular, could have been the presence of the endosymbiotic bacterium 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, which is known to block the transmission of multiple mosquito-borne pathogens including Zika virus and occur in wild 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0233309.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We tested our mosquitoes for the presence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> using previously published PCR primers and found no evidence that 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> were present in the New Orleans populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0233309.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Thus, we conclude that there are other mechanisms that underly the lack of susceptibility of New Orleans 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes to this strain of Zika virus. Such mechanisms may include mosquito-virus kinetics, the level of viremia needed for this virus strain to establish an infection in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, the ability of this Zika virus strain to establish and shed in the salivary glands of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes or the fact this Zika virus strain was isolated from a human sample and only ever passaged in Vero cells.
