<p>Populations of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> have been shown to be competent vectors of dengue virus and Zika virus both in the laboratory and field [

 <xref rid="pone.0233309.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The competence of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes for transmitting Zika virus has been shown to be affected by such factors as species, mosquito and virus strain [
 <xref rid="pone.0233309.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition to the infection and transmission rates, the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), or the time it takes for an individual mosquito to become capable of transmitting virus after taking an infectious blood meal, is known to be dependent on the multiplicity of infection, or the infectious dose of virus in a blood meal, and the number of subsequent blood meals taken.
