<p>Prior to the salivation assay, mosquitoes were starved off sucrose for 12 hours. For the low dose experiment, mosquitoes were force salivated at 4, 10, and 15 DPI. Briefly, females were anesthetized with triethylamine in a sealed container (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) [

Mosquitoes were placed on inverted autoclave tape on a salivation plate with proboscises inserted into a 20 μL micro-pipette tip containing 10 μL of salivation solution: 10% sucrose/10% FBS/5 μM ATP [

Heads and bodies were placed in 2 mL round bottom tubes with a 4 mm stainless steel ball bearing. Samples were immediately frozen at -80 °C until further processing.
