<p id="p0165">Many questions regarding the neurological consequences of COVID-19 in humans are still unanswered. For instance, it is currently unknown whether the neurological signs described in COVID-19 patients are a consequence of a direct SARS-CoV-2 CNS infection; however, the fact that SARS-CoV-2 genome has been isolated from the CSF of a COVID-19 patient (
 <xref rid="bb0895" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>) suggests direct viral neuroinvasion. Further attempts to isolate SARS-CoV-2 from the CSF, and autopsies of COVID-19 victims may shed some light. In addition, knowing whether the encephalopathy occurring during the acute phase of the disease leads to long lasting sequelae such as chronic epilepsy or cognitive impairment would be critical for rigorous prognostic evaluation; however, we presently don't know whether SARS-CoV-2 establishes latent infections that could either reactivate or trigger chronic neurological disorders. Shared procedures for early identification of COVID-19 patients at high risk of neurological involvement are essential. In order to better define the extent and pathomechanism of CNS damage, special attention should be given to signs and symptoms that could suggest brainstem impairment. These may then prompt further diagnostic investigations with auditory brainstem responses, neuroimaging tools, or CFS analysis, as recently suggested (

Studies aiming to better characterize the immunological mechanisms responsible for disease pathogenesis could additionally provide solid conceptual basis for the rational use of immune modulators such as the anti-IFN-Î³ emapalumab, the IL-1 antagonist anakinra, and the two monoclonal antibodies targeting the IL-6 pathway sarilumab and tocilizumab. All these drugs, potentially representing targeted therapeutic interventions to prevent or dampen neuroinflammation in COVID-19 patients, are currently under active investigation (
