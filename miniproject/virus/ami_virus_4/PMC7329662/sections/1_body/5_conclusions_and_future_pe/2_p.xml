<p id="p0160">The evidence examined in the present review highlights the long-known but currently little-considered ability of CoVs to invade the CNS and cause neurological diseases.It also shows, however, that most of our knowledge of CoV neurovirulence derives from studies performed in rodents infected with MHVs or HCoV-OC43. On the other hand, the information on the new human CoVs is much more limited. Many basic questions concerning the neurobiology of these new viruses still need to be addressed in experimental animals, and major clinical points concerning CoVs infections in human patients remain to be urgently clarified for SARS-CoV-2 in light of the devastating health consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Reliable animal models are critical to successfully address these issues (

In fact, both MERS and SARS can hardly be replicated in rodents, and transgenic animals overexpressing the receptors for their causative viruses display a non-physiological distribution pattern of CoV receptors in the CNS which does not faithfully replicate the neurobiology of these viruses (

 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Agrawal et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, even in hACE2 overexpressing mice, no evidence of CNS invasion was detected upon experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2 (
