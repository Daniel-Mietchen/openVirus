<p id="p0035">CoVs can access the CNS in two ways: the hematogenous and the neurogenic routes (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Hematogenous invasion occurs when a neurovirulent agent enters the brain after a transient viremic episode and crosses the blood brain barrier (BBB). Hematogenous neuroinvasion by CoVs, as with the human respiratory syncytial neurotropic virus (hRSV), may occur through two non-mutually excluding mechanisms: by direct penetration of the free viral particle across the endothelial cells of the BBB, or by hijacking peripheral blood cells (mainly monocytes/macrophages) which are infected in the airways during the acute phase and then transmigrate from the blood to the brain via the paracellular route between endothelial cells of the BBB (
