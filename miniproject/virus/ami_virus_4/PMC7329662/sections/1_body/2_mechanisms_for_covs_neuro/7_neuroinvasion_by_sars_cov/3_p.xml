<p id="p0075">Remarkably, not only regions directly connected with the olfactory bulb (including the piriform cortex, the basal ganglia and the midbrain), but also regions with no direct synaptic connection are rapidly invaded, suggesting that alternative routes of invasion besides the transsynaptic propagation could be involved, possibly including the Virchow-Robin spaces. The dorsal vagal complex is among the brain structures not directly connected with the olfactory bulb which are invaded early during the disease. Its damage could thus contribute to the death of the animal by cardiorespiratory failure. The route used by SARS-CoV to invade the dorsal vagal nuclei is still unclear, but it does not likely involve the propagation from the gut through the vagal fibers since the virus has not been found in the gut after intranasal instillation. Importantly, after intranasal administration, SARS-CoV-2 can be found only in neurons, with no glial colonization or inflammatory cell infiltration, ruling out the spread to the CNS through the hematogenous route (
 <xref rid="bb0565" ref-type="bibr">Netland et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, the pattern of neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV emerging from studies in K18-hACE2 transgenic mice is different from that observed by Glass et al. (
 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Glass et al., 2004b</xref>) in wild type C57 mice. This study found no evidence of olfactory bulb involvement and the location of the virus was predominantly in the hippocampus, an area frequently spared or only slightly and lately infected in transgenic mice. It is presently unknown whether this different neuroinvasion pattern occurs because SARS-CoV penetrates the brain through alternative routes in the absence of high affinity hACE2 receptors, or because it is simply a consequence of the slow progression of brain infection in wild type mice.
