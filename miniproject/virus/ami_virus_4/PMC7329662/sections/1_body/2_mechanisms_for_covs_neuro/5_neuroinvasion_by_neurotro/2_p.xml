<p id="p0050">Neurotropic MHVs use different neuroinvasion mechanisms depending on the administration pathways. Systemic administration of MHV through intravenous or intraperitoneal routes is followed by hematogenous propagation in the brain, a process facilitated by the ability of CoVs to infect brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and to loosen the BBB (
