<p id="p0060">The ability of MHVs to invade the CNS by the neurogenic route was demonstrated by sequential immunochemistry analysis showing that, after intranasal inoculation in mice, JHMV first infects the nasal mucosa and then progresses into the brain through the olfactory fibers to reach the anterior part of the brain and, after at least four days, invade the posterior regions (
