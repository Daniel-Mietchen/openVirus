<p id="p0065">HCoV-OC43 can invade the CNS through the neurogenic route. After intranasal inoculation in mice, HCoV-OC43 first appears in the cell bodies and dendrites of olfactory neurons 3â€¯days after infection, and then propagates to other brain regions including the hippocampus, the brain stem where it can damage the respiratory nuclei, and, finally, the cortex and the spinal cord (

Destruction of the olfactory epithelium with zinc sulphate abrogated brain invasion, further supporting the critical role of olfactory fibers for neuroinvasion; by contrast, hematogenous invasion was ruled out because viral particles were not found in the general circulation after intranasal viral inoculation (
