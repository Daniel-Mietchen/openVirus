 <xref rid="bb0520" ref-type="bibr">Morfopoulou et al., 2016</xref>). In the majority of cases, however, CoV neuroinvasion triggers a major immune response with tissue inflammation that can either clear the virus and help resolving the infection, or cause immune-mediated CNS injury. Importantly, even when CoVs are no longer detectable, sterile immunity is rarely achieved since the virus persists in the brain in a latent form.
