<p id="p0085">In vitro experiments using murine or human cell cultures exposed to JHMV, HCoV-OC43, or SARS-CoV have shown that CoVs can infect neurons, glial cells and BMECs (

Non-neuronal cells have a role in the neurobiology of CoV infection of the CNS since they may be instrumental for tissue damage or healing. In addition, their dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of relevant neurological disorders such as stroke (
