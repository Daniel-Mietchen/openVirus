<p id="p0040">During neurogenic invasion on the other hand, viruses enter the CNS through retrograde axonal transport along specific peripheral nerves depending on the main site of infection. For instance, respiratory viruses which colonize the olfactory epithelium may use olfactory nerve fibers to enter the CNS (

 <xref rid="bb0495" ref-type="bibr">Matsuda et al., 2004</xref>), but seem to play only a minor role in CoV neuroinvasion (
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Dube et al., 2018</xref>). The vagus nerve may serve as a gateway to the CNS for CoVs that infect the gastrointestinal mucosa, as seen for PHEV-67â€¯N, which, after oronasal inoculation, infects the epithelial cells of the small intestinal mucosa in pigs and is thereafter transported retrogradely via peripheral nerves to central neurons in charge of peristaltic function of the digestive tract, resulting in the so-called vomiting disease (
