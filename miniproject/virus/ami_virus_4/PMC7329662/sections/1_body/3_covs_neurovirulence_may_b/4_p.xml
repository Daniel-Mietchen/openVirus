<p id="p0130">However, it is presently unknown whether highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can also cause encephalitis in humans, possibly because of the difficulties in identifying symptoms and signs of brain involvement in patients who are deeply sedated during mechanical ventilation, and due to the limited availability of autoptic material. Nonetheless, genome sequences of SARS-CoV have been found in brain samples from all eight SARS-affected patients reported by Gu et al. (
 <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2005</xref>) who underwent a thorough autoptic examination, with neuronal death and necrosis at histopathology in 6 of them. Moreover, the SARS-CoV genome was identified by RT-PCR in the CSF of a 32 year-old woman affected with SARS who developed generalized tonic-clonic seizure (
 <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">Lau et al., 2004</xref>), and in brain autoptic samples from a 39 year-old patient who died from SARS and showed neurological symptoms suggestive of encephalitis (
 <xref rid="bb0855" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, three patients with MERS-CoV infection displayed severe neurological impairment, which variably included altered mental status from confusion to coma, ataxia and focal motor deficits, and MRI findings suggestive of ongoing encephalitis (

 <xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0555" ref-type="bibr">Nath, 2020</xref>) may represent early warning signs of the disease (
 <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">Lechien et al., 2020</xref>). In a retrospective analysis of 214 COVID-19 patients admitted to three hospitals in Wuhan, China, neurological signs were observed in more than 36% of the cases (
 <xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2020</xref>). Although in the majority of cases these neurological symptoms were mild and consisted in headache, dizziness augeusia and hyposmia, altered consciousness or stroke also occurred (
 <xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">Mao et al., 2020</xref>). Additional reports documenting serious neurological complications in COVID-19 patients have been subsequently published. For instance, a severe encephalopathy with diffuse EEG slowing was described in a 74-year-old man presenting with altered mental status and later shown to be affected with COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Filatov et al., 2020</xref>). Altered mental status at presentation was also documented in a middle-aged female whose CT scan was diagnostic for acute hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE), a rare complication of influenza and other viral infections causing BBB breakdown but without direct viral invasion or parainfectious demyelination (intracranial cytokine storm) (
 <xref rid="bb0615" ref-type="bibr">Poyiadji et al., 2020</xref>). Seizures may occur at the time of COVID-19 onset as reported in a 24-year-old man with meningo-encephalitis found positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF but not in nasopharyngeal swabs, or may complicate the course of the disease (
 <xref rid="bb0690" ref-type="bibr">Sohal and Mossammat, 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">Moriguchi et al., 2020</xref>). Altered mental status and seizures have been also observed in COVID-19 patients showing demyelinating lesions of the brain and spinal cord resembling those observed in acute MHV infection (
 <xref rid="bb0880" ref-type="bibr">Zanin et al., 2020</xref>). It has also been hypothesized (but not formally proven) that SARS-CoV-2-induced acute encephalopathic damage of the brainstem respiratory centers may contribute to the respiratory failure observed in seriously affected COVID-19 patients (
