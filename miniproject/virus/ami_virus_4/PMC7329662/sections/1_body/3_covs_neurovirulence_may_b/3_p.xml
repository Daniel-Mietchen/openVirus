<p id="p0125">CoVs may also play a role in the genesis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), a monophasic autoimmune demyelinating disease usually occurring in children a few days after an infection or a vaccination (

 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 2019</xref>). The histopathological features of ADEM are similar to those observed in the subacute form of JHMV-induced encephalitis in rats, with perivascular sleeves of demyelination abundantly infiltrated by T cells but not by polymorphonucleates (

Intriguingly, a common laboratory finding in ADEM patients is the significant increase in CSF levels of several cytokines and chemokines, also including those induced upon CoV infection in experimental animals, such as IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α, CXCL9, and CXCL10 (
