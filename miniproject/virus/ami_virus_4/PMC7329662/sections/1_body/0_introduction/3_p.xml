<p id="p0010">Recent studies have shown that significant neurological signs and symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, and sensory disturbances, the most prominent being anosmia and ageusia, may occur in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that the neuroinvasive potential of CoVs might be responsible for at least part of these symptoms and may contribute to the respiratory failure observed in affected patients. Therefore, in the present manuscript, we have reviewed the available preclinical evidence on the mechanisms and consequences of the CoVs-induced CNS damage, and highlighted the potential role of CoVs in determining or aggravating acute and long-term neurological diseases in infected individuals. To this aim, we searched repositories of articles (PubMed;

In addition, clinical trial databases (

The screening of titles and abstracts was performed by all authors, and those considered relevant for the purpose of the present review were retrieved, analyzed, and their main findings reported in the present manuscript.
