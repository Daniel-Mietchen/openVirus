<p id="p0005">Coronaviruses (CoVs), a subfamily of RNA enveloped plus-strand viruses belonging to the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales,</italic> family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, have recently gained worldwide notoriety as the agents causing the ongoing Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, already responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths (

More than 50 different CoVs, classified into four genera (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-CoVs) on the basis of phylogenetic clustering (

 <xref rid="bb0765" ref-type="bibr">van der Hoek, 2007</xref>): two α-CoVs (HCoV-229E and -NL63) and two β-CoVs (HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1). At the beginning of the new millennium, three new β-CoVs highly pathogenic for humans, have been proven responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS; MERS-CoV) epidemics, and more recently for the COVID-19 pandemic (SARS-CoV-2). All three viruses are strictly related to CoVs infecting lower animal species from which they are believed to have originally spread (
