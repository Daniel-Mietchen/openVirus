<p id="p0020">As previously mentioned, CoVs responsible for dramatic outbreaks in humans in the last 20â€¯years probably originated from animal species and later spread to humans. It is therefore crucial to understand whether the neurovirulence of CoVs is species-specific. Even though available evidence is very limited, CoVs can easily adapt to infect brains from species different from their original hosts. In fact, neurotropic MHV may also induce encephalitis in rats (
