<p id="p0025">Different animal species including mice, ferrets, hamsters and monkeys have been infected with SARS-CoV; however, unlike the devastating human infection, these animals only developed a mild form of the disease (

The low virulence of SARS-CoV for C57BL/6 mice is believed to be a consequence of the low affinity of the virus (whose receptors are represented by human ACE2, see below) for murine ACE. In fact, a lethal infection was successfully induced when SARS-CoV was inoculated intranasally in transgenic mice overexpressing the human ACE2 enzyme (K18-hACE2 mice), with high viral titres in neurons of the cerebrum, thalamus, and brainstem, and relative sparing of the olfactory bulb and cerebellum (
