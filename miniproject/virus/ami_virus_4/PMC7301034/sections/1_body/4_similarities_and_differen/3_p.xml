<p>Similarities and differences between SARS, MERS, and COVID‐19 are tabulated hereunder (Table 
 <xref rid="ppul24810-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It is perhaps unnecessary to coin confusing and seemingly different acronyms for each of these recurring epidemics and coronaviruses.

 </xref> The virus for COVID‐19 could have been called CoV‐19, or the epidemic caused by SAR‐CoV2 as SARS‐19. Assuming the next CoV epidemic may recur every 8 years in 2027, the epidemic can be called COVID‐27 and the virus CoV‐27. They are often severe, always acute, and have pneumonia with respiratory tract symptoms among the more severe cases. In other words, severe acute respiratory syndromes presenting with severe acute respiratory symptoms are here to stay and they are just like SARS.
