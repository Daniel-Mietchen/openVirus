The fact that a significant number of patients with COVID‐19 are mildly symptomatic vs patients with SARS and MERS, with low mortality rates, reflects that SARS‐CoV‐2 resembles other common circulating respiratory viruses. However, the lack of any population immunity against SARS‐CoV‐2 gives it the ability to cause high attack rates, which can overwhelm and cripple healthcare systems if not managed carefully.
