<p>The syndrome approach (as in SARS) as opposed to disease approach (as in COVID) has its pros and cons (Table

 </xref> Health organizations and authorities should provide consistent definitions for index surveillance, epidemiological and prognostication studies, and refrain from the temptation of coining unnecessary new terminology to describe essentially the same conditions when outbreaks of severe respiratory infection occurs.

 </xref> History of travel or contact provide important clues to emerging infections as evidenced during coronavirus outbreaks in 2003 and 2012, swine influenza pandemic in 2009 as well as the avian influenza outbreak in 2013. In 2003, the WHO coined the term SARS for severe acute respiratory syndrome in patients with a relevant travel/contact history and pneumonia symptoms. Any patient in an epidemic area with fever and cough would be diagnosed as SARS by WHO definition in 2003. The clinical features are essentially the same as for any respiratory viral infections or pneumonitis. Toward the end of the 2003 epidemic, SARS‐CoV was identified to be the culprit. Subsequently, it was realized that the clinical features of many patients with laboratory SARS (confirmed by laboratory testing) were neither “severe” nor “respiratory” in nature. Nevertheless, imprecise definition carries serious public health implications as patients may be erroneously quarantined and cities stigmatized. Conceptually, we could think of the infections as a confluence of factors: pathogens (viral, bacterial); exposure (travel, contact history); vector (bat, camel); infectious status (exposed but not infected, asymptomatic carrier, infectious, disease); syndrome (during early phrase of disease as in SARS and MERS); and disease (during late stage when the process becomes apparent as in COVID‐19).
