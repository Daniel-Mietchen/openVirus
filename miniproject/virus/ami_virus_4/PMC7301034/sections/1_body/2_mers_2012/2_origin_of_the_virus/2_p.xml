<p>Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory infection caused by the MERS‐coronavirus (MERS‐CoV). Like SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV is a betacoronavirus likely derived from bats with camels as an intermediate host. A strain of MERS‐HCoV known as Erasmus Medical Center (EMC)/2012 that was isolated from an infected person in London in 2012 was found to have a 100% match to a virus that affected Egyptian tomb bats. Camels have been shown to have antibodies to MERS‐CoV, and are believed to be involved in its spread to humans but it is still unclear how and to what extend this contributed to the outbreak.
