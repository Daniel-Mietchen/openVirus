 </xref> On 22 September, 2012, the United Kingdom informed WHO of a case of “acute respiratory syndrome” with renal failure in a previously healthy, 49‐year‐old male Qatari national with travel history to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The Health Protection Agency confirmed the presence of a novel coronavirus (human betacoronavirus 2C). WHO coined the interim case definition of “severe respiratory disease associated with novel coronavirus” on 25 September, which was revised on 29 September to “Severe Acute Respiratory Infections associated with novel coronavirus infection” (SARI associated with nCoV). Notably, the definition of SARS for surveillance is not used, while the symptoms and viral etiology all fulfilled the SARS definition. The Department of Health in Hong Kong included “Severe Respiratory Disease associated with Novel Coronavirus" as a statutorily notifiable disease. Originally named “human coronavirus EMC/2012,” the virus was finally given the name Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV).
