<p>From September 2012 to January 2020, WHO has been informed of a total of 2519 laboratory‐confimed MERS cases globally, including 858 associated deaths (34.4% case‐fatality rate) from 27 countries. It is not known if this staggering mortality is related to elusive milder cases that had escaped identification. Cases of MERS mainly originated from countries in the Middle East and 84% of human cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia.

The largest outbreak outside Middle East occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015, resulting in 186 cases and 39 deaths.
