<p>The incubation period for SARS‐CoV is between 2 and 10 days with a mean of 5 days and up to 13 days, symptoms usually develop 2 to 10 days after the initial infection. The immune response includes immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to the SARS‐CoV—this peaks during the acute or early convalescent phase (week 3), and declines by week 12. IgG antibody is produced later and peaks at week 12.
