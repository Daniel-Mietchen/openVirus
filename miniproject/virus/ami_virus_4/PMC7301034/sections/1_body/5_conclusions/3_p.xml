<p>Lessons to learn in the past 17 years since the first SARS outbreak include: (a) coronavirus could cause a major global public health crisis every 8 to 9 years; (b) SARS, MERS, and COVID‐19 are overlapping syndromes that may be associated with severe ARDS and associated with different coronaviruses; (c) pediatric infection by novel coronaviruses is milder; and (d) treatment is primarily symptomatic in nature. At the time of writing, the most urgent issue at present is to control the COVID‐19 pandemic. Vaccination could be an answer to this crisis, but it is likely to take more than a year to develop and manufacture at scale for the worldwide population. As the global battle against the coronavirus continues, alertness in personal hygiene, mass mask‐wearing in the community, early prompt quarantine, vigilant contact tracing, surveillance program for testing suspected cases and measures to prevent healthcare related transmission are all the key factors to our success in the global management of coronavirus disease pandemic.</p>
