<p>This review compares three distinct entities sharing a commonality of a virus. The pediatrician's view is relief that children are globally far less affected by these infections, and the threat is predominantly that asymptomatic children may transmit the virus to vulnerable adults. The larger view, however, is that the current epidemic is by far more concerning in its impact on morbidity and mortality around the globe. It stands to reason that some of the pernicious profile of today's pandemic is related to delayed recognition of its magnitude and virulence that allowed for spread that went out of control starting in China and followed by the US. However, the disturbing questions about this apparent evolution from relatively small‐scale epidemics to a global pandemic are whether this has to do with a serendipitous evolution of a virus with inherently more potent infectivity and transmissibility, and if so what are the determinants of these characteristics. Whether beyond the virus there might be environmental changes that have occurred over the two‐decade history of these infections, that enhance its spread, such as rising temperatures, or other yet to be determined atmospheric changes. It is hoped that because of the devastation that COVID‐19 carries in its wake, large efforts will be invested in a search for answers to these questions, and with that, we will all be able to be wiser in dealing with the threats of the future. This will require the combined efforts of a global community, since the current events clearly manifested our interconnectedness and interdependence and hence shared vulnerability in the face of a calamity of previously unexperienced magnitude.</p>
