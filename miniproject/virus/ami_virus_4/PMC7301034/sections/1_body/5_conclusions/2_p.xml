<p>Apart from the epidemics and novelty of names, these coronavirus are similar in nature and not particularly novel in their clinical presentation. Lower prevalence of these coronavirus diseases in children might be explained by lower exposure in the pediatric population; and as the symptoms are less severe and can even be asymptomatic in children, some cases are not diagnosed. Research to compare the immunopathogenesis of children and adults in responding to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection might lead to discovery of the possible pathogenesis and treatment strategies for these “recurrent” novel coronavirus diseases. If the opportunity to study this is missed during this epidemic, we might need to wait for another few years before this mystery can be solved—the most vulnerable population of the society might be the answer to the treatment of coronavirus.</p>
