<p>Long‐term outcome for COVID‐19 patients is yet to be determined. The Guangdong Centre of Disease Control and Prevention reported that about 14% of recovered patients were tested postive for SARS‐CoV‐2 in follow‐up checks several weeks after discharge. This is deemed most likely due to residual RNA in clinical samples rather than reinfection.

 </xref> Given that a robust test has yet to be developed, speculations about results of the testing include false negativity at the time of discharge, inadequate specimen, less desirable site of specimen acquisition (eg, specimen taken from the throat vs the nasopharynx), testing discrepancies, new tests finding the virus in the lower respiratory tract, and reinfection.
