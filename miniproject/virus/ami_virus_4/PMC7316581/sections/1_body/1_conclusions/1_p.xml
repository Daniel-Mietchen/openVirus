<p id="Par17">Till date, the hotspots of COVID-19 have been more prevalent in the northern hemisphere with the worst affected countries being the United States (80 684 deaths), United Kingdom (32 141 deaths), Italy (30 739 deaths) and Spain (26 744 deaths) while in comparison, countries south of the equator have in general recorded fewer deaths (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It remains to be seen if COVID-19 will continue to spread unremittingly during summer in the northern hemisphere when environmental temperatures will start to rise, or whether the overall case numbers and mortalities in the warmer countries of the southern hemisphere will remain comparatively lower. The answers we seek may not be unconnected to the structural biology of SARS-CoV-2, especially as it relates to the transmission of this novel virus. More studies are required to identify and characterize the potential seasonality of COVID-19 cases as the current global pandemic continues to unfold.
