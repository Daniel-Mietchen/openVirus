<p id="Par15">The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of other coronaviruses and has four genes that encode the following structural proteins – the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N (nucleocapsid) proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The N protein encapsulates the RNA genome (GenBank accession number: MN908947) that measures 29 903 nt in length while the other proteins (the S, E, and M) together comprise the viral envelope [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The presence of a lipid bilayer envelope makes a majority of enveloped viruses to be susceptible to destruction upon exposure to dry heat, detergents and organic solvents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 may only survive outside host environments for a limited time and characteristically need to be transferred directly from one host to another to continue to survive. It is with the spike proteins that SARS-CoV-2 attaches and gains entry into human cells using specific receptors, especially the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the membrane surface of human cells, to which the higher affinity of the spike protein has been demonstrated [
