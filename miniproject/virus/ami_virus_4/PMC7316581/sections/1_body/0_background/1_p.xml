<p id="Par11">The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic and a threat to the public health systems across the world. Much about the dynamics of the transmission of the causative agent of COVID-19, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is still unknown. However, it has been established that SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped positive-sense single stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, the lipid bilayer within the cell membrane of enveloped viruses consists of cholesterols and phospholipids, and will only allow the virus to survive for a limited time outside the host cell environment. Hence, to survive, enveloped viruses need to be transferred directly from one host to another, as quickly as possible. A critical look at the epidemiology of some enveloped viruses will reveal the influence of seasons on their activities. The incidence of infections caused by enveloped viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is higher when environmental temperatures are lower but RSV and influenza virus cases are limited to the cold winter months while hMPV cases are seen throughout the year and peak in later winter and spring [

Based on the structural, biological and biochemical similarities of these ‘cold-season’ viruses and SARS-CoV-2, it could perhaps be the situation that the current rampant spread of COVID-19 cases will wane during summer months in the northern hemisphere when the weather becomes warmer. This report takes a critical look at the potential influence of weather conditions on the geographical distribution and transmission of COVID-19, amidst the consideration of other non-climatological factors.
