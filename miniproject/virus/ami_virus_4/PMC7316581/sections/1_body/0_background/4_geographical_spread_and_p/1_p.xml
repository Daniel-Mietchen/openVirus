<p id="Par16">COVID-19 cases have been reported in 208 countries/territories in six continents and caused over 285 760 deaths globally [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Cold temperatures favor the survival of cold viruses and reduce immunity in humans and animals by altering the cellular and molecular defenses against pathogens in the upper respiratory tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Some common colds experienced during winter and spring in countries of the northern hemisphere, are caused by viruses from the same family. Majority of these viruses are called cold-viruses and they have a cyclical pattern of occurrence in what is known as “flu season”. Flu viruses are widespread during the fall and winter months and peak between December and May [

It was recently reported that 70.2% of people that were positive for COVID-19 and as much as 79.4% of COVID-19 deaths throughout Italy occurred in the northern provinces namely Lombardi, Emilia Romagna, Veneto and Piemonte, the same areas from were the first cases of the disease were recorded in the country [

However, according to the report, the skewed distribution of COVID-19 mortalities in Italy was not due to the colder weather of the north alone but likely, an interplay of factors including “demographics and health, societal customs and epidemic-specific attitudes, environmental factors and administrative issues” [
