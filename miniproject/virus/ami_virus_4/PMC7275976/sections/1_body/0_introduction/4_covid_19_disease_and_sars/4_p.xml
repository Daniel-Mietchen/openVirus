 <italic>CoV2:</italic> SARS CoV2 shows some similarities with SARS CoV. SARS CoV originated in the Guangdong province of China in November 2002. Palm civets were identified as intermediary hosts for SARS CoV2 which contracted the virus from bats (Falsey and Walsh

SARS-CoV, however, was more `severe than COVID-19 and produced influenza-like symptoms in humans like fever, myalgia, headache, diarrhea, shivering, cough and shortness of breath. WHO described the epidemic as a serial killer that spanned from 16th November 2002 to 5th September 2003 affecting 8098 individuals in 26 different nations and causing death of 776 people (mortality rate of 9.6%) (WHO

In both cases, mutations have occured in the spike protein. This glycoprotein is important for the association of virus with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptors (ACE2) on cells of lung, intestine, liver, heart, vascular endothelium, testis, and kidney (Hamming et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2004</xref>). ACE2 is part of the ‘Renin–Angiotensin’ hormonal system of the body. Structural and biochemical studies conducted so far have shown that S protein of a SARS virus comprises of 2 functional subunits. (i) The S1 subunit or receptor binding domain is responsible for binding of virus to host cell receptor and (ii) S2 is responsible for fusion of virus with cellular membranes. Both sub-units are separated but remain non-covalently bonded in a ‘pre-fusion conformation’ stabilized by S1 (Andersen et al.
