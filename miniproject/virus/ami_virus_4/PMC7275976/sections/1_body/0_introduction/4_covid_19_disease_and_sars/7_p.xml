<p id="Par19">The mechanism of viral infection is still not complete and under study. So far, the data show that the activation of the virus occurs as it enters the host cell. During this time, a cleavage process occurs at polybasic (furin) cleavage site at S1–S2 boundary (formed by insertion of 12 nucleotides), which is followed by an irreversible conformational change. Through bioinformatics tool, researchers have identified the presence of a proline residue in the cleavage site and so the inserted sequence is “PRRA”. Presence of proline is predicted to cause addition of O-linked glycans to S673, T678 and S686 that margin the cleavage site and produce a mucin-like domain that can shield epitope or key residues of SARS-CoV2 spike protein (Andersen et al.

Previously it has been shown that in Avian influenza, the speedy replication and transmission of virus in high population of chicken ‘selects’ for attainment of polybasic cleavage sites in a protein called hemagglutinin or HA (immunodominant viral antigen of H5N1 virus). Such acquirement of polybasic cleavage sites in hemagglutinin (insertion or recombination) has been observed to convert low pathogenic viruses to very high pathogenic ones (Andersen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). HA has a similar function with the spike protein of SARS-CoV2 but whether a similar mechanism is operating in COVID-19 needs to be validated.
