 <italic>How did COVID</italic>-
 <italic>19 originate?</italic> The source of COVID-19 outbreak is yet to be determined. Although some preliminary investigations in China identified samples in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market of Wuhan city to be positive for SARS-CoV2, the zoonotic source of the outbreak is still ambiguous. All throughout the pandemic, it was argued by many researchers that bats which harbor a lot of viruses (
 <italic>but remain unaffected by these</italic>) are a reason for the COVID-19 outbreak. This was because some bats called ‘intermediate horseshoe bats’ (
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic>) of Rhinolophidae family (
 <italic>widespread in central China, Southeast Asia and Indian subcontinent)</italic> carry bat corona viruses called BatCoV RaTG13 (
 <italic>popular in Yunnan Province</italic>) with 96% whole genome similarity with SARS-CoV2 (Calisher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2006</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020</xref>). However, direct transmission of SARS-CoV2 from these bats was not considered as evidences from recent epidemics demonstrate that efficient human-to-human transmissibility while retaining high human pathogenicity is possible only with involvement of an intermediate host. According to the current evidence, virus isolated from Malayan Pangolins (
 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>) celled Pangolin-CoV has 91.02% and 90.55% genetic similarity to SARS-CoV2 and BatCoV RaTG13, respectively, and hence contemplated to be one of the natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV2 (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020</xref>).
