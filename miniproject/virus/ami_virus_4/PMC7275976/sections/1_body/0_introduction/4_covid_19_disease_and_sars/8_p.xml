<p id="Par20">We have also seen that for SARS-CoV, the evolutionary starting point (as evidenced by palm civets) was a prototype virus group with low-pathogenicity with 7 single-nucleotide variations (SNV) which caused 6 amino acid changes in the S protein. This group caused the early phase of the 2002–2003 epidemic. Later, further changes, i.e., 14 SNVs caused 11 amino acid residue changes that produced a “highly virulent group” which caused the middle phase of the epidemic of 2003. Thereafter, 6 SNVs caused four amino acid changes and brought about a group responsible for the late phase and the global epidemic. The neutral mutation rate of this virus during 2003 was almost constant, at around 8 × 10

 <sup>−1</sup>, which was the same with the most recognized RNA viruses. Afterwards, a second interspecies jump recorded in late 2003 to early 2004, caused resurgence SARS in China. This was, however, thought to be an independent interspecies transmission event, instead of residual cases of the major epidemic because the virus had lower affinity of virus for human ACE2 (Cheng et al.
