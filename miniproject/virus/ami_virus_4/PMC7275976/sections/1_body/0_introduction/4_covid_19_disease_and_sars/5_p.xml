<p id="Par10">Although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 viruses have been observed to infect host cells via same ACE receptor, there have been some differences noted like an increased affinity of the virus towards the receptor in SARS CoV2. This has been presumed to be due to a mutation, i.e., N501T in spike protein of SARS-CoV2 that has somehow increased the binding affinity of virus for ACE2 (Andersen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>). Very recent reports demonstrate that the S1 protein of Pangolin-CoV is similar to SARS CoV2 than RaTG13. There is evidence that 5 key amino acid residues in spike protein that are in interaction with human ACE2 are consistent between Pangolin and SARS-CoV2; while, only 4 amino acid mutations are present in RaTG13. Nonetheless, both Pangolin-CoV and RaTG12 have lost putative furin recognition at S1/S2 cleavage site that is seen in SARS CoV2 (Zhang et al.
