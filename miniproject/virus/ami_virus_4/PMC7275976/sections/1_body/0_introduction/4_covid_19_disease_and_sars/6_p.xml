     <italic>Entry of virus:</italic> Viral entry is a fine interplay between the virion and the host cell and is initiated by association of the viral particle with specific proteins on the host cell surface. Thereafter, the enveloped viruses fuse their envelope with the host cell membrane to deliver their nucleocapsid to the host cell. The S protein plays a dual role in this viral entry process by mediating receptor binding and membrane fusion, which involves large conformational changes of the S protein. During COVID-19, SARS-CoV2 S-protein binds to host cell’s receptor ACE2 (Belouzard et al.

     <italic>The activation of the virus:</italic> Endosomal pH acidification is a fusion trigger for corona viruses and those like SARS-CoV rely on endosomal proteases for productive entry. As virus enters the host cell, it moves through the early and late endosomes that have low pH. In ‘early’ endosome, host proteases like cathepsin L facilitates cleavage of S protein in the S1-S2 boundary region leading to fusion of the viral envelope. Enzyme digestion experiments have shown that first cleavage event at the S1–S2 boundary probably enables the second cleavage event at S2’ region, that is responsible for fusion activation. SARS-CoV spike protein also exhibits a certain degree of plasticity in the position of the cleavage site for priming of fusion SARS-CoV. In ‘late’ endosome, the viral genome with its nucleocapsid is released into the host cytoplasm (Cassell et al.

     <italic>Viral protein synthesis:</italic> ORF1a and ORF1b genes of viral genome produce two polyproteins (PPs) that are pp1a and pp1b which takeover host ribosomes for their own translation and replication. As ribosome machinery of the infected cells moves in favor of the virus, it synthesizes non-structural proteins (NSPs) for virus. These assemble into the replicase–transcriptase complex to support viral sub-genomic mRNA synthesis. NSP1 and NSP2 have specific functions such as suppression of host gene expression (Schoeman and Fielding

     <italic>Transport across ER and TGN (Trans</italic>-

     <italic>Assembly:</italic> Viral genomic RNA is then packed into the nucleocapsid and then envelope proteins are included during the budding step to form mature virions.

     <italic>Budding and exocytosis:</italic> Further after assembly, the virus particle comes out of the ERGIC via a bud-like structure.
