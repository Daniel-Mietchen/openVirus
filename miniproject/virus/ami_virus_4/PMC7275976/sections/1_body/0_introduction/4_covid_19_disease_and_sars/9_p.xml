<p id="Par21">What governs the affinity of a virus towards the human host cell? As for the case of SARS-CoV, it was shown that the binding specificity of virus to host cell was due to 3 prime amino acid residues in S1 protein at positions 360, 479, and 487. Interestingly, the patient samples in the 2003 epidemic had N479 and T487 in their S protein, while most civet samples had K/R479 and S487, which is a combination that reduces the affinity of virus for receptor. At the later stages of the epidemic (2003–2004), both the samples from humans and civet showed the presence of N479 and S487, signifying an intermediate stage of mutation of the S protein. Additional change to the N479 and T487 combination is believed have allowed competent human-to-human transmission. A different set of studies conducted using samples isolated from game animals (animals hunted for sports) from Guangdong also showed high nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV. These exhibited an insertion of 29-bp between
