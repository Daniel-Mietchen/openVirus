<p id="Par27">CQ and HCQ also have a track record of reducing over-production of cytokines during rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, and sarcoidosis (Rebecca et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2019</xref>; Schrezenmeier and Dörner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>). These immunomodulatory effects of CQ and HCQ need highlight since they may be useful for taming the cytokine storm in the COVID-19 scenario (Conti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). One of the proposed modulatory effect of HCQ is its ability to inhibit the activity of the nucleic acid sensor cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) by interfering with its binding to cytosolic DNA, and by stopping TLR signaling and cGAS–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling (Picot 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). At the cellular level, CQ and HCQ have been shown to inhibit immune activation by reducing signaling by Pattern Recognition Receptors (Toll-like receptor signaling) and cytokine production. Both CQ and HCQ reduce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and, in particular, TNF-α in macrophages. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the reduction in TNF-α by CQ and HCQ like (i) inhibition of TNF-α mRNA expression, (ii) inhibition in post-translational conversion of pro-TNFα to a soluble mature form, (iii) a pre-translational stage by a non-lysosomotropic mechanism and (iv) reduced surface expression of TNF-α receptors. Apart from TNF-α, CQ also suppresses cytokines like IL-1, IL-6 and IFNγ in mononuclear cells, again by modulating TLR (Totura et al.
