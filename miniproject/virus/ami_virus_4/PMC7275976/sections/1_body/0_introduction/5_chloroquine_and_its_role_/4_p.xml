<p id="Par25">Does CQ have anti-viral effects? Literature cites that CQ exerts effects against a battery of different virusesÂ such as flaviviruses, retroviruses and corona viruses. CQ and HCQ have demonstrated anti-viral potency against Herpes simplex virus type 1, Zika, HIV, MERS, SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, Chikungunya and Hepatitis C (Picot

Of the different mechanisms of anti-viral action known for CQ, the most intriguing one is its ability to inhibit viruses at the entry point of host cell which happens in the case of Borna disease virus, Minute virus of mice MVMp and the Avian leucosis virus (Savarino et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>). Once inside the cell, CQ works by inhibiting the replication of a virus by altering the pH of acidic organelles that are sites of viral DNA replication (Devaux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>). Apart from blocking viral entry and viral replication, CQ can also block the final packaging process in certain viruses. Eg, in the case of infection caused by enveloped viruses like Mayaro viruses, CQ administration causes accumulation of the base in endoplasmic and trans-golgi compartments of the cell. This affects the functioning of certain low pH-dependent proteases and glycosyl-transferases which are required for formation of viral envelopes (Savarino et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>). For non-infectious retrovirus particles, as shown with the Avian reticuloendotheliosis virus, CQ inhibits glycosylation of envelope glycoproteins (Savarino et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>). Again in the case of HIV, CQ reduces the production of the heavily glycosylated epitope 2G12, which is located on the gp120 envelope glycoprotein surface which is fundamental for virus infectivity. Again, these effects are likely to be attributed to the increased pH in trans-golgi network, which impairs the function of glycosyl-transferases involved in the post-translational processing of the HIV glycoproteins (Savarino et al.
