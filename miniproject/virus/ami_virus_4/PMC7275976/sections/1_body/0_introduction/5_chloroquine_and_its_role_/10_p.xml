 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>), which stated that in the current context of the severe worldwide health emergency, it is practical for clinicians to use HCQ even if it can only reduce viral load by 10–30%. They mentioned that these are effective measures in reducing COVID-19 spread and improving clinical outcome in health care workers. They have stated that HCQ at doses matching that of the standard treatment of Systemic Lupus erythematous [which has proven safety and efficacy in terms of HCQ blood and tissue concentration adapted to bodyweight at 6 mg/kg/day 1 (loading dose) followed by 5 mg/kg/day, with a maximum limit of 600 mg/day in all cases] can be used as a drug for exposed people. The duration of HCQ treatment can be as long as contact with a positive patient lasts. In the case of repeated exposure to virus, then treatment is suggested to be for a min of 10 days so that there is a steady state of drug concentration in blood (Picot
