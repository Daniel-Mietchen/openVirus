<p id="Par26">How effective can be CQ against SARS? In 2005, Nichol et al. reported the anti-viral effects against SARS-CoV infection in primate Vero E6 cells (derived from the African green monkey kidney) (Vincent et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2005</xref>). Thereafter, it was found that hydroxyl chloroquine (HCQ, which has 40% lesser adverse effects than CQ) has a better anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity than CQ in Vero cells (Dong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>; Liu et al. 2020; Wang and Cheng 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>). An interesting mode of action of both CQ and HCQ is their ability to inhibit binding of SARS-CoV-2 viral particles to ACE2 without affecting the cellular level of ACE2 expression. This was basically via an interference with the glycosylation on ACE2 receptor, which is required for ligand recognition. This was ensured via inhibition of an enzyme called quinone reductase-2 which is vital for biosynthesis of sialic acids and thereby glycosylation process. ACE2 when not in the glycosylated state is less efficient to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and is one of the best ways to inhibit viral entry (Vincent et al.
