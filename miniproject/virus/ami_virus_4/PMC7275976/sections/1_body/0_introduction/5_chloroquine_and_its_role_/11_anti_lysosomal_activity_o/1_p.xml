<p id="Par38">We also include in this article some details of our pilot study where we tested the effect of a combination of CQ (Sigma Aldrich, USA) and betulinic acid (Sigma Aldrich, USA) on lysosomal function in mononuclear cells, in the absence of a pathogen. BA (3β-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid) is a triterpenoid belonging to lupane series which has a wide range of pharmacological properties like topoisomerase inhibitory potential (Chowdhuri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>), anti-cancer (Ren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>), anti-malarial (de Sa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>), anti-viral (Pavlova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2003</xref>) and anti-inflammatory properties (Chowdhuri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>; Vijayan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2011</xref>). BA can be extracted from bark of birch tree and many other plant sources (Moghaddami and Ahmad 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>). Purified form of botanicals is a rich resource for novel antiviral drugs as these can interact with different stages of the viral life cycle, such as viral entry, replication, assembly, and release, as well as on the targeting of virus–host-specific interactions. CQ is itself a synthetic form of quinine isolated from barks of barks of cinchona trees native to Peru. So, it was of interest to check whether BA and CQ exerted an additive effect on lysosomal function. Briefly, mononuclear cells were isolated from healthy volunteers by density gradient centrifugation as detailed in Vijayan et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2011</xref>). Blood collected on heparinized tubes were loaded on Histopaque-1077 (Sigma Aldrich, USA) and centrifuged at 800 rpm for 30 min. The buffy coat layer at interface was retrieved and plated on type I collagen coated cell culture dishes containing RPMI-1640 media containing 10% FBS. After 4 h, the media were carefully changed to remove the floating lymphocytes. The adherent mononuclear cells were cell cultured till plate reached 75–80% confluency (2–3 days). Cells were then shifted to media with autologous serum and exposed to a standardized concentration of chloroquine (CQ, 2.5 micromolar) or betulinic acid (BA, 10 ng/ml) and a combination of both (CQ + BA). BA was pre-treated for 20 min prior to CQ addition that was for 4 h. β-hexosaminidase activity was determined in cell lysates by colorimetric assay as previously described by Lew and Rarrazzi (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1991</xref>). Lysed cell extracts prepared by repeated freeze–thaw cycles from basal, CQ-, BA- and CQ + BA-treated cell cultures were incubated with 
 <italic>p</italic>-Nitrophenyl-2-deoxy- β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucosaminide (5 mM) in 0.1-M citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 4.5 for 1 h. The 
 <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenol released by the enzyme-dependent hydrolysis of the substrate was quantified spectrophotometrically (Shimadzu, Japan) at 405-nm wavelength. Units of activity were defined as nanomoles of substrate per hour per mg protein. Results of the study demonstrate that a combination of BA and CQ has greater effect in reducing lysosomal activity as compared to CQ or BA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This is a pilot experiment conducted in the absence of a cargo. CQ is known for inhibiting autophagy by impairing autophagosome fusion with lysosomes rather than by affecting the acidity and/or degradative activity of this organelle (Mauthe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2018</xref>). So, the reason for reduction in activity of lysosome enzyme by CQ as seen in our pilot study requires investigation. We are assuming reduction in the count and activity of lysosomes with CQ exposure. But whether BA is potentiating the effect or not requires more sophisticated experimentations which is a futuristic aspect. We are hoping that if we can lower the dose of CQ by including BA, such combinational therapy can be considered for improving efficacy of treatment in conditions of pathogen overload.
