<p id="Par24">How does CQ help eliminate malarial parasite? During malaria, the malarial pathogen attacks red blood cell and degrades hemoglobin in vacuoles of the parasitic cell and acquires those amino acids for constructing its proteins and energy metabolism. CQ is basically a lysomotrophic agent and crosses plasma membrane and organelle membranes by simple diffusion process. Once inside the acidic organelles, CQ gets protonated and cannot leave the site by diffusion. CQ, therefore, gets concentrated in the acidic organelles herein the parasitic vacuoles, changing the pH and facilitating the formation of a complex of ‘heme and chloroquine’ that prevents parasites of Plasmodium genus from drawing nutrients from the red blood cell. CQ can be transported out of cells via a protein called multi-drug resistance protein or MRP-1, an ATP binding protein (Mejia et al.
