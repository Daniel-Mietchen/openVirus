<p id="Par5">CoVs mainly cause respiratory and intestinal infections with an array of clinical manifestations. So far, 7 CoVs have been identified that produce infections in humans. These are the α-type HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63; the β-type HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43; and 2019-nCoV (that caused the present pandemic).
