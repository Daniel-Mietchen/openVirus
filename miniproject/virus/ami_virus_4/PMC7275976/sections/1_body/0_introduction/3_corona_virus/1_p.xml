<p id="Par4">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of single-stranded RNA viruses belonging to a sub-family called Coronaviridae that together with Torovirinae form the Coronaviridae family of the Nidovirales order. These are the largest known RNA viruses with the potential to infect birds, humans and some other vertebrates. Although the first member of the coronavirus family was discovered in the 1930s, coronaviruses gained notoriety with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002–2003 (Belouzard et al.

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) have segregated CoVs into four genera, historically based on serological analysis and now on genetic studies: α, β, γ, and δ. These viruses are enveloped, spherical and distinct in appearance, as they possess club-shaped projections on their surface. The RNA genome of these viruses ranges from 26,000 to 32,000 bases (longest among RNA viruses). The genome is packed into a helical nucleocapsid surrounded by a host-derived lipid bilayer. RNA has a cap structure at the 5′ end and multiple poly (A) tail at the 3′ end. RNA is positive and, hence, can serve as messenger RNA (mRNA), allowing the translation of replicase/transcriptase and structural proteins. The replicase/transcriptase is composed of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs): ORF1a and ORF1b which encode 16 non-structural proteins and 4 classical structural proteins, viz. (i) spike protein (S), (ii) envelope protein (E), (iii) membrane protein (M), and (iv) nucleocapsid protein (N) (Lodish et al.

Modification in S protein alters cell and tissue tropism, association with other viral and host factors and changes in host pathogenicity (Belouzard et al.
