<p id="Par2">Viruses are submicroscopic infectious particles with the capacity to infect bacteria, algae, plants, animals and humans. These can be found in every ecosystem on earth. There are numerous different varieties of viruses and many are yet to be discovered. Viruses are different from other living organisms as these require a host cell to reproduce. When virus infects a host cell (or the virus enters a living organism), the host cell gets ‘enslaved’ to the virus and synthesizes thousands of identical copies of the original virus. Thereafter, the host cell dies in the process of releasing newly synthesized viral particles.</p>
