<p id="Par3"> A complete virus basically exists as ‘virions’ comprising of either DNA or RNA as genetic material encased in a protein or sometimes lipid coat. The genetic material may be single stranded or double stranded, linear or circular. The amount and arrangement of the genetic material and proteins determines the shape and sizes of the viruses. Viruses thus have complicated shapes ranging from helical to icosahedral forms. How a virus originated on earth is still a mystery and it has been thought that these were formed from DNA fragments that once escaped from a cell. With time, many viruses learned to evade host immune systems via efficient strategies producing diseases for both humans and animals. However, the last several years has witnessed a surge in many new viruses especially those from animals by a process called zoonosis. This basically occurred due to intrusion of human activity into wildlife habitats. An example of this is deforestation which led to changes in living habitat of bats, and infections from bats to other organisms like palm civets, pangolins, camels, horses which acted as intermediary hosts to infect humans. The increased world-wide travel is a reason that has accelerated the spread of viruses. For example, the Avian flu virus H5N1 was transported from Asia to Europe by migratory birds. The AIDS pandemic that was induced by human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) was originally a zoonotic transmission from monkeys to humans, followed by efficient further distribution within the human population (Modrow et al.
