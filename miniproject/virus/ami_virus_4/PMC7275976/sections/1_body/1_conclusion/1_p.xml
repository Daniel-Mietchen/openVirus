<p id="Par39">CQ has been in pharmaceutical industry for 50Â years now. It has low cost and is reasonably safe to use and widely available in countries where malaria is endemic, but CQ usage warrants frequent monitoring of physiological parameters to avoid any adverse effects. CQ has distinct ways of attacking a virus. CQ interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptor of SARS-CoV to block viral infection. CQ inhibits the quinone reductase-2, which is involved in sialic acid biosynthesis required for ligand recognition. CQ changes the pH of lysosomes and likely inhibits cathepsins that lead to the formation of the autophagosome which cleaves SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The potency of CQ can be increased when used with an anti-viral agent. The Government of India has put up a platform for identifying the use of botanicals to treat disorders. In that context, the effect of a botanical like betulinic acid was tested. This botanical has reported that anti-viral effect may aid to reduce the dose of CQ for prophylactic or therapeutic regimen. Pre-clinical and clinical studies are required to confirm this.</p>
