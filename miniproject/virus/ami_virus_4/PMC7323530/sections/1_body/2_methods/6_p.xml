<p>We used R version 3.6.1 (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>) to compute , the maximum likelihood estimate of β
 <italic>,</italic> and the expected imported-and-reported case count given high surveillance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We also computed the 95% prediction interval (PI) bounds under this model of high surveillance for all 194 locations of daily air travel volume (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). First, we generated a bootstrapped dataset by sampling 
 <italic>n</italic> locations with replacement among high surveillance locations. Then, we reestimated β by using the bootstrapped dataset. Finally, we simulated imported-and-reported case counts for all 194 locations under our model by using the estimate of β from the bootstrapped dataset. We repeated the 3 steps 50,000 times to generate 50,000 simulated imported-and-reported case counts for each of the locations computed to the lower and upper PI bounds (PI 2.5%–97.5%). We smoothed the 95% PI bounds by using ggplot2 in R (
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>8</italic>
 </xref>). We fit the imported-and-reported case counts of the 49 high surveillance locations to the model and plotted these alongside 145 locations with low surveillance capacity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). We noted some overlap between high and low surveillance locations (
