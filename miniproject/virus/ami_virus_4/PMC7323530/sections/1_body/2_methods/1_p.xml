<p> To identify locations reporting fewer than predicted imported SARS-CoV-2 infected cases, we fit a model to data from 49 locations outside mainland China that had a score of 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>49.2/100 (the 75th quantile) of the GHS Indexâ€™s category 2 (Early Detection and Reporting of Epidemics of Potential International Concern) (

We considered locations to be countries without taking any position on territorial claims. We performed a Poisson regression by using the cumulative number of imported-and-reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in these 49 countries and the estimated number of daily airline passengers from the Wuhan airport. We then compared predictions from this model with imported-and-reported cases across 194 locations from the GHS Index, excluding China as the epicenter of the outbreak.
