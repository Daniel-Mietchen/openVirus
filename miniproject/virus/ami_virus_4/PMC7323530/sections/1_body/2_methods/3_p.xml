<p>We obtained data on daily air travel from a network-based modeling study (S. Lai et al., unpub. data, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020479" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020479</ext-link>) that reported monthly air travel volume estimates for the 27 locations outside mainland China that are most connected to Wuhan. These estimates were calculated from International Air Travel Association data from February 2018, which includes direct and indirect flight itineraries from Wuhan. For these 27 locations, estimated air travel volumes are 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>6 passengers/day. We assumed that travel volumes for locations not among the most connected are censored by a detection limit. We used a common method of dealing with censored data from environmental sampling (
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>5</italic>
 </xref>), or metabolomics (
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>6</italic>
 </xref>), and set the daily air travel volume to half the minimum value. Therefore, we used 3 passengers/day for estimated travel volumes for the 167 locations from the GHS Index not listed by Lai et al. We tested the robustness of our results by using a set of alternative values of 0.1, 1, and 6 passengers/day for the censored data.
