<p>The model requires data on imported-and-reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, daily air travel volume, and surveillance capacity. We obtained data on imported-and-reported cases aggregated by destination from the World Health Organization technical report issued February 4, 2020 (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>3</italic>
 </xref>). We assumed a case count of 0 for locations not listed. We used February 4 as the cutoff for cumulative imported-and-reported case counts because exported cases from Hubei Province dropped rapidly after this date (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>3</italic>
 </xref>), likely because of travel restrictions for the province implement on January 23. We defined imported-and-reported cases as those with known travel history from China; of those, 83% had a travel history from Hubei Province and 17% traveled from unknown locations in China (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>3</italic>
 </xref>). We excluded reported cases likely caused by transmission outside of China or cases in which the transmission source was still under investigation (
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>3</italic>
 </xref>). In addition, we excluded Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan from our model because locally transmitted and imported cases were not disaggregated in these locations.
