<p>For our model, we assumed that the cumulative imported-and-reported case counts across 49 high surveillance locations follow a Poisson distribution from the beginning of the epidemic until February 4, 2020. Then the expected case count is linearly proportional to the daily air travel volume in the following formula (

 <italic>i</italic> denotes location, 
 <italic>C
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> denotes the imported-and-reported case count in a location, 
 <italic>λ
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> denotes the expected case count in a location, β denotes the regression coefficient, and 
 <italic>x
  <sub>i</sub>
 </italic> denotes the daily air travel volume from Wuhan to a location. The Poisson model assumes cases are independent and that the variance is equal to the expected case count. Imported-and-reported cases likely meet the independence assumption because the value excludes cases with local transmission. We also checked the robustness of our results by using an over dispersed model with a negative binomial likelihood. We computed the p value of the overdispersion parameter as shown in Gelman and Hill (
