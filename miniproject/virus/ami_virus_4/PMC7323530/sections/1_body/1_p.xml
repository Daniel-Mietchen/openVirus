<p>Most cases imported to other locations have been linked to recent travel history from China (

To prevent other cities and countries from becoming epicenters of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, substantial targeted public health interventions are required to detect cases and control local spread of the virus. We collected estimates of air travel volume from Wuhan to the 27 most connected locations outside of China from a total of 194 international destinations. We then identified 49 locations with high surveillance capacity according to the Global Health Security (GHS) Index (

 </xref>). We assumed these locations would have relatively high proficiency in detecting SARS-CoV-2 and reporting confirmed imported cases, which we refer to as imported-and-reported cases. We ran a generalized linear regression model on this subset of locations; based on this model fit, we generated predictions for all international locations. Using these predictions, we identified locations that might not be detecting imported cases.
