<p id="Par15">Our results may suggest the molecular mimicry between SARS-CoV-2 drug target protein sequences (spike and nucleocapsid) and human proteins. Our study will use immunoinformatics tools to identify the possible epitopes of spike and nucleocapsid proteins of SARS-CoV-2. These epitopes can be the ideal candidates to formulate the initial component to develop a therapy against COVID-19 either in the form of peptide and sera based vaccine, based on the selected antigenic determinants. However, our analysis will require several in vitro and in vivo validations before formulating the therapeutic products to resist COVID‚Äê19. Antibody binding activity of these motifs will be performed in vitro to evaluate the neutralization activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection or participate in the immunopathogenesis induced by SARS-CoV-2. Our studies on the mimicry motifs of S and N protein, may provide approaches to inhibit or disrupt the infection of SARS-CoV-2. The peptides selected from the study after testing for toxicity in vivo, can have wide range of applications- be made into vaccines or intranasal and inhalation formulations. Also, since these peptides are selected on the basis of their binding specificity to regions of the viral proteins that are highly conserved across various coronaviruses, the execution of such therapeutic approaches could lead to cross-protective antibody responses against future coronavirus epidemics and pandemics and help us be better prepared for the next novel coronavirus outbreak.</p>
