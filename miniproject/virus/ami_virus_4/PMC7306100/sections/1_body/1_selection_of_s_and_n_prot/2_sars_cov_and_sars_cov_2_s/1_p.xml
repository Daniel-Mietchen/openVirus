<p id="Par6">SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 89.8% sequence identity in their S protein S2 subunits, which mediate the membrane fusion process, and both of their S1 subunits utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) as the receptor to infect human cells (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>). Also, the ACE2-binding affinity of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in S1 subunit of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is 10- to 20-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV which may contribute to the higher infectivity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV (Wrapp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>). Sequence alignment studies also show that S2 subunits of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share consensus regions with 92.6% and 100% in HR1 and HR2 domains, respectively (Xia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). The presence of large amount of sequence identity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enables designing of vaccines which are not only cross-protective across a wide spectrum of betacoronavirusesÂ but also relatively resistant to the ongoing virus evolution.
