<p id="Par5">The nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the major structural proteins of the virus and is involved in the transcription and replication of viral RNA, packaging of the encapsidated genome into virions (Chang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>; Hurst et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2009</xref>) and interference with cell cycle processes of host cells. Moreover, in many coronaviruses, including SARS -CoV-2, the N protein has high immunogenic activity and is abundantly expressed during infection. Thus, both S and N proteins may be potential targets for design of peptide vaccines against COVID-19.
