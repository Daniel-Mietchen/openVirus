<p id="Par4">SARS-Co-V-2 possesses many druggable targets. Coronavirus entry into host cell is mediated by the transmembrane Spike (S) glycoprotein that forms homotrimers protruding from the viral surface (Tortorici and Veesler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>). S comprises two functional subunits responsible for binding to the host cell receptor (S
 <sub>1</sub> subunit) and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (S
 <sub>2</sub> subunit). SARS-CoV-2 and several SARS-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) interact directly with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via S to enter target cells (Song et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>; Ge et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>). As the coronavirus S glycoprotein is surface-exposed and mediates entry into host cells, it is the main target of neutralizing antibodies (Abs) upon infection and the focus of therapeutic and vaccine design. After binding of RBD in S1 subunit of S protein on the virion to the ACE2 receptor on the target cell, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and 2 (HR2) domains in its S2 subunit interact with each other to form a six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core, bringing viral and cellular membranes into close proximity for fusion and infection (Bosch et al.
