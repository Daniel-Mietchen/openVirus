<p id="Par14">The above step will help to identify the region of viral proteins (S and N) that are homologous to human protein which will be shortlisted based on the score. The peptides which display high immunogenicity, location on the protein surface and low hydrophobicity are to be selected, following which these peptides will be synthesized and tested by ELISA for binding to antibodies present in the convalescent plasma of COVID 19 patients. This is in line with the theory that the simplest and most direct approach to combating SARS-CoV-2 during the outbreak would be to use plasma from the convalescent patients (Kruse 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). Patients who have been diagnosed with the disease, ascertained by RT-PCR and who are in their convalescent stage (&gt; 20 days of incubation) should be selected for the study. The peptides which show good amount of binding and with negligible auto immune response can be selected for the design of peptide vaccines. Table
