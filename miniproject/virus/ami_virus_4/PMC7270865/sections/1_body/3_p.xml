<p id="par0020">There is now evidence that such health crises are to resurge periodically: what about preparedness plans? Plans would address public health issues but also anthropological, sociological, ethical and philosophical questions (and perhaps legal ones). Plans would prepare the question of the collection, process and application of substances of human origin, of which blood and blood components. The “next one” may associate stringent viremia at the onset of the contamination and ahead the patient becomes symptomatic, if he/she becomes symptomatic. Pathogen inactivation/reduction technologies have been designed largely on this hypothesis, but run late in terms of clinical trials (for whole blood and red blood cell concentrate) to verify the absence of unacceptable complications, and public decision making to allow budgets and afford expenses. Would expenses be mitigated by the maintenance of blood transfusion as a service to populations in need, provided that the inventory is maintained thanks to sufficient blood donors capable of running to blood establishments?</p>
