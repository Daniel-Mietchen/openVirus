<p id="par0005">Nearly, the entire world has been struck by the SARS-CoV-2 emergent virus that spread from China late in 2019 to all continents, and particularly, to Europe on early 2020. This virus causes a disease termed COVID-19 in an enormous number of persons, a large number of whom suffer severe pulmonary lesions (ARDS) and many of them dye. It is far too early at the time of this Editorial to state about the severity of this pandemics compared to previous ones, e.g., the 1918 Spanish flu 
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, or the 1957â€“1958 flu 
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, or to the extreme heat wave during summer 2003 that killed about 70,000 aged people in Europe 
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>; however, questions arise, one of them is: Were we prepared and, before hands, could such a viral pandemic be anticipated 
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>? The globalization has called for years attention to emergent and reemergent infections, and the recent years or decades have seen the spread out of SARS-Cov-1, MERS-CoV, West Nile Virus, Chikungunya, H1N1 influenza strain, Zika virus, and the reinforcement of the Dengue viruses 
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>; all killed in affected areas and some threatened public health systems in certain countries. Ebola virus has not trespassed West African countries borders and has disorganized the developing public health management in those areas 
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Preparedness was called out by medical doctors and scientist, fearing that some additional threat might come 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It came.
