<p>Yet adaptive science, as we see it, does not assume a linear iterative progression towards an ever more ‘accurate’ or ‘valid’ correspondence with a pre-existing reality or context. Rather than promising to converge on a ‘single point’ of evidence through iteration, models in adaptive science can be treated as forms of 
 <italic>deliberation</italic> to deepen understandings of interventions as contingent local concerns rather than as fixed globalised facts.
 <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> Viewed in this way, models enhance the capacity of knowledge to translate across boundaries, such as when science translates into policy and when global strategies are tweaked into local actions.
 <xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref> The model, precisely because it has latitude as a space of triangulation and speculation, potentiates a working relationship, in which dialogue is made possible.
 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61 68</xref> A more open approach to triangulation reveals the multiple situated versions, indeed ‘models’, of pandemics-in-context which are at play, and made-to-matter, in any given moment.
