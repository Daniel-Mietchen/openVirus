<p>A core challenge in novel viral outbreaks and emergencies is how to act in an evolving situation of complexity and need. Emergency situations make it all the more apparent that evidence is uncertain, and that outcomes are without guarantee.
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This troubles the ‘business-as-usual’ of evidence-based intervention which assumes an ideal of ‘definitive information’ through empirical verification.
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> ‘Evidence-based’ approaches imagine that interventions, once tested and verified, will translate into new contexts and with similar effects.
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Pandemics are evolving situations of complexity which challenge assumptions that evidence can be held apart from the contexts in which it is made and put-to-use, making more obvious the situated nature of intervention outcomes, and the need for adaptive modes of evidencing and intervening.
