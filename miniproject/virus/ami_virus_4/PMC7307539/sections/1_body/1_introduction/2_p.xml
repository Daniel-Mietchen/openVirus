<p>A commentary in 
 <italic>BMJ Global Health</italic> also focuses on the ‘limits’ of pandemic models.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Richardson draws attention to how social and policy contexts shape how evidence is produced and put-to-use, arguing that models are ‘merely fables’ which reproduce prevailing narratives of global concern. Rather than treated simply as an evidence-based method of forecast or prediction, the model is here configured as a form of ‘biopower’ in the extension of global health responses.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Richardson argues that models reproduce dominant social and economic relations, and are in ‘clear need of decolonising’.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Whereas Sridhar and Majumder idealise a better evidenced model to progress towards a more ‘definitive’ knowledge, Richardson prompts us to reflect on the governing potentials of models as ‘evidence-making interventions’.
