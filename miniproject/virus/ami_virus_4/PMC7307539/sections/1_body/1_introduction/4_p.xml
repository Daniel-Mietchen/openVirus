<p>In this analysis, we draw on the cases of Ebola and influenza to consider lessons for the modelling of COVID-19 (See Summary box). Drawing on sociological and anthropological research, we trace how models can be investigated as matters of ‘correspondence’ and ‘enactment’ in relation to their social and policy contexts.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> While there is a tendency to concentrate on pandemic models as matters of ‘evidence-based’ concern, to ‘better evidence’ models towards greater precision and certainty,
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> our analysis treats the model as an emergent ‘evidence-making intervention’ which not only reproduces but enacts pandemics in context.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This helps to consider models as an element of adaptive evidence making, not only when intervening in pandemic emergencies but in the everyday, allowing for policy decision making that is responsive to evolving situations of complexity.
