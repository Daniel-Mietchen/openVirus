<p>Responding in pandemics not only demands the speeding-up of science, but requires evidence making that can adapt to evolving situations of complexity.
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In these situations, it is all the more apparent that evidence is uncertain, and that the outcomes of policy decisions and intervention are without guarantee. Global health emergencies therefore draw attention to the limits of ‘evidence-based’ intervention approaches. These idealise the translation of controlled interventions on the basis of seemingly unambiguous evidence verified through empirical observation and testing over time.
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Outbreak science adapts to the emergency situation in a rapid assessment approach where evidence-making and decision-making emerge simultaneously, through triangulation, iteration and dialogue.
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the presence of uncertainty, mathematical models offer a bridge to ‘knowing’ by generating scenarios to enable rapid policy decisions.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref> As elements in global pandemic preparedness and response, models are deployed to imagine futures of unprecedented disease which cannot be known.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Projections thus afford biosecurity through calculus, by anticipating unknowns, and ‘dis-ease’, into a governable present.
