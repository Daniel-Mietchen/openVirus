<p>This reminds us that scientific calculus is never separate to, but a constitutive element in the making of, context.

 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43 48</xref> The globalising narrative that people mistrusted and avoided internationally supported interventions because ‘they did not believe that Ebola was real’ is traced to epidemiological research published in the 
 <italic>Lancet Infectious Diseases</italic>,
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> which was then translated locally, including through media stories, among people with Ebola to reinforce the sense that transmission resulted from their ‘false beliefs’. The circulating narrative of ‘evidence-based’ mistrust, with its particular causal logic of individual responsibility, silenced alternative narratives of the historical and political hinterland of DRC which materialised mistrust as a matter of postcolonial concern. We have then, different ‘models’ of emergent causation, with different cultural and epidemic logics, which a critical social science helps to notice. The implication is that models can be done 
 <italic>differently</italic>, so that they attune as matters of 
 <italic>becoming</italic>. In the case of DRC, for instance, models can adapt emergent causations of mistrust to incorporate measures of structural effect linked to global health, corporate and institutional actors and not only affected individuals.
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> In an adaptive science approach, the model becomes a speculative intervention of ‘epistemic reconstitution’
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>; that is, an evidence-making event which generates an ontological change.
