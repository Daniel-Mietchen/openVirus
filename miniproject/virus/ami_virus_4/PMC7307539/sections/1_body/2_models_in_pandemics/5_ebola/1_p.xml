<p>In keeping with global pandemic response strategies, underwritten in WHO guidance, responses to Ebola outbreaks have been rooted in strategies of ‘control at source’ through ‘containment’.
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Mathematical models have accentuated containment through isolation, quarantine and safe burial.
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 18</xref> For instance, models projected the isolation of at least 70% of people with Ebola within 3 days of their becoming symptomatic as a critical threshold in reducing R
 <sub>0</sub> to 1
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> (the point at which the basic reproduction number, R
 <sub>0</sub>, indicates the force of transmission potential is neither increasing or decreasing). Yet, attempts to implement containment have revealed the basis of such assumptions as 
 <italic>detached</italic> from local cultural logics and concerns.
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 33</xref> Far from smooth, the implementation of containment efforts entangled as sites of miscommunication, mistrust, disrespect and symbolic violence, fuelling resistance in towns and villages.
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32–35</xref> Efforts to separate caregivers from their dead and to conduct burials through cremation met with particular resistance.
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32 36</xref> Household quarantine, and isolating people at risk to holding centres, inflicted profound social and economic harms in some places, including deaths linked to reduced access to food and medicines.
