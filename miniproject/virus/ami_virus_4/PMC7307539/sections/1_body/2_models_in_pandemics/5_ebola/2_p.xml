<p>Pandemic models tend to assume an undifferentiated smooth implementation of containment interventions, making little or no incorporation of ‘setting’.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 19 30</xref> Yet, Ebola responses vary from place to place as an effect of how public authority in relation to care and burials emerge through negotiations locally.
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Few models have incorporated the transmission impacts of contacts with the deceased,
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> a practice embedded in cultural logics of care and dignity.
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref> Projections of transmission have overlooked local variation in the composition and dynamics of households.
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Case projections have been overestimated because community-based protective actions have been underestimated.
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Projections of containment based on hospital isolations, for example, led to large investments in upscaling hospital beds when these were not required by the time they were built given community responses.
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> At the same time, global pandemic preparedness models emphasised investing in vaccines which only materialised at the tail end of epidemics, in some cases diverting investment from hospital care.
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Taken together, there is ‘social science intelligence’
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> that is ‘rarely integrated into supremely important epidemiological projections’,
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> including because it is ‘declared too difficult to model’.
