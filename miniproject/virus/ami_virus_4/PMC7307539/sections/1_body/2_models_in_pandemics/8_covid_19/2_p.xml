<p>Unlike previous pandemics, the performativity of COVID-19 models is expanded by the intensity and scale of public and media engagement with projections and metrics.
 <xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Controversy linked to shifting national policies based on emergent modelled scenarios of ‘herd immunity’ (viral mitigation) and ‘lockdown’ (viral suppression) have enacted the mathematical model, its adaptations, and the logics and science of these, as sites of public trouble.
 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> There is ongoing public deliberation in some settings about trusting generalised projections made in the absence of empirical data, especially that derived from community testing initiatives.
 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Sociological studies have sought to ‘follow the numbers’ of COVID-19 models as they travel in policy and public communication to investigate how projections ‘go public’ as sites of social concern.
 <xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Here, the model is not treated as if separate from society, as if 
 <italic>facts</italic> can be isolated from 
 <italic>concerns</italic>, but is understood as 
 <italic>made-to-matter</italic> in the local of the everyday. The ‘domestication’ of the mathematical model and citizen engagement in modelling science precipitated by COVID-19 potentiates the model as a site of deliberative intervention in evidence-making incorporating multiple forms of expertise.
