<p>The uncertainty of the unfolding H1N1 pandemic reproduces the global policy response narrative of WHO, which theorises a threat of unknown massive potential, justifying a precautionary response.
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> A ‘plausible uncertainty’

 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> are key elements in the performance of pandemic preparedness. In the making of H1N1 pandemic, the WHO enacted the pathogen as an unpredictable danger (‘The virus writes the rules on this one’
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>; ‘History has told us that these viruses are very, very, very unpredictable’
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Crucially, the uncertainty of scientific projections performed the basis for global policies of precaution. As has been noted: ‘The WHO’s narration of risk in respect to the H1N1 pandemic accommodated scientific uncertainty by resting on an appeal to (rather than an erasure of) uncertainty as the basis of risk’.
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> Rather than present the science 
 <italic>as if</italic> certain, WHO accentuated its contingency as a feature of the unknowability of pandemic threat. We see here, a pattern across viral outbreaks—from Ebola to influenza—where the pandemic model performs a qualitative scenario of generalised threat rather than predicts with local precision.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In the end, the projections driving H1N1 pandemic preparedness, which accentuated the urgent need for the stockpiling of (partially effective) antiviral pharmaceuticals, overestimated the ‘pandemic’ and its harms, even to the extent that the WHO was accused of ‘faking’ these to boost industry profits.
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Models, as with any evidence-making intervention, are calculative machines of
