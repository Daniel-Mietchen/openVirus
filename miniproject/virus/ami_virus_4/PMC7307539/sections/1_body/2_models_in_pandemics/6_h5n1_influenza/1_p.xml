<p>Influenza outbreaks further illustrate that mathematical models are not mere devices of correspondence in relation to contexts, be these local or global, but are modes of enactment which perform a pandemic in context. Anthropological studies of the mathematical models
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> which shaped WHO responses to the H5N1 avian influenza outbreak, which emerged in Thailand in 2003, have noted various ‘questionable assumptions’ due to ‘limited data’ which led to massive overestimates of the antiviral pharmaceuticals needed for global stockpiling.
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The heterogeneous data inputs combined in these models included, for instance, age-specific attack rates ‘from 1957 data in Sheffield, UK’ and ‘incubation times from a study of infection on an aeroplane’.
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The models assumed that households were ‘randomly distributed’, thereby ‘ignoring any social dynamics in rural village settings’, and introduced ‘no changes in behaviour as the pandemic accelerated’, while also assuming that population and quarantine restrictions ‘would work smoothly’.
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Although detached from local implementation contexts, the model was presented as ‘valid’ for ‘Southeast Asia’, with ‘the potential to prevent millions of deaths’.
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The model attaches in a network of practices to enact a global narrative of pandemic threat of great magnitude, where the ‘costs of failure’ are projected as ‘so catastrophic’ that it is ‘mperative to ensure that containment is given the best possible chance of success’.
