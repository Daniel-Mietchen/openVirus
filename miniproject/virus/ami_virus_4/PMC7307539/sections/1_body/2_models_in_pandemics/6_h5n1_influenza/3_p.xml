<p>As it turned out, in the case of H5N1, there was to be no ‘pandemic’ as feared, and massive stockpiles of antiviral pharmaceuticals went largely unused. Yet, our point is that models enact pandemics even before their arrival is ‘known’. Our example here draws on an ethnographic analysis of pandemic preparedness in Israel.
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Working with different pandemic outcomes projected by the higher (45 000 deaths predicted) and lower (6000 deaths predicted) bounds of 1918 and 1957 past pandemics, the Ministry of Health of Israel ordered, in 2007, a policy of ‘full preparedness’ based on an intermediate ‘attribution scenario’ (assuming 30 000 deaths).
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Importantly, such modelled scenarios are ‘treated as real’,
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> and become materialised in the present through policy and other actions. Projections 
 <italic>actualise</italic> pandemics in the here-and-now, even if the pandemic event is yet-to-come.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Pandemic models thus work as performative devices to ‘make-up’ pandemic possibility and context.
