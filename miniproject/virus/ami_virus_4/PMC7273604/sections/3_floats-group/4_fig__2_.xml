  <p>Agarose gel electrophoresis of the amplification products of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) ribonucleic acid (RNA). Line M: pUC Mix Marker 8, (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania); Lines 1–7: the milk of a persistently infected (PI) cow from Farm No. 1; Line 8–14: the milk of a PI cow from Farm No. 2; Line 15: the negative control (i.e., commercial fetal bovine serum); Line 16: the BVDV positive control (i.e., BVDV-1a nose strain). As for the dilution ratio, lane 1 and 8 is 1:1, lane 2 and 9 is 1:10, lane 3 and 10 is 1:100, lane 4 and 11 is 1:200, lane 5 and 12 is 1:400, lane 6 and 13 is 1:800, and lane 7 and 14 is 1:1,600. bp=base-pair.</p>
