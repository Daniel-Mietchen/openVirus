<p>In consideration of the more effective and rapid assessment of BVDV status in dairy herds, we focused on screening for BVDV in milk tanker samples. The milk tanker samples, which include commingled milk collected from several dairy farms, are often used to detect antibiotics to prevent them from getting mixed into the plant [

 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Milk tanker samples save the labor involved in sampling bulk tank milk or serums on each dairy farm. Therefore, the milk tanker samples have the potential to screen BVDV from cattle on several dairy farms simultaneously. However, whether milk tanker samples are sufficiently sensitive to identify PI animals among dairy herds has not been fully studied. Our objective was to provide a screening scheme of PI cattle in dairy herds by combining RT-PCR to detect BVDV in milk tanker samples and commercial ELISA to detect BVDV antibodies in bulk tank milk samples. By using these methods, we conducted a pilot survey and regional survey that targeted all dairy farms in Ibaraki Prefecture in eastern Japan, and we investigated the feasibility of using milk tanker samples and bulk tank milk samples for efficiently detecting PI cattle.
