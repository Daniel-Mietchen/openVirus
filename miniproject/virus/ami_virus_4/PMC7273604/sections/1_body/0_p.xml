<p>Bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) is a chronic infectious disease in cattle caused by infection with the BVD virus (BVDV) [
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It results in significant economic losses to the cattle industry worldwide [

 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Clinical signs are frequently fever approximately 6–9 days postinfection, inappetence, and mucosal lesions; however, most cases of BVDV infection are subclinical in susceptible nonpregnant cows [
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. If clinical signs are severe, acute BVD infection may be followed by reproductive disorders immediately or shortly after seroconversion because of the general condition of the cow [
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Moreover, transplacental infection can cause fetal death and abortion, significant fetal abnormalities [
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], or the birth of persistently infected (PI) calves [
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. BVDV can be transmitted to the fetus in pregnant cattle during days 40–120 of gestation, and thereby induces fetal immune tolerance to BVDV and results in the delivery of PI calves [
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The PI calves continuously excrete large amounts of virus throughout their lives, show few symptoms, and are a continual source of infection in a herd [

 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, they are at risk of developing fatal mucosal disease [
