 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Figure 3</xref> shows the results of BVDV antibody detection by using ELISA on the sera and individual milk on two farms with PI cattle: Farm No. 1, which kept 120 adult cows, and Farm No. 5, which kept 48 adult cows. On Farm No. 1, a PI cow was kept between October 25, 2013 and October 24, 2016, and 120 (100%) sera samples and 26 (22%) milk samples of 120 samples, respectively, were positive after the PI cow was culled. In re-testing after two months, among 19 milk samples collected from antibody-positive lactating cows, eight samples were positive. On Farm No. 5, a PI cow was kept between February 11 and October 28, 2017, and 45 (95%) sera samples and 18 (38%) milk samples of 48 samples were positive after the PI calves were culled. Two months later, 29 of 51 milk samples were positive.
