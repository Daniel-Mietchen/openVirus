<p>The PI cattle raised on Farm No. 2 was detected in the regional survey, but not in the pilot survey. Because this cattle was introduced to the farm on Sept. 13, 2016 in a pregnant state before giving birth, it was not detected in the pilot survey on Sept. 18, 2016. On Farm No. 4, a PI calf was detected in the follow-up test. In addition, in the regional survey using bulk tank milk, one farm (Farm No. 5) among 12 antibody-positive farms was identified as having PI cattle, and three PI calves were detected. The two PI calves raised on Farm No. 5 were born on February 11, 2017 and February 12, 2017. The two PI calves were born from dams that were pregnant with PI fetuses that returned from summer pasturing in Hokkaido.</p>
