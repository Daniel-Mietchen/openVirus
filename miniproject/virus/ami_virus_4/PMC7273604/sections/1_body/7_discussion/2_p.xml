<p>The 324–326 primer pair was used to screen for BVDV in the milk samples in this study. This primer pair has been shown to be reliable, and is widely used to detect BVDV, including new genotypes identified in a recent report [
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. A previous study reported that the UTR1-UTR2 primer pair has a higher detection sensitivity than 324–326 primer pair for detecting the BVDV gene in bulk tank milk [
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, that study detected BVDV in acutely infected cattle, rather than PI cattle, among the parts of farms with BVDV-positive in bulk tank milk. This may explain the difference in the detection sensitivity of these primer pairs. Although the primer pair used in our study may be inappropriate to detect the viral gene excreted by acutely infected cattle, these cattle can be followed up by antibody testing of bulk tank milk. Further, no acute infection cases were observed during the study period. Thus, we believe that the primer pair used in the present study did not affect the detection accuracy in PI cows.
