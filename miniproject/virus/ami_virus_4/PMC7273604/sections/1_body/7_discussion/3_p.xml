<p>The commercial BVDV antibody ELISA kit used in this study sufficiently detected BVDV antibodies in individual milk samples collected from two farms with PI cattle. Immediately after removing the last PI cattle, the overall prevalence, based on individual milk samples, was 22% and 38% in the lactating herd on each farm, respectively. In immunologically naïve herds, the presence of a single antibody-positive animal (especially in an animal carrying a PI fetus) could make the bulk tank milk test result positive, even in herds with up to 250–500 cows [

A more important finding is that antibody detection in bulk tank milk is suitable as a herd test for the presence of PI calves and PI cows, and can compensate for the disadvantage of RT-PCR assay in bulk tank milk. However, among 12 farms in which antibody was detected in bulk tank milk, only one farm kept PI calves and four farms had kept PI cattle in the past, whereas seven of 12 farms did not keep PI cattle. Many false-positive results in bulk tank milk predictions of the presence of PI animals are attributable to the high prevalence of seropositive animals in herds from which PI animals had recently been removed [
