<p>In the regional survey, approximately 4% of the dairy farms in Ibaraki Prefecture had anti-BVDV antibodies in bulk tank milk. To some extent, the BVDV prevalence was relatively low, compared to the national level prevalence of 7.6% (95%CI, 3.1–16.4%) [

 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] on BVDV infections and its control, the annual incidence risk at the herd level varies between countries and regions, and has consequently been estimated to range from 8% to 48% under endemic conditions. In areas with a systematic control of the infection, reports indicate decreasing risk and levels of approximately 2–3% after 4–5 years of implementation [

 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], Finland [
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Denmark [
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], based on national programs for the control and eradication of BVDV.
