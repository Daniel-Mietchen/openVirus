<p>This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of using milk tanker samples and bulk tank milk samples to efficiently screen PI cattle in dairy herds. When using RT-PCR assay, BVDV was detected in milk samples from milk tankers with a maximum capacity exceeding 10 t, if the tanker contained milk from a lactating PI cow. Although the milk tanker samples were mixed with a large amount of milk collected from several farms, no false-negative results were observed in this study. Moreover, RT-PCR assay successfully detected BVDV at dilutions of 1:1,600 when using PI cowsâ€™ milk. To verify that the use of PBS as a diluent did not affect the detection sensitivity, the authors compared it with samples diluted with bulk tank milk from a BVDV-free herd, and confirmed no difference between these dilute solutions (data not shown). These results suggested that RT-PCR assay of a milk tanker sample has the potential to detect BVDV in a total volume of 16 t of pooled milk containing at least 10 kg/day of the milk of an individual PI cow. The detection of BVDV in milk tanker samples is an efficient and economical diagnostic tool because the number of PCR runs when using milk tanker samples is approximately one-fourth the number when using bulk tank milk samples from all dairy farms in a prefecture. However, a disadvantage of testing only for the virus in milk samples is that it does not fully screen for the presence of BVDV because PI animals are likely to be among the young stock rather than among the lactating herd [
