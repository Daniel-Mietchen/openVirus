<p>In nonvaccinated herds, bulk tank milk samples can be used to test for BVDV-specific antibodies because vaccination may interfere with bulk tank milk testing. In Ibaraki Prefecture, BVDV vaccines (including live and inactivated vaccine) are not used for cows on most of the dairy farms, except for several large-sized farms. Therefore, bulk tank milk testing is a useful method for continuous monitoring to confirm BVDV infection-free status. However, the areas where vaccination has been used for systematic BVDV control require another approach to testing of herds because the results for bulk tank milk samples are not necessarily indicative of a herdâ€™s BVDV infection status. One example of antibody detection is that the testing of milk samples for antibodies to NS3 is suitable for differentiating between animals vaccinated against BVDV and animals infected with a field virus [
