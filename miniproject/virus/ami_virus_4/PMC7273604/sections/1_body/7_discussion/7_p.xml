<p>The regional survey used in the study revealed the current prevalence of PI cattle. However, a continuous screening test is required to ascertain the effect of control measures against BVDV. To identify and cull PI animals introduced during an early stage and to prevent a new PI calf outbreak on farms in Ibaraki Prefecture, maintaining a low prevalence of PI cattle in this region is essential by repeating this screening scheme with as short an interval as possible. In conclusion, combining antibody testing of bulk tank milk to confirm the infection-free status and screening tests on milk tanker samples to classify and identify infected herds is feasible and economical.</p>
