<p>To compensate for the disadvantages of each diagnostic technique for detecting BVDV, various herd-level diagnostic tools such as antibody detection in bulk tank milk and BVDV detection in milk tanker samples need to be combined appropriately to obtain effective strategies at low cost. We demonstrated that the BVDV screening scheme shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref> is useful with the aim of efficiently identifying and removing PI animals. As a result of the regional survey, which is based on this screening scheme, seven head of PI cattle, which consisted of three cows and four calves on four farms, were identified and culled. The remaining 336 farms did not have BVDVs and antibodies detected in the bulk tank milk. The movement of cattle such as for animal trade and summer pasturing are particular epidemiological risk factors associated with the introduction of PI cattle, which are the source of infection for dairy herds [
