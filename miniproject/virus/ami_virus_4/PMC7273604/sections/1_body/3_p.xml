<p>In Nordic countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland where BVDV vaccines are not used in BVDV control programs, antibody detection in bulk tank milk by using indirect or blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) has been used as a diagnostic tool for monitoring the BVDV infection-free status [

 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] revealed that PI animals were found only among young stock, and that PCR analysis of bulk tank milk was therefore unsuitable to test a herd for the presence of PI animals. Furthermore, they stated that, because of the high sensitivity and low specificity of bulk tank milk antibody testing, this method identifies nearly all true-positive herds, but tends to produce a certain number of false-positive herds [
