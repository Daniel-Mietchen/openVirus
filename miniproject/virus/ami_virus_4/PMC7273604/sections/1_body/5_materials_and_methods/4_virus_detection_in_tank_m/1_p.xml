<p>Viral RNA was extracted from the pelleted cells recovered from milk by using fully automated instrumentation with an in-tip nucleic acid extractor (magLEAD 12gC; Precision System Science Co., Chiba, Japan). The RT-PCR assay was conducted as follows. Published primer sequences (primer pair 324 and 326) were used [
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The 324–326 primer pair is widely used to detect BVDV including new genotypes in a recent report [
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and to monitor BVDV infections in dairy herds using bulk tank milk [
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The solutions of the PCR reactions each contained 25 
 <italic>µl</italic> of RNase-free water, 10 
 <italic>µl</italic> of 5 × PCR buffer, 2 
 <italic>µl</italic> of dNTP mix, 2 
 <italic>µl</italic> of Enzyme Mix, 20 pmol of each primer and 8 
 <italic>µl</italic> of viral RNA; this made a total volume of 50 
 <italic>µl</italic> in the One Step RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Each reverse transcriptase reaction was performed at 50°C for 30 min. The reactions were then initially incubated at 95°C for 15 min, and cycled 35 times, as follows: 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 30 sec, and 72°C for 1 min. The ampliﬁcation products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels stained with GelRed (Biotium, Hayward, CA, USA).
