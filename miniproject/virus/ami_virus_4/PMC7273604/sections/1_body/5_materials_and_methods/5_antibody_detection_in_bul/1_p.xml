<p>A commercial BVDV antibody ELISA kit (VDPro BVDV AB ELISA; Median Diagnostics Inc., Chuncheon, Korea) was used to detect antibodies in all bulk tank milk samples, individual milk samples, and sera samples. This blocking ELISA was designed to detect the presence of anti-E2 protein-specific antibody for BVDV. Based on the test procedure, enzyme-conjugated immunosorbent reaction was performed in skimmed milk. The optical density (OD) was thereafter measured by absorbance at 450 nm. The results were judged by the sample-to-negative (S/N) ratio for each sample, as follows: S/N=the OD of the sample/the OD of the negative control. Samples with S/N ratios â‰¤0.7 were positive. Data handling and statistical analysis were carried out using Microsoft Excel 2010.</p>
