<p>In this study, all dairy farms in Ibaraki Prefecture were targeted for screening PI cattle by using milk tanker samples and bulk tank milk samples. In this area, milk tankers make multifarm pick-ups in which milk is collected from several farms and commingled before transport and unloading to a plant. On average, a milk tanker travels to four or five dairy farms to collect milk. The capacity of a milk tanker is 4.2–6.7 t for a mid-sized vehicle and 10.5−13.5 t for a large vehicle. The raw milk collected by milk tankers is transported to two cooling stations (CSs) in Ibaraki Prefecture. These CSs cover the raw milk distribution from nearly all dairy farms in this area.</p>
