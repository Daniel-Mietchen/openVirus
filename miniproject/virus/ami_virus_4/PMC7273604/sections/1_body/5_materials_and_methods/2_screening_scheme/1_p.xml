<p>The screening scheme for identifying PI cattle on dairy herds is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>. This screening scheme consists of two streams. The first stream is BVDV gene detection in milk tanker samples to screen PI cattle in a milk cow herd. The second stream was the screening of PI cattle, including calves and dry cows, by using BVDV antibody detection in bulk tank milk.
