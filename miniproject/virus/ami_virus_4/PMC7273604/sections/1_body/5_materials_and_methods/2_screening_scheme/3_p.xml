<p>For farms in which the bulk tank milk tested positive, we conducted a follow-up test of all cattle and attempted to identify PI cattle. The BVDV antigen-positive cattle were re-tested after three weeks. Cattle that were antigen-positive on both tests were diagnosed as PI cattle. For the follow-up test, all calves that were born up to 10 months after the removal of the last PI animal were tested for BVDV antigen by ELISA. Epidemiological information on identified PI cattle was collected to evaluate the validity of this scheme.</p>
