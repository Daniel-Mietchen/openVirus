<p>To establish this scheme, the possibility of false-negative results due to dilution in milk tanker samples was investigated. To address this, BVDV gene detection was conducted on milk tanker samples and their corresponding bulk tank milk samples in the pilot survey. Furthermore, to verify gene detection in milk tanker samples, we investigated the detection limits of BVDV genes diluted in milk from PI cattle. For antibody detection, we collected individual milk and serum samples of cattle from farms with PI cattle, and then investigated whether BVDV antibodies in milk could be detected with available ELISA kits.</p>
