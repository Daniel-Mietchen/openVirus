 </sup> Meanwhile, long-standing barriers between academic silos have been shattered by a shared desperation for knowledge. Medical and surgical critical care teams have fused to meet a singular clinical challenge. In our COVID-19 ICUs, we round virtually with an additional attending physician who is dedicated exclusively to interfacing with families. This structure alleviates in house clinicians of one of the innumerable strains on their time whereas offering families in need of comfort and information both access and support. It is hard to predict which of these changes will persist beyond this pandemic, and in what form, but as the Civil War birthed modern ambulance systems and World War I yielded triage, so too may this pandemic give us lasting organizational innovations.
