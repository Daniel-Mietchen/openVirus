<p>The pandemic has also uncovered an uncomfortable reality: when demands exceed available resources, physicians must make difficult decisions about rationing of care, prompting the dusting off of protocols developed during other epidemics.

 </sup> The sheer volume of patients required resource allocation decisions for COVID-19 testing and hospital admission. Rationing of care does not apply only to patients affected by COVID-19. The human cost of this pandemic will include many deaths from preventable causes not named COVID-19. In response, there is a growing call to designate specific hospitals in each city to handle serious non-COVID-19 medical problems, such as cancer and heart disease. Such distribution of care would be hard to imagine in the United States, where hospital systems on the same city block compete for patients (and ventilators). But then again, everything that has happened in the last few months, especially here in New York, would have been hard to imagine. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic may have broader collateral effects on our healthcare system itself.
