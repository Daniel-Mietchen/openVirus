<p>Three-dimensional (3D) printing, once a novelty and an academic pursuit in medicine, has surfaced as a viable solution to shortages of personal protective equipment and ventilator components. A collaborative effort between physicians and engineers at Columbia produced reusable face shields for front line clinicians.

 </sup> In Great Britain, a team from the University of Oxford is developing an emergency ventilator, combining 3D printed parts with components found in most hospitals.

 </sup> These experiences with 3D printing might unleash its wider adoption in hospitals, perhaps 1 day with entire printer banks in central supply enabling in-house manufacturing with capacity reserves as needed. Large-scale 3D printing could eventually be deployed to print durable medical equipment tailored to individual patient specifications.
