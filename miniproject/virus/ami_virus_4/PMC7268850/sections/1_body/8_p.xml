<p>At the time of writing, we have only just passed the COVID caseload apex here at the epicenter. Among the remaining challenges is how to safely unwind surge-phase alterations in the organization of care, like the conversion of 23 ORs into temporary ICUs. OR capacity will return only in stages, as will radiology, invasive cardiology, and so many other processes on which surgery relies. We will need to fluidly triage our backlog of cases according to clinical urgency, the improving resource climate, and the return of patient confidence. On the downslope, personal protective equipment will not likely be a limiting resource, but hospital and ICU beds will, so we have rethought our ICU bed utilization rubric, replacing the traditional “first come, first served” model with one that matches anticipated postoperative stay with available beds. If the COVID storm cloud is to have a silver lining, we must take this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make changes that we could not – or would not – make when we were going full speed. We must streamline our processes, discard archaic habits in favor of more efficient alternatives like telemedicine and resource-conscious surgery scheduling, and, perhaps most importantly, make good on the promise of high-quality care for all of our patients, regardless of their background or socioeconomic status.</p>
