<p>As we confront a new pandemic, innovation is again emerging. At Columbia, 2 floors of operating rooms (ORs) have been converted into COVID-19 intensive care units (ICUs), making it the largest critical care unit in our hospital. Similar simultaneous transformations have occurred at our sister institution.

 </sup> The elimination of outpatient visits amid the COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed the expansion of telehealth. Thanks to recent legislation, 85 new telehealth services are now fully reimbursed by Medicare. Both the utility and feasibility of telehealth, long ago substantiated in scholarly journals, is being proven in practice.

 </sup> If this foothold endures, widespread use of telehealth would offer solutions to the greatest limitations in our healthcare system: access to primary care and specialist consultations, flexibility for both patients and providers, and cost reduction in primary and preventative care.
