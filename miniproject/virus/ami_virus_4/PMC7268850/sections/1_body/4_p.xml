<p>Similar accelerations of technological applications into real-world use are being seen in web-based epidemiological tools, point-of-care testing, and novel therapeutics. Products like Kinsa's (San Francisco, CA) fever map, while rudimentary, hint at the promise of how cloud computing and the internet-of-things might form the building blocks of earlier epidemic detection tools. The need for rapid viral vaccine development and production emerged from this crisis as a challenge that has yet to be solved. Still, it took only 63 days from when this virus was sequenced until a viable vaccine for testing in humans was produced â€“ a record. We may see technology for truly rapid vaccine production before this pandemic ends. (Perhaps vaccine hesitancy will evaporate in the wake of COVID-19 as well.) In the most hopeful of futures, combinations of such detection tools and vaccination technologies may prevent viral disease from ever reaching pandemic levels again.</p>
