<p>It is fitting that our battlefield metaphors seem largely to find their origin in World War I (eg, trenches, front lines, etc). World War I represented not just a turning point in the modernization of warfare but also a crucible of creativity in medicine, surgery, and science. Although the world was entrenched in a struggle against the last viral pandemic, the Spanish Flu, in the European trenches Canadian surgeon Lawrence Bruce Robertson revolutionized transfusion medicine with the addition of citrate, allowing for conservation and transportation of blood. Triage, a concept now fundamental to disaster management, was first instituted by French doctors on European battlefields just over a century ago. Not long after, as Europe found itself in yet another war, the threat to life on the front lines gave rise to widespread use of antibiotics and vaccines for the first time. Likewise, numerous storied careers were molded by combat experience. As a major in the French Army Medical Corps during World War I, Alexis Carrel partnered with Henry Dakin to develop a wound antisepsis method that earned him the French Legion of Honor. Simultaneously, Harvey Cushing, the father of neurosurgery, made paradigm-shifting strides in the description and treatment of intracranial injuries.</p>
