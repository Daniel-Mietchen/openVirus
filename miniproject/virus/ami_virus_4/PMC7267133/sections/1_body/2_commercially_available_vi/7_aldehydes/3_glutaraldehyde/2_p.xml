<p>Like formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde (or sometimes known as glutardialdehyde) (Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6B</xref>), is a powerful broad‐spectrum disinfecting and sterilising agent which is highly effective against many viruses after short exposure times (Table 
 <xref rid="viw216-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This dialdehyde is usually sold as an acidic solution, but its reactivity can be “switched on” by making the solution alkaline at pH &gt; 7.5. In an alkaline solution, glutaraldehyde has a limited shelf‐life and stability, as its tendency to polymerise

To determine the reactivity of glutaraldehyde solutions, chemical tests have been developed, though the manufacturer's instructions must be carefully adhered to for accurate results to be obtained.

 </xref> In a similar manner as formaldehyde, the aldehyde linkages of glutaraldehyde can react with the reactive groups on proteins, RNA and DNA. However, as a dialdehyde, its two reactive functional groups can form inter‐ and intra‐molecular crosslinks with these biomolecules that destroys their activity.

 </xref> For instance, glutaraldehyde inactivates the hepatitis A virus and enteroviruses by reacting with lysine residues on their surfaces.
