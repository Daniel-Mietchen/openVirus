<p>Formaldehyde is the simplest aldehyde (Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>) and a powerful high‐level disinfectant with potent viral inactivation capabilities. Often sold as an aqueous solution called formalin, it has been used to inactivate viruses for vaccine production

 </xref> As a high‐level disinfectant, it can effectively and quickly inactivate many different types of viruses (Table 
 <xref rid="viw216-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>) both in suspension and on surfaces, by chemically alkylating the amino (NH
 <sub>2</sub>) and sulfhydryl (SH) groups of proteins,

 </xref> As these functional groups are more reactive at alkaline pHs than acidic pH, formaldehyde is most effective as an alkaline solution. However, its high reactivity renders its usage health‐hazardous: other than being a mutagen and suspected carcinogen,

 </xref> Furthermore, its pungent odour can be detected at concentrations lower than 1 ppm. As a result, other than usage in a well‐ventilated area, strict regulations for human exposure govern its use as a disinfectant and sterilizing agent in hospitals and healthcare facilities, and thus it is not used as a household disinfectant. Formaldehyde has been shown to be a slower‐acting disinfectant than glutaraldehyde.
