<p>Ortho‐phthalaldehyde, or 1,2‐dicarboxybenzaldehyde (Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>), is another high‐level disinfectant. Like both formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde, its virucidal properties stem from its reactions to crosslink reactive groups of proteins and nucleic acids. Although it is a less potent crosslinking agent than glutaraldehyde, this deficit is made up for by its more lipophilic aromatic nature which enhances its uptake by the lipid membrane, and has even shown faster bactericidal activity than glutaraldehyde.
