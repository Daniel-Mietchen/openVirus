 </xref> In the study by Tsujimura et al., the authors demonstrated that the disinfection ability of sodium linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) against enveloped equine herpesvirus type 1 is dependent upon duration, temperature, and organic matter contamination.
 <xref rid="viw216-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">
  <sup>46</sup>
 </xref> LAS is able to effectively inactivate equine herpesvirus type 1 at 0°C when applied at 0.05% concentration for 10 min. The minimum effective concentration (MEC) is reduced by four times when the temperature is raised to room temperature for 10 min. However, when the duration is shortened to 1 min, the MEC rose to &gt;0.05%. In addition, MEC value at room temperature and 10 min reaction duration increased by two times in the presence of 5% contaminating FBS.
