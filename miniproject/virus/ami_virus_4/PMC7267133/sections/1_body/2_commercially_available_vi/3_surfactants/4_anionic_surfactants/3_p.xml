 </xref> Incubating enveloped herpes simplex virus with LS reduced the first stage initial binding to cells while SLS functioned by disrupting the fusion process between the viral envelope and cell membrane. As LS reduces the initial binding of the virus to cells, the virucidal effectiveness of LS requires the pre‐incubation of the virus with LS in order to prevent future viral binding to cells. The lack of a pre‐incubation period significantly reduced the virucidal effectiveness of LS. On the other hand, as SLS does not reduce initial viral binding to cells, the virucidal effects of SLS is less reliant upon pre‐incubation of the virus with SLS. Moreover, it is also shown that SLS can exhibit viral inactivation effects on viruses already firmly attached to cells. Due to the complementary mechanisms of disinfection, the authors suggested synergistic combination of SLS and LS in a single formulation. In addition, the authors also note that the presence of contaminating organic matter reduced the disinfectant ability of both SLS and LS and consequently concentrations 5 and 2.5 times higher respectively are required to achieve viral inactivation.
