<p>Zwitterionic surfactants are molecules bearing both cationic and anionic charges but with an overall neutral charge.

 </xref> Their virucidal activity is less investigated but they may possess interesting properties. Crawford et al. demonstrated that a zwitterionic detergent, Empigen BB®, an alkylbetaine based on a C12‐C14 alcohol, is able to inactivate influenza A and B but still retain the biological activity of the surface haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens.

 </xref> The authors proposed that the mechanism of disinfection by the zwitterionic detergent is via viral disruption instead of solubilizing the surface proteins as cationic, anionic, and non‐ionic surfactants do.

 </xref> This special ability to inactivate viruses but retain the biological activity of their surface antigens allows the zwitterionic detergent to be utilized during the development of vaccines.
