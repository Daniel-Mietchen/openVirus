<p>QACs are regarded as lipophilic and target enveloped viruses by solvating their lipid‐based envelope.

 </xref> However, non‐enveloped viruses are mainly characterized as possessing a protein capsid which is hydrophilic,

 </xref> Romanowski et al. investigated the virucidal effectiveness of benzalkonium chloride (BZK) against common human ocular types of adenovirus that are non‐enveloped viruses.

 </xref> The results suggest that the effectiveness of BZK varies with the virus and also concentration of BZK. At the highest tested concentration of 0.1% BZK, five adenoviruses are inactivated with virus titers &gt;3Log
 <sub>10</sub> units while the remaining two adenoviruses are insufficiently inactivated with reduced titers &gt;1Log
 <sub>10</sub> units but &lt;3Log
 <sub>10</sub> units. Lower concentrations of BZK exhibited compromised ability to inactivate the adenoviruses. In another study by Wood and Payne, a formulation with a final BZK concentration of 0.2% (w/v) is found to be effective against non‐enveloped human coxsackie virus after 1 min of exposure but was ineffective toward inactivating other more resistant non‐enveloped viruses like poliovirus and human adenovirus under the same conditions.

 </xref> The same BZK formulation is also found to inactivate only some of the enveloped virus like the herpes simplex virus but failed to inactivate other enveloped viruses like human immunodeficiency virus and human coronavirus after 1 min of exposure.

 </xref> This shows that the virucidal effects of QACs are highly dependent upon the specific virus and the conditions of exposure to achieve virus inactivation needs to be tailored.
