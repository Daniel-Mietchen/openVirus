<p>An advantage of utilizing QAC‐based disinfectants is their relatively high tolerance toward the presence of contaminating organic matter; their ability to inactivate viruses is usually not diminished by the presence of organic matter

The seemingly contrasting results might be attributed to the fact that BZK disinfectant formulations tested by Rabenau et al. contain other active ingredients like glutaraldehyde and didecyldimonium chloride too.
