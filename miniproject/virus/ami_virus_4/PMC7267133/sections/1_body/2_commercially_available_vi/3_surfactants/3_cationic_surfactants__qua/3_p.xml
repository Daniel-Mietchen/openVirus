<p>QACs are attractive as they are relatively nontoxic, colorless, and odorless.

 </xref> They are well‐known for inactivating enveloped viruses but their virucidal activity depends on concentration, duration of application, and temperature.

 </xref> Tsujimura et al. evaluated the virucidal effect of three QACs, namely benzalkonium chloride, (BZK), mono; bis (tri‐methyl ammonium methylene chloride)‐alkyl (C
 <sub>9–15</sub>) toluene (MBAT), and didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride (DDA).

 </xref> It is found that the QACs require warmer temperatures to exhibit more significant virucidal properties.

 </xref> The QACs at their highest recommended concentrations of 0.05% (w/v), 0.02% (w/v), and 0.02% (w/v), respectively, had no virucidal effect on enveloped equine herpesvirus type 1 after 10 min reaction time at 0°C.

 </xref> When the temperature is increased to room temperature, the virucidal activity of the QACs is found to be dependent upon duration of reaction.

 </xref> Reaction times shorter than 1 min produced no virucidal effect, while the minimum effective concentration (MEC) at 5 min is mostly double that of the MEC for a 10 min reaction.

 </xref> MEC is defined as the lowest concentration of the biocide that reduced the virus titer value by 99.99% or greater as compared to control reactions.

 </xref> This suggests that effective disinfection utilizing QACs is best achieved using warm water and longer reaction times.
