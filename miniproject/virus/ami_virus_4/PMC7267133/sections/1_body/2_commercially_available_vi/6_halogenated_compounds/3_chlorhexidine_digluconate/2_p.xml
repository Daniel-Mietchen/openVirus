<p>Chlorhexidine is a broad‐spectrum cationic bisguanide biocide (Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>) found in many antiseptic products. An active ingredient in handwashes, mouthwashes and oral gels (e.g., Corsodyl®), disinfectants, and preservatives, chlorhexidine has generally low irritability, good substantivity on skin, and rapid bactericidal activity. However, its activity is highly dependent on its formulation, being reduced by the presence of organic matter, including serum, as well as anionic surfactants and phospholipids

 </xref> Compared to bacteria, its virucidal activity is more variable and significantly less effective and slower‐acting than povidone‐iodine. Generally, chlorhexidine is ineffective against non‐enveloped viruses (polio and adenoviruses), but shows variable potency for inactivating enveloped viruses (e.g. herpes simplex virus, Influenza A, cytomegaloviruses and hepatitis B virus) (Table 
 <xref rid="viw216-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Against human coronavirus HCoV‐299E however, chlorhexidine showed limited effectiveness, with a 1.0 mM solution showing only a 3 log

 </xref> Mechanistically, the viral inhibition of chlorhexidine has been proposed to arise from interactions with surface glycoproteins on enveloped viruses, which may reduce the activity of viral enzymes such as DNA polymerase enzymes for the hepatitis B virus.
