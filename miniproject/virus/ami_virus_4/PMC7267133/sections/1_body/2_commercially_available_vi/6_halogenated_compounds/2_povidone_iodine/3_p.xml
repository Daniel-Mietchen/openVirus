<p>The origins of the broad virucidal efficiencies of povidone‚Äêiodine has still yet to be fully elucidated, and is likely to occur by multiple mechanisms, reducing the likelihood of chance viral mutations conferring resistance. There is evidence that iodine can block the receptors of the virus responsible for attachment to the host cell surface.

 </xref> Furthermore, iodine can inhibit the activity of viral enzymes (e.g. neuraminidase) essential for virus release from host cells, preventing its spread to other uninfected cells.

 </xref> For enveloped viruses, it has also been suggested that virus membrane can be destabilized by the reaction of iodine with the unsaturated C=C bonds of membrane fatty acids.
