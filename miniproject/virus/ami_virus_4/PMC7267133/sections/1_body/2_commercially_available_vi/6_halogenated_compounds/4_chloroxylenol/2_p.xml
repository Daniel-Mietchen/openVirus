<p>Chloroxylenol, also known as para‐chloro‐meta‐xylenol (PCMX) (Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>), is a halogenated phenolic‐type antiseptic used as the key active ingredient in Dettol®. Commonly‐used for household disinfectants, wound cleaning, and for disinfecting surgical equipment, it is most effective against bacteria, but its virucidal activity is variable. A 1998 study of chloroxylenol against a number of human viruses found it to be effective against the enveloped viruses herpes simplex 1 and HIV (Table

 </xref> In spite of its widespread commercial use for a long time, surprisingly little is known about its mechanism of action against both bacteria and viruses. Chloroxylenol is generally safe to humans for external use, but has been reported to cause irritant contact dermatitis and contact depigmentation.
