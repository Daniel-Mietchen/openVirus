<p>Sodium hypochlorite is sensitive to the presence of organic material, and a significantly higher concentration is required to achieve the same disinfectant efficacy. While 100 ppm sodium hypochlorite can effectively disinfect a clean surface of HIV‐1 virus in 30 s, the activity is reduced in the presence of organic material. A higher concentration of 500 ppm and 1–2 min is required in the presence of 80% serum, and around 10,000 ppm (1%) is required in the presence of 80% blood.

 </xref> Sodium hypochlorite at 50 ppm was found to disinfect HIV in saline alone, but a 50‐fold higher concentration of 2,500 ppm was required to disinfect in the presence of 10% plasma, and 5,000 ppm (1%) was required in the presence of blood.

 </xref> In a review guidance for clinicians, noncritical surfaces that are contaminated with blood or other tissues are suggested to be cleaned first to remove organic material before spot decontaminating with sodium hypochlorite solution.
