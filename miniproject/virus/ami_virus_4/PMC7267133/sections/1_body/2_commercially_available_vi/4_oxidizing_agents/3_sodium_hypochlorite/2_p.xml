<p>Sodium hypochlorite, the active ingredient in household bleach, is a strong oxidizing agent. It dissolves in water to form hypochlorous acid, which can be reduced to form water and the chloride anion. The hypochlorous acid molecule can react with peptide bonds and thiol groups, chemically oxidizing proteins and other biomolecules and abolish function.

 </xref> The efficacy of disinfection decreases with an increase in pH, likely due to the decreased proportion of hypochlorous acid group present.
