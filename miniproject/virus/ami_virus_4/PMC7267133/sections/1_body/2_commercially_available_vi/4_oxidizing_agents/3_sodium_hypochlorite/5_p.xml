<p>Sodium hypochlorite at high concentrations of 1000 ppm is regularly used for clinical disinfection. However, it has an odor and can be irritating to mucous membranes at high concentrations. Less concentrated hypochlorous acid solutions are less stable to environmental factors such as temperature and light, and the oxidizing potential can be used up by impurities.

 </xref> In terms of application, a concentrated stock of 5% sodium hypochlorite that is more stable is typically recommended to be diluted 100× to 0.05% before use so as to mostly avoid the downsides of concentrated sodium hypochlorite during the disinfection process. The most common oxidizing agent disinfectant in the United States is aqueous solutions of 5.25–6.15% sodium hypochlorite, also known as household bleach.
