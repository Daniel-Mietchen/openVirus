<p>Compared to sodium hypochlorite, sodium dichloroisocyanurate has disinfectant activity that persists for longer, is more tolerant to the presence of organic material, and has a higher disinfectant efficacy overall. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate could inactivate the bacteriophage Phi6, an Ebola surrogate, at 0.5% concentration in 10 min on multiple different surfaces, while sodium hypochlorite could not inactivate sufficiently on nitrile surface.

 </xref> Sodium dichloroisocyanurate at 50 ppm was found to disinfect HIV in saline alone, but a 50‐fold higher concentration of 2500 ppm was required to disinfect in the presence of 10% plasma, and 5,000 ppm (0.5%) was required in the presence of blood.

 </xref> Sodium dichloroisocyanurate at 10,000 ppm shows disinfectant activity in the presence of 70% serum, while sodium hypochlorite only shows similar activity in presence of 20% serum.

 </xref> This is postulated to be because only 50% of the total chlorine is in the available hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid component form that can be neutralized by serum, while the rest of the chlorine can be progressively pushed toward hypochlorite/hypochlorous acid to maintain the chemical equilibrium.
