<p>Sodium hypochlorite is fast acting, and is effective at low concentrations. At 10 ppm available chlorine, sodium hypochlorite is able to inactivate bacteriophage PAO1 within 30 s, and further characterization studies showed that a large number of structural components were damaged or deformed by the treatment. Generally, it was found that the extent of damage was proportional to the concentration of sodium hypochlorite and the contact time.
