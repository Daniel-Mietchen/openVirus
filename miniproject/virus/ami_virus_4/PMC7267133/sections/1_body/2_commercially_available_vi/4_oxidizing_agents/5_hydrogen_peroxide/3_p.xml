<p>Hydrogen peroxide was also effective against noroviruses, although at generally higher concentrations than sodium hypochlorite. At a concentration of 0.18% and 5 min contact time, the AHP disinfectant was able to inactivate feline calicivirus, and at 3.5% and 10 min contact time, the AHP disinfectant was able to inactivate surrogate murine norovirus to greater than 5log
