<p>Potent biocidal agents eradicate viruses and bacteria by various mechanisms such as disrupting the structure of the cell, and coagulating and/or denaturing proteins in the microorganisms. Although few studies have been done to fully understand the biocidal activity of alcohol, it is often believed that alcohols disrupts the cell membrane and denatures the proteins in general.

 </xref> Viruses as well as many other microorganisms are commonly susceptible to this mode of action. Previous studies have reported that with the inclusion of water in the biocidal system, the efficacy of alcohol increases as water would facilitate quicker denaturing of proteins.
