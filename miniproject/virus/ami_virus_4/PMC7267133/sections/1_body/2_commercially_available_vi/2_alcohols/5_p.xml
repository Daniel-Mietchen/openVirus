<p>Although alcohols are effective in eradicating some types of viruses, other disinfectants such as quaternary ammonium compounds (QAC), glutaraldehyde, and hydrogen peroxide quickly outshine its performance.

 </xref> Therefore, disinfectants with alcohol as its main active ingredients are generally not used to disinfect critical equipment or environment in the healthcare settings.

 </xref> The use of isopropyl alcohol is also limited as it only inactivates lipid viruses. This greatly reduces the capabilities of alcohol as a broader use disinfecting agent. Because alcohols are flammable liquids, large amounts of alcohol will increase the risks and dangers of it as a disinfecting agent. The flash point of a higher concentration of alcohol solution is lower than that of a lower concentration.

 </xref> According to Boyce, 70% ethyl alcohol has a flash point at 20.5°C, while the flash point of 30% ethyl alcohol is at 29°C.

 </xref> Furthermore, prolonged and repeated usage of alcohol compromises the integrity of materials such as plastics and dyes. Materials with constant exposure to alcohol may experience discoloration, cracking, and swelling due to the effects of alcohol. Another difficulty with the use of alcohol is that it evaporates quickly when exposed to air, therefore reducing the contact time with the virus. Achieving maximum disinfection is difficult unless the tools are immersed in a bath for a period of time.
