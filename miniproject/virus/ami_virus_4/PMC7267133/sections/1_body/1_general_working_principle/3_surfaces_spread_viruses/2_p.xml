<p>Surfaces, including our hands, play an important part in the spread of viruses. Viruses such as poliovirus and bacteriophage showed a much higher survival when they were transferred by direct contact of surfaces, as opposed to droplet aerosolization or dust containing viruses.

 </xref> Hand‐to‐surface contact of only 5 s was sufficient to transfer a significant proportion of the virus, and viruses could then spread by touching the mucosa of the nose or conjunctiva of the eye.

 </xref> The chance of spread is in turn directly correlated with the viral survival time on the surface, which shows considerable variation between different viruses. For example, among different soft surfaces tested, enteric viruses were shown to survive on wool blankets for the longest period of time, poster card for the shortest period of time, and cotton fabric for an intermediate period of time.

 </xref> A very recent study has found that the Covid‐19 coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) can persist longest on propylene plastic surfaces and stainless steel, with viable viruses found up to 72 hr after initial application though at a greatly reduced viral titer.

 </xref> Much shorter persistence was observed on copper surfaces, with no viable viruses observed after 4 hr. While the closely‐related SARS‐CoV‐1 coronavirus showed no significant statistical differences in half‐life on these surfaces, SARS‐CoV‐2 could persist considerably longer on cardboard surfaces: 24 hr were required for no viable SARS‐CoV‐2 to be detected, compared with just 8 hr for SARS‐CoV‐1.
