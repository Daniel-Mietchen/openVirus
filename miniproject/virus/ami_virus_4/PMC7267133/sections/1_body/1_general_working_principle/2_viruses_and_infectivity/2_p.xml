<p>Viruses are typically composed of a viral capsid containing nucleic acids inside. The nucleic acid serve as the template information for replication, while the capsid and its associated proteins function both to protect the nucleic acid and bind to host cell receptors.

 </xref> The coronavirus SARS‐CoV‐2, for example, uses the spike glycoprotein to bind to host cell sialic acid receptors.

 </xref> Outside of a host cell, viruses are unable to replicate and increase in number. However, they can often survive for long periods of time in this state.

 </xref> When they encounter a suitable host cell, they will infect and enter the host cell, hijacking the cellular machinery for its own replication. Viruses are able to infect cells, including even bacterial cells, and cause a range of commonly seen diseases (see Table
