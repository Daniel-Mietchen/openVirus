<p>The main measure of efficacy of the disinfectant is by the fold reduction in infectivity of the virus, and this is typically conducted by carrier tests and suspension tests. The key parameters that affect the efficacy of disinfection agents against viruses include the contact time, concentration of disinfection agent, and the particular virus involved.

 </xref> With a decrease in the concentration of the active disinfecting ingredient, the contact time will likely need to be increased to achieve adequate disinfection.

 </xref> A reduction of viral infectivity by 4 log units correlates to a 99.99% reduction in the viral titer. The log unit reduction and percent (%) reduction are used interchangeably in literature to describe disinfectant efficacy.
