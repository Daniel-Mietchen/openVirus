<p>Disinfection efficacy can also be influenced by environmental factors. If disinfection requires chemical reactions to take place, such as for formaldehyde, then the rate of disinfection will be higher at higher temperatures. Under cold temperatures, certain disinfectants could be ineffective as the rate of disinfection would be exceedingly low.

 </xref> Humidity is also another factor that could affect disinfectant penetration to the virus. For reactions such as aldehyde disinfectants, a change in pH will also affect the disinfectant efficacy.
