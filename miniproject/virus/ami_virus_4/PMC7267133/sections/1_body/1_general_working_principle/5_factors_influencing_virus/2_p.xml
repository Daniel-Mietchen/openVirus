<p>There are specific unique characteristics of viruses that influence inactivation by disinfection. There are three main types of viruses with different structures, classified here according to increasing difficulty of chemical disinfectant inactivation: enveloped viruses, large unenveloped viruses, and small unenveloped viruses (see Table 
 <xref rid="viw216-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Larger viruses are generally more sensitive to disinfectants, although there are exceptions.

 </xref> A few disinfectant solutions tested were all effective against the enveloped viruses Herpes Simplex Virus and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) type 1, although less effective against the small non‐enveloped human coxsackie virus.

 </xref> Enveloped viruses contain a lipid envelope that is required for infection, and therefore interfering with the envelope could potentially reduce virus infectivity. Lipophilic disinfectants can often be used to inactivate enveloped viruses. In contrast, non‐enveloped viruses utilize a protein coat for infection, and therefore inactivation often requires denaturation of the redundant viral capsid proteins or essential replicative proteins.

 </xref> Disinfectants that disrupt proteins such as glutaraldehyde or sodium hypochlorite could be effective at inactivating non‐enveloped viruses.

  <sup>21</sup>
 </xref> Sodium hypochlorite was shown to inactivate the bacteriophage PAO1, and further electron microscopy studies showed that there was extensive structural damage to the phage, including damage to capsid proteins.

 </xref> However, the disinfectant might also need to penetrate to destroy the nucleic acids, as viruses such as polio retain infectivity with the RNA alone.

 </xref> While the enveloped virus Influenza H1N1 could be inactivated by all the disinfectants tested,

  <sup>25</sup>
 </xref> it is much more challenging to inactivate small non‐enveloped noroviruses, and several commonly available disinfectants are not able to sufficiently reduce infectivity.
