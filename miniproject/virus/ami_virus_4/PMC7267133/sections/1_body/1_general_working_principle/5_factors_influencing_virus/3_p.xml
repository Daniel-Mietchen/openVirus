<p>Viruses also show resistance to disinfection due to the cellular materials that viruses are normally associated with. Viruses are normally reliant on host cells for replication, so they are often found together with material such as cell debris, soil, and aerosolized droplets.

 </xref> These are called viral clumping protective factors, and they can both reduce the penetration of the disinfectant to the virus, and can also interact and reduce the activity of the disinfecting agents. This has a big impact on the disinfectants, necessitating a much higher concentration for effective disinfection. Disinfection is commonly associated with and reliant on cleaning processes, as the removal of organic material impurities first can allow for a better disinfection process.

 </xref> Viruses can also aggregate in the environment, for example, upon exposure to disinfectants, thereby making it more difficult for disinfectants to penetrate and access the viruses.
