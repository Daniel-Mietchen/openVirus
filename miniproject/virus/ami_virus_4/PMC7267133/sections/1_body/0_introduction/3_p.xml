<p>In this review, we summarize the various types of sanitizing agents used in commercially available formulations scientifically demonstrated for their virucidal properties to inactivate viruses in suspension and on surfaces. Viruses that require vectors for transmission, such as the chikungunya and dengue viruses, are not considered. These “virucidal” agents can either destroy viruses or alter their surface structures to prevent them from infecting potential host cells (Section

 </xref> which inhibits virus replication in host cells. The effective dose of each sanitizing agent, exposure time for effective virucidal activity, suitability for usage under domestic or healthcare/hospital settings and mechanisms of action are considered. We also explore what has been scientifically shown for some common myths believed to inactivate viruses and prevent their spread. Finally, we present promising new research directions, materials, and strategies that have been shown to inactivate viruses but have yet to reach widespread commercial availability.
