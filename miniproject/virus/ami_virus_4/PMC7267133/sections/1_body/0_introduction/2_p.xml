<p>Viral transmissions and infections have posed severe threats to human health and well‐being throughout history, and have led to widespread socioeconomic disruptions. During the 2014 Ebola pandemic in West Africa, the gross domestic product (GDP) growth of Liberia, one of the worst‐affected countries, fell from 8.7% in 2013 to just 0.7% in 2014.

 </xref> Bolstered by the close‐knit global connectivity we enjoy today, the threat of a global virus pandemic is greater now than any other time in human history, as viruses can spread across the globe at unprecedented rates. Even a century ago in 1918, the “Spanish influenza” pandemic caused a worldwide healthcare catastrophe, with more than 50 million deaths and 500 million infections.

 </xref> At the time of writing in early April 2020, the novel coronavirus causing Covid‐19 (SARS‐CoV‐2, or formerly known as HCoV‐19), which was first reported by China in late 2019, has resulted in more than a million confirmed cases of infections and almost 57,000 fatalities worldwide.

 </xref> Human‐to‐human transmission of common influenza viruses and coronaviruses can occur through virus‐laden body fluids, as well as self‐innoculation of the mucous membranes in the nose, mouth, or eyes by touching contaminated dry surfaces.

 </xref> The use of sanitizing agents for personal care and surface disinfection are clearly of paramount importance in limiting viral transmissions, by inactivating the viruses before they have a chance to enter the human body.
