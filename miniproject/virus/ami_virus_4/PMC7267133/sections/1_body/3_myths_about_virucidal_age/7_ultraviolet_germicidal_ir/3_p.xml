<p>First, as the efficacy of UVGI is dependent on the absorption by the target DNA, which has a maximum absorption wavelength of 260 nm, microorganisms have been found to be selectively vulnerable to the exposure to light at wavelengths specifically at or in close range of 253.7 nm.

 </xref> When tested against the strain of bacteriophage virus 
 <italic>Φ</italic>X‐174, it was shown that the wavelength could be increased to up to 280nm without significant reduction of virucidal efficiency, but a significant 
 <italic>decrease</italic> was observed upon the increase to 301 nm.
