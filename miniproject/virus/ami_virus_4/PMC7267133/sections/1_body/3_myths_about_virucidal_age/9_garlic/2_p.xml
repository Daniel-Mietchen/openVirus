<p>The basis of some of these myths stems from their common association with antimicrobial properties. Garlic is commonly associated with fairly broad‐spectrum antimicrobial effects, exhibiting antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral and even antiprotozoal activities. Its constituents that render it effective against viruses have been discovered to include allicin, diallyl trisulfide, and ajoene.
