<p>Through the study of star anise oil and some essential oil constituents, for example, it was identified that the oil itself, as well as the specific compounds trans‐anethole, farnesol and β‐caryophyllene were capable of direct inactivation of the herpes virus, potentially through the disruption of the virion envelope, prior to host cell infection.

 </xref> Other reports indicate that anti‐viral activities of essential oils do happen through similar mechanisms, including the virucidal effects of sesquiterpenes against various enveloped viruses,

 </xref> Due to the lack of research investigating the specific virucidal actions of these compounds against the selected viruses, it is unsafe to assume that effective sanitization can occur broadly over all recommended types of essential oils. When considering several of the aforementioned cases as examples, most of which act upon the virion envelope, it is possible to conclude that they would be rendered ineffective in the disinfection of non‐enveloped virus species.
