<p>The use of metal nanomaterials to form self‐disinfecting surfaces have gained traction in recent years, as viruses can persist on contaminated surfaces for prolonged periods. Self‐disinfecting surfaces are capable of inactivating viruses in contact with them 
 <italic>in situ</italic>, reducing the chances of virus transmissions via human contact with contaminated surfaces. In one design, the self‐disinfecting surface was established with photoactive metal nanocrystals which required visible light stimulation for viral inactivation. These surfaces, fabricated from nanocrystals of CuInZn
 <sub>4</sub>S
 <sub>6</sub> (CIZS) with band gaps within the visible light range, could absorb visible light and produce active oxidative species that inactivated the influenza A virus by oxidizing the amino acid residues presented on the viral envelope proteins (Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). While highly virucidal, visible light must be present to guarantee the self‐sanitizing effect, thereby limiting the practicality of the system.
