<p>Other than AgNPs, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are also promising virucidal agents. AuNPs synthesized using garlic extract with an average size of 6 nm showed virucidal activity against the measles virus by also binding to surface viral receptors and preventing subsequent host cell binding and infection.
