<p>β‐cyclodextrins (βCDs) are naturally‐occurring macrocyclic molecules comprising of 7 covalently‐joined glucopyranose units, possessing a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic interior cavity which can encapsulate non‐polar molecules in water. A family of sulfonated βCDs was recently studied for their virucidal activities (Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7A</xref>), which differed in the length of the flexible alkyl groups between the anionic sulfonate groups (CD1 and CD2), as well as rigidity of the spacer unit (CD3).

 </xref> CD1 displayed broad‐spectrum virucidal activity against many viruses from different families, including from herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV‐2), respiratory syncytial virus types A and B, human metapneumovirus and human parainfluenza virus type A, while being ineffective against enterovirus D68 and influenza virus H3N2. The long alkyl linker of CD1 appeared to be the key to its high virucidal activity, giving complete HSV‐2 inactivation within 15 minutes, and whose virucidal activity was not affected by dilution. Compared to CD1, a shorter linker in CD2 and a more rigid one in CD3 made the cyclodextrin derivatives less effective. It was proposed that CD1's best virucidal activity against HSV‐2 stemmed from its ability to bind to most numbers of glycoprotein B found on the viral surface, blocking the proteins‘ fusion loop and induces conformational changes to these proteins.
