<p>In addition to cyclodextrin derivatives, macrocyclic calix[4]arene derivatives also showed promising virucidal activities. 1,3‐bis(bithiazolyl)‐tetra‐para‐sulfonato‐calix[4]arene (C[4]S‐BTZ) (Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7B</xref>) was shown to show better virucidal activities against human coronavirus HCoV‐229E than the frequently used antiseptic, chlorhexidine (CHX) (Section
