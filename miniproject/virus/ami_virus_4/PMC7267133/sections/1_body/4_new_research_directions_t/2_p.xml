<p>To expand the repertoire of virucidal compounds available, there has been considerable research effort to develop new active materials which exhibit broad spectrum virucidal activities, yet pose low toxicities to humans. Three main types of virucidal agents are receiving significant research attention: small discrete virucidal molecules (Section 
 <xref rid="viw216-sec-0340" ref-type="sec">5.1</xref>), metal nanomaterials (Section 
 <xref rid="viw216-sec-0350" ref-type="sec">5.2</xref>), and virucidal polymers (Section 
 <xref rid="viw216-sec-0360" ref-type="sec">5.3</xref>). There is a considerable push towards utilizing naturally‐occurring molecules to exploit their intrinsic virucidal properties as much as possible. In this section, we will give a broad overview of emerging directions towards virucidal agents and materials, which are not yet commercially available, and/or their virucidal properties are only demonstrated under controlled lab settings and not yet conclusively proven under real‐life usage conditions.
