<p>Airborne transmission of viruses is another major route of human‐to‐human transmissions and can occur in the form of aerosols (a cut‐off droplet size of &lt; 5 µm is typically chosen).

 </xref> These aerosol microdroplets settle slowly from the air, and as long as the virus particles remain viable, are respirable and can result in direct viral transmission to the alveolar region. The airborne stability of viruses varies greatly, and depends on relative humidity and temperature. Lower humidity is generally favorable for viruses with more lipids, whilst viruses with low or no lipid content show stability at higher humidity.

 </xref> The effects of humidity on virus stability is also dependent on temperature‐ for instance, lower temperatures can enhance the stability of non‐enveloped rhinoviruses at high relative humidity.

 </xref> A recent study has also revealed that the Covid‐19‐causing SARS‐CoV‐2 virus possesses similar aerosol stabilities as the SARS‐CoV‐1, remaining viable for the 3‐hour duration of study.

 </xref> Furthermore, given the high momentum of the multiphase turbulent gas cloud emitted from sneezing and coughing, virus‐laden droplets may possibly be spread for distances larger than the 1–2 m recommended separation for SARS‐CoV‐2.

 </xref> Clearly, methods and disinfectants capable of disinfecting the air are thus valuable in limiting viral transmissions, especially within indoor environments.
