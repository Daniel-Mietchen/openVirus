 <sub>2</sub>) was reported to inactivate airborne viruses.

 </xref> Using the model bacteriophage viruses (MS2 and ΦX174), 0.01 and 0.02 ppm of ClO
 <sub>2</sub> could reduce the number of viable bacteriophages by &gt; 2 log
 <sub>10</sub> units after 3 hours in an exposure chamber. Concentrations of ClO
 <sub>2</sub> lower than 0.1 ppm has been shown to show no human toxicity. ClO
 <sub>2</sub> is a stable free radical and is a powerful oxidizing agent, and can inactivate viruses by oxidizing a critical tryptophan residue in their binding site.
