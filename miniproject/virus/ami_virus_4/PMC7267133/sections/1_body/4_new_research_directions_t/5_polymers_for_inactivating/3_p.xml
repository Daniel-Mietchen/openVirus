<p>The vast majority of viral‐deactivating polymers are charged. In 2006, Klibanov reported that hydrophobic polyethylenimine (PEI) derivatives can inactivate enveloped viruses such as the Influenza A virus.

 </xref> Cationic and zwitterionic (possessing equal numbers of positive and negative charges) PEI derivatives (Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9A</xref>) showed close to complete the virucidal activity in 5 min. On the other hand, much slower virus inactivation was reported for anionic PEI, reaching 89 % virucidal activity only after 2 hr, while the neutral derivative showed no virus inactivation. Notably, an alcoholic solution of these polymers could be painted onto glass slides to form virucidal coatings. The inactivation was proposed to arise from the interaction of the erect charged polymer “tentacles” with ionic sites within the hydrophobic lipid membranes of the Influenza A virus. A similar mechanism of action likely accounted for the virucidal activity of cationic pyridinium‐type polyvinylpyrrolidones (Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9B</xref>), which damages the lipid envelop of Influenza A and leads to virostasis.
