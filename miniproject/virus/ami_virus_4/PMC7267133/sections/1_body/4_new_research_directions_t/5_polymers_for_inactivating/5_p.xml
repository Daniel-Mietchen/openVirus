<p>In 2013, cationic chitosan derivatives (Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0011" ref-type="fig">11</xref>) were shown to be highly potent for inhibiting the replication of human coronavirus HCoV‐NL63, a common cold virus.

 </xref> The combination of chitosan and the specific cationic quarternary ammonium substituent appears to be essential for its activity, as unfunctionalized chitosan, ι‐ and κ‐carrageenans and heparin were ineffective

The chitosan derivatives bearing different degrees of substitution were also highly selective in their virucidal activity, being effective against only murine hepatitis virus and a number of human coronaviruses (HCoV‐NL63, HCoV‐229E, HCoV‐OC43, and HCoV‐HKU1).

 </xref> Their virus inhibition occurred from the formation of a complex with the S protein of the coronaviruses, which prevents the viruses from binding to its cellular receptor for infection.
