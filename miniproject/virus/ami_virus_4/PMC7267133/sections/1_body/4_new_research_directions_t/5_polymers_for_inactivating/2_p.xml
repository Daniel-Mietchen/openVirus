<p>Polymers capable of inactivating viruses are a new and exciting area of research. A large number of polymers capable of killing bacteria and preventing their proliferation are known today,

 </xref> but comparatively very few are known to be virucidal. Such polymers can: (1) act as carriers for controlled release of bioactive virucidal molecules, or (2) possess intrinsic viral inhibitory properties on their own due to the chemical functional groups present on the polymer structure. Compared to the former, whose virucidal efficiencies are limited by diffusion and initial loadings of the bioactive agents through the polymer matrix, the latter has the advantage of showing long‐term activity. Furthermore, these intrinsically viral‐inactivating polymers can be formulated or cast into various forms for customized applications, such as disinfecting coatings, binders in pharmaceutical products, water purification filters, and as additives in paper or common household materials. For these reasons, we discuss only intrinsically‐virucidal polymers here.
