<p>The lack of a lipid membrane in non‐enveloped viruses (e.g. adenoviruses) necessitates a different strategy for inactivation. The cationic quaternary phosphonium polymer in Figure 
 <xref rid="viw216-fig-0010" ref-type="fig">10</xref> achieves this by interacting with the binding fiber proteins on the virus, preventing them from binding to cellular receptors necessary for entry into cells. At aqueous concentrations as low as 100 ppm, these non‐cytotoxic polymers have a virucidal efficiency of 86.5%.
