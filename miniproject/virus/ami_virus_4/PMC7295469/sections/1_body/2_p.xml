<p id="para30">A question that Republic of the Congo and other member states in the region must ask themselves is why are we seeing only a gradual increase in the detection of cases? Are we missing infections? A probable answer is that people with symptoms do not present to health-care facilities because of their concerns about fragile health systems, social stigma, and quarantine in suboptimal facilities. Other questions still to be resolved are related to the dynamics of viral transmission across geographical regions, between humans, across different ecosystems, and within different genetic backgrounds, and to whether any protective herd immunity exists.</p>
