<p id="para10">When WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Jan 30, 2020, countries around the world began to prepare. Preparation, however, is becoming increasingly difficult in many African countries, especially in central African countries, such as Republic of the Congo and others, where the effects of the Ebola virus disease epidemic on the economy and health structures are still being felt. The first case of COVID-19 in Africa was reported on Feb 14, and within a few weeks the virus had spread to 54 African countries. Only a few African Union member states have been successful in implementing detection, prevention, and control measures. Republic of the Congo reported its first case on March 14, and by May 9 a total of 274 confirmed cases and ten deaths had been reported. Very few countries in Africa have sufficient and appropriate diagnostic capacities, and obvious challenges exist to handle an outbreak of this extent.
