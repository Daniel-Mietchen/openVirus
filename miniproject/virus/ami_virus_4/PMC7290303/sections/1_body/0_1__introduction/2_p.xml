<p>Except for KHV, and despite sporadic occurrences of SVC, the UK has a high status regarding aquatic animal health and is recognised as free from most notifiable aquatic animal pathogens listed by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Under international legislation, this means that imports of live fish into the UK can only be received from countries certified to have equal status concerning (i.e., be free from) these pathogens. To ensure the system of import controls is effective, the Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI) of England and Wales conducts routine random surveillance checks on live fish from both the EU and non-EU countries arriving at border inspection posts (BIPs). These checks target the pathogens listed by the OIE (principally SVC virus (SVCV), its variants [
