<p>Despite international trading standards relating to the health status of live fish concerning OIE-listed diseases, surveillance at BIPs has detected incursions of pathogens, such as SVCV and KHV, as well as other pathogens that are presently unlisted and for which their potential impact to the UK is unknown. This manuscript describes the genetic and ultrastructural characterisation of an exotic nidovirus recently isolated from imported goldfish 
 <italic>Carassius auratus</italic> at a BIP, the experimental challenge work that was undertaken to determine the susceptibility of two important UK fish species—common carp 
 <italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic> and Atlantic salmon 
 <italic>Salmo salar</italic>—and the design and initial evaluation of diagnostic tools.
