<p>In asymptomatic goldfish, mild epicarditis with multifocal or diffuse inflammation was observed in the heart of some IP-injected and bath-challenged fish. Additionally, cardiomyocyte atrophy was observed in goldfish sampled at 20 and 33 days pc. Bath-challenged goldfish showed vacuolation of the intestinal lamina propria and mild necrosis in more than 70% of the specimens sampled during the challenge. Vacuolation of the renal haematopoietic tissue and focal necrosis was present with a low prevalence. Histopathological changes observed in gill tissues of some challenged goldfish were related to the presence of co-infection with intracellular bacteria (epitheliocystis) rather than the viral infection. The liver, gill and brain sections did not show changes. </p>
