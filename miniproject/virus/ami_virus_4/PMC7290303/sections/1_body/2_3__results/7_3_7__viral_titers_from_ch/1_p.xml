<p>CSBV Cefas-W054 was re-isolated in cell culture from tissue homogenates of diseased goldfish, with viral titers ranging from 10

 <sup>−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00578-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The virus was also re-isolated from asymptomatic common carp, goldfish and Atlantic salmon homogenates sampled at 10 and 20 days pc, with titers ranging from 10
 <sup>3</sup> to 10 TICD
 <sub>50</sub> mL
 <sup>−1</sup> at 10 days pc, and from 10
 <sup>2</sup> to 10 TICD
 <sub>50</sub> mL
 <sup>−1</sup> at 20 days pc. Challenged Atlantic salmon showed lower titers than common carp and goldfish tissue homogenates. At the end of the challenge, at 33 days pc, low viral titers were still detectable only in challenged goldfish using both the IP and bath routes of infection. The nidovirus was not isolated from fish sampled from the control groups at any sampling time.
