<p>The viral loads in the kidney and heart of a selection of fish showing histopathology were also examined using Taqman qPCR (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00578-t006" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>). Viral detection was tested in parallel using standard RT-PCR in a selection of tissue homogenates (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00578">Figure S1</xref>). A moribund IP-injected goldfish sampled at 17 days pc showed 2.2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> and 9.8 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies of the CSBV Cefas-W054 ppIa gene in kidney and heart, respectively. The number of viral copies in asymptomatic IP goldfish sampled at 10 days was ~10
 <sup>5</sup> in kidney and ~10
 <sup>4</sup> in heart, while asymptomatic goldfish sampled at 20 days showed a very low viral copy number (&lt;10 copies). The viral load detected in common carp and Atlantic salmon was &lt;10 copies in all the specimens analysed.
