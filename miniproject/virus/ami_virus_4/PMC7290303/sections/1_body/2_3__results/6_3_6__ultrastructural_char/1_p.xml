<p>Infected FHM and E11 cells showing pathological changes were associated with the presence of abundant focal or multifocal accumulations of viral-like tubular structures in early-stage infections, which became widely distributed throughout the cell during the final stages of necrosis. The tubules were cylindrical, 15–20 nm in diameter and varied in length up to 650 nm (

Electron microscopy of purified virions (negative staining) from FHM and E11 cells revealed predominantly bacilliform viral particles of ≈150 nm length and ≈35 nm diameter, with externally projected spikes of ≈20 nm. Spherical coronavirus-like viral particles were also observed (
