<p>Following the IP challenge in goldfish, in cases of renal haematopoietic cell necrosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00578-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,b), the tubules described above were present with variable abundance and occasionally associated with the presence of low numbers of spherical virions. These virions were between 75 and 180 nm in diameter and showed surface spikes with a projection of 15 to 20 nm from the virion envelope (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00578-f006">Figure 6</xref>c,d). Virions were observed in the process of leaving infected cells via budding (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00578-f006">Figure 6</xref>e,f). However, evidence for the process of infection was not seen. Mature spherical virions were occasionally seen. Additionally, the ultrastructural examination of proximal renal tubules revealed the presence of intense virogenesis in the apical region of tubule epithelial cells immediately beneath the brush border (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00578-f006">Figure 6</xref>b). Virions approximately 150 nm in diameter with an external surface of glycoprotein spikes were formed via budding from tubular structures reminiscent of the endoplasmic reticulum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00578-f006">Figure 6</xref>c). The tubules contained faintly granular osmiophilic substances, which became increasingly dense as the viral nucleocapsid formed. In a few cases, the insertion of external microtubular material into the virion was seen forming a circular structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00578-f006">Figure 6</xref>c,d). Mature virions were not observed extracellularly in the brush border of the tubule epithelial cells or the tubule lumens.
