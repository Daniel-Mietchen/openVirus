<p>The complete genome sequence of the goldfish nidovirus shared a 97.99% nucleotide identity with CSBV NIDO with deletions of 537 and 480 nt in the ORF encoding for the Ia protein, in positions 1709–2246 and 4148–4628 of the CSBV NIDO genome, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral genome placed the goldfish virus in the 
 <italic>Oncotshavirus</italic> genus, within the 
 <italic>Piscaniviridae</italic> subfamily of 
 <italic>Toboniviridae</italic>, and it was named CSBV isolate Cefas-W054. Percentage identities with other oncotshavirus were 97.95% for the Atlantic salmon bafinivirus (ASBV VT01292015-09), 97.90% for a CSBV isolated from crucian carp 
 <italic>Carassius auratus</italic> (CSBV HB93), 97.81% for a CSBV isolated from the lesser spiny eel 
 <italic>Macrognathus aculeatus</italic> (CSBV WHQSR4345) and 96.52% for the yellow catfish 
 <italic>Pelteobagrus fulvidraco</italic> bacilliform virus (YCBV). A lower identity was observed when aligned with members of the genus 
 <italic>Banifivirus</italic>: 66.87% for fathead minnow nidovirus (FHMNV) and 68.25% for white bream virus (WBV) isolate DF24/00 (
