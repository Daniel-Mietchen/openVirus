<p>Bioinformatic analysis of the DNA-sequenced sample did not show any significant similarity with the virus deposited in the NCBI. In contrast, the initial de novo assembly of the ds-cDNA sample generated two major contigs of 2915 nucleotides (nt) and 2097 nt in length and several minor contigs. Blast analysis indicated that major contigs shared a 97% nucleotide identity to sequences submitted to GenBank for the Chinook salmon bafinivirus (CSBV) isolate NIDO (accession no. KJ681496.1). A repeat of the assembly of the raw sequence data using the CSBV NIDO genome as a reference was able to assemble 273,434 of the 334,630 total reads (81%) against the reference sequence to generate a 25,969 nt consensus sequence, corresponding to the full viral genome. </p>
