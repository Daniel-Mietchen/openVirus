<p>ORF 1ab encoded for the putative replicase polyprotein (PpIab, 6670 aa). ORF 2, 3 and 4 encoded for the viral putative structural proteins spike (S, 1203 aa), membrane protein (M, 243 aa) and nucleocapsid protein (N, 178 aa), respectively. Among the piscanivirus, the higher amino acid sequence identity was obtained with CSBV NIDO, with amino acid homologies of 98.6%, 99.3%, 98.8%, 97.1% and 86.3% for PpIa, PpIb, S, M and N, respectively (
