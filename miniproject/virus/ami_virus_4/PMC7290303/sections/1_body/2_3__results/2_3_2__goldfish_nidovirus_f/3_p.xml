<p>The CSBV Cefas-W054 genome contained four major ORFs in the 5′ region of the genome: ORF 1ab, 2, 3 and 4. The 5′- and 3′-ends contained untranslated regions of 845 and 191 nucleotides, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00578-f001">Figure 1</xref>b). ORF1a and ORF1b were offset by one nucleotide (−1 frame) and overlapped by 27 nt. This overlapping region contained a putative ribosomal frameshift (RFS) slippery sequence (13843UUUAAAC) that marked the site of frameshifting.
