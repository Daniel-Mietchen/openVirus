<p>A consignment of assorted goldfish showing no clinical signs of disease was sampled at the border post at Heathrow Airport in April 2018 by the FHI as part of a routine health check. Early CPEs, consisting of small plaques of rounding and clumping cells, were observed as soon as three days post-inoculation (pi), which continued to develop through the next 7 days to large plaques associated with detached cells, culminating in the destruction of the cell monolayer when the potential virus supernatant was transferred to fresh EPC and FHM cells. The development of CPEs was again observed in successive passages, with faster growth in FHM. Strong acidification of the media was noted as soon as two days pi. An ELISA test for rhabdovirus was negative, as well as the OIE-recommended SVCV RT-PCR assay. RT-PCR using a generic primer set targeting the spriviviruses and perhabdoviruses was also negative. A generic PCR test for cyprinid herpesviruses was positive but only in one out of two pooled samples tested, and sequencing indicated that CyHV-2 was present but was not the cause of the CPEs observed in all the samples. </p>
