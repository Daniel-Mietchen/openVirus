<p>The virus was initially cultured on EPC and FHM cells but it was found that the CSBV Cefas-W054 also replicated in a wide range of other fish cells; CCB, BF-2, E11, SSN-1 and GF, from 15 to 25 °C, with higher titers at warmer incubation temperatures (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00578-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The cell line E11 showed the highest viral titer under the conditions tested, reaching a titer of 10
