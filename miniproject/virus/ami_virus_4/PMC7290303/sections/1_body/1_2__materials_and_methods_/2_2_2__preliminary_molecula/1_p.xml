<p>Total nucleic acid was extracted from 100 µL of the supernatant of EPC cells showing cytopathic effects (CPEs) using the EZ1 Virus mini kit and an EZ1 extraction robot (QIAGEN, Manchester, UK) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed at 37 °C for 1 h in a total 20 μL reaction volume consisting of 200 U of M-MLV RT, M-MLV RT 5× reaction buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3; 375 mM KCl; 15 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>; 50 mM DTT), 1 mM dNTP mix, 500 ng of random primers, 25 units RNasin
 <sup>®</sup> Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Promega, Hampshire, UK) and 4 μL of viral nucleic acid extract.
