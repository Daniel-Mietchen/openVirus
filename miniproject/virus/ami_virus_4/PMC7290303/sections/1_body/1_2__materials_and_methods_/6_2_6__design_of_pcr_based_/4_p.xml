<p>Taqman assays were performed with 2 µL of cDNA containing 10 ng of input RNA, 500 nM of each primer and 250 nM of probe labeled with 6-FAM in 5′ and MGB in 3′, in a total volume of 20 µL by using the Taqman Universal PCR master mix with AmpErase UNG (Applied Biosystems, Loughborough, UK). Fluorescence detection was performed on a StepOne Real-Time PCR software V2.3 (Applied Biosystems, Loughborough, UK) at 50 °C for 2 min followed by 95 °C for 10 min then 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C.</p>
