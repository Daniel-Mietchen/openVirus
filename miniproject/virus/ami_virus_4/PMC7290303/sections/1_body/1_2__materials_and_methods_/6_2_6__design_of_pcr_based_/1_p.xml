<p>Chinook salmon bafinivirus (CSBV)-specific primers were designed by aligning the putative replicase polyprotein Iab (
 <italic>PpIab</italic>) gene of the CSBV isolate Cefas-W054 with the CSBV isolate NIDO (KJ681496.1) genome sequence. Real-time primers and a Taqman probe were designed to screen for CSBV in “apparently healthy” animals and a conventional primers set was designed to confirm the virus in overtly infected animals. An additional nested primer set was designed to increase the sensitivity of the conventional assay for the confirmation of low virus loads detected with the real-time PCR assay. Two sets of primers (CSBVdel1 For/Rev and del2 For/Rev) were also designed to amplify the sequences adjacent to the two deletions observed on the consensus sequence, where the predicted PCR products were 195 and 182 bp, respectively (
