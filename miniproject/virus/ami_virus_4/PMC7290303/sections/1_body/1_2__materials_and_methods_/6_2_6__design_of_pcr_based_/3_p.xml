<p>PCR was performed in a 50 µL reaction volume consisting of 1× green GoTaq
 <sup>®</sup> Flexi buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 1 mM dNTP mix, 1.25 units of GoTaq
 <sup>®</sup> G2 Hot Start Polymerase (Promega, Hampshire, UK), 50 pmol of each forward and reverse primers and 2.5 µL of cDNA. After an initial denaturing step of 5 min at 95 °C, samples were subjected to 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 76 °C, followed by a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C in a Mastercycler nexus X2 (Eppendorf, Stevenage, UK).
