<p>Additionally, primers (CSBV cloning for and rev) were designed to amplify an 800-nucleotide region of the CSBV 
 <italic>PpIa</italic> gene containing both the real-time qPCR primers and probes and the region covered by the conventional PCR assay. The amplification product was inserted into the pGem-T Easy plasmid vector (Promega, Hampshire, UK). The template (dsDNA) copy number was calculated using a QuantiFluor dsDNA kit in a Quantus fluorimeter (Promega, Hampshire, UK) and a plasmid dilution series, from 10
 <sup>6</sup> to 1 copy, which was generated to obtain a standard curve.
