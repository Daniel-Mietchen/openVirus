<p>Multiple sequence alignment, using the complete genome sequence of the goldfish virus and a selection of nidovirus sequences downloaded from the NCBI nucleotide database, was conducted using the ClustalW [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] algorithm in MEGA V7 [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using the neighbor-joining method. The phylogenetic tree was generated from 100 bootstrap replications of the Tamura-Nei model in MEGA V7 [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
