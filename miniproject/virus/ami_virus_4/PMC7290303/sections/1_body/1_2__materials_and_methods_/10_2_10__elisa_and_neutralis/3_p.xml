<p>The neutralisation test on the sera of challenged fish was performed as described before [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Each serum was initially diluted 1:10 in PBS and heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) to destroy complement and other labile non-specific neutralising factors. An equal volume of serum and virus was then mixed and held 1 h at room temperature. First, an equal dose of virus (10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> mL
 <sup>−1</sup>) was exposed to serum dilutions (from 10 to 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>); in a second test, virus stock was titrated in the presence of control fish non-immune serum and the sample serum was diluted at 1/100. The difference between these titers was considered the neutralisation index (NI), expressed as the log10 NI.
