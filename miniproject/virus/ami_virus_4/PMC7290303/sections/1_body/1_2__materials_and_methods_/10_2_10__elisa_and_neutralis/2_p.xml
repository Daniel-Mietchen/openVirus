<p>An indirect ELISA was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] with slight modifications. Goldfish nidovirus propagated on E11 cells were concentrated using ultracentrifugation at 100,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at 4 °C and the viral pellets were resuspended in 500 µL of cell culture medium. The viral protein concentration was then measured with a BCA protein assay kit (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), adjusted to 10 µg mL
 <sup>−1</sup>, and used as a capture antigen. The anti-common carp IgM monoclonal antibody (Aquatic Diagnostics, Stirling, UK) was used when analysing sera from common carp and the anti-Atlantic salmon IgM monoclonal antibody (Aquatic Diagnostics) was used when analysing sera from Atlantic salmon to measure antibody levels of goldfish CSBV Cefas-W054-induced IgM. An ELISA for the analysis of goldfish sera was not possible due to the lack of a commercially available anti-goldfish antibody. The optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm. For each of the 15 Atlantic salmon and common carp, including their respectively control fish, sampled at 33 days pc, two dilutions of sera were tested: 1:50 and 1:100 in duplicate wells. Test controls were added in each plate consisting of wells without sera and wells without anti-common carp/Atlantic salmon IgM. The collected data were analysed using Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test.
