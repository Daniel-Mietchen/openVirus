<p>Cells in maintenance media [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] were plated on 96-well cell culture plates (Corning, Flintshire, UK), inoculated with the viral stock, and incubated either at 15, 20 or 25 Â°C for up to 14 days for the observation of CPEs. The viral titer, measured as the median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>), was calculated, as described before [
