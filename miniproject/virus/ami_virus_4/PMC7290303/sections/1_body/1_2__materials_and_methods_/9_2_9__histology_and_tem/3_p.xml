<p>Inoculated FHM and E11 cells showing CPEs in approximately 50% of the cells were also prepared for ultrastructural examination. Cells were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 and pelleted. The pellet was rinsed in sodium cacodylate buffer before being post-fixed in 1% osmium tetraoxide in a sodium cacodylate buffer, rinsed again in sodium cacodylate buffer, before being dehydrated through an acetone series. Cell pellets were embedded in Agar 100 epoxy (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) and polymerised overnight at 60 °C. Ultrathin sections (70–90 nm) were mounted on uncoated copper grids and stained with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynolds’ lead citrate [
