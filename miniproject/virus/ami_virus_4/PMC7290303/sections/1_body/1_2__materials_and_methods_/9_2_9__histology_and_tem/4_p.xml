<p>The supernatant of inoculated cells containing infective virions was clarified using centrifugation [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the viral particles were pelleted using ultracentrifugation at 27,000 rpm for 60 min in an Optima XPN-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK). The viral pellet was resuspended in a 100 µL NaCa cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4. For negative staining, 4 µL of each sample was applied to a glow discharged carbon-coated grid. The solution was left on the grid for at least 1 min before being washed with 1% phosphotungstic acid solution. Excess stain was removed from the grid with blotting paper and the grids were left to dry overnight before being examined.
