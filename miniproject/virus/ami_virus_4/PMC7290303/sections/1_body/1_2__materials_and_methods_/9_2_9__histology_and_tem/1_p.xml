<p>Tissues collected during the challenge for the histology assessment were fixed in NBF for a minimum of 24 h and then transferred to 70% ethanol for paraffin embedding according to standard laboratory procedures for histological examinations. Tissue sections were then embedded in paraffin wax with the PELORIS II Premium Tissue Processing System (Leica Biosystems, Nussloch, Germany). Embedded blocks were sectioned with 3−4 μm thicknesses using a rotary microtome (Shandon Finesse, Cheshire, UK), and the sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). Slides were examined for the presence of lesions with a Nikon E800 light microscope (Nikon, Surbiton, UK) with images captured using Lucia™ software (Lucia Cytogenetics, Praha, Czech Republic).</p>
