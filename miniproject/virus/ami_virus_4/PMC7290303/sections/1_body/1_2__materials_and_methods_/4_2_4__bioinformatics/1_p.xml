<p>Pre-processing of the raw data, sequencing trimming, reads alignment, the novo assembly and mapping to reference sequences were done using CLC Genomics Workbench v4.9 (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/</uri>), as described before [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The sequence similarity of major contiguous sequences (contigs) was determined using BLASTn (NCBI nt database, March 2018) [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the virus genome showing the greatest nucleotide similarity to the goldfish virus was then used as a reference sequence to map the reads against. The trimmed reads were then mapped to the draft consensus sequence. The predicted insertions/deletions were checked using standard PCR amplification and sanger sequencing. Finally, ORFs were predicted using Artemis V17.0.1 [
