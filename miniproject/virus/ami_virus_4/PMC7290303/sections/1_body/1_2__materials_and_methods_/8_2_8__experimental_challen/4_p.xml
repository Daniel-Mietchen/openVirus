<p>For each sampled animal, a pool of brain, kidney, heart and spleen were taken for virology and processed as described above. Gill, kidney, spleen, liver, heart and brain were also fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (GLUT) for histology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) examinations, respectively. For all the survivors sampled at 33 days pc, equivalent to 594-degree days (DD) for common carp and goldfish and at 462 DD for Atlantic salmon, blood was drawn from the caudal vein for serology tests. </p>
