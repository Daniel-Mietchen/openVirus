<p>Single tanks containing either 30 Atlantic salmon parr or 30 common carp, both reared from ova in the bio-secure stock aquarium areas of the Cefas Weymouth lab, or 30 goldfish, sourced from a local farm subjected to health checks and quarantine, weighing between 10 and 15 g, were exposed to the virus via either intraperitoneal injection (IP), with a viral inoculum of 100 µL at 1.7 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> TCID

 <sup>−1</sup>, or by a static bath immersion, consisting in 15 mL of virus stock at 1.7 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> TCID

 <sup>−1</sup> added to 30 L of tank water (5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID

 <sup>−1</sup> dose) for 4 h, after which the flow rate was restored to 0.5 L min
 <sup>−1</sup>. The water temperature was maintained at 18 °C for common carp and goldfish, or at 14 °C for Atlantic salmon. Two control tanks for each species, containing 30 fish in each tank, were either mock IP-injected or mock bath-challenged.
