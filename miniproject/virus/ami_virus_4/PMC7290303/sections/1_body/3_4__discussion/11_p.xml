<p>Although the risk from this virus to UK fish appears low based on this study, the finding highlights the active nature of ornamental fish imports as a route of pathogen introduction. The study shows that ornamental fish (and potentially other aquatic animals and plants) may act as vectors for pathogens, and that without effective border surveillance pathogens, will enter the UK via this route; indeed, a second isolation of this particular virus has been made in ornamental fish sampled at a UK BIP since the original isolation. These detections were not part of a dedicated program to identify novel pathogens but were a chance finding made as part of routine surveillance for listed notifiable pathogens. Though international standards are in place to limit the risk of introduction of OIE-listed pathogens, their efficiency in terms of controlling new and emerging pathogens is limited. By their nature, emerging pathogens are challenging to detect and control, but with the evolution in high-throughput sequencing, rapid detection methods and other technologies, their utility in border surveillance should be evaluated [

This is especially pertinent in the case of ornamental fish species due to the scale of the trade, both in terms of volume and points of origin. For these species, effective border controls are critical, as once they have entered the country, there are limited controls or records relating to their movements and it is known that hobbyists frequently make unauthorised releases of ornamental fish into wild systems and recreational waters [
