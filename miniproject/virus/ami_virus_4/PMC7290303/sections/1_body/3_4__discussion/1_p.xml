<p>This manuscript describes the first isolation and characterisation of a novel oncotshavirus, CSBV Cefas-W054, isolated from assorted goldfish at a BIP as part of a routine health screening. The consignment of ornamental fish, where the goldfish oncotshavirus was isolated from, were shipped from Hong Kong, although it is not known if this was their country of origin. Two contemporaneous isolations of oncotshavirus, the YCBV and the CSBV HB93, have been reported in freshwater fish species in China [

 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]; however, phylogenetic analyses suggested that the oncotshavirus isolated from goldfish likely represents a new genogroup in the 
 <italic>Oncotshavirus</italic> genus, and this is the first report of the detection of an oncotshavirus in Europe.
