<p>Very little is known about piscanivirus in vitro replication and cell culture susceptibility. Overall, cyprinid-derived cell lines showed higher CSBV Cefas W054 replication than salmonid ones. However, notable differences in the viral titer among cyprinid-derived cell lines were also observed, which might be associated with differences in the host cellular immune response [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. CSBV Cefas W054 showed an increased viral replication rate at a higher temperature of incubation, reaching high viral titers (up to ~10

 <sup>−1</sup>) when incubated at 25 °C. A high viral titer was noted for CSBV HB93 in grass carp ovary (GCO), with titers of ~10

 <sup>−1</sup> at 25 °C [

Both YCBV and FHMNV were initially isolated in EPCs at 25 and 15 °C, respectively, while the salmonid CSBV NIDO was isolated in the rainbow trout RTG-2 cell line at 15 °C. Although there are no details about the isolation of ASBV VT01292015-09, a wide in vitro host range was noted in its direct NCBI submission. Like YCBV, syncytium formation was not observed in the goldfish CSBV Cefas-W054, which differs from the syncytium development reported for FHMNV [
