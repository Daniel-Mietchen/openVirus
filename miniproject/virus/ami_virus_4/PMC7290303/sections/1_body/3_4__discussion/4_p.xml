<p>Multiple sequence alignment of the CSBV Cefas W054 genome with other piscanivirus showed the presence of two large deletions of â‰ˆ500 nt in the ppIab. The first deletion was in a highly variable region among piscanivirus; this deletion is present in the ASBV VT01292015-09, CSBV WHQSR4345 and CSBV HB93 genomes but not in YCBV or CSBV NIDO. However, the second deletion was only present in the goldfish CSBV Cefas-W054 and the crucian carp CSBV HB93 isolate. Deletions in the viral genome can be associated with viral adaption to novel hosts or changes in virulence. For example, in the orthomyxovirus, salmon anemia virus (ISAV) deletions within the highly polymorphic region (HPR) confer higher pathogenicity than the non-virulent ISAVs (ISAV-HPR0) [
