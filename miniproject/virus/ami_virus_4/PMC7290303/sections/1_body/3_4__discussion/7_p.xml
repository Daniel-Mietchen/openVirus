<p>Ultrastructural observations revealed the presence of spherical or sub-spherical virions with surface spikes in inoculated FHM and E11 cells, which appeared in abundance during virogenesis in goldfish renal tubule cells. Spherical or sub-spherical virions originating from a budding compartment between the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) and Golgi described in SARS coronavirus infections [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] or within cytoplasmic vacuoles and rER cisternae [
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] was not observed in infected goldfish examined in the present study. Tubular structures within vesicles [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], which were also reported, were abundant in infected goldfish haematopoietic and renal tubule cells and tissue culture. Similar structures have been reported with nidovirus infections [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>].
