<p>In both cell types (FHM and E11) and challenged goldfish, spherical and bacilliform virions were observed. Only bacilliform viral particles have been described to date in cultured piscaniviruses (CSBV HB93, FHMBV, YCBV and WBV DF24/00 [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). The average size of bacilliform viral-like particles of the goldfish CSBV Cefas-W054 was similar to that described for YCBV and CSBV HB93 in fixed cells [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and the purified virions, observed using negative staining, showed a predominantly bacilliform shape similar to WBV DF24/00 [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Both spherical and bacillary forms of the mature virus have been described for reptilian nidovirus [
 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and a corona-like virus infecting hematopoietic cells associated to a new viraemic disease was found in common carp in Japan in 2000 [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]; however, no sequencing data is available for the carp virus, thus preventing further comparison. Another explanation for this dramatic pleomorphic has been considered since the co-isolation of an unknown virus that persists at a low number despite serial dilutions of the stock virus was made. Furthermore, NGS sequencing data has been thoroughly reanalysed but only viral sequences like CSBV were obtained. Further work is required to fully understand the observation of pleomorphic mature viral particles of the goldfish CSBV Cefas-W054 and its life cycle, which will involve deeper sequence and library approaches [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], as well as electron microscopy in situ hybridisation and immunostaining [
