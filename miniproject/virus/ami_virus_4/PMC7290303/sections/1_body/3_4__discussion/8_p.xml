<p>Electron microscopy observations on the virogenesis of the goldfish oncotshavirus budding from endoplasmic reticulum-like tubular structures (possibly analogous to the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC)) has also been described for other coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. However, mechanisms of attachment and replication of the goldfish oncotshavirus require further investigation since the release of virions from infected renal tubule epithelial cells was not observed and budding from haematopoietic renal cells was only occasionally seen.
