<p>The 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order currently comprises four genera: 
 <italic>Serpentovirinae</italic>, 
 <italic>Torovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Oncotshavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Bafinivirus</italic>; however, only the last two, grouped into the subfamily 
 <italic>Piscanivirus</italic>, are fish viruses [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The first reports of a fish nidovirus date from 2001, with the concurrent isolation of fish nidovirus infecting Chinook salmon 
 <italic>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</italic> in Canada and white bream 
 <italic>Blicca bjoerna</italic> in Germany [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Since those first isolations, very little is known about the fish nidoviralesâ€™ host range, pathogenicity and geographical distribution. The oncotshaviruses reported so far have been recently isolated in a variety of freshwater fish species: the YCBV [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the CSBV HB93 [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the CSBV WHQSR4345 [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (these three originate in China), the CSBV NIDO and the ASBV VT01292015-09 (these two originate in Canada) [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Bafinivirus</italic> genus includes two types of species, both isolated from cyprinids: the WBV DF24/00, which was isolated from white bream in Germany [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and the FHMNV, which was isolated from fathead minnows 
 <italic>Pimephales promelas</italic> in USA [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].
