<p>Recently, metagenomic sequencing allows for quicker novel identification of viruses in the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. Nidoviruses have been described in vertebrate mammalian and fish species, as well as in invertebrate crustacean and mosquito species [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and more recently in reptilian [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], amphibian and marine mollusc hosts [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Nidovirus genome consists of an infectious, linear, large positive-sense RNA [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The 5â€²-genome region of nidoviruses comprises two open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Depending on the family and genus, nidoviruses have diverse virion morphologies ranging from spherical to bacilliform [
