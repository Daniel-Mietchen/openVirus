<p>The predicted ORFs were as described for other oncotshaviruses, consisting of the putative PpIab, S, M and N proteins. As in the other piscaniviruses, YCBV, FHMNV and WBV DF24/00 [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00578" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], ORF1b was expressed by a programmed âˆ’1 RBS localised upstream of the ORF1a stop codon as an efficient mechanism of viral gene expression during the replication cycle, and it is present in 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> and other non-aquatic nidoviruses [
