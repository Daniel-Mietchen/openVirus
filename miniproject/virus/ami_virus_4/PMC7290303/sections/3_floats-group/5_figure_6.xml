   <bold>a</bold>) Semithin section of the kidney of moribund goldfish showing cellular necrosis in interstitial cells (asterisks) and renal tubule epithelium (arrow). (
   <bold>b</bold>â€“
   <bold>f</bold>) Virogenesis in the proximal renal tubule epithelium. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Semithin resin section showing the apical region of the infected cell bordering the renal tubule lumen (L) and infected epithelial cell with numerous large vacuoles (V) containing granular and more electron-dense material that was mostly located between the nucleus and the viral assembly area (asterisk) in the apical portion of the cell. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Virions budding from tubular structures comprising the endoplasmic reticulum with the insertion of external microtubular material (arrow). (
   <bold>d</bold>) Internally fuzzy-coated vesicles with internal dense bodies (DB) and similar structures in the cytosol. The tubular structures are seen in (
   <bold>a</bold>,
   <bold>b</bold>); microfilaments (MF) and viral budding are also visible. (
   <bold>e</bold>,
   <bold>f</bold>) Viral budding from renal interstitial cell membranes. The top inserts show the detail of mature virions with spikes on the surface.
