<p id="p0125">The genome of IBV is organized into eight single-stranded RNA molecules that are of negative polarity and vary in length from 1.1 to 2.4 kb (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). Each of the segments carries characteristic highly conserved sequences of 10 (AGUAG (A/U) AACA) and 9 nucleotides (UCGUCUUCG) at their 5′ and 3′-termini, respectively, which themselves flank short segment-specific non-coding regions (NCR) that encompass the coding sequences and short U-rich elements directing polyadenylation. Each IBV gene segment encodes one or two of the eleven known viral gene products (PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, NB, M1, BM2, NS1, NEP) utilizing distinct strategies to expand viral coding capacity
