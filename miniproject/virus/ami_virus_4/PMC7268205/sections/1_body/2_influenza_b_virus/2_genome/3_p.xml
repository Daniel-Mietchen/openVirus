<p id="p0135">Also the expression strategy of segment 7 encoding the viral M1 matrix and the BM2 ion channel protein differs from the one used by IAV, in which the primary mRNA transcript is processed by cellular splicing machinery proteins. In contrast, the IBV M1 and BM2 proteins are both translated from a collinear transcript in which the M1 stop codon and the BM2 start codon are assembled into a 
 <italic>UAA</italic>UG pentanucleotide, which facilitates ribosomal re-initiation of protein synthesis following completion of M1 translation. Translation of BM2 coding sequence depends on the presence of a conserved 
 <italic>cis</italic> element of 45 nucleotides preceding the stop-start signal. This element contains a nucleotide stretch complementary to helix 26 of 18S rRNA, which has been suggested to facilitate the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the mRNA upon termination at the M1 stop codon.
