<p id="p0245">Baloxavir marboxil, the prodrug of an oral anti-influenza compound, was licensed for the treatment of seasonal influenza in Japan and the US in 2018. It targets the cap-dependent endonuclease activity located on the PA polymerase subunits of IAV and IBV, and the drug can be given as a single dose. The EC50 of Baloxavir acid for the propagation of IBV in MDCK cells was reported in the range of 5.6â€“8.5 n mol. Analyzes of A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) viruses isolated from patients in the treatment studies showed that single mutations of the conserved residue I38 to T, F or M reduced the sensitivity to Baloxavir by more than 10-fold. No resistant IBV were reported in the clinical studies, but reverse genetics showed that PA I38 mutations increase the EC50 of IBV by 2- to 7-fold. Structural analyzes showed that resistance mutations reduced the affinity of the inhibitor to PA. Strong conservation of the PA I38 position in current human influenza B viruses suggests only a low background level of resistance to Baloxavir. Importantly, no cross-resistance has been found for Baloxavir and NAI.</p>
