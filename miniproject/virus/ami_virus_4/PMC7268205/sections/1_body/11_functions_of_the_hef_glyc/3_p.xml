<p id="p0295">The receptor binding site is located near the top of the globular head in a shallow groove surrounded by residues from four secondary structure elements: the 170-loop, 190-loop, 230-helix and 270-loop and thus exhibits a similar structure as the binding site for Neu5Ac in HA (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, the crystal structure of HEF of IDV, which is otherwise almost identical to the structure of HEF of ICV, revealed a more open receptor-binding cavity, which may be the basis for the broader cell tropism of IDV. Some coronaviruses, such as the prototype member mouse hepatitis virus and human and bovine coronaviruses, contain a hemagglutinin esterase (HE) protein that also binds 9-O-Ac-Neu5Ac, but the ligand is bound in an opposite orientation.
