<p id="p0310">A notable difference between HA and HEF is the fusion peptide, a hydrophobic region at the N-terminus of the small HEF
 <sub>2</sub> subunit which contains hydrophobic, aromatic, but also a few negatively charged residues. It is fully conserved between ICV and IDV HEF (IFGIDDLI), but very different from the respective, strictly conserved amino acids of HA2 (GLFGAIAGFIE). In addition, while the fusion peptide of HA is completely buried in the interior of the molecule, the fusion peptide of HEF has a loop-like structure, which is partly exposed at the surface of the virus. HEF may therefore be regarded as having an internal fusion peptide, similar to virus fusion proteins that do not require cleavage activation.
