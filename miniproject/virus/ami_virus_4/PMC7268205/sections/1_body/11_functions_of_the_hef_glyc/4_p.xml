<p id="p0300">Intrinsic temperature sensitivity is another peculiar feature of HEF of ICV that distinguishes it from HA. Folding of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (and hence cell surface expression) is less efficient at 37째C than at 33째C. Probably as a consequence, ICV grows to higher titers in cells cultured at 33째C compared with 37째C. This temperature sensitivity may be one of the factors that prevents the replication of ICV in the lungs that has a higher temperature compared with the upper respiratory tract. On the contrary, HEF of IDV exhibits an exceptional temperature and acid-stability and hence IDV is the most stable of the four types of influenza viruses, a feature that likely affects the tissue tropism and cross-species transmission of the virus.</p>
