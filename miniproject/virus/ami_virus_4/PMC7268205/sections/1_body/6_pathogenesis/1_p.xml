<p id="p0230">Clinical symptoms of seasonal influenza are in general similar for IBV and IAV and no unique pathogenetic mechanism has been ascribed for IBV, when it infects and spreads through the human respiratory tract. One autopsy study of 45 fatal influenza B cases showed that both lineage viruses caused inflammation of the trachea and bronchi with necrotic cells, pulmonary edema and hemorrhages as common findings. Viral antigen was mainly found in the columnar epithelium of the trachea and bronchi as well as in submucosal glands even in the absence of bacterial coinfection. These findings were similar to the ones seen in fatal influenza A virus infection. Yet, it is unclear how representative these findings from post mortem tissue are to the pathogenesis in uncomplicated influenza for which there is only little data available. The pathogenesis of IBV infection in experimental animal models depend on virus adaptation (e.g., mice), the use of specific virus strains (ferrets, guinea pigs) or in some models there is no pathological changes (e.g., Syrian golden hamsters).</p>
