<p id="p0255">Influenza C (ICV) and D virus (IDV) particles exhibit various morphologies: elliptical, spherical with a diameter of 80–120 nm or filamentous with a similar diameter but with lengths in the µm range (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). A peculiar feature of ICV and IDV particles not observed for IAV virions is the arrangement of its unique spike, the hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion glycoprotein (HEF) in a reticular structure that consist mainly of hexagons. The regular polymeric structure can also be observed in isolated HEF molecules indicating that the hexagonal arrangement is an intrinsic feature of the protein likely involving lateral interaction between its ectodomains.
