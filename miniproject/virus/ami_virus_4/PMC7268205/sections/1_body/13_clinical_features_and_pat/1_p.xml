<p id="p0335">Influenza C virus usually causes inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, especially in children from one to six years of age. Clinical symptoms, such as cough, fever and malaise are typically mild. Occasionally the virus can spread to the lower respiratory tract, causing symptoms such as bronchitis and pneumonia, particularly in children younger than two years.</p>
