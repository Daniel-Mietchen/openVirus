<p id="p0250">Vaccination is the most effective measure to protect against seasonal influenza A and B, for which either inactivated or live-attenuated vaccines are available. Since IAV and IBV strains circulate in unpredictable patterns, killed vaccine formulations contain a mixture of inactivated whole viruses or purified HA and NA proteins from one A(H1N1), one A(H3N2) and one (trivalent influenza vaccine, TIV) or two IBV strains (quadrivalent influenza vaccine, QIV) designed to elicit a protective humoral immune response. The specific strains to be included into the vaccine of the forthcoming season are recommended by WHO twice a year based upon extensive genetic analysis and antigenic profiling of circulating virus strains. Live-attenuated vaccines contain a mixture of three or four attenuated virus strains with the same antigenic profiles. High vaccine effectiveness depends on a good antigenic match between the vaccine strains and the circulating epidemic viruses. The elderly may also have weaker immune responses against the vaccine. Since there is only limited antigenic cross-reactivity between the two IBV lineages that co-circulate since 2001 with unpredictable frequencies, it has turned out a formidable challenge to predict the specific IBV lineage component for TIV. In fact, TIV was in five of ten seasons from 2001 to 2010 reported to confer little or no protection against the circulating IBV strains in the US. Still, recent meta-regression analysis quantified that there was reduced but substantial IBV vaccine effectiveness against laboratory confirmed infection even in seasons with a type B lineage mismatch (67% for matched seasons, 35% for mismatched seasons). The suboptimal performance of TIV led to a first recommendation in 2012/2013 for the inclusion of both IBV lineages into a seasonal QIV, which have been increasingly used by different countries. Modeling studies suggested a good potential that the simultaneous coverage of both IBV lineages by quadrivalent formulations can substantially reduce the burden of influenza B infection if vaccine uptake is sufficiently high.</p>
