<p id="p0185">NB is an enigmatic second transmembrane glycoprotein encoded by segment 6 with an unknown function. It consists of an N-terminal ectodomain of 18 amino acid, a predicted 22 amino acid transmembrane domain and a cytosolic part of 60 amino acids. It has two glycosylation sites in the ectodomain. Mature NB forms a tetrameric structure and is incorporated into virions, but only in low amounts as determined by quantitative mass spectrometry. NB transport to the cell surface was suggested to depend on palmitoylation of cysteine 49. Most interestingly, a recombinant influenza B/Florida/04/2006 virus engineered to lack NB expression by introduction of an early stop codon not affecting NA expression replicated well in stable cell lines or primary tissue cultures. The NB-deficient mutant virus had no specific phenotype in mice and propagated in a ferret model in virtually identical manner to the wildtype virus with a retained (low) capacity for respiratory droplet transmission. These findings partially contrast with a weakly delayed viral growth for a B/Lee/40 mutant virus in which NB palmitoylation at cysteine 49 was abrogated, which may have affected trafficking of NB to the cell surface. Yet, the likely essential function of the NB protein in IBV replication, pathogenesis or transmission, which is expected by the strong conservation of the NB reading frame, remains to be discovered.</p>
