<p id="p0150">The main targets of IBV are the epithelial cells lining the upper respiratory tract. The available evidence indicates that the replication cycles of IBV and IAV follow very similar or even identical principles, which are, however, executed by divergent and a few type-specific proteins, respectively, resulting in some virus type-specific mechanisms that are described in detail below. Hence, IBV and IAV were shown to enter a permissive host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, which is initiated by binding of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) to sialic acid residues that are present either as glycoprotein or glycolipids on the host cell surface. Intracellular release of the viral genome requires both acidification of the interior of the virion through the viral BM2 ion channel, which is followed by HA–mediated fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes in the acidic environment of the late endosome. The pH optimum for fusion activity of the IBV HA has been determined at pH of 5.4–5.6, which is slightly above the range known for HA of human IAV (pH = 5.0–5.4). The viral RNPs are transported from the cytosol into the nucleus, where the viral RNA polymerase, a trimeric enzyme of ca. 270 kDa initiates transcription and replication of the viral gene segments. These events have been less well studied in cells infected with IBV compared to type A viruses. However, the high conservation of structural elements within the three polymerase subunits PB1 (enzymatic core), PB2 (cap binding domain, aa 318–480) and PA (endonuclease site, aa 1–195) as determined by X ray crystallography, as well as functional studies of recombinant polymerases strongly argue for a conserved mode of action.</p>
