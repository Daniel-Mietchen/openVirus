<p id="p0175">The HA is a main target for antibodies elicited after infection or immunization. Phylogenetic and structural analyzes revealed four major canonical antigenic sites reflecting the strong immune pressures on the IBV HA. Antigenic sites have been mapped to the 120 loop (116−137), the 150 loop (141−150), the 160 loop (162−167), and the 190 helix (194−202) which contain sequence-variable immunodominant epitopes. The IBV HA protein contains a highly conserved cytosolic tail domain of 10 amino acids (RDNVSCSICL) with important regulatory roles in virion assembly and budding. The two cysteine residues are modified by palmitoylation thereby increasing hydrophobicity of the tail. Removal or shifting of palmitoylation sites affected membrane fusion activity of the HA. Studies by reverse genetic analyzes suggested that the cytosolic tail is important for the incorporation of IBV HA into virions and localization of viruses in lipid raft microdomains during entry. A deletion in the HA tail did not affect the fusion activity of HA, but yet it strongly reduced viral propagation and incorporation of HAs into virions. Interestingly, the phenotype of the HA truncation mutant was partially rescued by a compensatory E136K mutation in M1 suggesting that the assembly of HA into budding virions depends on an interaction with M1.</p>
