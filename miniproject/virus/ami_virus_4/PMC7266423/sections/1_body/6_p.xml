<p id="Par7">Hoffmann et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] suggested a serine protease inhibitor camostat mesylate, which blocks TMPRSS2 activity, might constitute a treatment option. Another option to regulate TMPRSS2 expression could be androgen receptor antagonists commonly used in metastatic prostate cancer treatment. Those molecules are well-know with side-effects that could be managed easily, especially for a short-term administration. Enzalutamide has been shown to down-regulate TMPRRS2 on cell lines. In the same way, long time exposure to estradiol led to down-regulation of TMPRSS2 [
