<p id="Par6">A putative androgen dependence for virus cell entry relative to high expression of TMPRSS2 in men could explain the male mortality displacement. To our knowledge, there is few comparisons between men and women on TMPRSS2 respiratory tract expression. Recently, in a study comparing patients with severe asthma and healthy people, gene expression of ACE2 and TMPRRS2 were similar in the both groups. However, among asthma patients, male gender, African Americans race, and history of diabetes mellitus, was associated with higher expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 [
