<p id="Par5">Considering this interplay, we hypothesize that androgens could upregulate TMPRSS2 expression in pneumocytes and consequently facilitates the viral entry into target cells. Augmented TMPRSS2 expression was also found to be associated with increased risk of severe influenza upon infection with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus and with increased susceptibility to H7N9 FLUAV infection [
