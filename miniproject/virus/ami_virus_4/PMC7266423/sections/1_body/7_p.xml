<p id="Par8">We are also aware that gender is associated with social norm and behaviors than can also induce different bias. The reasons for a true gender difference in the COVID-19 fatality rate could be hormonal, be also related to a non-uniform case definition of the COVID-19, a different treatment regimen, work-environment factors, gender-specific immune-defense factors. Another important bias could be smoking history that is according different countries more pronounced in men. However, daily smokersâ€™ rate in patients with symptomatic COVID-19 could be lower as compared to the general population [
