<p>The study of the function of HuNoV proteins has been hindered because, for decades, there was no efficient cell culture system for these viruses. However, various investigators have carried out studies of the HuNoV structural proteins. VP1, which can self-assemble and form VLPs, has facilitated the development of candidate vaccines based on these structures. In contrast, the development of research based on NS proteins of HuNoV has been limited to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cultures that have provided information about their role in the replication and the pathogenesis of HuNoV.
