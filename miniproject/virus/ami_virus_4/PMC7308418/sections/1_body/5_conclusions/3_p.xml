<p>Host susceptibility factors, such as HBGAs, are essential for HuNoV infection. The 
 <italic>fut2</italic> gene determines the secretory and the non-secretory characteristics of those individuals who present or do not present the active form of the FUT2 enzyme, respectively. The specific patterns by which HuNoV binds to these HBGAs can be classified into two groups: (i) those with HBGA type A/B binding patterns that recognize A and/or B and H antigens, but not the antigens of Lewis and (ii) those that have Lewis antigen binding patterns and bind only with the Lewis and/or H antigens.
