<p>Furthermore, the correlation between neutralizing antibody titers and protection against future infections is also unclear. It has been shown that the serum antibodies in volunteers are capable of blocking the binding of NV VLPs to HBGAs (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). Specifically, it was observed that only 20–30% of people who had pre-existing anti-NV antibodies had pre-existing blocking antibody titers. Moreover, between 90 and 100% of those volunteers, after the challenge with NV, generated blocking antibody titers (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). However, none of these studies has tested a correlation between blocking antibody titers and clinical outcomes. Interestingly, the convalescent cross-blocking serum of the GI VLP–HBGA interaction was tested and it was found that each volunteer demonstrated a unique pattern of VLP blocking (
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). Similarly, other studies have shown a high activity of blocking the binding of GII.4 VLPs to HBGA H type 3 in the serum of uninfected children during a waterborne outbreak of acute gastroenteritis, suggesting that strong blocking activity correlated with protection against HuNoV (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). Moreover, an early study showed that strains from different genogroups are antigenically dissimilar (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). Specifically, it was demonstrated that a NV (GI.1) failed to confer immunity to subsequent disease caused by the Hawaii virus (GII.1) and the opposite. In contrast, NV conferred immunity to a later challenge with the Montgomery County virus (GI.5), suggesting an antigenic relatedness between genotypes within a genogroup (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). However, it is not always the case since by measuring cross-reactivity and cross-blockade activity, using serum samples from HuNoV-infected patients, limited cross-reactivity was found but no cross-blockade activity between GII.4 and GII.17, suggesting that GII.4-specific immunity does not provide efficient protection against the GII.17 genotype (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>).
