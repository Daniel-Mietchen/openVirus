<p>Only a few reports suggest that the effectors of the IFN pathways limit HuNoV replication. Specifically, IFN-α has been reported to play a role in controlling HuNoV replication in Huh-7 cells and BHK21 cells, suggesting that IFN production may be one of the host antiviral mechanisms in controlling HuNoV infection (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). Furthermore, the following evidences suggest that the type I and III IFN systems can play an important role in controlling HuNoV infections: (a) high IFN-α cytokine production has been detected in the intestinal contents and the serum of pigs inoculated with a GII.4 strain (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>); (c) NV replication in Huh-7 cells, after transfection with genomic NV RNA, is inhibited when cells are pre-treated with the supernatant from cells that have been transfected with the IFN inductor, poly inosinic/polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), to induce IFNα/β production (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>); and (d) bile acids allow the replication of GI.1, GII.3, and GII.17 HuNoV strains and enhance it in GII.4 variants in human intestinal enteroids (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Interestingly, bile acids have previously been reported to down-regulate type I and III IFN pathways and enhance the growth of the porcine enteric calicivirus (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). The latter strongly suggests that the downregulation of these IFN pathways allows and enhances HuNoV infection in human cells, although it has been challenging to prove it. Additionally, permissive NV genome replication after transfecting NV RNA in Huh-7 cells does not induce strong type I IFN responses (
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). Using the NV RNA transfection method described by Guix et al. it was likewise recently reported that HuNoV does not induce type I or type III IFN pathway in the human cell line 293FT (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>). Nevertheless, further studies are required since these cell types are not necessarily suitable to evaluate these IFN responses.
