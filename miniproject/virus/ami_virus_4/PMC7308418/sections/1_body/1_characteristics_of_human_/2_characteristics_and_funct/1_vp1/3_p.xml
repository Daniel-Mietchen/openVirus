<p>On the other hand, the 
 <italic>P</italic> domain of NV VP1, which comprises from residue 225 to the C-terminal end of the protein, is the domain that protrudes from the shell of the capsid (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The 
 <italic>P</italic> domain contributes to the control of the size and the stability of the HuNoV capsid because it establishes intermolecular contacts between dimeric VP1 subunits (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). It has also been observed that the 
 <italic>P</italic> domains do not form VLPs. Nevertheless, the 
 <italic>P</italic> domain can bind to the histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) using the same patterns as the native viral capsid, playing a role in the virusâ€“cell receptor interaction (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). This domain is further divided into two subdomains: P1 and P2 (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).
