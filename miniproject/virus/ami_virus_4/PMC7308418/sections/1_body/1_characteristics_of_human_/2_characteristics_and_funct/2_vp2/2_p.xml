<p>A comparative analysis of the genomic regions of HuNoV sequences determined that the evolutionary rate of the region encoding the VP2 protein (GII.P4 Den Haag 2006b) is of 8.99 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year, being higher compared to the evolutionary rate of VP1 (5.94 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year), suggesting that this protein is under positive selection and likely involved in interactions with host restriction factors (
