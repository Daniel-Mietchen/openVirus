<p>VP1 is the main structural protein of the capsid of HuNoVs. It has an approximate molecular weight of 58 kDa, determined by expressing the NV ORF2 in a baculovirus expression system (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Moreover, the three-dimensional structure of the NV capsid revealed that the empty capsid has a diameter of 38 nm, with an icosahedral symmetry of 
 <italic>T</italic> = 3, which is composed of 90 VP1 dimers (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Likewise, a structural analysis of the NV capsid using X-ray crystallography showed that it has two distinct substructures, the shell (
 <italic>S</italic>) and the protruding (
 <italic>P</italic>) domains, which are linked by a flexible hinge (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).
