<p>Another

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), suggesting a role in HuNoV replication for this structural protein. Interestingly, this RdRp regulation activity is a characteristic shared by VP1, P48, and VP2 proteins (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Finally, HuNoV VP2 can also have a role in modulating the immune response of the host based on studies done with murine norovirus (MNV) VP2 protein. However, this possibility has not yet been proven for HuNoV (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Therefore, VP2 appears to be a versatile structural protein that may have many different functions in the replicative cycle and the pathogenesis of HuNoV.
