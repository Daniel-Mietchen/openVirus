<p>Furthermore, in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transfection study in RAW-Blue murine macrophages, it was determined that VPg of different HuNoVs genogroups can induce cell cycle arrest in phases G0/G1. The VPg of GI and GII increases the percentage of G0/G1 cellular phases to 85 and 60%, respectively. Furthermore, it was identified that the cell cycle arrest is induced by the conserved motif KGKxKxGRG in the N-terminal region which is found in the VPg proteins of all the norovirus genogroups, except for GIII. These findings demonstrate that the N-terminal end of VPg is essential to arrest the cell cycle in G1/G0 and promotes HuNoV replication (
