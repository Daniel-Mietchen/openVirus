<p>Additionally, the HuNoV protease has an intracellular precursor form, called ProPol, which has been shown to have protease and polymerase activities, partially processing the polyprotein encoded by ORF1 (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Interestingly, ProPol has an optimal activity at pH between 8.6 and 9.0, increasing its activity at a higher pH than the viral protease by itself. Moreover, ProPol has higher activity (64%) than the mature protease (34%) when the pH decreases to around 6.8. Also, both enzymes are inhibited when exposed to NaCl, KCl, MgCl, and MnCl
 <sub>2</sub>. Nevertheless, the HuNoV ProPol is more sensitive to CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> exposure than the protease itself (

 <sup>+2</sup> (
