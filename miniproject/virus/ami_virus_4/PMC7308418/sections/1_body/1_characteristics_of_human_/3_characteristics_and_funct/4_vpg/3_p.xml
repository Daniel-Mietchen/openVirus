<p>Moreover, unlike the eukaryotic genome, the NV mRNA lacks a coding region for a cap structure and it does not have an internal ribosome binding site. Therefore, it was described that VPg can participate in the initiation of viral RNA translation by binding to the cell translation initiation factor eIF3 (
