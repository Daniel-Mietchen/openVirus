<p>Furthermore, an analysis of the molecular evolution of the region coding for the Pol protein, based on different HuNoV GII genome sequences, suggests that the common ancestor of the Pol region of GI, GII, GIII, and GIV diverged ~1,150 years ago. Likewise, the Pol region of GII diverged from GIV about 570 years ago, giving origin to three main lineages of HuNoV GII (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Besides that, it has been estimated that the evolution of the HuNoV GII.4 Pol protein presents ~4.33 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> to 8.98 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions/site/year (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). It was identified that the GII Pol protein has several amino acid substitutions (39–107 sites) in different genotypes, while the negative selection sites were found to be different for each genotype (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). These results suggest that the Pol region of HuNoV GII has a rapid evolution with several amino acid substitutions and that the evolutionary mechanism may be different for each genotype (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Therefore, the HuNoV polymerase is not only a pivotal protein for virus replication and transcription processes but also a useful NS protein for the classification of the
