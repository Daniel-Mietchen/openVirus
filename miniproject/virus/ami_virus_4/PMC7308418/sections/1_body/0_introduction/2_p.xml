<p>HuNoV belongs to the family 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>, specifically to the genus 
 <italic>Norovirus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), which has recently been subdivided into 10 different genogroups (GI–GX) (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Only GI, GII, and GIV infect and cause acute gastroenteritis in humans. These genogroups are classified according to the similarity of the highly conserved regions of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp-NS7) or the conserved amino acidic regions of the capsid protein, VP1 (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The HuNoV genogroups are subdivided into different genotypes based on mutations that are produced by selective pressure and/or other factors to which these viruses are exposed (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). These mutations produce different variants or strains of the same genotype. For example, within the GII.4 genotype, Sydney and New Orleans are the most prevalent variants worldwide (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These variants may also recombine with others, giving rise to new recombinant strains, including the pandemic GII.P16–GII.4 Sydney strain, which is highly contagious (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Although the most prevalent genotype worldwide is GII.4 (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), cases caused by other highly infectious genotypes, such as GII.17, have been detected (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).
