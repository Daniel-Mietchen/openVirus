<p>While this process occurs, the p48 protein migrates to the endoplasmic reticulum and to the trans-Golgi network where its disassembly is induced (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), causing interference of the signaling pathways of NFÎºB, MAPK, and PI3K-Akt, which are important for the host's immune response (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). p48 binds to protein A that is associated with VAP-A, which participates in SNARE-mediated vesicular transport and causes a blockage in cell protein transport (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Besides that, the effect caused by p48 is reinforced by the action of p22, which synergistically contributes to the disassembly of the trans-Golgi network (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). P22 also blocks the traffic of COPII-coated vesicles since it has a motif that closely resembles an export signal from the ER (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). p22 and NTPase favor the pro-apoptotic activity of the cell, facilitating the release of HuNoV virions from the host cell (
