<p>After the interaction of VP1 with the cell receptor(s), internalization of the virus and subsequent disassembly of the viral capsid occur, releasing the RNA into the cell cytoplasm. The exact mechanism by which these two processes take place has not yet been described. Once the viral genome is released, the VPg protein, which is covalently linked at the 5â€² end of the viral genome, interacts with the cellular translation initiation factors, such as eIF3, generating a translation complex (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). This activity has been described in several caliciviruses, suggesting that this function is highly conserved (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). Subsequently, the major and the minor ribosomal subunits are recruited, resulting in the translation of the non-structural polyprotein which contains the non-structural proteins of the virus (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). Once the non-structural polyprotein of HuNoV is generated, the protease is auto-cleaved. Subsequently, the protease co- and post-translationally cleaves the rest of the polyprotein, generating three protein precursors: p48/NTPase, p22/VPg, and Pro/Pol (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Currently, the enzymatic functions of the p48/NTPase and p22/VPg complexes have not been described. However, the ProPol precursor has two enzymatic functions: protease and polymerase activities. It should be noted that the ProPol complex has a higher enzymatic performance compared to the activity of both proteins separately (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Subsequently, the three precursors are cleaved by the action of the ProPol complex, which in turn self-cleaves and generates the six individual non-structural proteins. These individual proteins have specific functions in the replicative and the infective cycles.
