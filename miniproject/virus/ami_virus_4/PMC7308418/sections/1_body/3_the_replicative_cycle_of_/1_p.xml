<p>The HuNoV replicative cycle starts with the interaction of the virus with the target cell through the recognition of specific cellular receptors and, in some cases, other cellular components. In the case of HuNoV, the main receptor is still unknown. However, some co-receptors and cell-binding factors have been described, including HBGA and bile acids among others (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). HuNoV binds to the cell by the interaction of the P2 region present in the 
 <italic>P</italic> domain of the VP1 protein with a still unknown receptor and some host co-receptors such as HBGA (
