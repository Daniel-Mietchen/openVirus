  <p>Molecular structure of human norovirus (HuNoV). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> A schematic representation of the human norovirus virion showing its 90-dimer protein surface of the VP1 structural protein of the capsid. The structural protein VP2 (1–8 proteins per virion) is shown within the viral capsid. The non-structural VPg protein, covalently bound to the 5′ end of the RNA genome (ssRNA+) in a positive sense and a poly-adenine tail at the 3′ ends are also displayed. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> General scheme of the HuNoV genome organization. ORF1 encodes the non-structural proteins: p48, NTPase, p22, VPg, Protease, and RdRp. The ORF2 encodes for the major structural protein VP1 and the ORF3 encodes for the minor structural protein VP2. The subgenomic RNA bound to VPg encoding VP1 and VP2 is indicated below the ORFs. VPg is represented as a circle linked to genomic and subgenomic RNAs.
