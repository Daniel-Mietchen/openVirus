  <p>Model of a Replicative HuNoV Cycle and Function of its Proteins. (1) The replication process begins with the binding of the P2 region present in the 
   <italic>P</italic> domain of VP1 to a still unknown receptor and some host co-receptors such as HBGA; (2, 3) After this union there is an internalization of the virus in the cell and a disassembly of the virus releasing the RNA in the cell cytoplasm; (4, 5) once in the cytoplasm, the covalently linked VPg protein at the 5â€² end induces the binding of translation initiation factors, such as eIF3, and the binding of major and minor ribosomal subunits, producing genome translation viral thus generating a non-structural polyprotein, the VP1 protein, and the VP2 protein; (6) after this, the Pro protein cleaves the polyprotein generating three precursors, but only the Pro-Pol precursor has enzymatic activity, these precursors are subsequently cleaved generating the six individual proteins; (7) subsequently: 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The P48 protein migrates to the reticulum and subsequently to the Golgi. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The NTPase protein will help in the replication process. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The P22 protein binds to the vesicles coated with COPII and contributes synergistically with the disassembly of the Golgi, and this protein together with the NTPase acts favoring the pro-apoptotic activity of the cell. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> the VPg protein participates both in the recruitment of translation initiation factors, and with the help of the replication process, in addition to this, it has a replication complex formation function. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Pro protein has a non-structural polyprotein cleavage activity. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> The Pol protein exerts its function in viral replication, whose activity is greatly enhanced by the action of P48. On the other hand, the VP1 and VP2 proteins are generated through a subgenomic RNA, which after translation takes place the assembly of the virions and subsequently, the output.
