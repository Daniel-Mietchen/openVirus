<p id="p0100">The interval of 10 days between the onset of viral illness respiratory symptoms and the first manifestations of Guillain–Barré syndrome in our case, is similar to cases reported by Galan(
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Galán et al., 2020</xref>) and Virani(
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Virani et al., 2020</xref>). This interval was 5–10 days in case series by Toscano that is quiet the same as occurs during or after other infections(
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Toscano et al., 2020</xref>). Considering the temporal association, we hypothesize that there is causal relationship between GBS and SARS-CoV-2 infection, but there is no evidence of direct invasion of nerves or nerve roots by virus, as the CSF was negative for SARS-CoV-2 in patient reported by Alberti(
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Alberti et al., 2020</xref>).
