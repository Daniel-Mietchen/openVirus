<p id="p0045">Seven days after onset of neurologic symptom regarding worsening of paresthesia and weakness the patient was referred for neurologic evaluation. In the first look at neurology office the patient was unable to stand and walk without assistance. The neurologic examination revealed normal mental status and speech. Motor examination showed absent muscle stretch reflexes in lower extremities and diminished reflexes in upper extremities. There was symmetric limb weakness (Medical Research Council score 4/5 at upper limbs and 3/5 at lower limbs), and symmetric and severe stocking-and-glove hypesthesia and reduced vibration and position sense at all 4 limbs (more pronounced at lower limbs). There was no cranial nerve deficit. Plantar responses were flexor. The patients complained of pain and an aching discomfort in the muscles, mainly those of the shoulder, hips, thighs, and back. There was no dyspnea, and cough if present was occasional. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies showed absence of right tibial and both peroneal nerves compound muscle action potentials (CMAP). F waves were unobtainable at lower limbs. Left tibial, Right and left median, and ulnar nerves distal latencies were markedly prolonged and velocities and amplitudes (with spatial and temporal dispersion) were decreased. All sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) latencies were prolonged and amplitudes decreased (
