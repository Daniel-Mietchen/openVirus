<p>Even though the contributions made by PHDs during the COVID-19 outbreak are undeniably significant, the role of PHDs is often not fully recognized. Early in this outbreak, PHDs familiar with the specific needs of their own areas of service led local quarantine efforts, set up screening centers, and even suggested drive-through testing before it became the national standard. These experiences also enabled them to cope with the circumstances of the places they were dispatched to in a high-quality and timely manner. However, their opinions regarding issues such as the efficient placement of PHDs and the prioritization of testing for symptomatic people were often ignored by administrative authorities. This ineffective usage of the PHD system and PHDsâ€™ expertise may slow down quarantine efforts. A similar scenario occurred during the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009, when PHDs were sent to fight against the outbreak but were largely treated as a subsidiary to the government, and the PHD system remained the same afterwards.</p>
