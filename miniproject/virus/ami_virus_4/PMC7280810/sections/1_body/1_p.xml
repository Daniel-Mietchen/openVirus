<p>There is a hidden key: a specific group of doctors known as public health doctors (PHDs). PHDs are a Korea-specific group of young (20s-30s) male doctors who work in medically underserved areas, including rural public health centers, airport quarantines, and correctional facilities, for 3 years as a substitute for their mandatory military service. There are around 2000 PHDs across the nation. Approximately 20% of them become PHDs straight out of residency, and 20% do so after their intern year, while approximately 60% of them have just finished medical school. This specific group of doctors was also at the frontline of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome, 2009 H1N1 influenza, and 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks. In late February 2020, when the Korean city of Daegu was hit by a super-spreading event, around 200 PHDs were dispatched immediately to Daegu within a 1-week period to join in efforts to test for the virus and to prevent a widespread COVID-19 outbreak. Although other doctors and nurses volunteered, PHDs comprised the main group of doctors who enabled the high diagnostic rate in Korea; more specifically, PHDs visited members of the Shincheonji religious group [
