<p>Second, more systematic education and training should be given to PHDs. COVID-19 has shown discrepancies among PHDs in their preparation and expertise, as their education and training have been based on personal pursuits without systematic support. Field epidemiologists furnish an excellent example of this issue, as few PHDs are trained for the position, resulting in a lack of in-depth epidemiological investigations. However, just as soldiers always train and prepare themselves even when there is no war, PHDs need to be always prepared to act both as primary physicians for underserved people and as public health experts. Moreover, this mandatory 3-year period of service can serve as an entrance to a public health career, especially if individuals have a positive and fulfilling experience during this time. If they are properly trained during their period of service, they will be able to become more competent future field epidemiologists, correctional physicians, and officers of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Continually passing down the know-how and expertise of trained PHDs will help prepare Korea for public health crises.</p>
