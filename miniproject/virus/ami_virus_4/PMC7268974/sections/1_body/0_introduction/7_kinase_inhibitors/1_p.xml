<p id="Par14">It is suggested that an inhibitor of Janus kinase (JAK) called baricitinib could prevent the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells and also inhibit the inflammation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) and AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) are endocytosis regulators. Baricitinib might inhibit SARS COV-2 entry by disruption of these regulators. Other JAK inhibitors such as fedratinib and ruxolitinib are also candidates for decreasing inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 individuals [
