 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]; chloroquine can prevent pH-dependent steps of the replication of several viruses such as SARS-CoV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Gautret et al. claimed that the treatment of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine (chloroquine analog) caused the significant viral load reduction/disappearance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. However, other researchers did not reveal the same effect. Moreover, high-dose chloroquine diphosphate in combination with azithromycin or oseltamivir resulted in high rates of death and adverse cardiac events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Clinicians also cautioned that the increased consumption of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine can lead to their shortage that might create a problem for people suffering systemic lupus erythematosus, other rheumatological disorders, primary Sjögren syndrome, dermatological diseases, and antiphospholipid syndrome [
