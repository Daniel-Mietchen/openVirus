<p id="Par24">Favipiravir is a new type of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibitor. Additionally, it is capable of blocking the replication of other RNA viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Favipiravir is converted into an active phosphoribosylated form (favipiravir-RTP) in cells and is recognized as a substrate by viral RNA polymerase, therefore inhibiting RNA polymerase activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Favipiravir may have potential antiviral action on SARS-CoV-2, which is a RNA virus. In a clinical trial on favipiravir for the treatment of COVID-19, the preliminary results indicated that favipiravir had more potent antiviral action than lopinavir/ritonavir [
