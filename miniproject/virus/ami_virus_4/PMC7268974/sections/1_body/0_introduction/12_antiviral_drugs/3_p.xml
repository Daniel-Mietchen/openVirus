<p id="Par23">It has been previously reported that the protease inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritonavir, used to treat infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>], could improve the outcome of MERS-CoV- [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] and SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]â€“infected patients. Initially, lopinavir and ritonavir were hypothesized to inhibit the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease of SARS and MERS, and seemed to be associated with improved outcomes of patients with SARS in a non-randomized open-label trial. In a case report from Korea, it has been shown that the viral loads of a SARS-CoV-2 significantly decreased after lopinavir/ritonavir treatment [

HIV protease belongs to the aspartic protease family, whereas the two coronavirus proteases are from the cysteine protease family. Moreover, HIV protease inhibitors were specifically optimized to fit the C2 symmetry in the catalytic site of the HIV protease dimer; however, this C2-symmetric pocket is absent in coronavirus proteases. If HIV protease inhibitors alter host pathways to indirectly interfere with coronavirus infections, their potency remains a concern [
