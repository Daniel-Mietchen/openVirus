<p id="Par6">Although the pathogenesis of this disease has not been fully understood, it seems that the host immune responses play an important role. Aberrant host immune response causes lung tissue damage, reduced lung capacity, and finally respiratory failure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These cells produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including TNF-α, IL-12, IL-6, IFNγ, and IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) [
