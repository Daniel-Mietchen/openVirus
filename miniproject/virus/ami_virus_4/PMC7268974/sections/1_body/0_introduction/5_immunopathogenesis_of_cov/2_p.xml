<p id="Par7">Adoptive immunity plays a major role in viral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8+ T cells) are the main T cell subsets that destroy infected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, the number of these cells is one of the major factors for clearance of the viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Preliminarily, it was indicated that the number of total T cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, reduced significantly in COVID-19 patients. This decrease was more intensive in ICU admitted patients compared with that in non-ICU admitted individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is also reported that T cell clonal exhaustion occurred during the infection and the expression of certain T cell surface markers like PD1 (programmed cell death protein 1) and TIM-3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule-3) markedly increased [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The cytokine storm occurred in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that led to increased expression of NKG2A (natural-killer group 2, member A) on cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) and NK cells. This upregulation suppressed CTL and NK function and cytokine secretion [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is suggested that inflammatory cytokines, TNF-Î± and IL-6, mainly originated from apoptotic monocytes (CD14+CD16+) and macrophages and induced T CD4+ and T CD8+ cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These excessive inflammatory responses might result in respiratory system pathology and dysfunction [
