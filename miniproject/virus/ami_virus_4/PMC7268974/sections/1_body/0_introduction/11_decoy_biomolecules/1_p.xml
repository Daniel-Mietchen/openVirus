<p id="Par20">As mentioned above, SARS-COV-2 attaches to ACE2 receptor to invade the host cells, particularly alveolar epithelial cells. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has strong affinity to ACE2 receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. This attachment may enhance viral entry and replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. It is assumed that targeting this interaction and using soluble form of ACE2 could be a potential therapeutic approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Studies on COVID-19 indicated that ACE2 injection could competitively neutralize the virus and improve lung injury [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Recently, a novel therapeutic approach was developed based on soluble ACE2 interaction with the virus. It has been shown that human recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 from entering the host cells, decreasing the viral load in a dose-dependent manner. This molecule inhibits viral infection of human blood vessels and kidney organoids. These data indicated that hrsACE2 was effective in early-stage patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Since the inhibitory effects of hrsACE2 were not complete, it is preliminarily considered that the virus may use a second receptor or co-factor such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. In this regard, TMPRSS2 inhibitor was approved for clinical application in COVID-19 to inhibit the entry of virus [
