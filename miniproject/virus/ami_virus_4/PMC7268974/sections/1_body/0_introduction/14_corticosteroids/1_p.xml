Additionally, corticosteroids have an anti-inflammatory effect to diminish systemic inflammation, reduce exudative fluid in the lung tissue, and inhibit further diffused alveolar damage, which can relieve hypoxemia which can protect the lungs effectively and prevent further progression of respiratory insufficiency [

It is supposed that patient selection, half-life, formulation, and dosage of the corticosteroids are important factors determining the clinical outcome. In this regard, a preprinted study indicated that in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS early short-term and low dose of corticosteroid (methylprednisolone) improved clinical manifestation and long lesions [
