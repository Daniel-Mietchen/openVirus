<p id="Par19">LIF nanoparticles (LIF-NPs) indicated clinical benefits in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal models. LIF-NPs possessed immunomodulatory effects and increased self-tolerance in animal models for ARDS [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Activation and polarization of macrophages play a major role in the initiation and intensity of inflammation, respectively, in ALI/ARDS. Peptide-coated gold nanoparticles could alleviate lung inflammation through inducing M1-to-M2 macrophage phenotype transition and increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) in the lung of acute lung injury (ALI) mice [
