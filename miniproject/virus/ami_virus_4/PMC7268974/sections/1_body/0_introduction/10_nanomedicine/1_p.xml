<p id="Par18">LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor) is one of the important cytokines to protect the respiratory system and promote lung homeostasis during viral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. This cytokine modulates severe adverse events during ARDS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Up to now, there is no study investigating the role of LIF in SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) model, it has been shown that overexpression of LIF enhanced the recovery of lungs during pneumonia. Neutralization of the LIF induced alveolar damage and chemokine secretion [
