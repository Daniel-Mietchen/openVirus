<p id="Par10">It has been shown that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could be an effective tool for the treatment of viral infectious diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Different techniques have been used to develop mAbs including phage display library, hybridoma, single B cell isolation, and transgenic mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Various monoclonal antibodies developed against MERS and SARS infections include m396, 80R, and S3.1 against SARS and LCA60 for the treatment of MERS disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These mAbs limited virus replication and facilitated lung recovery in animal models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. S protein is also the most immunogenic determinant of coronaviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Several mAbs target receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the virus spike (S) glycoprotein and inhibit the virus to invade the host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It is reported that mAbs against SARS-CoV-1 could cross react with SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. It is indicated in the preprint that mAb 1A9 that targets the S protein of SARS-CoV-1 could interact with SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].
