 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Past experiences from SARS and MERS viral infections indicated that passive immunotherapy could be a potential treatment strategy for the patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is considered that passive immunotherapy could also be beneficial in SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Extracting neutralizing antibodies from recovered individuals with high titer of antibodies in sera and transfusion to infected patient could deactivate the virus. However, neutralization activity of these antibodies is not fully understood. It has been showed that neutralizing antibodies are not long lasting and only the recently recovered patients are suitable candidates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It has also been reported that the neutralizing antibody titers vary among the patients and elderly patients had higher antibody titer compared with young recovered individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. It is supposed that convalescent serum administration may induce phagocytosis and antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. One important implications for using convalescent serum is the risk for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. It is supposed that these neutralizing antibodies may enhance other viral infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Another major limitation of this strategy is donor shortage. However, by increasing the number of recovered individuals, this limitation would be solved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].
