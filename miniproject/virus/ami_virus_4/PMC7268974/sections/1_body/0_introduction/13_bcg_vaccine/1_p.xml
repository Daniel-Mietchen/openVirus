<p id="Par25">Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG; weakened strain of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>) vaccination could have protective effects against COVID-19 infection. There are several mechanisms that ensure BCG-induced non-specific protection and are actively studied. BCG and viral antigens have similar molecular structure; so after vaccination, B and T cells can recognize both pathogen types. Moreover, BCG vaccination results in the so-called trained immunity—epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cell types [

Monocytes of vaccinated individuals had higher expression of different surface markers of activation and synthesis of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IFNγ, and TNF) in response to infection than those of non-vaccinated ones; so non-mycobacterium pathogens, e.g., staphylococci, yellow fever virus, and influenza, can be removed faster [
