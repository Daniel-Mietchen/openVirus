  <p>Novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of clinical complications of COVID-19. (a) Passive immunotherapy using serum of immunized individuals. (b) Monoclonal antibodies can directly target virus particles. Also, mAbs can be used to eliminate crucial cytokines in progression of inflammation, e.g., IL-6. (c) The effector cells in adoptive immunotherapy can be used to specifically target infected cells and enhance anti-viral immune responses. (d) Mesenchymal stromal cells are key players in immunomodulation of severe immune response. The paracrine effect of these cells can tune down immune reaction. (e) Using nanostructures for drug delivery in different medical applications. (f) Recombinant ACE2 receptor protein in soluble form attaches to viral particles. (g) Antiviral medicines can prohibit viral proliferation</p>
