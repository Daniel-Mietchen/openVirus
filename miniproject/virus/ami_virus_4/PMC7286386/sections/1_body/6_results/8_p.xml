<p>In 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, we found that the full (ie, using 43 predictors), simplified (ie, using 24 predictors), and the minimal (ie, using 10 predictors) models produced comparable performances, for instance, the AUC of the full model was 76.7% (95% CI, 61.0–82.7%), that of the simplified model was 76.0% (95% CI, 56.8–82.1%), and that of the minimal model was 75.7% (95% CI, 56.1–82.1%).
