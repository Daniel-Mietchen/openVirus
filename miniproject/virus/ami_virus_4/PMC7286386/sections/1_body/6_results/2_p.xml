<p>Using the 72 tested hyperparameter configurations of the full BRT model (ie, fitted using all available predictors), 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figures 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup2">2</xref> show the out-of-sample predictive performance and the goodness-of-fit performance, respectively. Further analyses were based on the following optimal hyperparameters: data-partitioning ratio (
 <italic>P</italic> = .65), tree complexity (tc = 27), learning rate (lr = 0.001), and bag fraction (bf = 0.75). In the simplified model we retained 24 survival predictors (out of the 43 originally included in the full model), accounting for 96% of the RI of the full model (ie, model with all candidate predictors).
