<p>Here, we used BRTs to identify, using a nonparametric approach, the predictors of CFR for the West African epidemic, imputed unreported survival outcomes, and combined the imputed and reported survival outcomes to re-estimate CFRs for the epidemic. Finally, we compared the CFR estimates obtained without data imputation with estimates obtained including data imputation and estimates adjusted for model imperfection.</p>
