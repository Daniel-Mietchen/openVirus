<p>The case fatality ratio (CFR), the proportion of EVD cases who died [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], remains a challenging quantity to estimate due to undetected cases, incomplete data on detected cases, and the lack of laboratory confirmation of probable and suspected cases. CFR estimates may vary because of unreported survival outcomes, time of case diagnosis, and the statistical methods used for estimation [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For instance, 14 694 (44%) of the survival outcomes for confirmed, probable, and suspected cases are unreported in the dataset analyzed by the World Health Organization (WHO) Ebola Response Team [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Using clinical, laboratory, and field surveillance data, we imputed unreported outcomes based on models fitted to observed outcome data. Imputed outcomes have previously been used in other contexts to generate baseline estimates of CFR necessary in evaluating interventions and designing randomized controlled trials [
