<p>Country-level CFR estimates were consistent for Guinea, which had the highest proportion of complete outcome data (99.5%; ie, 3740 out of 3757 cases; see 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) among the 3 countries. The relatively high adjusted CFR estimates obtained in Liberia and Sierra Leone compared with estimates without and with imputation, and the associated relatively wide CI, could reflect the true CFR in these 2 countries but also possibly the changing data-collection practices over time. For instance, Liberia switched from an aggregate system of reporting to an individual-based system of reporting that could have affected data curation at the country level [

 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Adjusted CFRs account for the estimated sensitivity and specificity of the BRT imputation model and the dependence of missingness on characteristics of the cases (eg, age and reporting delay).
