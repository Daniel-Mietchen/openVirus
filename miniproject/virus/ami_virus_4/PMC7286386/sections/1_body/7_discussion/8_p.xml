<p>While previous studies show clinical characteristics indicative of death with the intention of having a profile that could be used in subsequent case triaging [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the model built in this study cannot be used in such manner as it lacked clinically significant predictors, such as viral load, which were not captured in the dataset. Rather, the output of our analyses should be used to inform resource allocation and care planning. Also, our analysis provides a baseline CFR against which the CFR observed with interventions (such as a new treatment) could be assessed. As a known predictor of EVD CFR [

 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], viral load data, where available, should be used in future attempts to further refine CFR estimates of EVD. If some survival outcomes were incorrectly recorded during data collection and/or if some cases were missing entirely from the database, then, in the absence of at least some gold-standard data, no estimation strategy can fully account for such limitations and this may be in part responsible for the imperfect nature of the imputation process.
