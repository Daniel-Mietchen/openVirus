<p>The predictors retained in the simplified model were broadly similar to those reported in the literature and the identified clinical predictors reflected the symptomatic profile of EVD cases during the West African epidemic and in previous outbreaks [

 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Demographic predictors of age, case classification, reporting delay, quarter, and district were important predictors of CFR, which broadly agrees with discussions in the literature suggesting that, notwithstanding the clinical presentations of EVD, demographic factors were predictors of EVD fatalities [

 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Age-dependent CFR variation, consistent with previous studies [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], suggests a biological effect. Potential biological reasons include variation in the immunocompetency of children and young adults and the increased likelihood of comorbidities in aged individuals [

 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The CFR increased with increasing reporting delay, suggesting that early case reporting could have improved survival outcomes, although previous findings have suggested that early reporting was insufficient to increase survival probability [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A clinical consideration is that people who were reported late may have been more likely to die because their symptoms persisted while those with milder symptoms would have recovered earlier and were less likely to report as patients with Ebola.
