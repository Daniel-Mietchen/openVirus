<p>We have used the BRT to impute for unreported outcomes and produced improved (ie, representative of all cases and adjusted for BRT imputation performance) CFR estimates for the 2013â€“2016 West African Ebola epidemic. To our knowledge, the dataset used in this study (33 338 cases) is the largest case-level data used to characterize the CFR of EVD.</p>
