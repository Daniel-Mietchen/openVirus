<p>Model simplification suggested that district, hospitalization status, age, case classification, quarter, reporting delay, anorexia, difficult breathing, fever, and fatigue were the most important predictors retained in the model. Most bleeding predictors (except for unexplained bleeding) were removed, which corroborates the existing literature suggesting that external bleeding was not a prominent characteristic of the West African Ebola epidemic [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22â€“24</xref>]. Consequently, the predictive value of bleeding predictors was limited compared with the other (eg, age, reporting delay, district, and fever) predictors of CFR. Simplification removed some clinical predictors, but we found that the significance of clinical predictors varied with sample size and the subset of data included in the analysis. For example, hiccups occurrence was excluded from the final (simplified) model in our analysis but was found to have a predictive value in an earlier study conducted in Sierra Leone [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], although larger sample sizes would be needed to validate the significance of those results [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Earlier analyses of the West African epidemic showed that fever was not a significant predictor of the CFR [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], while, in contrast, our study identified fever as the ninth most important predictor of the CFR. Further investigations revealed that the occurrence of fever only became a significant predictor in analyses using the datasets compiled after 25 November 2014 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup5">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). From this finding we cannot determine whether the emergence of fever occurrence as an important predictor of the CFR is related to changing clinical presentation of the EVD over time or was caused by changes in reporting practices over the course of the epidemic. The high CFR in patients without fever might also suggest immune evasion [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, survival outcomes were better for patients with anorexia (see Supplementary Results), perhaps because these patients were better medically attended.
