<p>To fit the BRT model, we used the survival outcomes as the dependent variables and the candidate predictors as the independent variables. We evaluated the model performance in terms of multiple measures of predictive accuracyâ€”that is, sensitivity, specificity, proportion of predictions correctly classified, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The performance measures quantify the ability of the BRT model to discriminate between outcomes (death/survival) for the given predictors [
