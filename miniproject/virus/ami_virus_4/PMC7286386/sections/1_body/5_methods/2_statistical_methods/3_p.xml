<p>To identify the model hyperparameters (tree complexity [tc], learning rate [lr], and bag fraction [bf]), multiple BRT models were fitted using different parameter combinations. In total, we explored 72 hyperparameter combinations. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> presents a summary schematic of the analysis and further details of the parameterization are included in the Supplementary Data.
