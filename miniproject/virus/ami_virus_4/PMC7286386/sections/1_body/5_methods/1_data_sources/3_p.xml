<p>The survival outcome for this dataset was reported as the “final status” of cases. Final status was defined as alive, dead, or missing. The fate of cases with missing final status was unknown (eg, cases could have been alive in the communities or later died in the communities but were not reported to, or recorded by, the appropriate authorities). Cases with known final outcomes accounted for 18 644 (56%) of the cases in the dataset.</p>
