<p>Regression modeling has been used widely to predict EVD survival outcomes [

 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It was found that age, sex, country, and fever were correlated with CFR [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, much of the observed heterogeneity remained unaccounted for. Thus, there is a need to use methods that can account for multiple predictors and their interactions as well as limitations of the data available.
