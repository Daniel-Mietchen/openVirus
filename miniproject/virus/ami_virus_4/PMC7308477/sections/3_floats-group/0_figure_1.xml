  <p>Animal origin of human coronaviruses. SARS- CoV 
   <bold>(A)</bold> emerged from bats, infected civets and humans and adapted to these hosts before causing the SARS epidemic. MERS- CoV 
   <bold>(B)</bold> likely spilled over from bats to dromedary camels. SARS-CoV-2 
   <bold>(C)</bold> emerged from bats spilled over to human either directly or by previous infecting pangolins. Reverse zoonosis transmission (from human to cats, dogs, and tiger) refers only to SARS-CoV-2.
