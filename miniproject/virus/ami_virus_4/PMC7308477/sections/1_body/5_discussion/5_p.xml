<p>Based on the available scientific literature, we applied the EnvID framework (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) to facilitate the identification of the environment-disease relationships and connections that may impact on disease burden (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The EnvID framework encompasses 3 interlocking components including: environment, transmission and disease, and it defines three transmission groups: group I, including directly transmitted diseases; group II, including vector-borne diseases; and group III, including environmentally mediated diseases with non-human host. At first, based on the available data, we attempted to attribute COVID-19 to one of these three groups.
