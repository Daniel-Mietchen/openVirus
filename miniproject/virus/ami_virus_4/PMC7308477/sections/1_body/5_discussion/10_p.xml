<p>Attribution of the burden of disease to environmental risks, highlights in fact the importance of environmental protection for people's health and can inform priority setting for targeted management of environmental determinants (

The public health measures to contain COVID-19 spreading are being based on the scientific data currently available that mainly derive from studies on the infection's dynamics observed in industrialized countries. An important bias on the large amount of data produced in China and other Asian countries and the lower contributions from Europe and North America is evident. This is clearly due to the timing and geographic spread of the epidemic. As suggested by the EnvID framework, distal and proximal environmental factors, transmission dynamics and consequent morbidity and lethality may differ in different socio-economic contexts. It is thus essential to collect data on the determinants of infection even in developing countries where the capacities of the healthcare infrastructures, diagnostic and research capacities are very limited. In fact, country socio-economic profiles were shown to have an influence on the growth rate of epidemics so that R0 might differ in different geographic areas (

As an example, FAO warns that the policies to limit the effects of the virus, successfully applied in many industrialized Countries, and based on lockdowns and physical distancing, can spell disaster for the livelihood of individuals and families in developing Countries, leading to food insecurity and deficient nutrition.
