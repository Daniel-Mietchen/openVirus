<p>A study conducted by Setti et al. (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) has shown that pollution may have played a role in the propagation of SARS-CoV-2. Researchers evidenced an association between the exceedances of the legal limits of the PM10 concentrations recorded during the 2 weeks preceding the first peak of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy. This lead could be related to the conditions of airborne particulate matter pollution that may have exerted a boost action on transmission. Animal coronaviruses can replicate in the epithelial cells of both the respiratory and the enteric tracts (
