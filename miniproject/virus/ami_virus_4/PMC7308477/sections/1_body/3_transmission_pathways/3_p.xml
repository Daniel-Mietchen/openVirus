<p>According to WHO and Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>), more information on the potential for persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on foods traded internationally as well as the potential role of food in the transmission of the virus are needed. WHO suggests that the consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, raw milk, or raw animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross- contamination with uncooked foods. Results obtained with SARS-CoV surrogate, Bovine Coronavirus BCoV of the genus Betacoronavirus, showed that contaminated vegetables may serve as a vehicle for transmission through consumption. As an example, Mullis et al. (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) showed that BCoV on lettuce retained infectivity for at least 14 days under household refrigeration conditions. The ability of enteric coronavirus Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) to survive in specific feed ingredients, under modeled conditions simulating shipment, was shown suggesting that contaminated feed ingredients for pigs could serve as transboundary risk factors (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). These data lead to speculate that contaminated ready-to-consume produce may be a potential vehicle for zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses to humans. Awareness regarding the possible roles of water, fresh products, and fecal contamination in coronavirus transmission is required at times of human coronavirus outbreaks. The role of animals in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still debated and need to be clarified. Experimental infection tests conducted in laboratory animals, suggest that SARS-CoV-2 replicates poorly in dogs, pigs, chickens, and ducks, but efficiently in ferrets and cats, with cats transmitting the virus via respiratory droplets (

For these reasons, a possible role of animal hosts as reservoir and a further source of virus for humans cannot be ruled out, especially in hotspots of biodiversity, and in many developing countries characterized by close proximity among human, wild, and domestic animals.
