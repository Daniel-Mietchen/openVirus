<p>Evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 in a wet market in Wuhan, Hubei province, China (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). However, retrospective analyses indicate that SARS-CoV-2 might have spilled somewhere else prior to December 2019 (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Origin of this virus rapidly became one of the greatest concerns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The idea of a laboratory-based origin is not plausible as there is no evidence showing that SARS-CoV-2 is a purposefully manipulated virus (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Also, a snake origin of SARS-CoV-2 can be ruled out as no other coronaviruses have been found in reptiles, and there are not receptor signatures, or other strongly indicative molecular evidence (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) supporting this. It is now recognized that bats such as 
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> are natural viral reservoirs, and that the Malayan pangolin (
 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>) might be the SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host that brought the bat coronavirus to human hosts, even if some studies have proposed that the pangolin, illegally imported into southern China, may be a natural host rather than an intermediate host (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). The pet cases were in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 human case. Also, a Malayan tiger in Bronx Zoo in New York City developed COVID-19 after exposure to an asymptomatically infected worker (
