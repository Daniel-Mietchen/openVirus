<p>Early cases of MERS in Saudi Arabia in 2012; (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) had contact with animals, in particular with dromedary camels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>). Molecular and serological data indicated the presence of MERS viruses in dromedaries with high sequence similarities (&gt;99%) to human MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), and antibodies in camels could be traced back to the eighties (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). More molecular data support that human and camel MERS-CoV isolates belong to the same coronavirus species, and that MERS-CoV originated from the bat gene pool (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Ancestor analysis suggests that MERS-CoV could have spilled from bats to camels some 30 years ago in Africa, and it was subsequently introduced in the Arabian Peninsula by importing camels from the African continent (
