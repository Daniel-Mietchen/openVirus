<p>Climate is a further distal environmental factor that might indirectly influence SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The WHO assumption is that COVID-19 spread will not ameliorate during summer period. The effect of seasons on transmission of COVID-19 is still unknown. A negative correlation between warmer climate and COVID-19 spread has been suggested by a number of pre-print sources (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>) and news. However, Caspi and collaborators conclude that their findings, on possible reduced spread during warm season, should be cautiously interpreted and need to be validated as an association between warmer climate and reduced COVID-19 spread might be due to local patterns of transmission rather than by climate.
