<p>It has been speculated that the warm months of summer in the northern hemisphere might not necessarily reduce transmission below the value of unity as they do for influenza A given the fact that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was estimated 2–3 (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 spreads in Countries characterized by tropical climates, such as Singapore. For this reason, winter is not considered a necessary condition for SARS-CoV-2 diffusion and persistence (

The independence of viral spread from high temperature has been already proved for other coronaviruses such as the SARS- CoV surrogate animal virus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) a diarrheal pathogen of swine and mouse hepatitis virus MHV a respiratory and enteric pathogen of mice that showed the ability to survive on surfaces for days at 20°C and wide range of Relative Humidity (RH) levels (20–60%). The animal surrogates showed to be more resistant to inactivation on surfaces than previously studied human coronaviruses, such as 229E. Several studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have the capacity to survive on dry surfaces for a sufficient duration to facilitate onward transmission. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shown to be able to contaminate the environment and fomites, promoting viral access to mucous membranes of the nose, eyes or mouth through individual self-inoculation by hands (
