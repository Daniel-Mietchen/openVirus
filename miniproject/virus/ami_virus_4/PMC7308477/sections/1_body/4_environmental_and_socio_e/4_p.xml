<p>SARS-CoV and its surrogates can also survive in environmental reservoirs such as water, foods, and in sewage for extended periods (

SARS-CoV and probably MERS-CoV are shed into the environment at concentrations exceeding the infective dose and they can survive for considerable time on surfaces. The surface survival of SARS/MERS-CoV was shown to be greater than that of other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus. In particular, infective MERS-CoV could still be recovered after 48 h at the 20°C−40% RH condition, whereas the virus remained viable for 8 and 24 h at 30°C−80% RH and 30°C 30% RH, respectively. Instead, H1N1 influenza virus, known to have a seasonal spread pattern, cannot be recovered after 4 h at the same environmental conditions (
