<p>The considerable diversity of coronaviruses is driven by their genetic and evolutionary features. Specifically, mutation and recombination appear to be particularly important in coronavirus evolution (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). As RNA viruses, CoVs tend to accumulate random mutations at a far higher rate than their hosts. In spite of the proofreading-repair activity of their polymerase, increasing copying accuracy up to 14-fold (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), coronaviruses form mutant spectra (mutant clouds, quasispecies); viral populations consisting of dynamic and complex mutant distributions, rather than unique genomic sequences (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Quasispecies correlate to enhanced virulence and evolvability and render difficult to prevent and control viral diseases. The ability to exist as mutant clouds in an individual host have been described both in animal CoVs, such as the bovine enteric and respiratory coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and in human SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Furthermore, during CoV replication template switching favors homologous recombination among different CoVs lineages or with less related viruses. Cooperatively, CoVs circulation in multiple host species may increase recombination events (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Among others, genetic recombination was demonstrated in animal viruses such as rodents CoVs (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), porcine PEDV (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), cat and dogs CoVs (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), Hedgehog CoVs (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), and bats (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Notably, recombination between Coronavirus and Orthoreovirus has been postulated in the case of Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Genetic recombination in Human CoVs, including, NL63, HKU1, OC43, SARS-CoV, and MERSCoV has also been documented (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Additionally, the large genome in CoV, and the presence of key mutational and recombination hotspots (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) account for extra plasticity in genome modifications, promoting intraspecies variability, host shifts, and novel CoVs to emerge (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Evidence for a rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 was recently shown by comparing 86 complete or near complete genomes from different parts of the world, depicting the great diversity in viral coding and non-coding regions (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).
