<p>According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> study group (CSG) this family comprises 2 subfamilies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Table S1</xref>): 
 <italic>Letovirinae</italic>, including the single species 
 <italic>Microhyla letovirus</italic> 1, infecting the ornate chorus frog 
 <italic>Microhyla fissipes</italic> (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic>, including 4 genera (
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus</italic>) and 38 species. While all 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> species infect mammals, 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> infects exclusively birds. 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>, a less diverse genus, includes 2 viral species, the 
 <italic>Beluga whale coronavirus SW1</italic>, and 
 <italic>Avian coronavirus</italic>, infecting, respectively, the beluga whale and birds. To date there is no evidence of coronavirus infection in reptiles, even if the presence of a 
 <italic>Letovirinae</italic> coronavirus in amphibians encourage more coronavirus investigation in reptiles. Coronaviruses infecting human can cause mild respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), such as 
 <italic>Human coronavirus 229E</italic> and 
 <italic>Human coronavirus NL63</italic> (
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>), or mild enteric and respiratory disease, such as 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus 1 OC43</italic> and 
 <italic>Human coronavirus HKU1</italic> (
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>); whereas 
 <italic>Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus</italic> (SARS) and 
 <italic>Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus</italic> (MERS), both belonging to 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, can cause severe disease and are example of spillover of animal viruses to human. COVID-19 associated virus was recognized by CSG as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species 
 <italic>Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus</italic>, and it was designated as SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
