It seems like this could happen again given the identification of numerous bat SARS-like viruses and the finding of SARS-like virus in animal such as the civet.” This sentence sounded prophetic, especially now during the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, COVID-19 is highlighting that preparedness toward pandemics is still not adequate to effectively deal with what is unknown. However, Asian countries that previously experienced similar epidemics (e.g., SARS) demonstrated a prompt and appropriate response aimed at containing viral spread and reducing disease impact.
