  <p>Schematic drawing depicting FCγ receptor (FCγR) mediated Antibody-Mediated Enhancement (ADE). This response is mediated by the type of non-neutralizing antibodies mounted against infection or vaccination. The immune response to such vaccines is subverted, leading to exacerbated illness. The Fc-region of the antibody binds to FCγR on the immune cells, which subverts the immune response by reducing T
   <sub>H</sub>1 cytokines (IL2, TNF-a, and IFN-γ) and skews T
   <sub>H</sub>2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-6, PGE-2, and INF-ά) and inhibits STAT pathway leading to increased viral replication. 
   <bold>STAT-A</bold>= Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription protein-A, 
   <bold>IRF</bold>= Interferon Regulatory Factor, 
   <bold>INOS</bold>= Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase.
