<p id="p0050">A vaccine is medical preparations ranging from intact organisms (attenuated live, or inactivated) to genetically engineered parts of the organisms (antigenic) that induce both arms of the adaptive immune system and stimulate a sufficient number of memory T cells and B lymphocytes (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Vaccines should contain antigens necessary to mount the specific response without causing disease. Once challenged with the pathogen, memory cells yield effector T cells and antibody-producing B cells and fight the infection. The antibodies have to be the neutralizing type which binds to the virus and block infection (
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The virus coated with neutralizing antibodies either cannot interact with the receptor or may be unable to uncoat of the genome. Most currently licensed vaccines to induce neutralizing antibody responses capable of mediating long-term protection against lytic viruses such as influenza and smallpox (

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Following antigen processing in dendritic cells, the small peptides are displayed at the cell surface at the groove of major histocompatibility complex (
 <italic>MHC</italic>) class I and class II molecules. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8 +) recognize MHC class I-peptide complexes and differentiate into cytotoxic effector cells capable of killing infected cells or pathogens. Helper T cells (CD4 +) recognize MHC class II-peptide complexes and differentiate in effector cells that produce preferentially T helper Th1 or Th2 cytokines (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> ). T helper cells 1 (Th1) support CD8 + T-cell differentiation, which is in contrast inhibited by T helper cells 2 (Th2) like cytokines. Vaccines against chronic pathogens namely 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, malaria, HCV, HIV, etc more often require cell-mediated immune responses to control the infection (
