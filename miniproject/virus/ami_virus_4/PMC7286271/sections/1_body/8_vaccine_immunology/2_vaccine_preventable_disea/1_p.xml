<p id="p0055">The success of a vaccine against a pathogen is a complex issue and depends upon the biology of the virus and the type of immune response elicited by the body against the organism. While vaccines have been successful against several pathogens including 14 major infectious diseases (

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), not all infectious diseases are vaccine-preventable (

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). The development of vaccines against HIV and HCV have proved challenging. These viruses have an extreme genetic heterogeneity including the hypervariable regions (target for neutralizing antibodies) and the mutation contribute to immune escape (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The mutations lead to a mixture of genomes in the patient over time and from patient to patient. Also, antibodies mounted against such viral infections are predominantly non-neutralizing. Neutralizing antibodies are often either absent or weak to fight the pathogen or neutralize only a narrow range of circulating viral strains and only appear in a subgroup of patients who either recover or are ‘elite controller’ (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Another aspect to be considered is whether the virus can be grown in cell culture and transmitted to small animals for experimentation. Since HCV has been discovered by molecular cloning in 1989, its propagation in cell culture has been difficult which hampers the ability of investigators to experiment with various antigenic components of the virus (
