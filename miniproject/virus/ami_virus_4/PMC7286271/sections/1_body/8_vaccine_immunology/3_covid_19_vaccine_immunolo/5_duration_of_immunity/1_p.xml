 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Both these viruses, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2 induce a robust T cell and B cell immune response which is long-lasting. Many candidate vaccines against both these viruses had gone through successful clinical trials and are safe and immunogenic (
