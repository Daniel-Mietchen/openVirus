<p id="p0085">The greatest fear among vaccine developers is to create a vaccine that does not protect from infection but causes disease exacerbation, increased morbidity, and mortality (

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). This response is mediated by the type of non-neutralizing antibodies mounted against infection or vaccination. The immune response to such vaccines is subverted, leading to exacerbated illness. This could be due to Fc receptor- or complement bearing cells-mediated mechanisms. The Fc-region of the antibody binds to FCÎ³R on the immune cells, which subverts the immune response by reducing T
 <sub>H</sub>1 cytokines (IL2, TNF-a, and IFN-g) and skews T
 <sub>H</sub>2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-6, PGE-2, and INF-a) and inhibits STAT pathway leading to increased viral replication (

ADE is of clinical significance in several viral infections including influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Dengue virus, Zika virus, and West Nile virus. Considering ADE is a major impediment to vaccine development, efforts to identify highly selected epitopes have been done to avoid the production of antibodies responsible for disease enhancement.
