<p id="p0070">What type of immune response occurs in natural COVID-19 and after vaccination and are antibodies neutralizing in nature? SARS-CoV-2 infection evokes a robust adaptive immune response of both T cell and B cell type arms (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Furthermore, both IgM and IgG antibodies appear around the 10
 <sup>th</sup> day of infection and most patients seroconvert within 3 weeks. The antibodies are raised against internal nucleoprotein (N) and spike protein (S) of the virion and have neutralizing activity (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Now that several candidate vaccines are in the clinical trial, investigators shall study the strength and nature of immune response against the vaccine antigen (mostly spike protein).
