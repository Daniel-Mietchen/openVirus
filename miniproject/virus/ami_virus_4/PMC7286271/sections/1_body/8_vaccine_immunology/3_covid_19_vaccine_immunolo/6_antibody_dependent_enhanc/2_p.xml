<p id="p0090">ADE has been reported in animals during vaccination trials with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Vaccine candidates against coronaviruses based on full-length Spike protein induce non-neutralizing antibodies, lack of protection of animals against a viral challenge, and severe disease enhancement presenting as enhanced hepatitis, increased morbidity, and stronger inflammatory response (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). As of today, there are no reports of ADE with the use of COVID-19 candidate vaccines in non-human primates and humans (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). However, it is an early period in the development of these vaccines and as the matter is of major importance in the success of such a vaccine, we need to be vigilant. ADE following COVID-19 vaccination if reported can be prevented by shielding non-neutralizing epitopes of S protein by glycosylation or selecting critical neutralizing epitopes of the S antigen to elicit a more robust protective immunity.
