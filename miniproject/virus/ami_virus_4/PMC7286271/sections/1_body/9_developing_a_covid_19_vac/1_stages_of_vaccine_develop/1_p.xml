<p id="p0095">Every new Vaccine follows a stringent protocol in R&amp;D which has to be meticulously followed and completed before it is licensed to be marketed (

 <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The guidelines for vaccine development are more stringent than those meant for drug development. The reason for this is obvious, the vaccines are for global use, have enormous potential for production and marketing, and are given to healthy populations including children, elderly and pregnant mothers. The vaccine development follows a unique stepwise pattern and is broadly divided into Exploratory, Preclinical, Clinical, and Post-marketing stages. The clinical-stage is divided into 3 phases, namely phases I, II, and III. There are 2 regulatory permissions needed namely ‘Clinical Trial Authorization’ before the clinical stage to allow ‘First-in-human’ testing and ‘Biologic Licence Application/Approval’ for the marketing of the vaccine after successful clinical trials (
