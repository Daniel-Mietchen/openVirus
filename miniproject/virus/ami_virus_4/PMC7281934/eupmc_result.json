    "The aim of the present study was to analyze the sequence of the VP1 gene in enterovirus 71 (EV71) isolates and to explore their genetic evolution, so as to provide a scientific basis for the clinical prevention and treatment of hand, foot and mouth disease. The fecal samples of 590 patients with suspected hand, foot and mouth disease treated at Yan'an Hospital (Kunming, China) between January 2015 and December 2016 were collected and EV71 nucleic acid was detected by fluorescence PCR. The viral RNA of EV71-positive samples was extracted, the VP1 gene was amplified by PCR and the products were sequenced. The VP1 gene sequence was analyzed using DNAMAN and MEGA (version 4.0) software and homologous modeling was performed using Pymol software. A total of 50 EV71-positive samples were identified and the detection rate was 8.47% (50/590 cases). All of the 50 EV71 strains were of the C4 subtype. The genetic distance between the strains detected in the present study and EV71 strains detected in Beijing, Anhui and Malaysia was 0.01-0.03, while that between the strains detected in the present study and Australian strains was 2.11. Homologous modeling indicated that the amino acid sequence of the VP1 gene of the detected strains had a H144Y mutation. There was no significant genetic variation in the EV71 strain within the 2-year period. In conclusion, the EV71 strains detected in the present study was similar to that detected in Beijing, Anhui and Malaysia but different to that from Australia. A point mutation was present in the amino acid sequence of the VP1 gene."
