<p>EV71 VP1 contains 297 amino acids and is 32 kD in size. The crystal structure, according to the VP1 type with ‘jelly roll’ β barrel structure, includes eight β folds arranged in two β patches, each layer containing four β folds (
 <xref rid="b9-etm-0-0-8728" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). VP1 is the major protective neutralization site region of the EV71 virus. Compared with other EV71-associated reference sequences that have been registered in GenBank, an amino acid substitution occurred in the 144th amino acid (histidine → tyrosine) encoded by the VP1 gene of the EV71 virus strain in the present study. As indicated in the three-dimensional conformation presented in 
 <xref rid="f4-etm-0-0-8728" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the amino acid mutation site H144Y was located on the surface of the VP1 protein (PDB ID: 3J23 template used for modeling).
