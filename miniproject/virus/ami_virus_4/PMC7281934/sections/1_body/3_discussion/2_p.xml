<p>In the present study, a total of 590 fecal samples were obtained from patients with suspected HFMD and a total of 50 EV71-positive patients were identified by fluorescence PCR, with a detection rate of 8.47%. Among the 50 EV71-positive patients, 32 were male and 18 were female. Furthermore, 2 female patients were adults, which is consistent with the reported low incidence of HFMD in adults and the susceptibility of adult females to viral infection (

Furthermore, adults may be asymptomatic but still highly infectious. In recent years, there have been reports on severe HFMD and serious complications in adults (

 <xref rid="b19-etm-0-0-8728" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Therefore, it is important to prevent and control the prevalence of HFMD in adults.
