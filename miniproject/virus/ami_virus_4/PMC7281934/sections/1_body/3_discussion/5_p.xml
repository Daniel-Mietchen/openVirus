<p>In the present study, 15 strains of variable EV7l strains over two years were selected and subjected to genetic analysis. No major changes in genetic variation were observed over the 2-year period; however, from an evolutionary perspective, there were still certain differences. The strains detected in the same year had relatively closer genetic distances. This may be due to the small variation of genes and virulence in the region. EV7l strains from the Sarawak region in Malaysia had high homology with strains from the southwest border of China. In recent years, trade and tourism have led to the spread of pathogens, particularly HFMD, and safety monitoring, prevention and control should be implemented to avoid more widespread and serious infection.</p>
