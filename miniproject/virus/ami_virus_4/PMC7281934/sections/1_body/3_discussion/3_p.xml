<p>EV71 is divided into three genotypes, A, B and C, of which B and C may be subdivided into B1-B5 subtypes and C1-C5 subtypes. Previous studies have indicated that the D, E and F subtypes of EV71 have been isolated in India, Hong Kong and Africa (

 <xref rid="b21-etm-0-0-8728" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The VP1 gene sequences of 50 EV71 strains detected in the present study were compared with the EV71 reference strains in GenBank for sequence comparison and homology analysis, and it was confirmed that all of the 50 strains were of the EV71 C4 subtype, which was the same as the EV71 subtype isolated by Fu
