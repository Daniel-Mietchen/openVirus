<p>The present study revealed that an amino acid substitution occurred in the 144th amino acid of the VP1 protein in the EV71 virus strain in 2015 and 2016. The three-dimensional conformation suggested that the amino acid mutation site H144Y was located on the surface of the VP1 protein. Researchers have used biological software analysis to predict that EV71 epitopes may be distributed between 90-120, 150-170, 200-240 and 230-250 amino acids (

 <xref rid="b25-etm-0-0-8728" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) screened the highly conserved epitopes of EV71 among different gene subtypes as SP55 (amino acid position 163-177) and SP70 (amino acid position 208-222) in the VP1 protein and demonstrated that these epitopes may induce the production of specific neutralizing antibodies against the EV71 virus in mice, which are ideal targets for multi-epitope vaccines. Other studies suggested that EV71 is able to infect white blood cells by binding to specific receptor molecules called P-selectin ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (
