<p>In the present study, through sequence comparison analysis, a total of 15 strains with different amino acid sequences were screened out from the 50 EV71 strains, including EV71-VP1-1145-1147, -1149, -1151, -1153, -1159, -1161 and -1248 in 2015 and EV71-VP1-2732, -2740, -2742, -2746, -2756, -2760 and -2762 in 2016. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with MEGA software (version 4.0) and the adjacency method and a Kimura 2-parameter model were used to analyze the genetic origin, variation and association of the virus with other strains in China and in other countries. The viral strains detected in the present study were compared with those in Beijing (EV71 strain BJ4211 VP1), Hefei [EV71 isolate 1401-Luan (CHN)-08 VP1, Anhui, 2008; EV71 isolate 1404-Luan (CHN)-08 VP1] and Sarawak Prefecture, Malaysia [no. EV71 e SB12007-SAR-03 VP1; EV71 isolate 1401-Luan (CHN)-08 VP1]. SB12278-SAR-03 VP1 and EV71 isolate SB10712-SAR-03 VP1 are all on the same branch and the genetic distance is close (0.01-0.03), which indicates that the origin of the virus is similar. The strains isolated from Zhejiang, Ningbo province, in 2010 (EV71 strain EV71/Ningbo. CHN/001/2010), Shanghai in 2014 (EV71 strain SHAPHC5251/SH/CHN/14), Shenzhen in 2014 (EV71 isolate EV71/SZ07/CHN/2014; EV71 isolate EV71/SZ88/CHN/2014), Wenzhou in 2013 and 2014 (EV71 isolate EV71/P156/2013/China; EV71 isolate EV71/P654/2013/China; EV71 strain 15/EV71/Wenzhou/CHN/2014) were in the same evolutionary lineage, and there were certain differences in amino acid sequence, with a genetic distance of 1.52. The genetic distance of strains isolated from Australia in 2006 (EV71 strain 2978-SYD-92 VP1; EV71 strain 7784-SYD-90 VP1; EV71 strain 1182-SYD-91 VP1; EV71 strain 6560-SYD-86 VP1) was 2.11 and the amino acid sequence was quite different (
