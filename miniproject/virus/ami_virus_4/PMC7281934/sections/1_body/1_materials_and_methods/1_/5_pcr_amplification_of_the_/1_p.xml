The product cDNA obtained from the above RT-PCR reactions serves as a template for the PCR amplification of VP1 gene. A 50-µl PCR mix consisting of 2 µl complementary (c)DNA template, 1 µl 30 pmol forward and reverse primers, 5 µl 10XeasyTaq DNA buffer, 0.5 µl 5 U/µl EasyTaq DNA polymerase, 5 µl 2.5 mmol/l deoxyribose nucleoside triphosphate mixture and 35.5 µl RNA-free pure water. The PCR cycling parameters were as follows: 1 cycle at 94˚C for 3 min, 35 cycles at 94˚C for 3 min, 56˚C for 30 sec and 72˚C for 1 min, and 1 cycle at 72˚C and 3 min. The products were subjected to 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with Gelview nucleic acid dye (Beijing Bioteke Biotechnology Co., Ltd) and observed using a 6000 gel imaging system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc). PCR products were compared with a DL5000 DNA marker (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) and the presence of target bands at the required length was considered to indicate a positive result.
