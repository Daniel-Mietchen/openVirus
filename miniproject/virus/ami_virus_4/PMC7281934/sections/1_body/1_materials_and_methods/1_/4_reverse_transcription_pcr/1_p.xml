<p>The extracted EV71 viral RNA was used as the template for RT-PCR. A reverse transcription-PCR kit (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) was used for RT-PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions. The components of the reaction system are presented in 
 <xref rid="tII-etm-0-0-8728" ref-type="table">Table II</xref>. The reaction mixture was placed in the PCR instrument, reacted at 65˚C for 5 min and placed on ice. The components used for the next reaction are presented in 
 <xref rid="tIII-etm-0-0-8728" ref-type="table">Table III</xref>. The thermocycling conditions were as follows: 37˚C for 15 min, 50˚C for 15 min and 65˚C for 10 min. The cDNA obtained was used as a template for the PCR amplification of the VP1 gene.
