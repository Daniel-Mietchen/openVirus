<p>EV71 belongs to the enterovirus family of picornaviruses and is composed of a single strand of RNA (~7.4 KB). The VP1 gene encodes the peripheral immunogenic protein, which is the major pathogenic factor of the virus. It has an important role in the adsorption and desorption of viral infection (

 <xref rid="b6-etm-0-0-8728" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, this protein includes the major neutralization epitope that may be used for virus identification and evolutionary analysis (

In the present study, the VP1 gene of EV71, the most important pathogen causing HFMD, was analyzed with the aim of enriching the genetic database of HFMD in Yunnan, China. The results of the present study may provide novel clues to elucidate the molecular genetic pathogenesis of HFMD epidemics and provide a scientific basis for the clinical assessment of HFMD risk and prognosis, early clinical intervention and prevention, as well as the development of vaccines or therapeutic targets.
