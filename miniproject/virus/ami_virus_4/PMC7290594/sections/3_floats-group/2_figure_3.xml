  <p>Pre-existing antibodies can improve vaccine immunogenicity by promoting virus infection and inducing innate and adaptive immune responses. Immune complexes formed by pre-existing antibodies and viruses can engage FcγRs, resulting in increased viral uptake and fusion through the process of antibody-dependent enhancement that leads to increased vaccine viremia and antigen presentation. Activating FcγR-signaling, on the other hand, provokes greater innate immune responses and production of pro-inflammatory metabolites that can enhance innate and adaptive immune responses. In addition, the cross-linking of FcγRs causes increased expression of immune semaphorins, which are critical for antigen-presenting cell and T-cell interaction. Overall, this leads to increased T-cell proliferation and activation, which consequently improves LAV immunogenicity.</p>
