  <p>The impact of pre-existing antibody levels on live-attenuated vaccine immunogenicity. In the presence of high levels of pre-existing antibodies or with potently neutralizing antibodies, LAV immunogenicity is hindered due to immune interference from virus neutralization or inhibition of B-cell responses. However, at sub-neutralizing antibody titers, there is a window of augmented vaccine immunogenicity due to increased uptake into Fc receptor-bearing cells and greater induction of innate immune responses. The horizontal dotted line indicates LAV immunogenicity in the absence of pre-existing antibodies.</p>
