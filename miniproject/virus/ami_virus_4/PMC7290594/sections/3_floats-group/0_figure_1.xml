  <p>Mechanisms by which pre-existing antibodies neutralize LAVs. Antibodies can prevent attachment and entry of the virus, either via steric hindrance or by altering the conformation of the viral protein that binds the receptor. However, antibody binding to activating FcγRs may still allow virus–antibody complex internalization via FcγR-mediated uptake, indicating that antibodies that prevent viral fusion and uncoating could be critical to ensure complete virus neutralization. High levels of antibodies can also lead to the formation of aggregates which inhibit viral entry.</p>
