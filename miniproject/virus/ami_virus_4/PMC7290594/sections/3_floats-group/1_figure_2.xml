  <p>Effects of antibody binding on B-cell activation. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Formation of viral immune complexes may result in cross-linking and activation of the inhibitory FcγRIIB, which in turn inhibits downstream BCR signaling. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Antibody binding may prevent the exposure of epitopes normally recognized by B-cells in a phenomenon known as “epitope masking”, thereby preventing B-cell activation.
