<p>The last few decades have witnessed remarkable advances in vaccine design and development, with new and innovative technologies redefining our approaches to vaccine production. Nevertheless, one particular class of vaccines has withstood the test of time and has remained in use ever since the advent of immunization: the live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs). Comprised of living but attenuated microorganisms, this group, which also includes replication-competent viral vectors, retains the capacity to replicate in vivo but does not cause disease in humans. Due to their ability to mimic a natural infection and activate innate immune responses, LAVs are able to induce long-lasting, robust cellular and humoral immune responses without the need for adjuvants [

This provides an added advantage over their inactivated counterparts, which often require adjuvants to stimulate innate immune responses for the induction of adaptive immune responses. Active viral replication within cells enables antigen processing via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, which is pivotal in activating cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells that facilitate clearance of virus-infected cells [

Given their potential in activating robust CD8+ and CD4+ responses, polio, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), recombinant adenovirus, and attenuated measles vaccines have also been proposed as potential viral vectors for the delivery of tumor antigens [
