<p>With an anticipated increase in the demand for vaccines to control viral epidemics and high-endemicity of virus infection worldwide, the presence of pre-existing antibodies caused by infection or vaccination with an antigenically similar virus may influence the outcome of LAV immunogenicity and efficacy. Thus, vaccines that are administered to the adult population will have to consider the role of pre-existing immunity on vaccine efficacy. Conversely, it is critical to determine whether the administration of LAV generates sufficient antibody responses that protect against wild-type virus infections and not cause worse disease outcomes. For vaccines that are administered to neonates, the presence of passively acquired maternal antibodies within the first six months may also interfere with vaccination [

In this review, we examine the scenarios in which pre-existing antibodies can either enhance or inhibit LAV efficacy, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved. A better understanding will allow us to tailor our vaccination schedules or vaccine doses, to ensure that LAV efficacy will not be compromised by the presence of pre-existing immunity.
