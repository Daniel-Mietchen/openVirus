<p>One of the greatest challenges for the development of LAVs is to ensure that the vaccine is safe and does not cause serious adverse events. Moreover, they should not replicate in vectors to prevent viral transmission, and caution must be taken to ensure that the attenuated viral strains do not revert to a wild-type virus. Therefore, to ensure the safety of LAVs, there is usually a tendency to select LAV candidates with limited replicative potential in order to reduce the risk of adverse events. However, it is also critical to ensure that LAV candidates are not over-attenuated so as to induce sufficient innate and adaptive responses necessary for vaccine efficacy. Vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy, however, are difficult to assess in animal models and may not correlate with clinical efficacy. An example is the Dengvaxia
 <sup>Â®</sup> vaccine manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, which generated protective antibody and T-cell responses against all dengue virus serotypes in non-human primates, but in phase II and III clinical trials, only low to modest efficacy was observed against DENV serotype 1 and 2 [
