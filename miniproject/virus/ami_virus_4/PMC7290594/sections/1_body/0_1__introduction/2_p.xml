<p>Among the various methods to impede viral transmission, vaccines are widely heralded as one of the most effective medical interventions. Indeed, since the pivotal discovery by Edward Jenner over two hundred years ago, vaccination has seen tremendous success in reducing the burden of viral diseases such as polio, yellow fever, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and influenza [

In addition, at high enough coverage, vaccination can impart both individual and community protection in the form of herd immunity, safeguarding those who are legitimately incapable of receiving immunization. On the other hand, reduced vaccine coverage threatens to cause a resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, mumps, and pertussis [

With such accolades, vaccination is widely considered as the crowning achievement of public health, and the WHO touts it as the most cost-effective method to prevent infectious diseases. Given their remarkable track records, vaccination is likely to remain a cornerstone of antiviral strategies, especially with the increasing prevalence of epidemic viral diseases.
