<p>Antibodies can neutralize LAV strains in a variety of ways, as summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00520-f001">Figure 1</xref>. They may block virus attachment and entry by either binding to epitopes that are directly involved in virus–receptor interactions or by imposing steric hindrance that prevent virus interaction with host receptors. As most virus structures are dynamic and can change structural conformations at different temperatures, it is thought that antibody binding to these dynamic structures may cause structural changes that can impair virus attachment, thereby causing virus neutralization [
 <xref rid="B100-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. However, the blockade of virus–receptor interactions alone may not be able to completely neutralize the viruses, especially in FcγR-bearing cells, as activating FcγRs can enable entry of virus–antibody complexes by FcγR-mediated uptake. Thus, pre-existing antibodies that can block viral fusion and uncoating will likely be more efficient in virus neutralization. In situations where pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies are unable to inhibit viral fusion processes intracellularly, high concentrations of antibodies may enable the formation of viral immune aggregates that influence the types of FcγRs engaged. These large viral aggregates can then inhibit phagocytosis by co-ligating the lowly expressed inhibitory receptor FcγRIIB that inhibit phagocytosis [

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Finally, there have been theories suggesting that FcγR cross-linking by virus immune complexes may increase the production of IL-10 that abolishes innate immune responses [
