<p>Virus neutralization occurs when virions are bound by antibodies with stoichiometry exceeding a required threshold. Hence, one of the popular explanations to explain the lack of LAV efficacy in the presence of pre-existing antibodies is the neutralization of the LAV, which could consequently decrease the amount of viral antigens to levels that are below the threshold for immune detection and recognition. Antibody concentrations, affinity, and epitope accessibility are critical determinants for virus neutralization [

Antibody affinity, defined as the fraction of epitopes that are bound by antibodies at non-saturating concentrations, has been shown to correlate with neutralizing activity in vitro. On the other hand, epitope accessibility is defined as the number of epitopes on viruses that are available for binding and can be affected by virus structure, structural dynamics of virus, and virus maturation states [

Taken together, cross-reactive antibodies that can neutralize virus infection are likely those that can bind to accessible epitopes with considerable affinity. Conversely, antibodies that bind weakly and target epitopes with reduced accessibility are unlikely to neutralize viruses, and may instead enhance viral infection via FcÎ³R-mediated uptake.
