<p>Another way in which antibodies can inhibit B-cell responses is through epitope masking. This hypothesis postulates that the presence of pre-existing antibodies can mask the exposure of epitopes, thereby prohibiting recognition by the B-cell. This is also termed as epitope-specific suppression, whereby epitopes covered by these antibodies are unable to be recognized by B-cells (

Interestingly, there have been reports of epitope unspecific suppression, where monoclonal antibodies that target only one specific epitope can suppress B-cell recognition of a whole antigen, suggesting the possibility that steric hindrance or obstruction by high concentrations of antibodies can also lead to overall suppression B-cell recognition [
