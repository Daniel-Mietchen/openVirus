<p>Unlike myeloid cells, B-cells exclusively express FcγRIIB but not the activating FcγRs [

 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. However, this mechanism of inhibition has not been demonstrated for other viruses. It is conceivable that this mode of inhibition is dependent on the size of the virus–antibody immune complexes, as immunization of small polypeptides can escape maternal antibody inhibition [
