<p>Consistent with the notion that sub-neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies can promote viral infection, the presence of pre-existing cross-reactive antibodies can also increase the immunogenicity of flaviviral LAVs. As demonstrated in both Dengvaxia
 <sup>®</sup> and Takaeda
 <sup>®</sup> dengue vaccine trials, seropositive individuals produced greater neutralizing antibody responses and protection against the wild-type DENV infection compared to seronegative vaccinees [

 <xref rid="B82-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. These studies were also supported by in vivo studies showing that sequential immunization for flaviviruses with shared CD4 epitopes that could enhance protection during subsequent heterologous infection [

The clinical trial finding that subjects with a limited range of cross-reactive antibodies from a prior Japanese Encephalitis vaccine were able to enhance yellow fever vaccination, by prolonging vaccine viremia duration that leads to higher antibody titers, thus hints at the possibility that whether pre-existing antibodies inhibit or augment flavivirus infection will depend on both antibody titers and the type/specificity of antibodies produced [
