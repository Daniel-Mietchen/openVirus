<p>Flaviviruses include a number of clinically important pathogens that are either transmitted by mosquitoes (dengue, Zika, yellow fever, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis virus) or by ticks (tick-borne encephalitis, Powassan virus) [

 <xref rid="B72-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The antigenic closeness between flaviviruses is such that infection with one flavivirus induces species-specific immunity, as well as cross-reactive antibodies against related serocomplexes [

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. However, these cross-reactive antibodies do not necessarily cross-protect. Initial insights come from human dengue challenge studies by Albert Sabin, who provided evidence that a homologous challenge in humans with the same dengue virus (DENV) serotype protects against re-infection, but only short-term protection against the heterologous DENV serotype challenge for up to six months [

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Moreover, when cross-reactive antibodies decline to sub-neutralizing levels, these antibodies can opsonize dengue virus infection, resulting in enhanced virus burden and risk of severe dengue in patients experiencing secondary infection [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Indeed, recent cohort studies conducted in Nicaragua and Thailand provide clinical evidence that a specific range of antibody titers is associated with an increased risk of severe dengue [
