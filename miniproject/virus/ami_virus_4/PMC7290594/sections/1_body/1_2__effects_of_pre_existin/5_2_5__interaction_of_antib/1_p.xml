<p>The primary role of antibodies is antigen binding and interacting with Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs) to modulate subsequent immune responses. The integration of both activating and inhibiting signals is critical for the generation of an effective immune response. In this aspect, FcγRs are an archetype of how such signals influence both innate and adaptive immune functions. Functionally, FcγRs can be classified into either activating or inhibiting receptors depending on the pathway they initiate [

Activating FcγRs possess an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation (ITAM) motif in their cytosolic domain, or in the case of FcγRI and FcγRIIIA, associate with an ITAM-containing γ-chain. Engagement of activating FcγRs by immune complexes results in the phosphorylation of the γ-chain by SRC-family kinases in order to create a docking site for spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK). Subsequent activation of SYK results in a signaling cascade, leading to the induction of pro-inflammatory responses and activation of innate immune effector cells [

By contrast, the inhibitory FcγRIIB receptor contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition (ITIM) motif within its intracellular domain. Cross-linking of FcγRIIB enables the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing inositol polyphosphate 5′ phosphatase (SHIP) and SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP1) to modulate signals generated by activating FcγRs, thereby regulating the magnitude of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, FcγRIIB is important for controlling B-cell development [

 <xref rid="B94-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Indeed, B-cells express FcγRIIB as the only FcγR on their cell surface, and cross-linking of FcγRIIB on naïve B-cells could inhibit their proliferation and differentiation into plasma cells [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Likewise, cross-linking of FcγRIIB induces apoptosis in bone marrow plasma cells, suggesting that FcγRIIB may influence the lifespan of these antibody-producing cells [
 <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. The signaling responses triggered by virus–antibody complexes are thus highly dependent on the type of FcγRs with which the immune complexes interact, which can result in either virus inhibition or enhancement of virus infection.
