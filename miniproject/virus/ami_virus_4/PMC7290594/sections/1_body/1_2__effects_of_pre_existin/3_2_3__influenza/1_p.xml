<p>The history of mankind is intricately intertwined with that of influenza, and the virus remains one of the top 10 threats to global health. Estimates indicate that there are approximately 1 billion cases globally each year, of which 3 to 5 million are severe cases and up to 650,000 eventually succumb to the disease [

The 2019 Global Influenza Strategies recommend vaccination as the most effective intervention to mitigate the impact of influenza [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Three types of influenza vaccines are licensed for use: (1) recombinant, (2) inactivated, and (3) live-attenuated. The three vaccines are multivalent and provide protection against selected influenza type A and type B strains that are predicted to spread in the upcoming season [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Indeed, a meta-analysis by Ambrose et al. on the efficacy of LAIV in children showed that recipients of the live vaccine demonstrated a 44% reduction in influenza cases compared to those who received the trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) [
