<p>Yet, efforts to develop such a vaccine have been stymied by the presence of pre-existing immunity gained over a lifetime of exposure to different viral strains either from natural infection or vaccination. Indeed, several observational studies point to the possibility that pre-existing immunity can reduce the efficacy of both inactivated and life-attenuated influenza vaccine [

However, given how complicated it is to trace the history of an individualâ€™s exposure to influenza strains, it is difficult to tease out the exact impact that pre-existing immunity has on vaccine efficacy in human samples. Perhaps then, by establishing a good animal model with controlled infection histories, we will be able to better understand these complexities.
