<p>Adenoviruses (AdV) and adeno-associated viruses have been widely studied as a potential viral vector for cancer gene therapy and infectious diseases. This double-stranded DNA virus holds several advantages as a vector, including but not limited to the ability to induce robust cellular and humoral responses, high expression of transgenes, favorable safety profiles, and no risk of integration into the host genome. The most commonly used adenoviral vector is AdV serotype 5 (Ad5) and has been tested in more than 400 gene therapy trials. However, the large majority of the human population having pre-existing immunity to AdV limits its widespread use in the clinics. Indeed, a recent international cross-sectional serological survey demonstrated that greater than 80% of the study participants possessed neutralizing antibodies against Ad5 [

These pre-existing antibodies have been shown to neutralize the Ad5 vectors after administration, thereby lowering their efficacy and transgene expression. The most convincing evidence is from the large-scale clinical trial (STEP) that tested an Ad5-based HIV-1 vaccine, where reduced efficacy of Ad5 was found to be associated with subjects who had pre-existing immunity to Ad5 [

 <sup>10</sup> viral particles was weakened by pre-existing immunity, whereas immunogenicity was enhanced at a higher dose of 8.0 × 10
 <sup>10</sup>- 1.6 × 10
 <sup>11</sup> viral particles. In a mouse model, pre-existing anti-Ad5 neutralizing antibodies were observed to severely hamper the induction of both cellular and humoral responses by a recombinant Ad5-Ebolavirus glycoprotein vaccine [

Likewise, a recombinant Ad5 vector expressing the Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV) gag gene showed diminished, but not complete, abrogation of gag-specific cellular immune responses following the vaccination of rhesus monkeys pre-exposed to an empty Ad5 vector [
