<p>The high seroprevalence of anti-Ad5 immunity has pivoted the development of genetically-modified AdV and the search of rarer AdV serotypes for use as vectors, in hopes that these viruses may circumvent the effects of pre-existing anti-Ad5 immunity [

 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, there remains the possibility of cross-reactivity between antibodies against the different AdV serotypes, which could in turn potentially influence the efficacy of these rarer AdV as vaccine vectors. Indeed, investigations by Heemskerk et al. have shown that Ad5-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells could cross-react with other AdV serotypes including but not limited to Ad1, Ad3, Ad7, and Ad35, suggesting that the different AdV serotypes share similar T-cell epitopes [

Several studies have attempted to further explore this school of thought, and their results have provided greater insight into this particular topic. Ad35 is one of the rarest human AdV serotypes, with a seroprevalence of less than 7% in the population. In an attempt to determine its potential as an alternative vector to Ad5, Barouch et al. compared the immunogenicity of a rAd35 vaccine expressing Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)-Gag versus a rAd5 SIV-Gag vaccine in Ad5 immune C57/BL6 mice [
 <xref rid="B53-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Indeed, the efficacy of the rAd35-Gag vaccine was unaffected even by high levels of pre-existing Ad5 immunity, indicating the absence of a cross-reactive response between Ad5 and Ad35. Likewise, the presence of anti-Ad5 immunity did not affect the efficacy of a rAd11-Gag vector vaccine in mice. Interestingly, pre-existing anti-Ad11 immunity could suppress cellular immune responses elicited by the rAd35-Gag vaccine, suggesting some cross-reactivity between Ad11 and Ad35 immune responses [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The inhibitory effect of pre-existing antibodies to AdV remains a challenge for their use as viral vectors, and the development of alternative serotypes remains to be one of the best strategies to circumvent this limitation.
