<p>The live-attenuated MV is one example of a highly successful LAV, and its introduction has transformed measles from a complicated disease into a triviality in most developed countries, although measles still forms a significant disease burden in developing nations [

Enders and his team from the blood of an 11-year-old boy named David Edmonston, who became the namesake of the viral strain that would eventually become the first measles vaccine [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Serial passage of the wild-type Edmonston strain in human and chicken embryo fibroblast tissue culture resulted in a virus with reduced virulence. However, the ability of the parental strain to induce protective immunity is retained. The MV is highly immunogenic, inducing both humoral and cellular immunity at magnitudes comparable to that of a natural infection, although antibody titers induced are often lower [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Investigators have demonstrated that this protection is highly robust, and could last for as long as 20 years after vaccine administration [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Its excellent safety profile, highly immunogenic nature, and low possibility of reversion to virulence has also placed it as a promising candidate for use as a viral vector to deliver heterologous antigens [
