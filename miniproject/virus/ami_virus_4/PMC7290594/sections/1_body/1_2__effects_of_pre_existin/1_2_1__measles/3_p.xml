<p>Some of the first evidence that describes the role of pre-existing immunity on live vaccines comes from the measles vaccine. The efficacy of live MV was found to be often hampered by pre-existing immunity at the time of vaccination, and this effect is best illustrated in infants who are born to measles-immune mothers. During gestation, infants acquire protective antibodies as a result of transplacental transfer of maternal IgG antibodies [

Indeed, studies have shown that vaccinating infants born to measles-immune mothers before or at the age of six months often results in seroconversion failure [

For instance, following the intravenous transfer of varying titers of MV neutralizing antibodies, immunization of mice with a recombinant measles vaccine (rMV) expressing Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) gag protein was significantly inhibited when pre-existing antibody titers were above 500mIU/mL of serum [

Likewise, investigations in cynomolgus macaques by van Binnendijk et al. revealed that pre-existing antibody titers as low as 0.1IU/mL abrogated the development of antibodies following vaccination with MV or a recombinant vaccinia virus vector expressing measles antigens [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Interestingly, while antibody induction by MV is negatively impacted by pre-existing immunity, the effect on cellular responses seem unaffected. For example, infants vaccinated with MV at age 6 or 9 months followed by the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine at 12 months generated equivalent T-cell responses to control infants given only MMR at age 12 months [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Thus, experimental models and clinical data support that the inhibition of MV vaccination in neonates is more likely due to interference from maternal antibodies rather than the immaturity of the neonatal system.
