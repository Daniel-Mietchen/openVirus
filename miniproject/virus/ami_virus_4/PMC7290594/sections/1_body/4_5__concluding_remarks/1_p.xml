<p>In this review, we have highlighted several studies that have shown that the efficacy of some commonly used LAVs, such as measles, adenovirus, influenza, and flaviviral vaccines, can be affected by these pre-existing adaptive immune responses. This knowledge will be critical to understanding the limitations of administering LAVs in seropositive individuals to reduce the incidence of vaccine failures, as well as in future designs of clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of LAVs. Whether pre-existing antibodies can inhibit or augment LAV immunogenicity depends on the concentration and the type of antibodies that are present (

With high antibody levels or potently neutralizing antibodies, pre-existing antibodies can inhibit LAV efficacy by virus neutralization or inhibition of B-cell responses. By contrast, at sub-neutralizing titers, pre-existing antibodies can enable viruses to better infect cells and increase innate immune responses that augment LAV immunogenicity. Moreover, pre-existing immunity can prime dendritic cells and memory T-cells to enhance protection during secondary infection with an antigenically related virus [

We believe that a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved will help us better understand the circumstances that can allow us to manage immunization in the presence of pre-existing antibodies, and even explore the possibilities of exploiting pre-existing antibodies to promote vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. It would also be interesting to determine if cross-reactive antibodies can impact future development of LAVs against newly emerging pandemic viruses, including Ebola, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2), and Zika viruses.
