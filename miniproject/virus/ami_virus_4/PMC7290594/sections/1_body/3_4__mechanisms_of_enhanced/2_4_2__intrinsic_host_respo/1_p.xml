<p>Besides promoting viral entry and antigen presentation, the cross-linking of FcγRs may also modulate cellular and host responses that promote viral replication and LAV immunogenicity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00520-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Some insights can be obtained from our clinical trial, where subjects were sequentially vaccinated with the inactivated Japanese Encephalitis virus vaccine followed by the yellow fever vaccine. Subjects within a restricted range of cross-reactive antibodies resulted in increased antibody responses, whereas too many or too few antibodies resulted in reduced antibody responses, indicating the possible role of ADE in augmented vaccine antibody responses [

In addition to the extended duration of viremia observed in these subjects, enhancing titers of cross-reactive antibodies provoked greater pro-inflammatory responses, including increased innate immune responses and the production of pro-inflammatory metabolites such as arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and 12-HETE that promote phagocytosis and adaptive immune responses. The co-ligation of both FcγRI and FcγRIIA by virus–antibody immune complexes or cross-linking can also upregulate immune semaphorins such as SEMA4A, SEMA6A, and SEMA7A which are critical for antigen-presenting cell and T-cell interactions [

While the mechanisms of whether upregulation of immune semaphorins by immune complexes leads to increased T-cell proliferation and activation in humans remains to be evaluated, previous studies have shown that SEMA4A can enhance T-cell activation through interaction with Tim-2, thereby increasing antigen-specific T-cell and antibody responses against T-cell dependent antigens [

However, it is also noticeable that not all subjects within that specific window of cross-reactive antibody levels exhibited increased vaccine immunogenicity, suggesting that baseline variations, such as genetics, dietary or environmental factors may also influence the outcome of LAV immunogenicity [
 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Some recent studies hinted at the possibility that baseline variations in B-cell signatures and gene regulation could influence LAV reactogenicity and immunogenicity, which can be potential avenues for future studies [
