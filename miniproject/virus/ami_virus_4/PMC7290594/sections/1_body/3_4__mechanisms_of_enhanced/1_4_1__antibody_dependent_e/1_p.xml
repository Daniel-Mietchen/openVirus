<p>Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection has been documented for many viruses, including flaviviruses, influenza, MV, Ross river viruses, HIV, and coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B109-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. ADE can occur when sub-neutralizing levels of cross-reactive antibodies form immune complexes with viruses, opsonizing viral infection in FcγR-bearing myeloid cells including monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells via activating FcγR-mediated uptake. The majority of the mechanistic insights about ADE of viral infection are gathered from dengue, as waning cross-reactive antibodies that are acquired from a heterotypic DENV infection or through maternal-fetal transmission can result in a heightened risk of severe dengue that can be life-threatening [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Both activating FcγRI and FcγRIIA have been shown to be involved in ADE-mediated infection, although increasing studies indicate that FcγRIIA could be more important than FcγRI in enhancing viral infection [

 <xref rid="B111-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. While the precise mechanisms involved remain unclear, it is possible that the trafficking of immune complexes through FcγRIIA-mediated uptake is slower, thereby allowing more viral fusion and infection [

 <xref rid="B113-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. The activation of FcγRI, however, may aid to further enhance immunogenic responses to viral antigens by targeting virus immune complexes to the late endosomes or lysosomes for enhanced antigen processing and antigen presentation to the CD4+ T-cells, thereby increasing B-cell responses [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00520" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Overall, at sub-neutralizing antibody levels, the presence of pre-existing antibodies can activate both FcγRI and FcγRIIA, which promotes virus uptake, replication, and antigen presentation that consequently augments vaccine immunogenicity.
