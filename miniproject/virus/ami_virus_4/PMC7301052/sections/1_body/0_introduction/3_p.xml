<p>The highest morbi-mortality of COVID-19 is observed among older patients (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). Patients in intensive care unit (ICU) are older than patients not requiring ICU (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). In a study using an observational database from 169 hospitals in Asia, Europe, and North America, an age of more than 65 years-old was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital death: 10.0% mortality rates for people â‰¥ 65 years-old vs. 4.9% for those &lt; 65 years-old (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). In France, 3.6% of infected individuals needed to be hospitalized, with an average death rate of 0.7% ranging from 0.001% in individuals &lt; 20 years-old, to 10.1% in those &gt; 80 years-old (
