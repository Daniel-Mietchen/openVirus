<p>Not all older adults appear to be equally vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Frailty is a clinical syndrome in older adults characterized by an increased vulnerability for adverse health outcomes and aging-associated functional declines (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). Frail older adults, especially those with comorbidities (eg, hypertension, obesity, diabetes) are at higher risk of death if they get infected than younger adults (

Geroscience is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the links of biological mechanisms of aging with biological mechanisms of disease and body functions (eg, mobility, cognition) to ultimately find potential interventions and promote health in older adults (
