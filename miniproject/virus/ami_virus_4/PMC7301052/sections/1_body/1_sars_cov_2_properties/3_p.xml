<p>Once the SARS-CoV-2 enters a human cell, the virion releases its RNA in the cytoplasm. Translation and replication occur and new virions are then released from the cell through exocytosis (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). Cytokine storm, or Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) in peripheral blood is observed in some subjects during the second week of the COVID-19 infection. Approximately 8 days after symptom onset, when it happens in patients, the acute cytokine storm is associated with unfavorable outcomes requiring sometime ICU care and mechanical ventilation. Inflammatory factors elevated during this storm include IL-6 (interleukin 6), IFNγ (interferon γ), TNFα (Tumor necrosis factor α), IL-1β, IL-8, MCP-1 (CCL2 chemokine ligand 2), IP-10 (CXCL10) in peripheral blood as well as antiinflammatory factors such as IL-1RA and IL-10 (
