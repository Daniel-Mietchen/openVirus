<p>Coronaviruses are members of the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family. They are divided into 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> that can only infect mammals, and 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> which mostly infect birds (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 is a 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> (subgroup B Sarbecovirus), enveloped, with a positive single-stranded large RNA that can infect animals and humans. As MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, it may cause severe diseases and high fatality rate. The envelope spike protein of the SARS-CoV-2 recognizes the human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) as an entry receptor, and preferentially infects lung epithelial cells (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>). The receptor binding domain of the spike protein latches onto the ACE2 receptor, and then the host TMPRSS2 protease cleaves the spike protein to expose fusion peptides able to fuse the viral and cell membranes (
