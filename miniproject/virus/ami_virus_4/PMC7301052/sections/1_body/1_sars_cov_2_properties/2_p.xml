<p>The cellular tropism of a virus is determined by the susceptibility of host cells to be infected. This is determined, in part, by the presence of the receptor needed for entry: the ACE2 receptor in the case of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 is expressed in several human tissues, including lungs, small intestine, kidneys, heart, thyroid, adipose tissue, the infection of which by the SARS-CoV-2 can result in diverse symptoms (
