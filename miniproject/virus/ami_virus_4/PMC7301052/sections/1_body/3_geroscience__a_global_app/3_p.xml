<p>In a more global perspective, geroscience should be associated to COVID-19 prevention and treatment (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>). Geroscience seeks to understand all biological mechanisms (genetic, molecular, and cellular) that make aging a major risk factor of chronic diseases of older adults. The aim is to target the aging process as the single most important risk factor instead of treating just the infection. Treatments that target the molecular pathways of aging could decrease the development and severity of age-related disease, and more globally comorbidities. Among these agents, senolytics can selectively induce death of senescent cells, limiting the accumulation of SASP. Senolytic drugs (eg, quercetin, dasatinib, ruxolitinib) might have a beneficial effect for the prevention or the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection by attenuating the cytokine storm and reducing immunosenescence (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>). mTor inhibitors (eg, rapamycin, RTB101, everolimus) are approved for use in humans and are known to delay age-related diseases in multiple animal models (
