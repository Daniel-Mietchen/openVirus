<p>In COVID-19 clinical studies, chronological age has been used, whereas all individuals do not age in the same way and the underlying mechanisms of aging may be different. Frailty is a clinical syndrome common in older adults. It has been defined by Fried et al.(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>) as a clinical syndrome in which at least three of the following criteria are present: unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, weakness, slow walking speed, and low physical activity. Aging and frailty change the clinical presentation of infections, due to alterations in temperature regulation, cognitive decline or malnutrition. Fever may not be detected in older adults and we need to be aware about all the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 for an early identification of frail individuals infected by the SARS-CoV-2 (
