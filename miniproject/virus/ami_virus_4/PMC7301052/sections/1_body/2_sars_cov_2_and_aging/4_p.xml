<p>It is well established that the immune response decreases with aging: reduced production of B and T cells in bone marrow and thymus, diminished function of mature lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissues, increase in the number of memory T cells, chronic stimulation (with persistent viral infection by Cytomegalovirus and others), impaired function of B cells, and compromised communication between innate and adaptive immunity (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>). This series of age-related changes affecting the immune system is called “immunosenescence” (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>). It affects principally the adaptive immune response. The consequence of immunosenescence is characterized by an increase in vulnerability, and poor resolution of homeostasis following a stress, that may lead to low resilience and frailty. Infections in frail adults often lead to large deterioration and functional dependency which does not return to baseline homeostasis (
