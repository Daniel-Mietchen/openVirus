<p>Inflammaging is a low-grade persistent increase in inflammatory mediators (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>). During aging, chronic antigenic stress (eg, chronic infection, microbiota translocation) leads to chronic low-grade inflammation, as a mechanism of defense; but the regulation by anti-inflammatory molecules is lacking in some older adults and this chronic inflammation become deleterious (
