<p>During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, patients in ICU have higher levels of inflammatory factors, and are significantly older and with comorbidities than patients who are not in ICU (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). Older age is also associated with a higher peak viral load in the naso-pharynx, suggesting that the virus could replicate at higher rates in older adults, or more probably that their immune system is not efficient enough to limit the infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>). Differences of ACE2 expression level between young and old adults could contribute to the higher viral loads in older adults, even though this is not established yet in the literature; whereas one study suggests that ACE2 expression in the lung increases with age (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>), another investigation (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>) indicates that ACE2 expression levels showed no significant difference between younger and older adults. This discrepancy deserves further studies. When ACE2 expression in the lungs was associated with immune signatures (genes expression of CD8+ T cells, type I IFN response, B cells and NK cells), a positive correlation was observed in the older group and a negative correlation in the younger one (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). The ability of the host immune response to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection may partially explain the difference in severity between young and old adults. The induction of proinflammatory cytokines during sepsis (as it may occur in COVID-19 pathology) is not always adequately controlled by anti-inflammatory mechanisms, notably in older patients (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>). People respond differently to the infection and older patients or those with comorbidities could more frequently have an inappropriate immune response. We can speculate that it is not the SARS-CoV-2 itself, but the inappropriate immune response and the inflammatory process that are responsible for the higher mortality of COVID-19 among older patients (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>).
