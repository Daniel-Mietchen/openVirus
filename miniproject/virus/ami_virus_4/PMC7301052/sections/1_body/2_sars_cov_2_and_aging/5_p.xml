<p>The immunosenescence is also characterized by a delayed type I interferons (IFN) response (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>). Type I interferons (IFNs) are polypeptides secreted by infected cells. They induce an antimicrobial state in infected and neighboring cells to limit the spread of the virus. IFNs can also modulate innate immune responses in order to promote antigen presentation, natural killer cell functions and to restrain the production of proinflammatory mediators. Finally, IFNs activate the adaptive immune system (high-affinity antigen-specific T and B cell responses) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>). The lack of type I IFN response in frail older adults leads to a low adaptive immune response (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 is a virus sensitive to type I IFN; however, it is also able to limit type I IFN induction(
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). With this function, the virus could escape from the human immune response. Thus, the IFN-I response is limited by the immunosenescence in the host, as well as by the virus itself; explaining why frail patients could be more affected by the COVID-19 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Moreover, lymphopenia during COVID-19 infection correlates with clinical severity, and occurs in 80% of critically ill patients (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>). A recent study from Wang et al., showed that similar to MERS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 can infect T cells but failed to replicate in T lymphocytes (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>). If the SARS-CoV-2 could induces the apoptosis of T cells as the MERS-CoV-2, this could have a significant negative impact on frail older people with already reduced T cell production (
