<p>Taken together, inflammaging and immunosenescence, observed in frail adults, can results in a decrease of the immune system ability to fight new challenges (as SARS-CoV-2 infection). On the other hand, the SARS-CoV-2 may accentuate this immune decline, by its capacity of limiting type I IFN response and maybe infecting T cells. All of this could result in an unstopped SARS-CoV-2 infection and leads to COVID-19 complications in frail older adults.</p>
