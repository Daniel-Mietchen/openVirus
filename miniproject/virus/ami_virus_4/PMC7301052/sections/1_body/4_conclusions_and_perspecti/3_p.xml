<p>During aging, immunosenescence and inflammaging are suggested to stand at the origin of frailty and diseases in older individuals (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>). The inflammaging results of a chronic inflammation, with low-grade production of inflammatory mediators; and the immunosenescence is characterized by a loss in adaptive immune functions that reinforces the need to find treatments that stimulate the innate immune response to protect the organism from infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>). Immunosenescence and inflammaging occurring in some older adults, could be predisposing conditions that sustain the mechanisms by which the SARS-CoV-2 escape the immune surveillance and leads to serious COVID-19 (Figure
