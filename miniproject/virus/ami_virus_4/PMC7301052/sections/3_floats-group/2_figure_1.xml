  <p>Circle of aging and SARS-CoV-2 infection</p>
  <p>With age, the immune system declines leading to frailty, comorbidities and high susceptibility to infections. This immune decline can be a predisposing condition sustaining COVID-19 serious complications and explaining high mortality rates in older people with COVID-19. We hypothesize that COVID-19 can be a future cause of accelerated aging and frailty</p>
