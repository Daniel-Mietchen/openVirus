<p>Droplets are the main human-to-human mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but fecal shedding with environmental contamination may play an important role in viral spread. As pointed out by Li et al,

 </sup> there is a great number of infections not being documented, especially in paucisymptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, which may have helped the fast diffusion of the virus.

 </sup> The clinical pattern of disease presentation among children may have facilitated viral dissemination. Moreover, there is evidence supporting viral viability in environmental settings that may predispose fecal-oral transmission, with recent evidence supporting that SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable in aerosols up to 3 hours, and for 72 hours on solid surfaces, similarly to SARS-CoV.
