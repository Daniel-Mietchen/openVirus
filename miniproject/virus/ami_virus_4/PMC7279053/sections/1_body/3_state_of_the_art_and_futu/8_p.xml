 </sup> reported ten pediatric PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, all with non-specific symptoms. The childrenâ€™s pattern of viral shedding was monitored with subsequent nasopharyngeal and rectal swab samples: 8 patients showed persistent positivity on rectal swabs, with 2 of them remaining positive for up to 13 days after discharge, also after nasopharyngeal swabs had turned negative. Viral loads showed that shedding from the gastrointestinal tract may be higher and more long-lasting compared with the respiratory tract.
