 </sup> reported detection of viral RNA in respiratory tract swabs and stools, with 44/153 positive fecal samples. Four positive fecal samples showed high copy numbers with a mean cycle threshold (Ct) value of 31 4 (&lt;2.6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/mL). Live virus was found in feces of patients without diarrhea, suggesting a systemic infection. The spread of the virus by also non-respiratory routes might justify the rapid diffusion of infection and testing of samples from multiple sites may be useful to enhance sensitivity and decrease false-negative results.
