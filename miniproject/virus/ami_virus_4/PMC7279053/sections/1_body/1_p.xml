<p>In March 2020, 2 infants with SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to our Pediatrics Department. The first one, a 5-month-old boy, presented respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms with diarrhea. Nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were taken, with a positive result. He was discharged in mandatory home isolation, afebrile and asymptomatic. The second one, 2-months-old, presented only mild respiratory symptoms. After COVID-19 infection was confirmed with nasopharyngeal swab, despite the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms and based on the findings of the previous case, he also underwent a rectal swab, that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on day 3 from onset.</p>
