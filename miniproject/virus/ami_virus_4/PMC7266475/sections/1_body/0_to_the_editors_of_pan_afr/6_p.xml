 <bold>Suggestions for prevention and treatment of covid-19 infection:</bold> in frail people, we propose to reduce their level of oxidative stress by providing them with substances that increase their antioxidant system [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] such as Glutathione, some trace elements like Zinc and Selenium, vitamin E and C, carotenoids and polyphenols [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Glutathione has analogues and precursors such as N acetyl cysteine. Indeed, cysteine is one of the three constituent amino acids of the major natural antioxidant Glutathione which also has an immunomodulating effect and destructive action on viruses such as herpes, influenza etc. by blocking viral replication [

 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] could also be tested. In sick people, in addition to the various used treatments, we suggest to add antioxidants mentionned above and especially, injectable N acetyl cysteine [
 <xref rid="cit0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] which has shown its effectiveness in hemorrhagic dengue fever [
 <xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] another RNA virus infection [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Various antioxidant which have been experimentally used successfully as melatonin, minocycline [
