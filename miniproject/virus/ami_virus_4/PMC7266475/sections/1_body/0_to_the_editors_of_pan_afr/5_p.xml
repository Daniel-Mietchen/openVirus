 <bold>What about covid-19 and oxidative stress?</bold> SARS-CoV2, probably like other RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] can trigger an oxidative stress. This hypothesis can easily be checked by the dosage of oxidative stress markers [
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in the blood of sick people of COVID-19. A cytokin storm with hyper inflammation had been found in these patients [
 <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] but researchers should also chek for a possible oxidative storm with all he deleterious effects of RONS, notably lipid peroxydation and proteins oxidation of membranes which can contribute to the transformation, hyalinization of pulmonary alveolar membranes [
 <xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] with letal respiratory distress. As elders and people suffering of diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases have already a state of oxidative stress [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], viral infection will increasae this stress, giving us one possible explanation of the severity of COVID-19 in these categories of patients [
 <xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].
