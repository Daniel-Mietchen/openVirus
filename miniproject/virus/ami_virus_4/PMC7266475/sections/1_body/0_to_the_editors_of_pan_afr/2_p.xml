 <bold>Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS)</bold>: reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species (RONS) are molecules characterized by the presence of unpaired valence electrons, which cause them to react with various biological molecules [
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Main ROS are hydroxyl radical (OHº), superoxide anion (O
 <sub>2</sub>º-), singlet oxygen (¹O
 <sub>2</sub>), oxygen peroxide (H
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) and ozone (O
 <sub>3</sub>), a powerful oxidant formed by endothermic reaction from O
 <sub>2</sub> [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For RNS it is nitric oxide (NO) peroxynitrite (ONOO
 <sup>-</sup>), the nitrosyl cation (NO
 <sup>+</sup>), the nitrosyl anion (NO-), nitrous acid (NH
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>) .... [

 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Under physiological conditions these reactive species play an important role in cell signalling, regulation of cytokines, growth factors, as immunomodulators, etc [
 <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and are involved in the natural aging of the human organism [
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. But when the balance is broken between oxidizing agents and antioxidant systems, which characterizes oxidative stress, these free radicals will have deleterious effects on all biomolecules [
 <xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The most reactive, hydroxyl radical can oxidize various molecules in its proximity, including DNA, phospholipids, and proteins. The superoxide can generate other free radicals and come into contact with nitric oxide (NO) to give the peroxynitrite radical (ONOO
 <sup>-</sup>), a powerful oxidant with NO depletion. Hydrogen peroxide is converted to hydroxyl and can cross cell membranes. Ozone is a powerful oxidant of lipid chains, it can generate other free radicals, and interact with a large number of organic and inorganic compounds [
 <xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Damage caused by these free radicals will affect cell membranes through the phenomenon of lipid peroxidation, oxidation and denaturation of proteins, DNA damage which can induce inflammatory immune responses, mutations and tumorigenesis risk, apoptosis [
 <xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. So oxidative stress is involved in the occurrence of certain pathologies such as cancers, autoimmune diseases, cataract, Alzheimer’s and neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, chronic kidney disease etc [
