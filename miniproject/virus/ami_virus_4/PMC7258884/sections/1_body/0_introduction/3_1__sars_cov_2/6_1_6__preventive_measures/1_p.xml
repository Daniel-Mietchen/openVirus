<p>Since there is no safe and effective medicine against COVID-19, the WHO has developed a strict guideline to adhere to during the pandemic. Standard precautions are very important to set out and adhere to in an effort to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. Preventive measures such as regular hand washing with soap or sanitizer, avoiding handshaking, wearing masks and gloves, social distancing of 1â€“2 m apart, coughing into disposable tissues or into a flexed elbow and self-isolating if symptomatic, avoidance of gatherings and unnecessary travel to affected areas can suppress the spread of viral infection.</p>
