<p>The SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus, which is a large, spherical, enveloped, non-segmented positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus genome of about 30 kb [
 <xref rid="b5-ophrp-11-93" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It consists of 4 main structural proteins which are spike glycoprotein (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [
 <xref rid="b6-ophrp-11-93" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 uses its spike to inhibit the activity of neutralizing antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies are mainly involved in preventing viral particles from interacting with the host cell to infect cells. S protein contains S1 and S2 domains and the interaction between the S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 with a specific host cell receptor called Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) promotes a conformational change in the S protein. The virus mediates membrane fusion with the host cell membrane via the S2 domain and enters the host cell (specifically alveolar epithelial cells) [
