 <title>Acknowledgments</title>
 <p>I would like to thank the MOH in Malaysia and many professions including doctors, nurses, police officers, soldiers, garbage collectors, and cleaners who have been at the forefront in responding to the pandemic COVID-19 outbreak. I would like to thank specifically Dato Dr. Noor Hisham Abdullah who is the Director-General of Health Malaysia. Every day, Dato provides the necessary information and updates of COVID-19 to the country. Lastly, I greatly appreciate the COVID-19 cases whose information was used for this review.</p>
