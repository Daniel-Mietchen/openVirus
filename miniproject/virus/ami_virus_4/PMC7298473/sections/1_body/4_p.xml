<p id="p0030">The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced our way of life and emphasized the need to review and prepare for future outbreaks. Food shortages and increasing costs also highlight the fragility of our food supply chain. To avoid further disruption, produce collection from growers and redistribution strategies to the consumer need to be developed when commercial operations are unavailable. Approaches to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including business closures and global travel restrictions, have triggered an economic depression. This will lead to reduced funding, disproportionately affecting agricultural research, resulting in fewer investigators and international collaborations and ultimately exacerbating plant disease and crop loss. The International Year of Plant Health has been eclipsed by COVID-19. This year was meant to raise awareness of the lack of resources and funding to combat plant diseases and to promote global collaboration and engagement in support of plant health. To prevent the negative effects of COVID-19 on plant disease research, these aims should be adhered to and supported. The developed world is spared the consequences of crop damage caused by plant pathogens, and as a result, policy makers and the public perceive less urgency to invest in new methods to protect against and treat crop infection. Funding for crop disease research continues to decline, partly due to the sporadic nature of outbreaks. In the coming decades, however, population growth will demand increased agricultural output, while we battle against environmental changes that cause drought, flooding, and exacerbated plant disease. Without increased visibility and funding, current initiatives toward the development of resistant crops cannot keep up with the number of infections threatening global food production.</p>
