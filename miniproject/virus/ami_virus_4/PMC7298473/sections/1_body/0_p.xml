<p id="p0010">As the world is gripped by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, plant epidemics are spreading silently, affecting crop yields and the global economy. Parallels have been drawn between the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing plight of plant diseases. While 7.4 million people have been infected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19, 822 million people, over 10% of the world's population, are currently facing food insecurity. Whereas the elderly and obese are at greater risk of fatality from COVID-19, it is the children and the malnourished who are at greatest risk from the consequences of plant diseases. There is no doubt that SARS-CoV-2 has had a negative impact on our food supply chain, causing shortages and increasing costs, yet plant pathogens have a significantly greater impact. Current hunger-related fatalities have reached 4 million this year, 10 times the number of COVID-19 fatalities. Unlike COVID-19, pathogen-related crop loss disproportionately affects food-insecure populations in developing countries (
