<p id="p0020">In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US government granted USD4.3 billion specifically for disease control, prevention, and global health programs. With its high rate of infection and severity of symptoms, it is not surprising that there is increased urgency to overcome and prevent future SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 symptoms range in severity from asymptomatic to multiple organ failure and death. Public-health policies, such as monitoring, screening, contact tracing, and quarantine, help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, comparable measures are expensive, labor-intensive, and time-consuming if applied to control the spread of plant pathogens. Asymptomatic carriers are the leading cause of infection propagation and disease spread, especially for fruit crops such as citrus, papaya, strawberry, and tomato in disease-free regions (

Conventional methods, such as biological (natural predators of the vectors) and chemical (pesticide application), have been utilized for decades, although they do not eradicate the pathogens. Modeling predictions based on environmental conditions, vector proliferation, and viral-genome evolution, could forewarn new disease emergence. Drone surveillance, self-monitoring, and reporting could control both human and plant diseases. But pandemics occur unexpectedly, and strategies to combat emerging infectious agents rarely prevent outbreaks. Thus, to prevent future outbreaks, awareness, preparation, and long-term funding support are required. However, there are large funding discrepancies between human and crop diseases. The 2020 US budget for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) research (USD2.6 billion) is USD150 million more than the entire budget for agricultural research.
