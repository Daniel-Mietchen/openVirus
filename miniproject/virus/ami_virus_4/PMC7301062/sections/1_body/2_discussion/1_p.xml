 </xref> There are only a few studies about these infections causing ACS during the previous epidemics of H1N1 and SARS-CoV in the last decades, mainly in the pediatric population.

 </xref> The literature is also scant on pulmonary infection by SARS-CoV-2 in SCD, considering its short time of history. Few case reports showed that the symptoms could be respiratory or even unspecific, presenting only with vaso-occlusive crisis. Overall, these results suggest a favorable evolution of the viral infection, even in the presence of SCD comorbidities.
