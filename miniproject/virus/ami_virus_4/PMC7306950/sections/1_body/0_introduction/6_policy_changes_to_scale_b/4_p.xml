<p>Health education and literacy is important to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on crises-affected populations. Some countries may have to create massive information and surveillance: people would need to provide a transparent image of travel history, health records, movement and different relevant data so as to assist identification of (potential) infected persons. Therefore, governments and agencies can implement evidence-based approaches recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for combating Covid-19. Hand washing hygiene could be an extremely effective public health intervention, amidst other preventative measures such as regular use of facial masks, safe coughing and social distancing.
