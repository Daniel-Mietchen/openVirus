<p>Governments can adapt several economic palliative measures to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 on households. These could include providing money transfers or state insurance, especially for staff placed on unpaid leave and guarantees for lower medical costs for all. Additionally, governments can reduce policy interest rates and possibly, provide economic stimulus packages to boost business confidence. Such measures would assist with the recovery of demand, once the spread of the virus eases and travel restrictions are lifted. However, such measures could be less effective in coping with the immediate supply-side disruptions that result from imposed shutdowns and travel restrictions.</p>
