<p>The Coronavirus 2, which resulted in the COVID-19 pandemic, although dangerous, and a public health concern, is equally an independent international standard world-wide country governance assessor. It has exposed the strength or lack of institutional governance in countries worldwide: some have been found weak, non-resilient and some completely dysfunctional. There is no sector of the economy immune to the pandemic. Governments are compelled, not just to act fast and forcefully to beat the coronavirus and its economic impact, but equally to act in a manner that would guarantee effective and well-resourced public health measures to curb infection and contagion. Also there is need to implement well-targeted policies tailored towards supporting health care systems and employees. Such measures will shield the incomes of vulnerable social teams and businesses throughout the period of the virus outbreak.

Supportive economic policies, however, will revive business confidence and aid the recovery of demand as virus outbreaks ease.</p>
