<p>Health is very critical to the prosperity of any society. The absence of health affects the overall well-being of an individual and limit movements. In the work place, poor health slows down individual performance levels, firm or organization productivity and ultimately income. This is what COVID-19 has caused and is causing. This disease has locked down economies and created wide-ranging socio-economic disruptions in different countries across the world. For instance, banks have lowered their repayment rates on housing loans; and there is temporary cancellation of value-added tax (VAT) receipts associated with small businesses and company taxies, amongst other `protecting and saving the economyâ€™ measures. The unavoidable impact of all these measures is that government revenues have dwindled. Artisans and petty traders have been left without recourse whilst some small-scale businesses and even some big ones have collapsed, especially where there is total lockdown. Schools are closed resulting in months of lost education. The impact is felt across all sectors as the most effective mitigating strategies according to experts and WHO still remain hand washing, social distancing and lockdowns.
