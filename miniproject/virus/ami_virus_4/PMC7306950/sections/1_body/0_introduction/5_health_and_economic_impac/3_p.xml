<p>Apart from the morbidity and mortality rates of COVID-19, the huge consequence of impaired productivity because of individual sickness, their social unit or their community are glaring.
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Impacts could involve psychological, academic, or skills losses on individual households. The high death rate witnessed in West Africa during the Ebola viral haemorrhagic fever outbreak triggered various impacts. Such impacts included dilated socio-economic impacts; declined growth rates; wage lost because of peopleâ€™s inability to work or their contagion concerns; exaggerated economic condition and food insecurity; loss of education and lost jobs.

The global infection rate is high and increasing exponentially, and only the early preventative measures imposed by governments on populations could possibly slow down the death rates. However, some of the preventative measures directly or indirectly affect the economy negatively.
