<p>Discernably, this paper recommends coordinated public-private sector partnership recovery policy agenda with all stakeholders in health and business anchored on scientific evidence regarding balancing health and the economy that aligns to an informed systems approach and cost-sharing strategies in re-opening of businesses, without possible resurgence of the virus. This approach entails phased opening of the economy and educational institutions where the effect of the pandemic is wide spread. Importantly, there must be synergy between the Health policy and the Economic and Post COVID-19 recovery policy in order not to tip the delicate balance between health and economy. While some of these policy strategies and approaches may be contextual and country specific, they are nonetheless universal. The time for international geo-political and public health collaboration and solidarity is now and the world must save no resources in protecting regional, national and international populations and economies. Now is the time to spend to save!</p>
