<p id="Par5">Recently, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is dubbed ‘camel-flu’ virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Seven years after its first human infection in 2012 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], more than 2400 human cases have been reported with approximately 35% case fatality rate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. MERS-CoV has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome consisting of two partially overlapping large replicase open reading frames (ORFs) and at least nine downstream ORFs including the ORFs encoding the four canonical structural proteins of coronaviruses, the envelope proteins S, E, and M and the N protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Similarity of MERS-CoV with influenza viruses is not in its genome organization but probably in its respiratory symptoms, zoonotic potential, and the mode of respiratory transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition to influenza viruses and MERS-CoVs, arthropod-borne viruses, such as dengue and Zika, may also pose pandemic threats even though persistent human-to-human transmissions have been rarely reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In this review, we intend to figure out the recipe and the ingredients of a pandemic by looking into the past pandemic events.
