<p id="Par23">The pathogenicity of MERS-CoVs is closely associated with DPP4 expression in the lower respiratory tract of humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>]. Like IAVs, the pathogenicity of MERS-CoV in hDPP4 mice may be an initial indicator. While hDPP4 mice produced severe symptoms upon MERS-CoV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>], mice whose mDPP4 replaced with hDPP4 or modified to contain MERS-CoV binding hDPP4 motif (m-hDPP4-mice) showed little clinical signs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>]. hDPP4 mice might be good for the evaluation of antiviral candidates, but not as a pathogenicity indicator, due to the ectopic expression of hDPP4. hDPP4 mice might be better to observe increases of growths and clinical signs after MERS-CoV infection. Comparison of viral titers in the lungs and the lung pathology of MERS-CoV infection with those of the first MERS-CoV isolate HCoV-EMC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] would give clues concerning the replication potential of MERS-CoVs.
