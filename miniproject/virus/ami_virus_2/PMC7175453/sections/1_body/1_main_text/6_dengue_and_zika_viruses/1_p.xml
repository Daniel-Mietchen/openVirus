<p id="Par11">Mosquitos are a vector and non-human reservoir of dengue and Zika viruses. Back and forth transmission of these viruses between mosquitos and humans and the ‘antibody dependent enhancement’ of infection to dengue and Zika viruses might potentially support the expansion of susceptible human pools [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. However, currently there are very limited cases of human-to-human transmission of these viruses through body fluid contacts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], and it is unlikely to result in rapid global spreading of the viruses like IAVs, especially since mosquito distribution is geographically limited [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. Hence, possible human-to-human transmission of the dengue and Zika viruses is inevitably limited by the requirement of intimate contacts or blood transfusion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Even though this ecological limitedness, solid control measures against mosquitos should be implemented to prevent dissemination of these arthropod-borne viral diseases in a global scale.
