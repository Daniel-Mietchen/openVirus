<p id="Par7">IAVs can be largely divided into the human-like and avian-like types given the receptor specificity of their HA proteins. Normally, human-like IAVs bind to α-2,6 sialic acid (α-2,6 SA) receptor whereas avian-like IAVs prefer α-2,3 SA receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. It has been revealed that an aquatic bird mallard expresses more α-2,3 SA than α-2,6 SA in the respiratory tract but α-2,6 SA is barely expressed in the intestinal tracts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The preference of avian IAVs to α-2,3 SA might be related with fecal transmission of the viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Regarding zoonotic transmission of IAVs, swine is considered the intermediate host that can shuffle genetic segments between avian and human IAVs to produce a novel strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Because swine expresses both α-2,3 and α-2,6 SAs in the upper respiratory tract, avian and human IAVs all can infect swine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. It has been also challenged by additional studies that demonstrated similar SA distribution between human and swine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. However, it has been shown that avian IAVs could transmit between swine, and novel strains could be generated from contact swine by the genetic reassortment between avian and swine IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], which cannot be demonstrated in humans. Hence, it appears that swine rather than humans may play a major role for the generation of novel strains at the interface of avian and human IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], and swine might be considered an adaptation host of IAVs, as indicated in the cases of zoonosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] and reverse zoonosis of IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Then, it should be questioned whether avian IAVs can be transformed into a pandemic virus by the adaptation only in humans. Even though some reports indicated acquired transmissibility of avian IAVs through multiple passages in ferrets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] and transmissibility of avian IAVs in swine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>], it may be limited contact opportunities of the same avian IAV to be repeatedly adapted in humans, as demonstrated in Herfst et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Whether a rare adaptive mutant would grow out to dominate in the human host would be another issue. Unlike severe symptoms observed in novel avian IAV-infected patients, however, swine may be asymptomatic when infected with avian IAVs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Unless efficient transmissibility of an avian IAV in humans was adaptively acquired during a single human infection, there would be only very limited close contact transmission from the patient to the care giver. Close contact transmission of avian H7N9 IAVs between patients and care givers have been recognized, but the contacted care givers have rarely shown the signs of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. This may demonstrate why avian IAVs have acquired necessary adaptive mutations in swine rather than in humans to be pandemic viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].
