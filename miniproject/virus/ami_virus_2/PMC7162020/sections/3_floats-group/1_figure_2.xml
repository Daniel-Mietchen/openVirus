 <caption>
  <p>A) Sequence alignment for the amino acids between the 2019‐nCoV and SARS‐CoV spike RBD domains. Conserved (pink arrows) and nonconserved (black arrows) mutations are highlighted. Gray: hydrophobic aliphatic, orange: neutral aromatic, yellow: thiol and sulfide, green: hydroxy, red: basic, blue: carboxylic acid, brown: primary amide, pink: proline. B) Various binding interactions between the 2019‐nCov spike protein (pink) and ACE2 (blue; spike protein homology model built by using Modeller, based upon PDB ID: 2AJF) in regions 1 and 2. C)–E) Zoomed in views of several spike protein–ACE2 interactions depicted in (B). Residues before the forward slash refer to 2019‐nCoV; the amino acid after the slash refers to its corresponding identity in SARS‐CoV.</p>
