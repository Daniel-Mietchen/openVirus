  <bold>What′s sauce for the goose?</bold> Little is known about the coronavirus causing the current outbreak; however, it shares strong sequence homology with its better‐studied cousin SARS‐CoV. Based on previous studies of targeting SARS‐CoV, we suggest four potential candidates that could be used to drug the viral spike protein, RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase, and coronavirus main proteinase.
