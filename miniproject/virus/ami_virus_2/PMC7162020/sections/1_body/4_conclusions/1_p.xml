<p>2019‐nCoV and SARS‐CoV share very high sequence identity in their RdRp and 3CLpro proteins. Previous work has resulted in the discovery of some potent small‐molecule therapeutics based on these two proteins for SARS‐CoV. We envision that remdesivir and 3CLpro‐1 could be directly applied to treat 2019‐nCoV. As remdesivir is a drug undergoing a clinical trial, the authorities in China could negotiate with Gilead for the possible use of this drug for patients suffering with 2019‐nCoV. Other potential small‐molecule therapeutics for 2019‐nCoV are the molecules shown in Figures

 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. The 2019‐nCoV spike RBD is significantly different from the SARS‐CoV spike RBD, especially in two regions when binding to ACE2. This difference effectively rules out the use of previously developed antibodies and therapeutic peptides for the SARS‐CoV spike RBD. However, a possible quick solution to inhibit the RBD–ACE2 interaction so as to prevent the infection is to use peptides derived from RBD and ACE2 and cocktails thereof.
