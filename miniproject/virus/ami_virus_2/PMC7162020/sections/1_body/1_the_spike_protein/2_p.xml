<p>The roles of the SARS‐CoV spike protein in receptor binding and membrane fusion make it an ideal target for vaccine and antiviral development. The development of SARS vaccines based on the spike protein has been summarized in several previous reviews.

Alternative approaches are to directly use the 2019‐nCoV RBD in combination with immunity‐promoting adjuvants as a vaccine to trigger the human body to develop antibodies for the 2019‐nCoV RBD, thereby neutralizing the virus.
