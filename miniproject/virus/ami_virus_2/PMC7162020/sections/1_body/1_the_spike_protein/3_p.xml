<p>Although there are published results about therapeutic antibodies and peptides developed to neutralize the SARS‐CoV spike protein, they are expected to have little use in neutralizing 2019‐nCoV. As discussed above, the two engaging regions in the spike RBD for binding ACE2 are very different between SARS‐CoV and 2019‐nCoV. Antibodies and peptides targeting two regions in the SARS‐CoV RBD are expected to interact weakly with the 2019‐nCoV RBD. Novel antibodies and therapeutic peptides that interact potently with the 2019‐nCoV RBD can be used to block its interaction with ACE2. Several research groups, including ours, have developed methods for building macrocyclic peptide libraries and applying them to the quick identification of macrocyclic peptide ligands for drug targets.

 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Application of these libraries to search for potent ligands for the 2019‐nCoV RBD or the two ACE2‐engaging peptide regions will potentially lead to rapid discovery of anti‐2019‐nCoV macrocyclic peptides. Although our group has initiated this effort, the lengthy drug‐discovery process will not make it possible to help patients in the current epidemic in this way. Learning from the study of SARS‐CoV, a possible alternative is the direct use of peptides derived from the 2019‐nCoV RBD and ACE2. Peptides derived from both the SARS‐CoV RBD and ACE2 have been developed as novel therapeutics against SARS‐CoV infection by blocking SARS‐CoV RBD–ACE2 binding. For example, a peptide that overlaps the RBD sequence (aa 471–503) can specifically block the binding of ACE2 to the SARS‐CoV RBD and inhibit the entry of SARS‐CoV into Vero cells with an IC
