<p>Both 2019‐nCoV and SARS‐CoV encode a large (2019‐nCoV: 1253 aa; SARS‐CoV: 1273 aa) spike protein. The sequence identity of this protein between the two origins is 76 %. A large variation exists at the N terminus (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> A). The spike protein has two regions, S1 and S2. For the SARS‐CoV, there is a receptor binding domain (RBD) in the S1 region that interacts with ACE2 with high affinity. The current assumption is that 2019‐nCoV also engages this RBD to bind ACE2 for entry into its human host cell. The alignment of the RBD from the two origins shows 73.5 % sequence identity (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> A). However, many nonconserved mutations that interact directly with ACE2 have accumulated in the two structural regions (1 and 2 in Figure

 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> Both crystal and cryo‐EM structures of the SARS‐CoV spike‐ACE2 complex (PDB IDs: 2AJF and 6ACD) have showed that only regions 1 and 2 engage in hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with ACE2. As many residues in these two regions have been replaced in 2019‐nCoV, this will lead to a loss of some of these interactions. It has also been predicted that the 2019‐nCoV RBD interacts with ACE2 more weakly than the SARS‐CoV RBD.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> However, both regions are highly looped structures. Large variations in the two regions will inevitably lead to structural rearrangements that potentiate novel and possibly even stronger interactions with ACE2. For region 2, there is almost no similarity in the sequence between the two virus origins; however, it is premature to presume that the protein will fold in the same way to interact with ACE2. Assuming that region 2 of 2019‐nCoV folds in the same way as that in SARS‐CoV, F486 will be placed right at the position that engages in strong hydrophobic interactions with both L79 and M82 in ACE2 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> C). These interactions do not exist in the SARS RBD–ACE2 complex due to the significantly smaller L472 in that position. Another residue that potentially engages in strong hydrogen‐bonding interactions is Q474, which is at the correct distance to engage a rearranged Q24 in ACE2 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> C). In region 1, the critical residue Y484 in SARS‐CoV is replaced by Q498 in 2019‐nCoV. However, P499, a proline that is a known secondary‐structure disruptor, is expected to lead to a structural rearrangement of region 1 in the SARS‐CoV RBD. In combination with Q498 and N501, new hydrogen‐bonding interactions that might involve K353 and other residues in ACE2 could form (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> D). Another notable difference between 2019‐nCoV and SARS‐CoV in the RBD is K417(2019‐nCoV)/V404(SARS‐CoV). This is a residue in the middle of the concave RBD binding surface that involves no interaction between SARS‐CoV and ACE2. However, the long, positively charged K417 could potentially engage in strong hydrogen bonding and salt‐bridge interactions with H34 and D30, respectively, in ACE2 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> E). Although molecular simulation may be used to analyze all these possible interactions in detail, uncertainty about them will persist until the structure of the 2019‐nCoV‐RBD–ACE2 complex is determined by crystallography or cryo‐EM. Given the urgency of the matter, there must be multiple research groups working on this. We hope to see their results within a short time. Alternatively, the 2019‐nCoV RBD could be expressed, and its affinity toward ACE2 could be independently determined biochemically and compared with that of the SARS‐CoV RBD. Before any solid experimental results are available, any claims about the weaker binding of the 2019‐nCoV RBD toward ACE2 than that of the SARS‐CoV RBD is premature.
