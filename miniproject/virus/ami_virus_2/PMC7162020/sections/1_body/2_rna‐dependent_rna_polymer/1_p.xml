<p>Although 2019‐nCoV and SARS‐CoV share 82 % sequence identity at their genomic RNA level, their RdRp proteins share a remarkable 96 % sequence identity (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> A). RdRp involves a very large and deep groove as an active site for the polymerization of RNA. Residues that show variations between the 2019‐nCoV and SARS‐CoV RdRps are mostly distal to this active site (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> B).
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> This high sequence conservation between the two enzymes makes it very likely that any potent agents developed for the SARS‐CoV RdRp will exhibit equal potency and efficacy on the 2019‐nCoV RdRp. Although not extensively explored, several agents exist that target the SARS‐CoV RdRp or its catalyzed polymerization process. One such compound found to show antiviral activity was aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA; Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). ATA is an anionic polymer shown to bind to a variety of protein targets, including gp120 of HIV‐1 and HIV‐2, that has been demonstrated to prevent SARS‐CoV replication (IC

 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Despite computational models validated against known ATA targets predicting RdRp as the bound target, no experimental evidence has demonstrated this relationship.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> Beyond this exception, the remaining RdRp inhibitors have been nucleoside analogues, and these provide the most promising avenue towards disrupting viral RNA replication. The nucleoside analogue ribavirin (RBV, Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) has been tested against SARS‐CoV, and in SARS‐ and MERS‐infected patients.

 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> At best, efficacy with RBV was inconclusive, with some studies showing a worsening of patient outcomes (as reviewed by Stockman, et al.).
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> Exonuclease activity by the enzyme nsp14 has been shown to be able to remove mismatches as well as incorporated nucleoside analogues, and inactivation of nsp14′s exonuclease activity has been shown to increase the efficacy of nucleosides like RBV.

 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref> In order to develop nucleoside analogues to effectively inhibit viral RNA replication, the nucleoside must either evade detection by the exonuclease or must outcompete exonuclease activity. Remdesivir (GS‐5734) is an excellent example of the latter. An adenosine analogue prodrug with a 1′‐nitrile, it displayed potent efficacy against SARS and MERS in human airway epithelial (HAE) cell models and in mice (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=0.069 and 0.074 μ
 <sc>m</sc> for SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, respectively, in HAE).
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> Broad‐spectrum activity against various bat coronaviruses was also demonstrated.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> The susceptibility of CoV to remdesivir was shown to be increased in strains with inactivated exonuclease activity.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> CoV resistance to remdesivir was studied in the model β‐coronavirus, murine hepatitis virus (MHV). MHV passaged in the presence of the parent nucleoside, GS‐441524 (which contains a 5′‐hydroxy group instead of a phosphoramidate), developed two mutations in the RdRp, F476L and V553L. These mutations conferred a 5.6‐fold increase in resistance to remdesivir in MHV and a sixfold increase in resistance when the homologous mutations were introduced to the RdRp of SARS‐CoV (0.01 vs. 0.06 μ
 <sc>m</sc>). Mice infected with this resistant SARS‐CoV had significantly lower lung viral titers 4 days post‐infection.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> Altogether, remdesivir has been shown to outcompete the proofreading ability of nsp12, and mutations that confer resistance attenuate virulence. Efforts towards drugging coronavirus in a RdRp manner should provide a basis not only to develop therapeutics for 2019‐nCoV, but could provide broad‐spectrum antivirals useful for future CoV outbreaks.
