<p>The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019‐nCoV) is a newly emerged human‐infectious coronavirus (CoV) that originated in a Wuhan seafood market but has quickly spread in and beyond China.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> As of February 4th 2020, there have been more than 20 000 diagnosed cases and 426 confirmed deaths (Xinhua News). As the pathogenesis of this virus is yet to be understood, there are few treatment options available to healthcare professionals who are fighting this epidemic at the front line. Praise needs to be given to Chinese researchers who have acted quickly to isolate and sequence the virus. The availability of the virus genome sequence (GenBank ID: MN908947.3) makes it possible to identify treatments. Although it is essential to develop vaccines, small molecules, and biological therapeutics to specifically target the 2019‐nCoV virus, it is unlikely that any effort made at the moment will benefit patients in the current outbreak. However, 2019‐nCoV shares 82 % sequence identity with severe acute respiratory syndrome‐related coronavirus (SARS‐CoV, GenBank ID: NC_004718.3) and more than 90 % sequence identity in several essential enzymes (see figures below). Therefore, what we have learned from several medicinal chemistry studies on SARS‐CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS‐CoV) may be directly used to help us treat 2019‐nCoV. CoV relies on its spike proteins to bind a host cell‐surface receptor for entry (Figure

 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref> For 2019‐nCoV, it is evident that this receptor is angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref> After the virus′ entry into the host cell, its positive genomic RNA attaches directly to the host ribosome for the translation of two large, coterminal polyproteins that are processed by proteolysis into components for packaging new virions.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> Two proteases that participate in this proteolysis process are the coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro) and the papain‐like protease (PLpro).
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> In order to replicate the RNA genome, the CoV encodes a replicase that is an RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> These four proteins are essential for the pathogen. Therapeutics currently targeting spike, RdRp, 3CLpro, and PLpro are possible treatments for 2019‐nCoV. In this viewpoint, we shall analyze similarities in spike, RdRp, 3CLpro, and PLpro proteins between 2019‐nCoV and SARS‐CoV, and suggest possible prevention and treatment options. Most compounds discussed will be experimental compounds and drug candidates; for a review of repurposed drugs for treating coronaviruses and other viruses, see Li et al.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> As little is known so far about the virulence of this virus, we shall also discuss the interactions between spike and ACE2 that might challenge the current view that 2019‐nCoV is less virulent than SARS‐CoV owing to weaker interactions between spike and ACE2.
