<p>Both 3CLpro and PLpro are cysteine proteases; therefore covalent inhibitors with high potencies could potentially be developed for specific targeting. Recently, Simmons and co‐workers developed a class of potential covalent cysteine protease inhibitors that specifically target CoV entry.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> No direct relationship to 3CLpro and PLpro was drawn; however, this class of vinylsulfone small molecule was able to inhibit replication of the virus in the nanomolar range. Simmons′ group discovered that inhibition of serine proteases (by using camostat) as well as cysteine protease (by using their vinylsulfone protease inhibitors) is able to combat SARS‐CoV. The survival of mice suffering from SARS‐CoV who were treated with this combination therapy significantly increased in comparison to the control group. The group studied several variations of vinylsulfone small molecules, which are shown below with their corresponding IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0008" ref-type="fig">8</xref> (compounds 
 <bold>A</bold> to 
 <bold>C</bold>). Once again, these vinylsulfone small molecules provide an additional scaffold for SAR development. They can also be tested against the specific 3CLpro and PLpro in order to further elucidate their specific mechanism of action. Given their high potency against SARS‐CoV, it is possible that they are equally potent against 2019‐nCoV.
