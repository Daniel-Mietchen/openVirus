<p>3CLpro and PLpro are two proteases that process the polypeptide translation product from the genomic RNA into the structural and nonstructural protein components vital for the replication and packaging of a new generation of viruses. PLpro also serves as a deubiquitinase that functions to deubiquitylate host cell proteins such as interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) as well as to inactivate the pathway for nuclear factor κ‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells (NF‐κB).
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> This leads to immune suppression in the cells of the host being infected by the virus. Because both proteases are vital to the virus for replication and controlling the host cell, they are viable targets for antiviral agents. Similar to the RdRp protein, 2019‐nCoV and SARS‐CoV share a remarkable 96 % sequence identity in their decoded 3CLpro (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> A). 3CLpro naturally forms a dimer, and each monomer contains two regions: the N‐terminal catalytic region and the C‐terminal region (Figure

 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref> Most residues in the catalytic region that display variations between two origins are on the protein surface. Although S46(2019‐nCoV)/A(SARS‐CoV) might possibly interact with either substrates or inhibitors that bind to the active site, the small structural change from A to S is expected not to interfere significantly with the binding of small‐molecule inhibitors to the active site of 2019‐nCoV 3CLpro (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref> C). Small‐molecule agents that potently inhibit the SARS‐CoV 3CLpro are expected to function similarly toward the 2019‐nCoV 3CLpro. Unlike 3CLpro, PLpro from the two origins shares only 83 % sequence identity (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> A). Residue variations between the two origins cover almost all the surface of PLpro. These substantial variations in amino acid composition are expected to influence how the two PLpro enzymes interact with their ligands. However, the three secondary‐structure components that form the active site do not vary in the two PLpro proteins (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref> B).
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref> It is possible that an inhibitor developed for the SARS‐CoV PLpro would also work for the 2019‐nCoV PLpro.
