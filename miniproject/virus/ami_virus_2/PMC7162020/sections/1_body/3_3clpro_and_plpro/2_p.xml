<p>Over the last two decades, much of the research in drugging SARS‐CoV has focused on the development of small‐molecule, peptide, and peptidomimetic inhibitors of 3CLpro and PLpro. Many of the inhibitors are in the micromolar range in terms of binding to and inhibiting the two proteases.

 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0045" ref-type="ref">45</xref> However, a few low‐n
 <sc>m</sc>‐range inhibitors have been identified that can be used in combination with other protease‐inhibitor therapies to help combat the virus.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> For the purpose of this section, the inhibitors will be divided into categories based on the proteases that are inhibited to stop the virus from taking control of the host cells. Each of the compounds was tested in terms of a SARS‐CoV, a MERS‐CoV, or a deubiquitylate cell model. Several hundred small molecules have been developed to inhibit 3CLpro and PLpro; however, these are the most potent since the early 2000s. The classifications with structures and inhibitory concentrations are summarized in Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. These compounds are in the low‐μ
 <sc>m</sc> range in terms of inhibition, leaving room for further development. However, extensive SAR studies have already been performed on these final‐stage products that guide the researcher in knowing which substituents to modify when targeting 2019‐nCoV. This summary can also guide both researchers and health professionals in using combinational therapy with two or more of these compounds, as this has already been done in terms of treating people suffering with a CoV infection. One of these compounds (highlighted as 3CLpro‐1 in Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0007" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) has an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value against SARS‐CoV of 200 n
 <sc>m</sc>.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref> This potency could be adequate to combat 2019‐nCoV.
