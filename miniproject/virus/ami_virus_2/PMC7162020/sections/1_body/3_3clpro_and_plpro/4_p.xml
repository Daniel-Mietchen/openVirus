<p>More distant members of the orthocoronavinae subfamily can also provide inspiration for new therapeutic regimens, such as with studies done with feline coronavirus (FCoV) and its mutated form, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). The peptidyl bisulfite adducts GC376 and NPI64 (Figure 
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-fig-0009" ref-type="fig">9</xref>) were both found to be potent inhibitors of FIPV replication at 0.04 μ
 <sc>m</sc>.
 <xref rid="cbic202000047-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">47</xref> 3CLpro of FIPV and SARS‐CoV share about 50 % sequence identity, but the overall structure is conserved. In a FRET‐based activity assay, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of GC376 against recombinant SARS 3CLpro was found to be 4.9 times that against FIPV 3CLpro (4.35 vs. 0.72 μ
