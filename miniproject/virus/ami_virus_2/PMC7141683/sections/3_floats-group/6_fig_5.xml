  <title>qRT-PCR and Western blotting verification of 16 DEGs.</title>
  <p>(A) Gene expression associated with DEGs was verified by RT-qPCR; RNA levels were normalized to GAPDH. Three replicates were performed, and bars represent the means Â± SD (n = 3). (B) The analysis of the NP expression levels by Western blotting in different groups. The A549 cells were transfected with ISG expression plasmids for 12 h, and then the cells were infected with IBV at a MOI of 0.1 for 24 h. GAPDH was used as a control. The NP protein was identified with a rabbit anti-NP polyclonal antibody. The expression of the 12 ISGs was detected using a mouse anti-EGFP monoclonal antibody. A549 cells transfected with empty plasmid were employed as a negative control (NC). (C) The expression rates of NP were compared by gray scale analysis.</p>
