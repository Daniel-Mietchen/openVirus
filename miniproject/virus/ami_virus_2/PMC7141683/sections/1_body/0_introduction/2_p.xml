<p>When influenza virus invades a host cell, the innate immune system is activated against the virus. During the infection, viruses are recognized by pattern recognition receptors, the innate response is triggered, and interferons (IFNs) are secreted to limit early viral proliferation [
 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This identification leads to an appropriate antiviral response and to the activation of inflammatory response and adaptive immune responses [
 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. While the reasons for the limited host range of IBV remain unclear, one of explanations is that the interaction between IBV and the innate immune system imbues the virus with distinct characteristics, such as the role of ISG15, a typical interferon-induced antiviral gene for the innate immune response [

 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Existing studies describe the production of host cytokines, including IFNs, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and proinflammatory cytokines against influenza virus infection, as integral parts of the process of the cellular antiviral response [

 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We have also reported that type I IFNs, ISGs, and proinflammatory cytokines can be induced by IBV virions at the early stage of virus infection [
