<p>Previous studies demonstrate that single ISGs can inhibit virus replication, and transfecting A549 cells with a plasmid overexpressing ISG15 inhibits respiratory syncytial virus replication to inhibit viral growth [

 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Overexpression system validation does provide additional explanations for the individual roles of the key genes. There are many reports in the literature, such as the overexpression of ISG15 [

 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and ISG15 depletion cells and ISG15 depletion mice have been used as substrates for the study of the functions of IFN-mediated antiviral effectors [

 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In addition, we plan to establish stable cell lines with ISG15 and other ISG overexpression or silencing to more thoroughly investigate the functions of these genes. The replication cycle of influenza virus in A549 cells is ~8 h. The virus enters its second replication cycle 12 h after infection, and there does appear to be a mix of bystander effects.
