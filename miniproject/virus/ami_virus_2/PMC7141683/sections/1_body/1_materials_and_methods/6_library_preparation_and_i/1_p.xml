<p>The libraries for RNA-Seq were prepared using a TruSeqTM RNA sample preparation Kit according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). At first, messenger (poly A+) RNAs were purified using poly A tract, fragmented into short pieces with fragmentation buffer. Second, the double-stranded cDNA were synthesized using random hexamers with mRNA fragments as template, followed by end repair, and phosphorylation. Then, the cDNA fragments of 200-300bp were selected from the Agarose for PCR amplification to construct cDNA library. The cDNA library were quantified with TBS380, and the RNA-seq date were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq xten platform by Majorbio Bio-Pharm Technology Co., Ltd with a read length of 150 nt.</p>
