<p>Then, we specifically mapped the DEGs to KEGG pathways database terms (

We found that several innate immune response pathways were enriched, including NF-kB signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor, and the IL-17 signaling pathway, indicating that the natural immune response plays a significant role in host resistance to IBV infection.
