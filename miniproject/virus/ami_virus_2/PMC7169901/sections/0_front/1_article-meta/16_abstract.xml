 <p>This result reveals that transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is due to 
  <italic>two mechanisms</italic> given by: 
  <italic>human-to-human transmission</italic> (measured with density of population) and 
  <italic>air pollution-to-human transmission (airborne viral infectivity)</italic>; in polluting citieswith low wind speed, the accelerated diffusion of viral infectivity is 
  <italic>also</italic> due to mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission that may be 
  <italic>stronger</italic> than human-to-human transmission.
