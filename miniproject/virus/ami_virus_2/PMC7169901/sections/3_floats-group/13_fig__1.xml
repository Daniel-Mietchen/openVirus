  <p>Note: This result reveals that transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is due to two mechanisms given by: 
   <italic>human-to-human transmission</italic> (based on density of population) and 
   <italic>air pollution-to-human transmission (airborne viral infectivity)</italic>; in particular, in polluting cities, the accelerated diffusion of viral infectivity is 
   <italic>also</italic> due to mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission that may have 
   <italic>a stronger effect</italic> than human-to-human transmission!
