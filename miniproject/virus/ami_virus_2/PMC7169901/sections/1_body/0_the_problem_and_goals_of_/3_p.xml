<p id="p0035">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infection that generates a severe acute respiratory syndrome with serious clinical symptoms given by fever, dry cough, dyspnea, respiratory disorders and pneumonia and may result in progressive respiratory failure and death.

The prime factors of transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Italy, having a very high number of deaths, are crucial elements for explaining possible relationships underlying the temporal and spatial aspects of the diffusion of this viral infectivity worldwide. Results here are basic to design a strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 that generates health and socioeconomic issues for nations and globally (
