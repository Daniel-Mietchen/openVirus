<p id="p0040">Currently, as people with the COVID-19 infection can arrive in countries or regions with low ongoing transmission, efforts should be done to stop disease transmission, prevent potential outbreaks and to avoid second and other subsequent epidemic waves of COVID-19 (

 <xref rid="bb0755" ref-type="bibr">Wells et al. (2020)</xref> argue that at the very early stage of the epidemic, reduction in the rate of exportation could delay the importation of cases into cities or nations unaffected or with low number of cases of COVID-19, to gain time to coordinate an appropriate public health response. After that, rapid contact tracing is basic within the epicenter and within and between importation cities to limit human-to-human transmission outside of outbreak cities or countries, also applying appropriate isolation of cases (
 <xref rid="bb0755" ref-type="bibr">Wells et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 started in southern China was able to be controlled through tracing contacts of cases because the majority of transmission occurred after symptom onset (

 <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control., 2020a</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bb0465" ref-type="bibr">Kucharski et al. (2020)</xref> claim that the isolation of cases and contact tracing can be less effective for COVID-19 because infectiousness starts before the onset of symptoms (cf., 
 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Fraser et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0595" ref-type="bibr">Peak et al., 2017</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Hellewell et al. (2020)</xref> show that effective contact tracing and case isolation are enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within three months, but the probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation that increase transmission before symptoms. In the presence of COVID-19 outbreaks, it is crucial to explain the determinants of the transmission dynamics of this infectious disease for designing strategies to stop or reduce diffusion, empowering health policy with economic, social and environmental interventions. This study focuses on statistical analyses of association between infected people and environmental, demographic and geographical factors that can explain the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 over time, and provide insights to apply appropriate measures of infection control (cf.,

 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Funk et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0650" ref-type="bibr">Riley et al., 2003</xref>). In particular, this study here can explain, whenever possible, factors determining the accelerated viral infectivity in specific regions to guide policymakers to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 (

 <xref rid="bb0460" ref-type="bibr">Kucharski et al., 2015</xref>). However, there are several challenges to such study, particularly in real time. Sources may be biased, incomplete, or only capture certain temporal and spatial aspects of on-going outbreak dynamics.
