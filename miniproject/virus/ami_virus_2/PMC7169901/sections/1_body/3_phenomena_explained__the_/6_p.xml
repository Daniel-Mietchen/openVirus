<p id="p0460">Thus, the variation in bacterial community structure is related to different pollution intensities. 
 <xref rid="bb0745" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. (2020)</xref> show that Staphylococcus increases with PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and is the most abundant bacteria in moderate pollution. In heavy or severe pollution, bacteria that are adaptable to harsh environments, increase. In moderate pollution, PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> might harbor abundant bacteria, especially genera containing opportunistic pathogens. Therefore, effective measures should control health risks caused by bio aerosols during air pollution, especially for immunocompromised, such as elderly and other fragile individuals. This study may support the results here and explain the high mortality in Italy because of COVID-19 in individuals having previous respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and other disorders: in fact, the percentage of deaths compared to the total of those who tested positive for COVID-19 in Italy is of about 80% in individuals aged &gt;70 years with comorbidities as of April 26, 2020 (

 <xref rid="bb0780" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020c</xref>). Papi et al. (2006) also indicate that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is significantly exacerbated by respiratory viral infections that cause reduction of forced expiratory volume in

 <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Gorse et al., 2006</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">Ko et al. (2007)</xref> report that the most prevalent viruses detected during acute exacerbations of COPD in Hong Kong were the influenza A virus and coronavirus. 
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">De Serres et al. (2009)</xref> also point out that the influenza virus frequently causes acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD. Moreover, the study by 
 <xref rid="bb0745" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. (2020)</xref> argues that air pollution in the coastal city of Weihai in China was slightly lower than the inland city of Jinan. This study supports our results that coastal cities in Italy have a lower air pollution and the diffusion of viral infectivity by COVID-19 is lower than hinterland cities having a high level of air pollution (cf., Tab. 1). 
 <xref rid="bb0745" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. (2020, p. 9)</xref> also suggest that different air quality strategies should be applied in inland and coastal cities: coastal cities need start bioaerosol risk alarm during moderate pollution when severe pollution occurs in inland cities.
