<p id="p0470">The composition of ambient particulate matter (PM) varies both geographically and seasonally because of the mix of sources at any location across time and space. A vast literature shows short-term effects of air pollution on health, but air pollution affects morbidity also in the long run (

 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Brunekreef and Holgate, 2002b</xref>). The damages of air pollution on health can be explained as follows. Air pollutants exert toxic effects on respiratory and cardiovascular systems of people; in addition, ozone, oxides of nitrogen, and suspended particulates are potent oxidants, either through direct effects on lipids and proteins or indirectly through the activation intracellular oxidant pathways (
 <xref rid="bb0645" ref-type="bibr">Rahman and MacNee, 2000</xref>). Studies of animal and human in-vitro and in-vivo exposure have demonstrated the powerful oxidant capacity of inhaled ozone with activation of stress signaling pathways in epithelial cells (

 <xref rid="bb0480" ref-type="bibr">Lewtas (2007)</xref> shows that exposures to combustion emissions and ambient fine particulate air pollution are associated with genetic damages. Long-term epidemiologic studies report an increased risk of all causes of mortality, cardiopulmonary mortality, and lung cancer mortality associated with higher exposures to air pollution (cf.,
