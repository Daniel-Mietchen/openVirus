<p id="p0475">About the respiratory activity, the adult lung inhales approximately 10–11,000 L of air per day, positioning the respiratory epithelium for exposure to high volumes of pathogenic and environmental insults. In fact, respiratory mucosa is adapted to facilitate gaseous exchange and respond to environmental insults efficiently, with minimal damage to host tissue. The respiratory mucosa consists of respiratory tract lining fluids; bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells; tissue resident immune cells, such as alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, innate lymphoid cells and granulocytes; as well as adaptive memory T and B lymphocytes. In health, the immune system responds effectively to infections and neoplastic cells with a response tailored to the insult, but immune system must not respond harmfully to the healthy body and benign environmental influences. A well-functioning immune system is vital for a healthy body. Inadequate and excessive immune responses generate manifold pathologies, such as serious infections, metastatic malignancies and auto-immune conditions (
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Glencross et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, immune system consists of multiple types of immune cells that act together to generate (or fail to generate) immune responses. In this context, the relationships between ambient pollutants and immune system is vital to explain how air pollution causes diseases and respiratory disorders in the presence of Coronavirus infection. 
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Glencross et al. (2020)</xref> show that air pollutants can affect different immune cell types, such as particle-clearing macrophages, inflammatory neutrophils, dendritic cells that orchestrate adaptive immune responses and lymphocytes that enact those responses. In general, air pollutants stimulate pro-inflammatory immune responses across multiple classes of immune cells. In particular, the association between high ambient pollution and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is consistent with immunological mechanisms. In fact, diseases can result from inadequate responses to infectious microbes allowing fulminant infections, inappropriate/excessive immune responses to microbes (leading to more collateral damages than the microbe itself), and inappropriate immune responses to self/environment, such as likely in the case of COVID-19. 
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Glencross et al. (2020)</xref> also discuss evidence that air pollution can cause diseases by perturbing multicellular immune responses. Studies confirm associations between elevated ambient particulate matter and worsening of lung function in patients with COPD (
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Bloemsma et al., 2016</xref>), between COPD exacerbations and both ambient particulate matter and ambient pollutant gasses (
 <xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb2005" ref-type="bibr">Papi et al., 2006</xref>) and similarly for asthma exacerbations with high concentration of ambient pollutants (
 <xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">Orellano et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0845" ref-type="bibr">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). In short, associations between ambient pollution and airways exacerbations are stronger than associations with development of chronic airways diseases. 
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Glencross et al. (2020)</xref> argue that ambient pollutants can directly trigger cellular signaling pathways, and both cell culture studies and animal models have shown profound effects of air pollutants on every type of immune cell studied. In addition, studies suggest an action of air pollution to augment Th2 immune responses and perturb antimicrobial immune responses. This mechanism also explains the association between high air pollution and increased exacerbations of asthma – a disease characterized by an underlying Th2 immuno-pathology in the airways with severe viral-induced exacerbations. As inhaled air pollution deposits primarily on respiratory mucosa, potential strategies to reduce such effects may be based on vitamin D supplementation. Studies show that plasma levels of vitamin D, activated by ultraviolet B, are significantly higher in summer and fall than winter and spring season, in a latitude-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Barger-Lux and Heaney, 2002</xref>). Since the temperature and hour of sun depend on latitude, 
 <xref rid="bb0585" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al. (2010)</xref> argue that adequate activated vitamin D levels are also associated with diminished cancer risk and mortality in specific populations (
 <xref rid="bb0500" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Grant, 2002</xref>). For instance, breast cancer incidence correlates inversely with the levels of serum vitamin D and ultraviolet B exposure, which have the highest intensity in summer season. The relationships between adequate supply of vitamin D and low cancer risk are relevant to breast cancer, colon, prostate, endometrial, ovarian, and also lung cancer (
 <xref rid="bb0855" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>). In the context of this study, and considering the negative effects of air pollution on human health and transmission dynamics of Coronavirus infection, summer season may have twofold effects to reduce diffusion of COVID-19:
