 <xref rid="fo0010" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref> is performed using hierarchical multiple regression, a variant of the basic multiple regression procedure that allows to specify a fixed order of entry for variables to control for the effects of covariates and to test the effects of certain predictors independent of the influence of others. The R
