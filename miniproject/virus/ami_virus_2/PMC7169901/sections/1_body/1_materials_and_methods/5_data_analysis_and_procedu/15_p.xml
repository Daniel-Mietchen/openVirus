Beyond this critical estimated point, there are environmental inconsistencies of air pollution associated with meteorological conditions that can trigger a take-off of viral infectivity with damages for health of population and economic system in the short and long run. In addition, the max number of days that cities can exceed the limit set for air pollution and that minimizes the number of infected individuals can suggest implications of proactive strategies and critical decisions of crisis management to cope with future epidemics similar to COVID-19 in society.
