<p id="p0495">At the end of 2019, medical professionals in Wuhan (China) were treating cases of pneumonia and respiratory disorders that had an unknown source (

 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Backer et al., 2020</xref>). Days later, researchers confirmed that the illnesses were caused by a new coronavirus (COVID-19). By January 23, 2020, Chinese authorities had shut down transportation going into and out of Wuhan, as well as local businesses, in order to reduce the spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (

It is the beginning of several quarantines set up in China and other countries around the world to cope with transmission dynamics of COVID-19. Quarantine is the separation and restriction of movement of people who have potentially been exposed to a contagious disease to ascertain if they become unwell, in order to reduce the risk of them infecting others (

In the presence of COVID-19 outbreak in North Italy, Italian government has applied the quarantine and lockdown from 11 March 2020 to 3 May 2020 for all Italy, adding also some holidays thereafter. In fact, Italy was not able to prevent the diffusion of of Coronavirus infection and has applied quarantine as a recovery strategy to lessen the health and socioeconomic damages caused by this pandemic. In addition, Italy applied non-pharmaceutical interventions based on physical distancing, school and store closures, workplace distancing, to avoid crowded places, similarly to measures applied to COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan (cf., 
 <xref rid="bb0620" ref-type="bibr">Prem et al., 2020</xref>). The benefits to support these measures until May 2020 are aimed at delaying and reducing the height of epidemic peak, affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond to this emergency and, as a result reducing the final impact of COVID-19 epidemic in society. In general, non-pharmaceutical interventions are important factors to reduce the epidemic peak and the acute pressure on the health-care system (

 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al. (2019)</xref> report: “negative psychological effects of quarantine including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger. Stressors included longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate supplies, inadequate information, financial loss, and stigma. Some researchers have suggested long-lasting effects. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, officials should quarantine individuals for no longer than required, provide clear rationale for quarantine and information about protocols, and ensure sufficient supplies are provided. Appeals to altruism by reminding the public about the benefits of quarantine to wider society can be favourable”.
