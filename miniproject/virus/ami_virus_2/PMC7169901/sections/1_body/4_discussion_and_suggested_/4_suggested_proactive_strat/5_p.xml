<p id="p0535">An 
 <italic>indirect effect</italic> of quarantine and lockdown in Italy is the strong reduction of airborne Nitrogen Dioxide Plummets and PM
 <sub>10</sub> over Northern of Italy. The maps in 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> by 
 <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">ESA (2020)</xref> show concentrations of nitrogen dioxide NO
 <sub>2</sub> values across North Italy before the quarantine and lockdown in January 2020 and during the quarantine and lockdown in February–March 2020. The reduction in NO
 <sub>2</sub> pollution is apparent in all North Italy. Therefore, the non-pharmaceutical measures taken to cope with the COVID-19 outbreak (e.g., quarantine, closure of schools, the reduction of traffic, etc.), particularly restrictive in the first phase on regions of Northern Italy, have allowed a drastic reduction of concentrations of fine particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and other polluting substances on the Po Valley (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). For instance, in Piedmont, one of the regions of North Italy also having a high COVID-19 outbreak (24 820 infected individuals on 26 April 2020), the concentration of air pollution since the beginning of March 2020 has ever exceeded the limit values of PM
 <sub>10</sub> and has always remained below 50 μg/m
 <sup>3</sup> everywhere. Overall, then, 
 <italic>the vital indirect effect of quarantine and lockdown in Italy</italic> and 
 <italic>other European countries</italic> is a reduction in a short time of NO
 <sub>2</sub> and air pollution, improving the quality of environment that may reduce, associated with quarantine, physical distancing and other inter-related factors, the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. A study by 
 <xref rid="bb0840" ref-type="bibr">Q. Zhang et al. (2019)</xref> shows that with the implementation of air policy in China, from 2013 to 2017, fine particle (PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>) concentrations have significant declined nationwide with health benefits. A possible threat in future is that after the quarantine and lockdown, the industrial activity of regions in North Italy has to resume at an intense pace of production and in next winter-fall season 2020–2021 there may be again high air pollution and meteorological conditions that can lead to other waves of viral infectivity of COVID-19 and/or other dangerous viruses at local and regional level. Of course, non-physical distancing and other long-run factors play a critical part in mitigating transmission dynamics of future epidemics similar to COVID-19, in particular when measures of physical distancing, school and store closures, workplace distancing, prohibition for crowded places are relaxed. The suggested strategy that North Italy and other industrialized regions has to apply,-(considering their geographical location, meteorological conditions and polluting industrialization),- is to avoid to overcome the limits set of PM
 <sub>10</sub> and other pollutants, following more and more sustainable pathways of growth. 
 <italic>One of the findings here suggests that the</italic>
 <italic>max</italic>
 <italic>number of days per year that Italian provincial capitals can exceed the limits set for PM</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>10</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>(particulate matter 10</italic> 
 <italic>μm or less in diameter) or for ozone, considering the meteorological condition has to be less than 50 days</italic>. 
 <italic>Beyond this critical point, the study suggests that environmental inconsistencies because of the combination between air pollution and meteorological conditions trigger a take-off of viral infectivity (epidemic diffusion) with damages for health of population and, as result for economy</italic> and 
 <italic>society</italic>. Italy must design and set up necessary measures to drastically reduce the concentrations of pollution and improve air quality in cities. Italy has to respect Legislative Decree 155/2010 that establishes a maximum number of 35 days/year with concentrations higher than 50 μg/m
 <sup>3</sup> in cities (cf., Law n. 155 of the year 2000). As a matter of fact, the quarantine and other non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce the impact of viral infectivity in the short term, but 
 <italic>to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19, Italy and advanced nations have more and more to sustain a sustainable growth.</italic> The environmental policy to cope with future consequential coronavirus threats has to be also based on sustainable technologies that reduce air pollution improving the quality of air and environment for population (cf., 
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Coccia, 2005</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Coccia, 2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Coccia, 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Coccia and Watts, 2020</xref>). Italy must support, more and more, sustainable mobility as engine of socioeconomic change and redesign cities for people using an urban planning that improves public respiratory health. Moreover, in the presence of the association between air pollution, climate
 <xref rid="fn0030" ref-type="fn">5</xref> and high diffusion of viral infectivity, Italy and other advanced nations have to reduce the motorization rate of polluting machines with a transition to new electric vehicles, generating a revolution in society. It is basic to encourage sustainable mobility, by enhancing local, urban and commuter public transport with electric vehicles and creating vast Low Emission Zones within cities. Italy and Europe have to launch a real sustainable growth roadmap with the aim of complete zero emissions in all inter-related socioeconomic systems. Some studies done in the past show the causality of the reduction of air pollution on health benefits. For instance, 
 <xref rid="bb0605" ref-type="bibr">Pope (1989)</xref> describes the case of a labor dispute that shut down a large steel mill in the Utah Valley for 14 months in 1987. Toxicological studies of particulate matter collected before, during, and after the strike, in the Utah Valley case, provide strong evidence of a causal relation between exposure to ambient particulate matter, mortality and morbidity. Ambient particulate matter concentrations as well as respiratory hospital admissions were clearly decreased during the strike, increasing to prestrike levels after the dispute ended (
 <xref rid="bb0605" ref-type="bibr">Pope, 1989</xref>; cf., the reduction of mortality described by 
 <xref rid="bb0610" ref-type="bibr">Pope, 1996</xref>). Another example is the reductions in acute-care visits and hospital admissions for asthma in Atlanta (GA, USA) in conjunction with 
 <italic>low</italic> air pollution due to traffic restrictions taken during the 2000 Olympic games (
 <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Friedman et al., 2001</xref>).
