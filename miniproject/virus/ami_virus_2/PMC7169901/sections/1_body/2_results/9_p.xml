 <xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table">Table 7</xref> shows the association between variables of infected individuals on 17th March and 7th April 2020, and other variables: a correlation higher than 60% (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001) is between air pollution and infected individuals, a lower coefficient of correlation is between density of population and infected individuals (
 <italic>r</italic> = 48–53%, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001). Results also show a negative correlation between number of infected individuals and intensity of wind speed (
 <italic>r</italic> = −38% and −31%, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05 on 17th March and 7th April 2020 respectively): in fact, wind speed cleans air from pollutants that are associated with possible transmission dynamics of viral infectivity (COVID-19) as it will be explained later.
