 <xref rid="t0055" ref-type="table">Table 11</xref> shows results of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 considering the interpersonal contacts, measured with density of population in cities understudy. In short, results suggest that density of population explains the number of infected individuals, increasing the probability of human-to-human transmission. However, if we decompose the sample in the cities with ≤100 days exceeding limits set for PM
 <sub>10</sub> or ozone and cities with &gt;100 days exceeding limits set for PM
 <sub>10</sub> or ozone, then the expected increase of number of infected individuals is higher in cities having more than 100 days exceeding limits set for PM
 <sub>10</sub> or ozone per year. In particular,
