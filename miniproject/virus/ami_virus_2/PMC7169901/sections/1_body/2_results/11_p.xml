 <italic>r</italic>) between infected individuals and air pollution from 17th March to 7th April 2020, and the increase of the association between infected people and density of people in cities over the same time period, controlling mutual variables, suggest that air pollution in cities seems to be a important factor in the initial phase of transmission dynamics of COVID-19 (i.e., 17th March 2020). In the phase of the maturity of transmission dynamics (7th April 2020), with lockdown that reduces air pollution, the mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission of Coronavirus infection (
 <italic>airborne viral infectivity</italic>) reduces intensity, whereas coefficient of human-to-human transmission increases.
