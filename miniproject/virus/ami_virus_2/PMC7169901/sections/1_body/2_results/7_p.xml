 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> show results considering the categorization of cities per density of population (individuals/km
 <sup>2</sup>). Results reveal that average number of infected individuals increases with average density of people/km
 <sup>2</sup>, but with an arithmetic growth, in comparison to geometric growth of the number of infected individuals with other proposed categorizations of cities. These findings suggest that density of population per km
 <sup>2</sup> is important for transmission dynamics but other factors may support the acceleration of viral infectivity by COVID-19 in association with higher probability of interpersonal contacts in cities having high population density.
