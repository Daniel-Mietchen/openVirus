 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> confirms, 
 <italic>ictu oculi</italic> (
 <italic>in the blink of an eye</italic>), that the coefficient of regression in cities with &gt;100 days exceeding limits set for PM
 <sub>10</sub> or ozone is much bigger than coefficient in cities with ≤100 days exceeding limits set for PM
 <sub>10</sub> or ozone, suggesting that the mechanism of 
 <italic>air pollution-to-human transmission</italic> is definitely important to explain the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="graphic">Fig. 1A</xref> in 
 <xref rid="s0060" ref-type="sec">Appendix</xref> confirms this result that viral infectivity of COVID-19 increases with the mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission (
 <italic>airborne viral infectivity</italic>), but the rate of growth of viral infectivity is also supported by a high density of population that sustains the mechanism of human-to-human transmission. The policy implications here are clear: COVID-19 has reduced transmission dynamics on population in the presence of lower level of air pollution and specific environments based on a higher wind speed (e.g., in South Italy). 
 <italic>Hence, the effect of accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 cannot be explained without accounting for the level of air pollution and other geo-environmental conditions of the cities, such as high wind speed and temperature.</italic>
