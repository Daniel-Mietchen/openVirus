<p id="p0335">These findings are confirmed with hierarchical regression that also reveals how air pollution in cities seems to be a driving factor of transmission dynamics in the initial phase of diffusion of COVID-19 (17th March 2020). In the phase of the maturity of transmission dynamics of COVID-19 (7th April 2020), the determinant of air pollution is important to support the diffusion of viral infectivity of this airborne disease but it reduces the intensity, whereas the factor of human-to-human transmission increases,
