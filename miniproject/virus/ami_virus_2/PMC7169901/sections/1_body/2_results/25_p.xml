<p id="p0425">Let, the average reduction of the coefficients of regression B
 <italic>i</italic> at 7th April 2020 equal to δ = −0.0236, let the coefficient B at 7th April 2020 equal to 1.077, the date when B is close to 0 (
 <italic>zero</italic>) in Italy, with a constant reduction day by day of the value δ from 7th April 2020 onwards, is about 22 May 2020 or thereabouts (this date is a good approximation of when the coefficient B may be lower than 0.05, suggesting a very low number of infected individuals in Italy).
