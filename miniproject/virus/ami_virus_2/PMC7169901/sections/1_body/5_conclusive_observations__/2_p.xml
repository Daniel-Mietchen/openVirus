<p id="p0540">The intensity of human interactions with Earth system has accelerated in recent decades, because of urban development, population growth, industrialization, deforestation, etc., with changes in physical, biological, and chemical processes in soils and waters. In particular, human activity, driven by a high level of world population that is about eight billion (
 <xref rid="bb0705" ref-type="bibr">U. S. Census Bureau, 2020</xref>), has induced changes to Earth's surface, cryosphere, ecosystems, and climate that are now so great and rapid, advancing the geological epoch of Anthropocene (

 <sup>2</sup> levels (

Exposure to airborne particulate matter and ozone is associated with increases in mortality, hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and other health disorders (

 <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">Hoek et al., 2013</xref>). The idea that high levels of air pollution have a detrimental effect on human health is now rarely contested, and acute exposures to high concentrations of air pollutants exacerbate cardiopulmonary disorders in human population (
