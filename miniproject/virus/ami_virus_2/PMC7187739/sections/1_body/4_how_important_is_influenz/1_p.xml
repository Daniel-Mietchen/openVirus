<p>Consideration should urgently be given at present for use of vaccines for preventable respiratory infections in South Africa. This includes use of the influenza vaccine, particularly as low and middle-income countries in the southern hemisphere are now moving through autumn and on to winter, with an increased risk of influenza and other respiratory virus infections, including possibly SARS-CoV-2 infections. Furthermore, there should also be consideration for use of the pneumococcal vaccine, despite the increased costs, since pneumococcal infections also peak in winter and are clearly associated with an increased risk of co-infection with influenza.(
