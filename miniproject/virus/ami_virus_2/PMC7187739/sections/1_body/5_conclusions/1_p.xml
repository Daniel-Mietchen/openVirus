<p>In the midst of the current global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many have suggested that South Africa with its large HIV and TB population may potentially face a catastrophic health crisis. Although data suggest that those living with HIV do not appear to be at increased risk of getting influenza infection, the risk of more severe influenza is greater. An early report from Spain which suggests that HIV-positive patients do not appear to be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is encouraging. As the pandemic unfolds in South Africa and as the southern hemisphere moves into winter, with the potential increased risk of viral infections, and despite the lack of adequate data at the current time, all people, but particularly those living with HIV, need to be vigilant and follow strictly the guidelines and recommendations of how to keep themselves safe from SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
