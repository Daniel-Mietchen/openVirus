<p>Another important question is whether antiretroviral agents used for HIV infection have a role in the treatment of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection, irrespective of HIV status? The study of lopinavirâ€“ritonavir, in addition to standard of care, versus standard of care alone did not show a significant difference in the primary objective of time to clinical improvement.(
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) A further study was undertaken, in which the RNA-dependent polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2 was modelled, validated and then targeted using anti-polymerase drugs currently registered for use against various viruses (Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir and Tenofovir).(
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) RdRp is a crucial viral enzyme in the life cycle of RNA viruses. In that study, these antiviral agents were shown to be able to bind tightly to RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and thus could possibly be useful for the treatment of this infection.
