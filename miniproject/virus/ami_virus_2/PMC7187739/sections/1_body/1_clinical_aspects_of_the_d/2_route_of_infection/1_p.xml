<p>The route of infection is incompletely understood. The beginning of the outbreak was identified as being through an association with a seafood market that sold live animals, which most of the initial patients had either worked at or had visited.(

 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) With droplet transmission, the virus is released when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, and this then causes infection if it comes into direct contact with mucous membranes. Infection can also occur if a person touches an infected surface and then their eyes, nose or mouth. While droplets typically do not travel more than 2 m, experimental studies have suggested that the virus can remain viable in aerosols for up to 3 h at least.
