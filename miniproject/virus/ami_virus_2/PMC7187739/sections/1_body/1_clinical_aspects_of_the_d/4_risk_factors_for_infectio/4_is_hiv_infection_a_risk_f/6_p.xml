<p>There are very few published studies that have investigated directly the interaction between these novel coronaviruses and HIV infection, and therefore no conclusions can be reached regarding the impact of this coinfection. There is a single case report describing a patient with HIV infection who survived MERS-CoV pneumonia,(

 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) Although not yet published in the scientific literature, Dr Joseph Llibre, an HIV physician and clinical researcher from Spain recently, posted a commentary on the Clinical Care Options website regarding their experiences with the occurrence of COVID-19 in patients with HIV infection.(
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) Quite unexpectedly, but very interestingly, their experience has been that PLWHIV do not appear to be at increased risk of COVID-19 infection, or of progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in association with the infection, irrespective of their viral load or CD4 cell count. In fact, the risk appears to be even lower than in the general population. It does not appear to be related to the use of antiretroviral agents in HIV-infected patients, such as use of the protease inhibitors. The absence of an increased risk of COVID-19 in PLWHIV was thought to be surprising because dysregulation of the immune response especially that which involves the T-lymphocyte system seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infections, and the occurrence of lymphopenia is a recognized risk factor for the occurrence of ARDS and death among infected patients. Importantly, currently available data on host entry mechanisms and intracellular pathways harnessed by the HIV virus and the novel coronavirus do not show cooperative pathogenesis. While this may seem to be reassuring for PLWHIV, appropriate additional studies need to be conducted to address these issues and confirm these findings, before such reassurance can be given.
