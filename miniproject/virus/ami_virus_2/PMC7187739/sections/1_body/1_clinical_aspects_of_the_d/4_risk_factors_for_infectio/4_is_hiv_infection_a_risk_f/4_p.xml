<p>Thus, what can we extrapolate from influenza virus infections in PLWHIV, including those with and without concomitant TB? With regard to influenza, and recognizing that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is different from the influenza virus, there is no apparent increased risk of infection in HIV-infected persons; however, adults with AIDS experience a much higher influenza-related mortality, which decreases with the use of ART but does not disappear.(
