<p>The NICD communication mentioned previously,(
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) based largely on the studies with influenza virus, described above, furthermore indicated the following:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>It is not currently known whether patients living with HIV and/or TB have a higher, lower or similar risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Although PLWHIV appear to be at no increased risk of getting influenza infection, the risk of more severe disease is greater, even in those on ART, especially in those with a low CD4 cell count and in those not taking ART.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Dual infection with HIV and TB appears to increase the risk of severe influenza infection.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Since both TB and SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted through respiratory secretions, there is a possibility that patients with both infections may transmit both TB and SARS-CoV-2 more readily.</p>
