 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the most common conditions and/or comorbidities associated with severe infection and mortality, including those that are confirmed and those that are suspected as being possible risk factors but have not yet been proven. In one study from Italy, of patients who died of the infection, the mean number of pre-existing comorbidities was 2.7 and only three patients had no comorbid illness.(
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) Other conditions or comorbidities that have been documented in some of the early descriptions of the SARS-CoV-2 cases in Wuhan include liver disease (cirrhosis), hyperlipidaemia, hyperuricaemia, cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson's disease, renal dysfunction and recent surgery.(
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) Both with the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV epidemics, similar comorbidities were also noted, with hepatitis B infection being an additional risk factor for SARS, and obesity being an additional risk factor for MERS-CoV infection.(
