<p>The studies reviewing the data for HIV-infected persons during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, as an example, were somewhat contradictory. One study suggested that there did not appear to be an increased risk of H1N1 infection in HIV-infected adults without advanced immunosuppression or other comorbid illnesses; however, risk factors for influenza infection, especially cigarette smoking, are more common in HIV-infected persons and these factors could modify the risk for influenza infections in such patients.(

In hospitalized HIV-infected patients on ART and not severely immunocompromised, the disease severity and clinical outcomes were similar to that of HIV-uninfected persons.(
