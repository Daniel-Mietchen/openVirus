<p>Furthermore, a number of recent publications (in the scientific literature, from various organisations and even the lay press) have debated the issue of whether smoking, including the use of tobacco smoke, marijuana and vaping (as well as other substance abuse), may be a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, as well as the cause of more severe infections.(

 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) Some publications do suggest a relationship between smoking and risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection; for example, citing the much higher smoking rate of males in China compared with females and the associated higher mortality from SARS-CoV-2 in males in China, as well as the higher rate of need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation and higher mortality in smokers versus non-smokers.(
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) Other studies quote evidence, both from human and rat data, which confirm that smoking can increase the ACE-2 receptor in the respiratory tract, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2,(
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) although other publications suggest that this association is less clear-cut.(
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) Finally, a recent systematic review of the literature concluded that while further research on this topic was required, the limited data available, albeit not adjusted for other factors potentially impacting on outcome, concluded that smoking was most likely associated with negative progression and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2,(
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) while a second meta-analysis concluded that active smoking was not associated with severity of SARS-CoV-2.(
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) Nevertheless, despite this current uncertainty many organisations, such as the World Health Organization and the National Institute of Drug Abuse, recommend smoking cessation strategies not only to alleviate the harm caused by smoking, in general, but also because smoking cessation may potentially lessen the risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection.(
