<p>Coronaviruses are very important pathogens that affect both humans and animals.(
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) During epidemics they are a cause of some 30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults and play a role in severe respiratory infections in both adults and children.(
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) The human coronaviruses are divided into four genera; these include alpha-coronaviruses, beta-coronaviruses, and the latter include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses.(
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) The former two genera cause infections in humans. Coronaviruses are medium-sized, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses whose name derives from their characteristic crown-like appearance in electron micrographs.(
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) While until recently, six human coronaviruses had been identified, in December 2019, a seventh human coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, also a beta-coronavirus, was identified initially in Wuhan, China, and it has subsequently become pandemic.(
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) As with the SARS epidemic, the initial outbreak of the new coronavirus occurred during the Spring Festival in China, the most famous of all festivals in China, during which more than 3 million people travel countrywide, creating favourable conditions for spread of the highly contagious virus.(
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) All coronavirus infections are zoonotic, and following mutation, recombination and adaptation are passed on to humans.(
