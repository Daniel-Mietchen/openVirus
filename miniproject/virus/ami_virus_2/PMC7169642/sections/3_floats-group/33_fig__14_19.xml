  <p>Time course of antibody formation during rubella virus infection. Day 0 on the scale indicates the time at which the first appearance of the exanthem is observed. The incubation period lasts up to 10 days. As early as before the appearance of the exanthem, swollen lymph nodes are found, and rubella virus is detectable in the blood and pharyngeal lavage. Immediately after the onset of symptoms, IgM can be detected in the blood; its concentration decreases within 3â€“6 months. IgG antibodies appear after IgM antibodies and remain detectable for life</p>
