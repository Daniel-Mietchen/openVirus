  <p>Genome replication of picornaviruses. In a first step, the RNA genome is translated (
   <italic>1</italic>), leading to the synthesis of a polyprotein, which is processed into the individual protein components by the activity of the proteases 2A and 3C/3CD (
   <italic>2</italic>). The protein Vpg, which is subsequently uridylylated, arises during this process (
   <italic>3</italic>). Cellular proteins are also needed for this process. The Vpg-pUpU complex attaches to the 3′ terminus of the RNA genome (
   <italic>4</italic>), acting as a primer for the synthesis of the negative-sense RNA strand by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (
   <italic>5</italic>), which is also generated by proteolytic processing of the polyprotein. New Vpg-pUpU complexes attach to the 3′ terminus of the newly synthesized negative-sense RNA molecules (
   <italic>6</italic>). They function as primers for the synthesis of more RNA molecules (
   <italic>7</italic>), which now possess positive-sense polarity (
   <italic>8</italic>) and serve both as messenger RNA (mRNA) for further protein synthesis and as viral genomes
