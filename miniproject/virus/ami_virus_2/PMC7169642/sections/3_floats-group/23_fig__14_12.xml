  <p>Genome organization of flaviviruses. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Yellow fever virus, vaccine strain 17D. (
   <bold>b</bold>) TBE virus, strain Neudörfl. (
   <bold>c</bold>) Hepatitis C virus. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (
   <italic>BVDV</italic>), strain SD-1 (non-cytopathogenic). In hepatitis C virus and pestiviruses (BVDV), an IRES is located in the 5′ UTR. In members of the genus 
   <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (yellow fever virus and TBE virus), the 5′ end of the genome is modified by a cap group. The genomes of flaviviruses have a continuous open reading frame. It encodes a polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into the different protein components (structural proteins in 
   <italic>colour</italic>). Responsible for this process are enzymes which are a constitutive part of the polyprotein and autocatalytically activate themselves, as well as cellular proteases and signalases. The 
   <italic>numbers</italic> refer to the amino acid positions in the polyprotein at which the cleavages occur
