  <p>Genome organization of hepatitis E viruses. The mRNA genome contains a cap structure at the 5′ terminus, and is polyadenylated at its 3′ end. It comprises three open reading frames: ORF1 encodes a non-structural protein containing the domains for a methyltransferase, a protease, a helicase and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The protease cleaves the precursor protein into the different functional domains. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is responsible for the synthesis of both the antigenomes and new viral RNA genomes. ORF2 encodes the capsid protein and ORF3 encodes a non-structural protein of 13.5 kDa</p>
