 <caption>
  <p>Genome structure of picornaviruses using the example of poliovirus 1. The viral genome possesses a covalently linked protein (
   <italic>Vpg</italic>) at the 5′ terminus and is polyadenylated at its 3′ end. Adjacent to the 5′-terminal Vpg there are RNA sequences that form a cloverleaf-like secondary structure, which is essential for genome replication. 
   <italic>IRES</italic> indicates the internal ribosome entry site that is necessary for binding of ribosomes to the viral RNA genome. The single open reading frame encodes a large precursor polyprotein that is processed into the distinct viral components (structural proteins, non-structural proteins and enzymes) by the proteolytic activity of 2A, 3CD and 3C proteins. The regions representing the proteases are illustrated in 
   <italic>red</italic>; 
   <italic>red arrows</italic> indicate the cleavage sites of the respective proteases
