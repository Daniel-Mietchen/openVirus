   <bold>b</bold>) IRES region of the encephalomyocarditis virus. The computer analysis prediction of the energetically favoured secondary structure of the 5′ UTR of the viral genome is shown. The 
   <italic>numbers</italic> refer to the corresponding nucleotide positions starting from the 5′ terminus of the genome. By interaction with various cellular proteins, the secondary structures stabilize a nucleotide sequence located directly upstream of the start codon used for translation of the polyprotein. This sequence can form a partial double-stranded region (indicated by 
   <italic>stars</italic>) with sequences at the 3′ end of the 18S ribosomal RNA (marked in 
   <italic>red</italic>) within the small (49S) ribosomal subunit. The illustrated sequence ends with the start codon (AUG) of the polyprotein
