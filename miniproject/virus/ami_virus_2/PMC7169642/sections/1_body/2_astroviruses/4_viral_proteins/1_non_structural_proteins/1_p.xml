<p>Two precursor proteins are produced: NSP1a (103 kDa) comprises 920 amino acids and is encoded by ORF1a; NSP1ab has a molecular mass of 160 kDa and is a precursor fusion protein that arises from a hairpin-mediated translational frameshift between ORF1a and ORF1b. After translation, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (3C-like protease) mediates cleavage of the precursor protein NSP1a into probably four proteins (NSP1a/1, NSP1a/2, NSP1a/3 and NSP1a/4); 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> resembles the 3C protease of picornaviruses and is located in the central domain NSP1a/3 of the precursor protein. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is encoded by ORF1b. Few data are available concerning the function of the other cleavage products (TableÂ
