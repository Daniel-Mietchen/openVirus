<p>The precursor protein (pVP87) for the production of the capsid proteins is encoded by ORF2 and comprises on average 780 amino acids; depending on the virus type, the molecular mass ranges between 70 and 90 kDa. The precursor protein aggregates to particular structures, and is subsequently cleaved by trypsin-like cellular proteases into a conserved amino-terminal domain (VP34) and a carboxy-terminal domain (VP26, VP29); the size of the latter can vary as additional trypsin cleavage sites are located within the neighbouring amino acid sequences and may be alternatively recognized and used by the enzymes. In the carboxy-terminal regions of both precursor protein pVP87 and its cleavage products VP26/VP29, a series of acidic amino acids have been described which are cleaved by cellular caspases. Both these proteolytic cleavage reactions by trypsin-like enzymes and caspases are necessary for the production of infectious virus particles.</p>
