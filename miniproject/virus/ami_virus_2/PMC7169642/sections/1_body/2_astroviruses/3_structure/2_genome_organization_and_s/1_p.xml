<p>The astrovirus genome consists of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA; it is polyadenylated at its 3′ terminus and has a length of about 6,800 nucleotides (6,771 and 6,813 nucleotides in human astroviruses 1 and 3, respectively). Sequence analyses revealed three open reading frames with overlapping ends (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00146" ref-type="fig">14.6</xref>). ORF1a and ORF1b encode non-structural proteins NSP1a and NSP1a/1b. A sequence of 20 nucleotides in the region overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b is highly conserved; it forms a hairpin structure that leads to a partial translational frameshift during translation of the genomic mRNA. Thereby, the codons encoded by ORF1a are fused in frame with those of ORF1b, resulting in the production of a joint precursor protein, NSP1ab. ORF2 encodes the precursor protein for the capsid proteins. At the 5′ terminus of the genomic RNA, there is a short untranslated sequence upstream of the start codon of ORF1a which comprises 10–20 and 45–85 nucleotides in avastroviruses and mamastroviruses, respectively. Also at the 3′ end of the genomic untranslated sequences are present (130–135 nucleotides in avastroviruses and 59–85 nucleotides in mamastroviruses).
