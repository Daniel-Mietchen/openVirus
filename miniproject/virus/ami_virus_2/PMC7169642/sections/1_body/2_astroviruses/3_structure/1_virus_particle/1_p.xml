<p>Members of the astrovirus family have non-enveloped, spherical and icosahedral capsids with a diameter of about 28–30 nm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00145" ref-type="fig">14.5</xref>). At the capsid surface, approximately 10 % of the virions are characterized by structures which resemble a five- or six-pointed star. The particles are formed from a precursor protein, pV87, i.e. proteolytically cleaved, thereby generating capsid proteins VP34 and VP26/VP29. The processing is necessary for astrovirus infectivity. When cultivated in CaCo-2 cells (human colonic carcinoma cell line), newly synthesized virus particles must be treated with trypsin in order to gain infectivity.
