<p>Astrovirus infections can be diagnosed by detection of viral proteins via antigen-capture ELISA, by electron-microscopic representation of virus particles from samples of faeces or by amplification of viral RNA by PCR. During infection, IgM antibodies and later IgG and IgA antibodies against viral structural proteins and are detectable by ELISA. The antibody concentration declines rapidly after the disease. Neither cultivation of the virus in cell cultures nor serological methods play a role in diagnostics. Nothing is known about cellular immunity.</p>
