<p>Astroviruses infect enterocytes in the small intestine and replicate in these cells. Only few signs of cell destruction and inflammation can be found histologically. The relatively low inflammatory activity can be associated with the property of capsid proteins binding to the C1q complement component, thus inhibiting the activation of the complement system as a defence reaction of the unspecific immune system (see 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_7). Furthermore, capsid proteins seem to exert an additional function that determines the pathogenesis of astrovirus infection: they cause an enhancement of the permeability of the epithelium of the small intestine. Because of this, the interaction of occludin, a tight-junction protein, with the cellular actin skeleton is impaired. This process is independent of active viral replication, and it may contribute to the diarrhoea symptoms.</p>
