<p>Human astrovirus infections were first described during an outbreak of infectious gastroenteritis in a maternity clinic in the UK in 1975. Afterwards, it became evident that astroviruses are distributed worldwide and that they are, after caliciviruses, the second most frequent cause of non-bacterial diarrhoea (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec001467" ref-type="sec">14.3</xref>). Eight serotypes have been found in human astroviruses to date, but serotype 1 is predominant. Astrovirus infections are preferentially found in children aged less than 2 years, but are also found in older people and in immunosuppressed patients. Excretion of the virus in the faeces persists for 1–2 weeks, but in immunosuppressed individuals also for considerably longer. Transmission occurs via the faecal–oral route.
