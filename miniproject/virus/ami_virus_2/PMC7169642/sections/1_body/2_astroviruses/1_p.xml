 <italic>Astroviridae</italic>. Like picornaviruses, caliciviruses and hepeviruses, astroviruses possess a non-enveloped capsid and a positive-sense RNA genome. During the replication cycle, they synthesize a subgenomic mRNA species which is necessary for the production of structural proteins. The name is derived from Greek 
 <italic>astron</italic> (
 <italic>cσtpov</italic>), which means “star”, alluding to the star-like shape of a part of the astrovirus particle (Fig.
