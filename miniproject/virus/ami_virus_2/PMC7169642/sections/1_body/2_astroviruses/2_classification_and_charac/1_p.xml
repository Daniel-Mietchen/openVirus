<p>The family 
 <italic>Astroviridae</italic> is currently subdivided into two genera, the members of which differ in regard to their host specificity (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab00145" ref-type="table">14.5</xref>). The viruses of the genus 
 <italic>Mamastrovirus</italic> infect humans and several mammals (swine, ovines, bovines, felines). The genus 
 <italic>Avastrovirus</italic> includes viruses that infect birds (chickens, ducks, turkeys). Most astroviruses can easily be cultivated in vitro.
