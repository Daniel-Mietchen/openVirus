<p>Like human and mammalian astroviruses, avian astroviruses cause subclinical infections and mild diseases. Both serotypes of turkey astrovirus provoke gastroenteritis and are associated with the poultry enteritis mortality syndrome. These viruses replicate in epithelial cells of the intestine as well as in various other tissues, including thymus, bursa of Fabricius, spleen and kidney. Avian nephritis virus infects kidney epithelial cells, and is capable of inducing an interstitial nephritis. Duck astrovirus is associated with hepatitis; a mortality rate of more than 50Â % has been observed in experimental transmissions.</p>
