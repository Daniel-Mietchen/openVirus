<p>The initial step of the reproduction cycle is the translation of non-structural precursor proteins NSP1a and NSP1ab. How protein synthesis is initiated is unclear. No covalently linked protein has been found at the 5′ terminus, as observed in picornaviruses and caliciviruses; the UTR does not seem to form an IRES (see Sects. 
 <xref rid="Sec00141" ref-type="sec">14.1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Sec001467" ref-type="sec">14.3</xref>). Whether the 5′ end is capped is also not clear. In some translation events, a shift of the reading frame occurs in the carboxy-terminal region of NSP1a, resulting in an in-frame fusion of NSP1a and NSP1b. This process resembles the synthesis of the non-structural proteins of togaviruses (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec0014164" ref-type="sec">14.6</xref>). After synthesis, the NSP1a and NSP1ab precursors are both autocatalytically cleaved by 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, whereby the functions of the diverse non-structural proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, become available. The synthesis of complementary negative-sense RNA molecules is achieved by the activity of RNA polymerase. The negative RNA strands serve as templates for the synthesis of (1) new genomic mRNA molecules and (2) subgenomic mRNA species of about 2,000 nucleotides. The latter contain the ORF2 coding sequences and serve for translation of precursor protein pVP87 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00146" ref-type="fig">14.6</xref>). Apoptosis is induced in infected cells during viral replication, resulting in cell death and release of progeny viruses. However, it is unknown which of the viral proteins are responsible for this process. Caspase activities that are induced during apoptosis cleave capsid proteins VP26 and VP29, thus increasing the infectivity of released progeny viruses.
