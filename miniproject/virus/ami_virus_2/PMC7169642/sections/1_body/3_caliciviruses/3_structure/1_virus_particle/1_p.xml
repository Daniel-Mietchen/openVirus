<p>Members of the family 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> have non-enveloped, spherical and icosahedral capsids with a diameter of about 34–39 nm and depressions in the lateral faces (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00147" ref-type="fig">14.7</xref>). They consist of 90 units of the dimeric VP1 (60 kDa). The virus particles contain one or two molecules of VP2 (23 kDa in noroviruses), which is associated with the RNA genome, and Vpg, which is covalently linked to the 5′ terminus of the genome.
