<p>The genome of caliciviruses is constituted of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA, which is polyadenylated at the 3′ terminus and has a length ranging from 7,000 to 8,000 nucleotides (7,338–7,708 nucleotides in noroviruses, 7,437 nucleotides in rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus, 7,690 nucleotides in feline calicivirus and 7,431–7,490 nucleotides in sapoviruses). A viral protein (15 kDa) is covalently linked to the 5′ terminus; it is equivalent to Vpg of picornaviruses (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec00141" ref-type="sec">14.1</xref>). Short untranslated sequences of 10–14 nucleotides in length are located in the 5′ region of the genome upstream of the start codon of ORF1. Genome sequence analyses revealed two open reading frames in sapoviruses and lagoviruses and three open reading frames in noroviruses and vesiviruses; their ends partially overlap (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00148" ref-type="fig">14.8</xref>). ORF1 is located in the 5′ half of the genome and encodes the precursor of the non-structural proteins. ORF2 is located in the 3′ half of the genome and encodes capsid protein VP1; in sapoviruses, the VP1 open reading frame is directly interconnected with ORF1. The additional reading frame ORF3 (ORF2 in sapoviruses) is responsible for the synthesis of VP2.
