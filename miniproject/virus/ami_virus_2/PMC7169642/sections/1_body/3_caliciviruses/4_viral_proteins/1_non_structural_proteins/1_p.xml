<p>The non-structural proteins of caliciviruses are synthesized as a precursor protein of about 180–190 kDa. It is post-translationally cleaved into single components by 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, which resembles the 3C protease of picornaviruses (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec00141" ref-type="sec">14.1</xref>). The arrangement of the individual components is similar in all caliciviruses: the amino-terminal sequences constitute a non-structural protein (p48 in noroviruses) of variable length that is characterized by a transmembrane domain and that is associated with Golgi vesicles. It interacts with cellular vesicle-associated membrane-protein-associated protein A (VAP-A), which regulates the SNARE-mediated fusion of intracellular vesicles; the function of this viral protein is not completely resolved. The directly adjacent sequences represent an NTPase with similarity to the picornaviral 2C protein and which possibly functions as a helicase. The domain of Vpg, which is covalently linked to the 5′ terminus of the genome, is separated from the NTPase by an amino acid region of unknown function; it contains many hydrophobic amino acids and possibly induces the interaction of the precursor protein with intracellular membrane compartments, such as the 3A protein in picornaviruses. The adjoining sequences represent the domains of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Table
