<p>The incubation period is very short and usually lasts 2–3 days. Noroviruses and sapoviruses cause short-lasting (2–3 days) but severe gastroenteritis with vomiting and diarrhoea. Severe general symptoms are not observed. The disease is self-limiting and does not cause long-lasting damage. Protracted courses are observed in immunocompromised patients who excrete infectious viruses for considerably longer periods. Threatening situations can emerge in older patients owing to massive fluid loss.</p>
