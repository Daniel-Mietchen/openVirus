<p>Norovirus and sapovirus infections can be diagnosed by detecting virus particles via antigen ELISA or by detecting viral RNA by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) from stool samples. Evidence of virus particles in stool samples by means of electron microscopy does not play a role in diagnosis. Serological analyses to detect virus-specific antibodies do not have diagnostic significance. Nothing is known concerning cellular immunity.</p>
