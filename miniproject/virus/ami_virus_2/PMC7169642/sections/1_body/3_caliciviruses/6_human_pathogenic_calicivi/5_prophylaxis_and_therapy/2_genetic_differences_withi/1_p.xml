<p>Blood groups are characterized by the individual composition of glycolipids or proteins on the surface of erythrocytes and other somatic cells. In humans, there are a myriad of different blood group systems; the so-called histo-blood group antigens can be assigned to three families, namely the Lewis, secretor and ABO families. For example, the common feature of all groups of the ABO system is the presence of 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine as the central sugar molecule of carbohydrate structures on cell surfaces. They are linked to galactose molecules that carry fucose residues. Together they compose the basic structure of all blood groups representing blood group 0. If one or two additional 
 <italic>N</italic>-galactosamine molecules are linked to the galactose, these carbohydrate structures represent blood groups A and B, respectively. The biosynthesis of blood group antigens depends on a number of enzymes that are subject to genetic variation. If viruses use carbohydrate structures of blood group systems as receptors, the susceptibility of the respective infection is genetically determined. Therefore, people with genetic defects in the enzyme α(1,2)-fucosyltransferase are not able to synthesize the carbohydrate structures that are necessary for binding of noroviruses and sapoviruses to the cell surfaces. Hence, these “non-secretor” phenotypes cannot be infected by certain types of noroviruses and sapoviruses: they are resistant. Inasmuch as noroviruses frequently mutate, and as a result also change their receptor preferences, it must be assumed that such resistance does not apply for all virus types. Similar genetically determined resistances are also known from parvovirus B19 infections: this virus binds to blood group antigen P, a glycosphingolipid. People who do not possess the genetic information for the enzymes which are necessary for the synthesis of the corresponding carbohydrate structures cannot be infected by these types of parvoviruses (see 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20)
