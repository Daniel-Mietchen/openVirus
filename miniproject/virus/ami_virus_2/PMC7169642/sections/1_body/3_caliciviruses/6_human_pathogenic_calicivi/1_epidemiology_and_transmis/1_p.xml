<p>Infections with noroviruses and sapoviruses have a global distribution. Both virus types contain several genogroups with variants that are pathogenic in humans and which can be subdivided into different genotypes. This suggests that caliciviruses have a very high mutation rate because of the high error rate of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which essentially contributes to the high norovirus and sapovirus variability. Infections cause gastroenteritis that is associated with severe diarrhoea and vomiting. The introduction of obligatory notification has revealed that noroviruses and sapoviruses are responsible for most intestinal infections in the countries of central Europe. The viruses are transmitted by infected individuals via stool and vomitus. Excretion of the virus lasts some days longer than the symptoms; therefore, infected individuals should not return to work not until 2 days after cessation of diarrhoea. Faeces of immunosuppressed individuals can remain infectious for weeks or months. This causes considerable logistic problems in hospitals because patients cannot be transferred unless viruses are undetectable in stool. The non-enveloped calicivirus particles possess a high environmental resistance, which has to be considered when choosing appropriate disinfectants. Fewer than 100 virus particles are sufficient to induce an infection. Therefore, these pathogens can easily be transmitted by the faecalâ€“oral route, but also by contaminated food and drinking water. They induce epidemics in collective facilities such as schools and homes or on cruise ships, where many people have to cohabit in a relatively confined space. Particularly affected are retirement homes and hospitals, where there is a high turnover of patients, nursing staff and visitors. In such outbreaks, the infection is also frequently transmitted by infected personnel. Whereas sapoviruses have principally been observed in gastrointestinal diseases of children, and until now have not been detected in food, noroviruses also cause food-borne infections (food poisoning); therefore, a strict code of conduct is prescribed for kitchen personnel. More recently, noroviruses have also been detected in the faeces of calves and swine. This suggests a zoonotic potential for this virus group, but this has not been demonstrated so far, however.</p>
