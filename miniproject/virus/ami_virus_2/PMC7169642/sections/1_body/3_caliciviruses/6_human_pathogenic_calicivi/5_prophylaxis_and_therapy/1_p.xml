<p>The best measure to avoid infections with human caliciviruses is systematic compliance with both personal and general hygiene measures. This also includes disinfection by using appropriate disinfectants, the strict isolation and non-transport of infected patients within the hospital, and cleaning of plants for food production and water supply. In extreme situations, entire hospital units and sections and even whole hospitals have to be closed to admission of patients. Cruise liners are temporarily quarantined. Chemotherapy or vaccines do not exist.</p>
