<p>Noroviruses and sapoviruses infect and destroy mature intestinal enterocytes. As cellular receptors, noroviruses and sapoviruses use carbohydrate structures which are present in ABH and Lewis blood group antigens as well as on the surface of enterocytes. These saccharide structures are present not only in cell-bound form, but also in soluble form, e.g. in breast milk. Individuals belonging to the secretor-negative type are resistant because of the lack of genetic information for the enzyme Î±(1,2)-fucosyltransferase. Breast-fed infants of secretor-positive mothers ingest the sugar molecules via breast milk and are temporarily protected because the saccharide molecules can complex with the viruses in the intestine of children, thereby preventing infection of enterocytes.</p>
