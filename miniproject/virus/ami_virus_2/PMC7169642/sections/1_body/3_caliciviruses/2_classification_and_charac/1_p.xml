<p>The family 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> is subdivided into five genera, which differ especially in the structure of their genome (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab00147" ref-type="table">14.7</xref>). The genera 
 <italic>Vesivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Lagovirus</italic> comprise only animal pathogens. Feline calicivirus, which belongs to the vesiviruses, is a widespread cat flu pathogen. Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus is most prominent among the genus 
 <italic>Lagovirus</italic> because it was used to combat the rabbit plague in Australia some decades ago. Human pathogenic viruses that cause diarrhoea are classified into the genera 
 <italic>Norovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sapovirus</italic>. Their members are characterized by considerable sequence differences in their genomes, and are subdivided into five groups (GI–GV), which in turn contain a large number of different genotypes. They have denominations that commonly are derived from the place where they were isolated. Norovirus types GI, GII and GIV are human pathogenic viruses, whereas genogroups GIII and GV infect cattle and mice. Sapoviruses infect predominantly humans; only members of genogroup III have been isolated from swine. Until now, only one species, Newbury-1 virus, has been assigned to the genus 
 <italic>Nebovirus</italic>: it infects cattle and causes diarrhoea in calves. Recently, new members of caliciviruses have also been isolated from pigs in Canada. These St-Valérien viruses cannot be assigned to any genera today; therefore, the new genus 
 <italic>Valovirus</italic> has been proposed. Only a few caliciviruses can be cultivated in cell culture: feline calicivirus and San Miguel sea lion virus can be propagated largely without problems, whereas the propagation of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus is only possible in primary hepatocytes. No cell culture system has been described for noroviruses and sapoviruses.
