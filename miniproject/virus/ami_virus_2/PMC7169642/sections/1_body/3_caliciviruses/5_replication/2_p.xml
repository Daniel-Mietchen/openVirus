<p>The first step during viral replication is the translation of non-structural proteins in noroviruses and vesiviruses, as well as the translation of the fusion products of the non-structural and capsid proteins in lagoviruses and sapoviruses using the positive-sense RNA genome as mRNA. The viral genome is characterized by neither a 5′-cap structure nor an IRES element at its 5′ terminus, which otherwise mediate binding of ribosomes for cellular or picornaviral translation, respectively (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec00141" ref-type="sec">14.1</xref>). Instead, caliciviruses have developed an alternative mechanism for translation initiation that is mediated by Vpg linked to the 5′ terminus of the RNA genome. Vpg interacts with the cellular translation initiation factor eIF-3, a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit; binding of Vpg to eIF-3 mediates attachment of the small ribosomal subunit to the 5′ end of the viral genome. This probably induces binding of the large ribosomal subunit and the translation of ORF1 from the adjacent start codon. The synthesized precursor proteins are autocatalytically cleaved by 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, whereby the functions of the different non-structural proteins, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, become available.
