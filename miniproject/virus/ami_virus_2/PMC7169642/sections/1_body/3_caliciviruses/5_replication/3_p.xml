<p>RNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyses the synthesis of complementary negative-sense RNA molecules. The negative-sense RNA molecules are used as a template for the synthesis of new Vpg-primed genomic and subgenomic RNAs. These have a length of 2,400–2,700 nucleotides and encode the structural proteins. This process is similar to the replication process in astroviruses (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec001446" ref-type="sec">14.2</xref>). The subgenomic RNAs are bicistronic and are responsible for the synthesis of VP1 and VP2 in lagoviruses and noroviruses. Translation initiation of VP2 occurs by an unusual mechanism. After termination of VP2 translation, the ribosomes remain bound to the mRNA. Next, translation is reinitiated, resulting in the synthesis of VP2. VP1 capsid proteins aggregate to precursor virus particles, into which the viral RNA genomes are deposited. Interestingly, subgenomic RNAs are also packaged in some virions; this has been shown in rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus, but not in feline calicivirus.
