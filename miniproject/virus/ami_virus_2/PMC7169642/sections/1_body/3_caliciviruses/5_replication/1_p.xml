<p>Noroviruses and sapoviruses use the carbohydrate structures of the ABH and Lewis blood group antigens as cellular receptors, whereby distinct virus types bind to different versions of these histo-blood group antigens. Histo-blood group antigens are complex sugar structures which are present on the cell surface of erythrocytes and epithelial cells of the mucosa of the respiratory tract and the intestine. The cellular receptors of feline calicivirus are Î±(2,6)-linked sialic acid molecules, which are modifications of junction adhesion molecule A, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. After adsorption, virus particles are probably incorporated by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Nothing is known concerning the processes that lead to the release of the viral genome from capsids and endosomes.</p>
