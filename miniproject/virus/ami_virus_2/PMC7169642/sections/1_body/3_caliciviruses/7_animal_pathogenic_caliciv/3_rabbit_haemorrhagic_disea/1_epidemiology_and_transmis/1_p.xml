<p>Around 1985, a seemingly new severe epidemic disease appeared in rabbits (
 <italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus</italic>) in China. The illness, named rabbit haemorrhagic disease, spread rapidly worldwide. It is characterized by severe haemorrhagic symptoms and fulminant hepatitis. Parvoviruses were primarily assumed as the aetiologic agent; however, calicivirus was rapidly described as the true pathogen. The origin of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus in China has not yet been finally determined. Retrospective serological analyses have revealed that the virus was disseminated in the UK as long ago as 1950 without having shown any epidemic signs at that time.
