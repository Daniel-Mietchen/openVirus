<p>Rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus gained dubious popularity when it was released for biological control of rabbit populations under the name “rabbit calicivirus” in Australia in 1996. It has been and is being controversially discussed whether other species of the unique Australian fauna may be endangered in addition to rabbits. On the other hand, the tremendous rabbit plague in Australia had considerable consequences for the flora and consequently also for the fauna. The application of the virus led to a significant reduction of the rabbit population (60 % or more) in some regions of Australia; however, in other regions it had no influence. Farmers disseminated the virus over long distances within the continent, and a lively trade in infected rabbits flourished. Furthermore, the virus was illegally introduced to and spread in New Zealand. As expected, healthy rabbits carrying infectious viruses were found in Australia and New Zealand after a short time. This is an infallible sign of natural attenuation of the virus in its host.</p>
