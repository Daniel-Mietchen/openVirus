<p>Because of the fulminant course of the infection, an immune response cannot be established in the animals; the serological diagnosis is generally irrelevant. Subclinically infected animals can be identified by detecting specific antibodies in ELISA. The viral genome can be detected by RT-PCR in samples from liver, blood and faeces. Electron-microscopic verification of virus particles in the liver is also possible and is commonly used. Since the virus does not replicate in cell cultures, isolation of the virus is not possible.</p>
