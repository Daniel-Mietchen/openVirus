<p>Feline calicivirus is a very important animal pathogen; it is the causative agent of cat flu. It is transmitted by direct contact and by secretions from the respiratory tract. Many infected cats develop the status of persistent infected virus carriers, which excrete the virus for weeks and months. Feline caliciviruses are antigenetically not uniform, and although distinct serotypes cannot formally be distinguished, there are many isolates whose infections induce no or a non-protecting and incomplete cross-immunity. The variability within the capsid proteins is primarily limited to a little domain of about 100 amino acids, the hypervariable E region. The nucleotide sequences of different isolates can differ in this region by up to 70Â %.</p>
