<p>The clinical pictures caused by caliciviruses that are pathogenic in animals are clearly different from those of human pathogenic caliciviruses. Vesicular exanthema of swine virus is the prototype of the genus 
 <italic>Vesivirus</italic>. Retrospective genetic analyses revealed that vesicular exanthema of swine virus is closely related to San Miguel sea lion virus, which displays different serotypes; it may therefore be of marine origin. Vesicular exanthema virus of swine exhibits a broad host spectrum, which includes various mammals, reptiles, amphibians and even fishes and nematodes. It can also be cultivated in human cell lines in vitro. Between 1930 and 1950, vesicular exanthema of swine virus caused diseases in swine in the USA which could not be distinguished by differential diagnosis from FMD. In mammals, blistering of the skin can be observed, particularly in the extremities (coronary band as well as fins), and in the mucosa of the muzzle. The last outbreak was detected in the USA in 1952; since then the virus has been deemed to be eradicated.
