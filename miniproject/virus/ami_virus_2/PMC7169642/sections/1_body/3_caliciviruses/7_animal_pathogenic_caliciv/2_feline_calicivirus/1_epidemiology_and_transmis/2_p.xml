<p>Recently, feline caliciviruses have been isolated from cats with a new clinical picture. These cats show oedemas in the head and neck and ulcers in the nose, ears and paws, as well as sporadic icterus. Such isolates have been denominated as virulent systemic feline caliciviruses. This is an unfortunate designation as every feline calicivirus infection is systemic and the haemorrhagic component in the clinical picture is rare; in particular, these new isolates do not show any resemblance to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus. Interestingly, these highly virulent isolates originate from vaccinated and mainly old cats. Genetically, they cannot be grouped together; they exhibit a similar heterogeneity like other feline caliciviruses. A genetic marker has not yet been found for these highly virulent strains.</p>
