<p>Meanwhile, all rabbit populations are contaminated, but the initially high mortality has strongly decreased. Apparently, fast attenuation of the virulence seems to occur in rabbits, as shown by the “field study” in Australia and New Zealand. Therefore, animal health measures have been lifted. Besides direct contact between animals and coprophagy (eating faeces), the passive transmission of the virus by arthropods plays an additional role. The virus is deemed to be host-specific; it cannot be propagated in cell culture. European brown hare syndrome virus, a similar but different virus type, causes disease in the European brown hare (
 <italic>Lepus europaeus</italic>). This virus is not contagious for domestic rabbits.
