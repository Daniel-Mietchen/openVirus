 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic>. The name is derived from the Greek word 
 <italic>kalyx</italic> (meaning “goblet” or “chalice”) and alludes to the cup-shaped deepened structures in the lateral surfaces of the icosahedron which can be observed in electron microscope images. Like picornaviruses, caliciviruses possess non-enveloped capsids and single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes. In contrast to picornaviruses, caliciviruses synthesize a subgenomic RNA species during their replication cycle. By this property, they exhibit similarities to hepeviruses and togaviruses.
