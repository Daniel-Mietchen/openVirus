<p>The genome of hepatitis E viruses consists of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA with a length between 7,194 and 7,232 nucleotides, depending on the different genotypes. The 5′ terminus contains a cap structure and the 3′ terminus is polyadenylated. Short non-coding sequences are located at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the genomic RNA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001410" ref-type="fig">14.10</xref>). Sequence analyses revealed three open reading frames with partially overlapping ends. ORF1 is situated in the 5′-oriented part of the genome half and encodes the precursor of the non-structural proteins. The second open reading frame (ORF2) directs the synthesis of the capsid protein. A further open reading frame (ORF3) encodes the small protein pORF3, which comprises 112–132 amino acids and is important for the infectivity of the virus. This open reading frame overlaps with ORF1 in most isolates. Exceptions are the Chinese isolates of hepatitis E viruses (genotype 4), in which the 3′ end of ORF1 encoding the non-structural protein precursor is separated by 28 nucleotides from the translation initiation codon of ORF3.
