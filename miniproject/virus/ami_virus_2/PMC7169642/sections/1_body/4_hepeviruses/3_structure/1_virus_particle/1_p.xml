<p>Hepatitis E viruses have non-enveloped icosahedral capsids with a diameter of 34–39 nm. In electron-microscopic images they resemble caliciviruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00149" ref-type="fig">14.9</xref>) and are composed of 180 units of a capsid protein with a molecular mass of 76 kDa. The particles additionally contain various amounts of a small soluble protein of 14.5 kDa, the origin of which is still uncertain. It is possibly a cleavage product of the capsid protein.
