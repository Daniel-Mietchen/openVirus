<p>The non-structural protein precursor (186 kDa) comprises 1,692–1,709 amino acids and contains the domains of a methyltransferase/guanylyltransferase at the amino-terminal region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001410" ref-type="fig">14.10</xref>). It is necessary for modification of genomic and subgenomic mRNAs with a cap structure. The other non-structural proteins are a protease, which cleaves the precursor protein into the individual functional components, an NTPase/helicase and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab001410" ref-type="table">14.10</xref>). The protease resembles cysteine proteases of the papain type. Whether this protease is responsible for all cleavage reactions and at which sites has not been finally elucidated. In hepatitis E viruses, the sequences encoding the capsid protein are located in a separate reading frame (ORF2) that exhibits the highest degree of conservation. The capsid protein generally has a length of 660 amino acids (about 72–76 kDa) and forms homodimers. It is characterized by a signal-peptide-like sequence followed by a signalase cleavage site at the amino terminus. Glycosylated and unglycosylated forms may be found in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Probably the capsid protein is synthesized in association with the ER membrane and translocated into the ER lumen, whereby the signal peptide is excised and the amino acid chain is modified with sugar groups. Subsequently, retransport of the capsid proteins into the cytoplasm seems to occur. ORF3 encodes a small phosphoprotein, pORF3. Its function has not been conclusively resolved. Nevertheless, two-hybrid analyses have shown that it interacts with the capsid proteins; phosphorylation of the serine residue at position 80 of pORF3 is necessary for interaction. Moreover, binding to bikunin, a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor of serine proteases, and binding to haemopexin, a glycoprotein present in blood plasma that belongs to the acute phase proteins (see 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_7), have also been observed. To what extent these in vitro results are relevant for in vivo replication of hepatitis E viruses is not clear. New data suggest an interaction of pORF3 with dynein of microtubules. It has further been shown that pORF3 is localized in endosomes, where it interferes with protein transport into the compartments of late endosomes, e.g. the transport of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Since this process is a prerequisite for the transport of phosphorylated STAT3 proteins into the nucleus and thus for initiating the non-specific immune responses (see 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_7 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_8), these cannot be properly developed. By inhibiting the early immune defence, the virus may become capable of replicating without impairment.
