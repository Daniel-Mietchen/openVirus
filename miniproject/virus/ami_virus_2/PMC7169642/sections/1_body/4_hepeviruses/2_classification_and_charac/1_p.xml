<p>Hepatitis E viruses are classified into the genus 
 <italic>Hepevirus</italic> (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab00149" ref-type="table">14.9</xref>). They are serotypically homogenous, but are subdivided into four genotypes: genotypes 1 and 2 have only been found in humans, whereas genotypes 3 and 4 represent porcine hepatitis E viruses and are closely related to genotypes 1 and 2 and can also infect humans. Human hepatitis E virus infection is a classic zoonosis in which the pathogens are transmitted from swine to humans. Furthermore, there is also a hepatitis E virus variant which can only reproduce in chickens and other birds.
