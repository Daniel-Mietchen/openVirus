<p>The hepatitis E virus enters the body predominantly through contaminated food and settles in the liver cells. How it arrives there is unknown, as is the nature of its cellular receptor. From the liver the virus is shed into the blood and through bile ducts into the intestine. Similarly to hepatitis A, both excretion of infectious hepatitis E viruses and viraemia reach their peaks before the onset of symptoms. Hepatitis E is pathohistologically characterized by cell necroses and degenerations in the liver; they can also be observed in the otherwise asymptomatic infection in swine. Immigrating granulocytes can be detected in intratubular infiltrates, whereas there are more lymphocytes than granulocytes in the portal region.</p>
