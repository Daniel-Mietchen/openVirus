<p>Hepatitis E virus infections apparently do not induce clinical symptoms in swine. In humans, the severity of the disease seems to correlate with the quantity of hepatitis E virus particles transmitted upon contact. In connection with very low amounts of the virus, infections are asymptomatic, especially in children. After an average incubation period of 6–7 weeks, influenza-like symptoms appear, such as sickness, nausea, fever, itching, joint pain and headaches, which are accompanied by a steep increase in the levels of liver enzymes. The intrahepatic cholestatic jaundice which develops during the disease and is caused by disintegration of liver cells and congestion of bile can last for several weeks (light stool, dark urine and yellow eyes). The mortality rate is 1–4 %, which is considerably higher than that of infections with hepatitis A virus (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec00141" ref-type="sec">14.1</xref>). Particularly striking is the high death rate among acutely infected pregnant women, which is observed mainly in India; it is around 20 %. Apart from the mother, the unborn child may also be affected. Chronic, persistent infections can be established in immunocompromised patients; recipients of organ transplants (liver, kidney, pancreas) have been reported to develop chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, which apparently are linked to persistent hepatitis E virus infections.
