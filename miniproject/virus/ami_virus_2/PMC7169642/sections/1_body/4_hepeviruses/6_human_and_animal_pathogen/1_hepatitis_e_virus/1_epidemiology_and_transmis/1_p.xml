<p>A new hepatitis epidemic emerged in New Delhi in 1955, and was transmitted via the faecal–oral route by contaminated drinking water; it infected 29,000 people. Further outbreaks were observed in Central America, Africa, India, China and the south of the former USSR. Occasionally, patients in non-endemic regions developed similar forms of infectious liver inflammation, e.g. also in central European countries. Owing to the mode of transmission, it was initially thought that hepatitis A viruses had provoked these diseases. They could only be identified retrospectively as hepatitis E virus epidemics. After the first isolation of the virus by Mikhail S. Balayan, whereby he inoculated himself with pathogenic material, the molecular characterization of hepatitis E viruses was performed by Daniel W. Bradley and co-workers in 1988. They were able to isolate virus particles from stool samples; these showed a positive reaction with sera from patients, and caused hepatitis in macaques after feeding. Later, it was demonstrated that the virus can be transmitted to other primates, and even to animal species such as rats, sheep and cattle. Hepatitis E viruses were isolated from swine for the first time in 1997. These viruses, as shown in subsequent investigations, are spread worldwide in both wild boar and domestic pig populations. It is assumed that adolescent animals, which are no longer suckling, are mainly infected via the faecal–oral route. At least 50 % of all animals older than 6 weeks have antibodies against the virus.</p>
