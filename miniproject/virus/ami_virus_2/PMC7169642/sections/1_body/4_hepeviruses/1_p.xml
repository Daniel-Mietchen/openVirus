Later they were classified into the family 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> because of electron-microscopic analyses which revealed some structural similarities. However, further investigations regarding the replication cycle and genome structure have revealed notable differences; therefore, hepatitis E viruses are now classified into their own family, the 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic>. The family name is derived from the denomination of the hepatitis E virus.
