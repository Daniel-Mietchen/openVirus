<p>The togavirus genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA molecule, which is capped at the 5′ terminus and polyadenylated at the 3′ end. It has a length of 9,762 (rubella virus, strain Therien), 11,703 (Sindbis virus), 11,675 (eastern equine encephalitis virus) or 11,442 (Semliki Forest virus) nucleotides. The genome encompasses two open reading frames: the open reading frame beginning at the 5′ terminus encodes the precursor protein of the four non-structural proteins NSP1–NSP4 in alphaviruses, as well as p150 and p90 in rubiviruses; the open reading frame in the 3′-terminal half of the genome contains the genetic information encoding the structural proteins, C, E1 and E2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001418" ref-type="fig">14.18</xref>). The two open reading frames are separated by a few nucleotides in Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus, whereas the intergenic region of rubella virus has a length of 124 nucleotides. The polyprotein of the structural proteins is translated from another open reading frame. There is a short UTR at the 5′ end of the genome (41 nucleotides in rubella virus, 60–80 nucleotides in Sindbis virus). Between the stop codon of the second open reading frame and the poly(A) tail at the 3′ terminus of rubella virus there are 61 nucleotides (264 nucleotides in Semliki Forest virus, 322 nucleotides in Sindbis virus), and these are folded into defined secondary structures.
