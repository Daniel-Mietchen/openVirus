<p>The infectious particles of togaviruses have a diameter of 60–80 nm and consist of icosahedral or spherical capsids (diameter 40 nm), which are enclosed by an envelope. Glycoproteins E1 and E2 are embedded in the envelope. They are present as E1/E2 heterodimers, which further associate to form trimeric protein complexes. There are about 80 trimers per virion. They form spike-like protrusions of 6–8 nm in length on the surface of the virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001417" ref-type="fig">14.17</xref>). The trimers mediate attachment to cellular receptors and are binding targets of virus-neutralizing antibodies. In rubella virus, there are also E1 homodimers on the particles. The capsid is composed of 240 dimers of the C protein. It contains the RNA genome, and is associated with amino acids on the inner side of the capsid.
