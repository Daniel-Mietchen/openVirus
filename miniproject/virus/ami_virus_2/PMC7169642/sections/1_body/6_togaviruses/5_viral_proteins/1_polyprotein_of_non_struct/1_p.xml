<p>The precursor protein of the up to four non-structural proteins NSP1–NSP4 differs among the various togaviruses. Two different precursors are synthesized in Sindbis virus; one includes proteins NSP1 – NSP3, and ends at an opal stop codon (UGA), which is located between coding regions NSP3 and NSP4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001418" ref-type="fig">14.18a</xref>). However, this termination signal for translation is skipped in 20 % of cases, and the translation is continued until the end of the NSP4 protein. In contrast, only one full-length non-structural polyprotein is synthesized in Semliki Forest virus and in rubella virus (240 kDa in rubella virus; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001418" ref-type="fig">14.18b</xref>). Whether similar two-stage translation processes play a role in other togaviruses is not known. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab001414" ref-type="table">14.14</xref> provides a summary of the size and function of togavirus proteins.
