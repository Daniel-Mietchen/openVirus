<p>In all togaviruses the structural polyprotein is significantly smaller than that of the non-structural proteins. In rubella virus, it has a molecular mass of 110 kDa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001418" ref-type="fig">14.18b</xref>). It contains the sequences of the C, E2 and E1 proteins. In alphaviruses, between the respective protein segments there are connecting amino acid sequences which are removed during polyprotein processing and viral maturation. The synthesis of the structural polyproteins occurs in the ER membrane. Amino acid sequences that are analogous to signal peptides have been found in alphaviruses directly after the carboxy-terminal end of the C protein (i.e. at the amino terminus of p62 protein, from which E2 arises) and within the 6K protein upstream of the E1 domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001418" ref-type="fig">14.18a</xref>). In rubella virus, they are located at the carboxy-terminal ends of the C and E2 proteins, respectively. These regions are responsible for the transport of the nascent polyprotein and its anchoring in the ER membrane. Membrane-associated proteases (signalases) cleave the precursor proteins after the signal-peptide-like sequences, thus leading to the generation of the individual components. In alphaviruses, an additional autocatalytic protease activity has been identified within the C protein. It contributes to the cleavage of the capsid protein from the precursor and resembles a serine protease. The cleavage occurs at the amino acid sequence tryptophan–serine. Similar functions have also been postulated for the C protein of rubella virus.
