<p>The NSP1 protein is a methyltransferase/guanylyltransferase involved in the formation of methylated 5′-cap structures in viral RNA molecules. Togaviruses need to encode this enzyme function, because they can not use the corresponding cellular functions that are localized in the nucleus, as their replication cycle occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm. The sequences of the NSP1 protein are highly conserved among the different togaviruses. The protein is modified with palmitic acid at cysteine residues 418–421 (in Semliki Forest virus). This determines, together with an amphipathic α-helix in the centre of the protein, the association with intracellular membrane compartments.</p>
