<p>The E2 protein (gp42â€“54) of rubella virus is also glycosylated, modified with fatty acids and anchored in the membrane by its carboxy-terminal amino acids. An E3 moiety, which is similar to that of alphaviruses, has not been identified in rubella virus. The E2 protein of rubella virus has haemagglutination and membrane-fusion activities, and is present predominantly as a heterodimer with E1. However, in this case, most of the neutralizing antibodies are not directed against the E2 protein, but are directed against the E1 protein.</p>
