<p>In rubella virus, neutralizing antibodies are predominantly directed against the E1 protein. Two protein domains which are recognized by protecting antibodies have been identified. The monomeric protein has a molecular mass of 58â€“62 kDa, it is glycosylated and is modified with palmitic acid. The E1 protein of rubella virus is responsible for attachment of the particle to cellular receptors. Mutations in the regions of the genome which code for the hydrophobic regions of the E1 protein reduce the infectivity of the virus.</p>
