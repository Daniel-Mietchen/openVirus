<p>The data on the cleavage reactions of the precursor which generate non-structural proteins NSP1â€“NSP4 have principally emerged from studies in Sindbis virus and Semliki Forest virus. It is expected that the non-structural proteins in the other togavirus species fulfil identical functions in the infection cycle. Their activities play an important role in viral transcription and replication.</p>
