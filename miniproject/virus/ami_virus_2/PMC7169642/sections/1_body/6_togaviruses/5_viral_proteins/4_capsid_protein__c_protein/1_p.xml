<p>Depending on the type of virus, the C protein has a length of 260â€“300 amino acids and a molecular mass of approximately 33 kDa. After cleavage from the nascent polyprotein chain by its autoproteolytic activity in alphaviruses or by the signalase-mediated release in rubella virus, C protein dimerizes and associates with the viral RNA genome to form nucleocapsids. The RNA-binding protein domain resides between amino acid residues 28 and 56. This interaction is very strong because only very few free C proteins can be found in the cytoplasm of infected cells. After their synthesis, C proteins are subject to complex phosphorylation and dephosphorylation processes. The degree of modification seems to influence the interaction with the RNA genome: non-phosphorylated C proteins bind to the genomes much more strongly than phosphorylated C proteins. The dephosphorylation of C proteins in the late stage of the replication cycle, presumably catalysed by the cellular protein phosphatase 1A, seems to promote the interaction with the RNA genomes and their packaging. This dephosphorylation reaction may prevent premature interactions of RNA genomes and C proteins.</p>
