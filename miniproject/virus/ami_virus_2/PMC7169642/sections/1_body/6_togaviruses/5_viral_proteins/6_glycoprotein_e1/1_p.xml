<p>In alphaviruses, a short, hydrophobic region of 55–60 amino acids is located between the carboxy terminus of the E2 protein and the beginning of the E1 sequences. It is referred to as 6K protein owing to its size of about 6 kDa. It contains signal-peptide-like sequences, which are recognized and cleaved by signalases, and mediates translocation of the amino acid chain of the E1 protein through the ER membrane during translation. It is also found in small quantities in infectious particles. However, it has also been ascertained that 6K protein has independent functions: it seems to be a pore-forming ion channel protein, which affects the membrane permeability of infected cells. It belongs to the viroporin protein family, which also includes the 7K proteins of hepaciviruses and pestiviruses (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec0014109" ref-type="sec">14.5</xref>). The E1 protein, which is anchored to the membrane by a hydrophobic transmembrane region at the carboxy terminus, is glycosylated and modified by fatty acids. In alphaviruses, it appears to be associated with the haemagglutination und fusion activities. In contrast to the E2 protein, only a few E1-specific antibodies with virus-neutralizing function have been found.
