<p>From the negative-sense RNA, new full-length complementary RNA genomes and an additional subgenomic RNA molecule are synthesized. The latter is initiated at the transition region between the two reading frames. It contains the sequences encoding the structural polyprotein. RNA synthesis is catalysed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the NSP4 protein and the other cleavage products of the non-structural proteins. The subgenomic RNA is capped and methylated at the 5′ end, thus facilitating translation of the structural proteins. It is also referred to as 26S RNA according to its sedimentation behaviour – in contrast to the genomic 49S RNA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001418" ref-type="fig">14.18</xref>). In infected cells, many more subgenomic RNA molecules than genomic RNA molecules are synthesized. Similar replication processes that lead to the synthesis of a subgenomic mRNA have also been found in astroviruses, caliciviruses and hepeviruses (Sects.
