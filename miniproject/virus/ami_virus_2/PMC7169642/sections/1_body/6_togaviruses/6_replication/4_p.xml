<p>Subsequently, the preformed nucleocapsids associate with the carboxy-terminal regions of E2 proteins, and are then surrounded by the membrane and the viral glycoproteins embedded in it. These budding complexes can arise on the membranes of the ER and the Golgi apparatus as well as on the plasma membrane. The enveloped virions are either transported through Golgi vesicles to the cell surface or directly released there. During infection, apoptosis is also induced in the cells. This process, which results in cell death, has been found particularly in infections with rubella virus, whose C proteins also act proapoptotically.</p>
