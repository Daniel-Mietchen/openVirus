<p>If sufficient amounts of dephosphorylated C proteins are present, they associate with nucleotide sequences in the 5â€² region of the newly synthesized genomic positive-sense 49S RNA molecules and assemble into nucleocapsid precursors. These initial packaging steps also prevent interaction with the cap-binding complex and ribosomal subunits and that genomic RNA is translated, thus interrupting the synthesis of further NSP polyproteins. This relatively simple regulatory mechanism ensures that viral structural components are preferentially produced in the late phase of infection because they are required in much larger quantities for the formation of virus particles than the enzymatically active non-structural proteins at this time.</p>
