<p>The togavirus family (
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) comprises two genera (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab001413" ref-type="table">14.13</xref>). The alphaviruses, which are transmitted by insects, are especially known as pathogens of animal encephalitis and arthritis in America, Africa and Asia. They are classified according to their antigenic similarity in different complexes that are not host-specific and are transmitted by different mosquito species between animal species (horses, rodents, various birds such as pheasants and cranes) and humans, where they proliferate. In humans, they occasionally cause symptomatic infections; infections with chikungunya virus have been occasionally described during the summer months in southern Europe (Italy) since 2005. On the other hand, the members of the second genus, 
 <italic>Rubivirus</italic>, are distributed worldwide. The pathogen of rubella infection belongs to this genus. These viruses are not transmitted by insects.
