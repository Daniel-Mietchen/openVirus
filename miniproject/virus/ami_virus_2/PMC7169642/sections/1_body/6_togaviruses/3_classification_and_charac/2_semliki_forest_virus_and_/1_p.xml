<p>Semliki Forest virus and Sindbis virus are the best studied representatives of togaviruses with regard to their molecular biology and replication mechanisms; therefore, they have long been considered as prototypes of this virus family. Sindbis virus is related to western equine encephalitis virus, which is common on the American continent (Sect.Â 
 <xref rid="Sec0014190" ref-type="sec">14.6.6</xref>). Both species of virus can be easily reproduced in cell cultures and show a pronounced cytopathic effect. Sindbis virus is widespread in Africa, eastern Europe and Asia. It is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, and only in rare cases causes a febrile illness with rash and joint pain, which is similar in terms of clinical features and pathogenesis to a disease caused by some flaviviruses in terms of the clinical picture and pathogenesis. Neurotropic isolates have previously been described only in individual cases. Semliki Forest virus is endemic in Africa, India and Southeast Asia. It is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. and is largely non-pathogenic in humans. Therefore, it is now frequently used as a genetic engineering vector for heterologous gene expression in eukaryotic cell cultures.
