<p>Eastern equine encephalitis virus is endemic in the southern USA and in many countries of South America. It asymptomatically infects different bird species, including various songbirds and wading birds. In other introduced bird species such as pheasant and emu, it causes lethal infections and severe economic losses. Certain mosquitoes that suck blood only in birds, particularly 
 <italic>Culiseta melanura</italic>, maintain this endemic bird cycle. If blood of infected birds is sucked by other mosquito species which can also bite mammals and humans, they can cause epidemics which include mammals as hosts. In regions with a temperate climate, there is a seasonal accumulation of diseases in the late summer, whereas in tropical climates, infections and transmissions of the reservoir hosts occur throughout the year.
