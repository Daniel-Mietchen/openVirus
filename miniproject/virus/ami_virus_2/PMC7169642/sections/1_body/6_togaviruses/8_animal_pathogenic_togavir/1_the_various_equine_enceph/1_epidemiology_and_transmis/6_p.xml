<p>In addition to the epizootiology of these viruses, their evolution is also interesting. It has been shown that western equine encephalitis virus emerged from a recombination between eastern equine encephalitis virus and a similar precursor virus with similarity to Sindbis virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_12). This recombination resulted in the replacement of the genes encoding the glycoproteins of eastern equine encephalitis virus by those of the Sindbis-like virus.</p>
