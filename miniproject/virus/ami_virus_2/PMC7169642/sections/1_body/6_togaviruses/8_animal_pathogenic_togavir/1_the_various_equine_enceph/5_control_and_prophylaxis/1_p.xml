<p>Vaccines are available against infections with all members of equine encephalitis viruses, and are used in humans, horses and birds such as the threatened whooping crane (
 <italic>Grus americana</italic>). They are based on inactivated viruses that were propagated in cell culture. A consequent vaccination can prevent the emergence of epizootic diseases, or favourably influence its development after an outbreak.
