<p>Unlike the eastern and western equine encephalitis viruses, the switch from an enzootic to an epizootic cycle in Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus depends on a mutation in the coding sequences for the E2 protein of the prevalent enzootic virus. Whereas the enzootic subtypes I-D to I-F and IIâ€“VI induce only limited infections in small rodents and are transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, the transmission of the epizootic subtypes I-AB and I-C is performed by mosquitoes of the genera 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Psoropha</italic> and involves the infection of a variety of mammals, including horses and humans. The pathogenetic basis for the epizootic types lies in their ability to cause a high-titre viraemia in their hosts and to facilitate transmission. Phylogenetic studies have revealed that the epizootic subtypes possibly arise from enzootic viruses before each epizootic outbreak. Thus, the epizootic biotype can be generated by replacement of the E2 gene from an enzootic I-D virus by that of an I-AB virus.
