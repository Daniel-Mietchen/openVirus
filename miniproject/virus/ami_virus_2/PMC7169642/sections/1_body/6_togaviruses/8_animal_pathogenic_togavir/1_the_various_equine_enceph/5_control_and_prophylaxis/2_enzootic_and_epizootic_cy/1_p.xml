<p>Eastern equine encephalitis virus, western equine encephalitis virus and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus are arboviruses (
 <italic>ar</italic>thropod-
 <italic>bo</italic>rne), which usually replicate asymptomatically in their hosts, especially songbirds and rodents, and establish a sufficiently high viraemia to be transmitted by mosquitoes among these hosts. This is referred to as an enzootic cycle. Various factors such as a massive proliferation of not strictly host-specific mosquito species, which serve as reservoir for the virus, can lead to sucking of other species, thus contributing to the transmission to humans, horses and other mammals. This is referred to as an epizootic cycle.
