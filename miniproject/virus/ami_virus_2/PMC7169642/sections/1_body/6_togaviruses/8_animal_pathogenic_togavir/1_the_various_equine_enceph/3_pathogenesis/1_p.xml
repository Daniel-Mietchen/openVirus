<p>Alphaviruses are transmitted by insect bites directly into the bloodstream and attach, using envelope proteins, to unknown receptors on endothelial and lymphatic cells. They then proliferate in these cells. They are transported through the bloodstream to other target organs. The damaged endothelium allows the transfer of the virus into the central nervous system, where it proliferates in neurons. The mechanisms of neuronal injury by induction of apoptosis have been studied in detail in Sindbis virus infections in mice. Sindbis virus shows an age-dependent pathogenicity in mice. Newborn mice become lethally ill after an intracerebral infection, whereas mice do not become sick at the age of 4 weeks and eliminate the virus 1 week after inoculation. The virus is eliminated by virus-specific antibodies. This phenomenon is based on the fact that the viral infection induces apoptosis in immature neurons, whereas mature neurons can prevent this process by an unknown factor. However, the resistance is not absolute and can be broken by extremely virulent virus strains. Obviously, the viral glycoprotein E2 is of extraordinary importance: the study of mutant viruses that were produced by site-directed mutagenesis revealed a special role in virulence of the amino acid histidine at position 55.</p>
