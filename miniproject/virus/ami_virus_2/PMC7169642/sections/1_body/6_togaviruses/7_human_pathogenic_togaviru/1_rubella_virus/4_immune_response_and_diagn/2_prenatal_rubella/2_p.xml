<p>Prenatal rubella is a medical indication for abortion. Because of the currently applicable regulations for maternity guidelines in many countries, immunity against rubella must be examined and documented in the maternity record book. In the case of suspected rubella exposure of a non-immune pregnant woman, the antibody titre has to be determined. If IgG antibodies are present at levels of 10 IU/mL and above, the patient is protected against the infection and there is no danger of damage to the embryo. If the level is below 10 IU/mL, and there is also no clear reactivity in alternative tests, rubella-virus-specific IgG should be administered within 3 days after exposure because a fresh infection is possible. Subsequently, it must be ascertained by further antibody tests whether an infection is actually ongoing or has finished in the pregnant woman, and whether the embryo has been infected. A further complication is that IgM reactivity in the ELISA may be unspecific during gestation. If rubella-virus-specific IgM antibodies are present in the umbilical cord blood and viral RNA is detected by PCR, this is an indication for termination of pregnancy because of the high risk of possible harm to the unborn child by the infection. The retrospective determination of the probable date of infection of the mother is of crucial importance since the risk of embryopathy decreases significantly in the course of the first trimester of pregnancy. This includes immunoblot analysis of avidity for and reactivity against individual proteins.</p>
