<p>The rubella virus is serologically uniform. With respect to its nucleic acid sequences, all isolates can be classified into two strains (clades 1 and 2), which can also be subdivided into ten genotypes (1a–1g, 2a–2c); the rubella virus of clade 2 has been isolated only in the Eurasian region. Rubella virus is found only in humans, but can be transmitted to some monkey species. Transmissions occur by droplet infection, and lead to infections during fleeting contact in about 20 % of cases. Carriers are infected individuals in the viraemic phase, which starts just 6 days before the onset of the exanthem and lasts 1–2 weeks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001419" ref-type="fig">14.19</xref>), infected infants who were born with congential rubella syndrome, and rarely adults with asymptomatic reinfections, who, nevertheless, can still transmit virus. Viruses are also found in the lacrimal fluid, in urine, in cervical secretions, in the stool, in the lungs, in cerebrospinal fluid and in synovial fluid.
