<p>The virus is transmitted by droplet infections. It penetrates into the organism through the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. The primary replication occurs in the epithelium of this region. There, macrophages and lymphocytes are infected, and carry the virus to local lymph nodes. There, the virus finds further target cells, where it replicates. Subsequently, the lymph nodes become extremely swollen. The viraemia probably originates from the infected lymph nodes, and rubella viruses are present in the blood (as free particles and in cell-bound form). They spread throughout the organism and can be detected in lacrimal fluid, in the nasal–pharyngeal region, in cervical secretions, in cerebrospinal fluid and in synovial fluid. The exanthem appears together with the first virus-specific antibodies. Immune complexes, i.e. antibody–virus complexes, are responsible for this response. They attach to the endothelium of blood capillaries in the skin and cause local inflammations.</p>
