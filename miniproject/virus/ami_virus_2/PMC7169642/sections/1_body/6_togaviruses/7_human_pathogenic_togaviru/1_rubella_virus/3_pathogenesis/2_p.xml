<p>Even the acute arthritis which is associated with the infection has been attributed to virusâ€“antibody complexes that are present in synovial fluid. In cells of the synovial membranes, IL-1 is synthesized in large quantities, an indication that inflammation processes are occurring. Evidence that rubella virus can proliferate and persist in synovial cells has been found in infants with congenital rubella syndrome, i.e. in children who were infected during the embryonic stage. In such infants, rubella virus can be detected in the growth areas of the bones, the epiphyses and diaphyses. It is presumed that in these children persistent viruses trigger the production of interferons, which inhibit the proliferation of bone cells, resulting in retardation of growth of the extremities. In the rare cases of postinfectious encephalitis, viral proteins can occasionally be detected in brain tissue. It is suspected that a cellular autoimmune response is triggered against basic myelin protein in the spinal cord and nerve sheaths because lymphocytes of such patients proliferate after addition of this protein.</p>
