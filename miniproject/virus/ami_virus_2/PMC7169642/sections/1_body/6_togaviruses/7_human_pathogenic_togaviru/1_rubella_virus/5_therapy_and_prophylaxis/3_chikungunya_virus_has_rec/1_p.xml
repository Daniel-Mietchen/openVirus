<p>Chikungunya virus was isolated from a patient with a febrile illness in the former Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania) in 1953. Infections with this virus have likely been noticed since the late eighteenth century but incorrectly documented as epidemic outbreaks of dengue fever. Between 1960 and 2003, chikungunya virus was repeatedly ascertained to be the cause of regionally restricted epidemics in the countries of eastern, southern and western Africa as well as in Southeast Asia (among others, in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam). Since 2004, the virus has repeatedly been found also in patients in different European countries, particularly in Italy, but also in Germany, Belgium, France, Spain, the UK and Norway. Infections induce severe fever, arthralgia and rash, and have a high morbidity. In particular, joint swelling and inflammations can last for months – they gave the virus its name: 
 <italic>chikungunya</italic> means “that which bends up”. The natural hosts and reservoirs for the pathogens are non-human primates in Africa and Southeast Asia. The virus is transmitted to a number of different 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species, which further spread it to and also between humans. The tiger mosquito (
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>) is considered to be particularly responsible for the chikungunya virus infections that have been observed in Europe in the last few years, as these mosquitoes can also exist in subtropical and cooler regions. Presumably the virus was originally introduced to European countries by tourists or mosquitoes, resulting in local outbreaks. In particular, further warming of the climate could have the effect that the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes increasingly feel at home in Europe, which could thus lead to increased infections with chikungunya virus.
