<p>In infections during pregnancy, the viruses are transported into the placenta and the chorionic villi by blood. They proliferate there, invade the endothelium of placental blood vessels and reach the circulatory system of the child. The infected and detached endothelial cells form so-called emboli, which spread the virus in the organism. After birth, production and excretion of the virus last a long time (up to 1 year). How injury to the differentiating organs and impairment of embryonic cell division is achieved is unknown. It is thought that interferons and possibly other cytokines with cytotoxic properties or apoptosis mechanisms may play an important role.</p>
