<p>Rubella is a relatively harmless, not very febrile illness. About half of infections are asymptomatic in children. The symptoms associated with the disease, mottled and not confluent exanthem, appear approximately 1–2 weeks after contact with the rubella virus and remain for up to 5 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001419" ref-type="fig">14.19</xref>). The disease is often uncharacteristic and therefore indistinguishable from other viral diseases. Cold-like symptoms are absent; swollen neck lymph nodes are frequently observed. Especially in young women, the infection is associated in part with arthralgia of small joints, which usually subsides within a few weeks. A thrombocytopenia is rarely observed and its pathogenesis is still unclear. Encephalitis occurs with an incidence of 1:6,000. About 20 % of rubella infections with postinfectious encephalitis are fatal.
