<p>Viruses that are transmitted by insects or arachnids are denominated arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses). They exist mainly in tropical and subtropical climates. A prerequisite for transmission of the viruses by arthropods is that the viruses must be able to infect specific organs of the vectors, such as the epithelial cells of the gut and salivary glands. The mere uptake of virus-containing blood by mosquitoes or ticks is not enough: the viruses must be able to perform a productive infection cycle in both arthropod and mammalian cells.</p>
