<p>The family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> encompasses more than 70 different flavivirus types, which are classified into three genera (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab001411" ref-type="table">14.11</xref>): The genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> includes yellow fever virus; the jaundice that is caused by the virus was eponymous for the denomination of both the family and the genus (
 <italic>flavus</italic>, Latin for “yellow”). It was the first virus for which an insect-associated mode of transmission had been demonstrated (
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp.). The genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> includes a number of other viruses which are also transmitted by arthropods (insects and arachnids) and are pathogenic in humans. Dengue virus, which is also transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp., and Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus and West Nile virus (transmitted by 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes) have been associated with febrile, haemorrhagic or neurological disorders and encephalitis, especially in tropical countries. In central Europe, the pathogen of meningoencephalitis is spread endemically in certain regions. This disease is a typical prototype of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), which is transmitted by tick bites. On the other hand, some other flaviviruses infect only mammals; they are presumably transmitted from animal to animal (Rio Bravo virus infects only bats and Jutiapa virus infects solely rodents).
