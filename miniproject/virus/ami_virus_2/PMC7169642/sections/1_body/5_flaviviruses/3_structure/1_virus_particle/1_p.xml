<p>Infectious flaviviruses have a diameter of 40–50 nm. The spherical capsids consist of only one type of viral protein (C protein), and are surrounded by an envelope, in which two viral surface proteins are embedded. They are designated by the letters M and E in flaviviruses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001411" ref-type="fig">14.11</xref>). M protein is relatively small and has a molecular mass of 7–8 kDa; 90 dimers of the virus-type-specific E proteins are found per particle. M protein is absent in hepatitis C virus and pestiviruses; instead a smaller glycosylated surface protein, E1 (gp33), can be found in addition to the main glycoprotein, E2 (gp70). The RNA genome is contained inside the capsids and interacts strongly with the highly basic C protein.
