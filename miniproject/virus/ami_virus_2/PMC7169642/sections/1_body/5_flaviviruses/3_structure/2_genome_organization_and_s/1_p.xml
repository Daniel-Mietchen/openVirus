<p>The genome consists of single-stranded RNA and has a length of about 9,100–12,000 nucleotides: 10,862 in yellow fever virus, vaccine virus 17D; 10,664–10,723 in dengue virus; 11,141 in TBE virus (TBEV), strain Neudörfl; 9,340–9,589 in hepatitis C virus, 9,143–9,493 in human pegivirus (GB virus C), 12,308–12,573 in bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV); 12,297 in classical swine fever virus. The RNA is present with positive-sense polarity and spans a large reading frame, which has a length of 10,233 nucleotides in yellow fever virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001411" ref-type="fig">14.11</xref>). Like in picornaviruses, it directs the synthesis of a single common precursor protein that is cleaved into the individual components during infection. The RNA genome of flaviviruses has a cap structure at the 5′ terminus. In the case of yellow fever virus, the reading frame is flanked at the 5′ and 3′ termini by untranslated sequences, which are 118 and 511 nucleotides in length, respectively. The 3′ terminus is not polyadenylated. However, adenosine-rich sequences of variable length are found in this region.
