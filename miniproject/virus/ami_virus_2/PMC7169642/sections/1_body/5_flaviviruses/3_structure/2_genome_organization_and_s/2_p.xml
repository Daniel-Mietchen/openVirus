<p>In contrast to members of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, the genomes of pestiviruses, hepaciviruses and pegiviruses do not have a cap structure at the 5′ end of the genome, but they possess – like picornaviruses – IRES elements. The IRES structure mediates binding of the ribosomal subunits and initiation of translation of the polyprotein (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec001413" ref-type="sec">14.1.4</xref>). Therefore, the 5′ UTR of hepatitis C virus is significantly longer than that of flaviviruses, it comprises about 340 nucleotides. A short sequence of uridine and adenosine residues is found at the 3′ end of the hepatitis C virus genome. Similarly to the untranslated sequences in the 3′ region of other flaviviruses, they have important functions in initiating negative-sense RNA synthesis during genome replication.
