<p>Hepatitis C virus was assigned to the so-called non-A, non-B hepatitis viruses until its molecular identification in 1989. Initially all pathogens of liver inflammation which could not be diagnostically identified as hepatitis A virus or hepatitis B virus were classified into the group of hepatitis non-A, non-B viruses. Even after the characterization of hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus (the latter was characterized and classified into the family 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> in 1988; see Sect.Â 
 <xref rid="Sec001495" ref-type="sec">14.4</xref>), some other, hypothetical viruses are still assigned to this group. For example, there is only indirect evidence for the existence of hepatitis F virus. It has long been unclear whether hepatitis C virus should be incorporated into the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> or the family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>. Detailed knowledge of the molecular-biological characteristics allowed hepatitis C virus to be included as a separate genus, 
 <italic>Hepacivirus</italic>, within the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>.
