<p>In pestiviruses, another envelope protein has been characterized: E
 <sup>rns</sup> protein. It is a virion component, has double-stranded RNase activity, is secreted by infected cells and induces the formation of neutralizing antibodies. The function of this protein during viral replication has not been fully clarified. In BVDV, the E
 <sup>rns</sup> protein counteracts the immunological responses that are triggered by double-stranded RNA by its ability to degrade double-stranded RNA. These include, among others, the activation of TLR3, whereby the production of IFN-α and IFN-β is induced (see 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_7 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_8) (Fig.
