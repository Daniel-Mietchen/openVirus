<p>The capsid is constituted of C proteins. It contains a large number of basic amino acids which interact with the RNA genome, thereby forming the nucleocapsid. The carboxy terminus of the C protein is highly hydrophobic. Together with further hydrophobic domains, it mediates the interaction of the polyprotein with the ER membrane. Cleavage reactions are induced by the signalase between the following domains: C and PrM (flaviviruses), C and E1 (hepaciviruses) and C and E
 <sup>rns</sup> (pestiviruses). A peculiarity has been found in BVDV: mutants have been described completely lacking the sequences that encode the C protein, but which, nevertheless, exhibit the morphology of flaviviruses. Accordingly, the C protein is not essential for the formation of infectious particles. In this case, the functions of the C protein are assumed by the NS3 protein, which interacts with the RNA genome and E proteins.
