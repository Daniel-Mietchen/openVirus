<p>The NS3 protein of all flaviviruses is bifunctional: in the amino-terminal region, a serine protease has been localized that is responsible for all cleavage reactions in the regions of the polyprotein that follow the NS3 domain. NTP-binding sites and a helicase activity are found in the carboxy-terminal region. The latter belongs to the helicase DExH/D box superfamily, and is necessary for unwinding the highly structured double-stranded RNA intermediates that are formed during genome replication and during translation of the polyprotein. The NS3 protease of flaviviruses is a heterodimer consisting of NS2B and NS3. In hepatitis C virus, NS3 interacts with NS4A by its amino-terminal region, which contains the active centre of the serine protease, thereby forming a heterodimer that is anchored in the ER membrane by the hydrophobic domains of NS4A.</p>
