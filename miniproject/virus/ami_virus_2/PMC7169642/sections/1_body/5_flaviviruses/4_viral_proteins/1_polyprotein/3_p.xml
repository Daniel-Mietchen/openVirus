<p>Like the polyproteins of hepaciviruses, the polyproteins of pestiviruses also do not contain the sequences of NS1 protein; pestiviruses also have two glycosylated envelope proteins, E1 and E2, followed by the sequences of p7 protein. Furthermore, the polyproteins of pestiviruses have some additional features: differing from flaviviruses and hepaciviruses, their genomes encode the non-structural protein N
 <sup>Pro</sup> at the 5′ terminus of the viral genome; in the polyprotein it is located before the domains of the structural proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001411" ref-type="fig">14.11</xref>). After the sequences encoding the capsid protein C, the genetic information for an RNase (E
 <sup>rns</sup> protein, for “envelope protein, RNase secreted”) follows; this RNase is part of the virus particle and is also secreted by infected cells.
