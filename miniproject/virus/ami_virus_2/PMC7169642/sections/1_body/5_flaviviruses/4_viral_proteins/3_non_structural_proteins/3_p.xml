<p>In flaviviruses, NS2 protein is cleaved into proteins NS2A and NS2B. There are few data regarding the function of NS2A. It is associated with the ER membrane and plays an important role during flavivirus morphogenesis. It also seems to inhibit the interferon-mediated antiviral immune response. The NS2B protein of flaviviruses is an essential cofactor of NS3 protease. In hepatitis C virus, the NS2 moiety fused with NS3 forms the catalytic domain of a Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependent protease which catalyses the cleavage between NS2 and NS3.
