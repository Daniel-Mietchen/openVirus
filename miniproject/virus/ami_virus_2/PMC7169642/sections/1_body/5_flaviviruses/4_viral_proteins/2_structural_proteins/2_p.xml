<p>The PrM protein, which is glycosylated at asparagine residues, is the precursor of the very small, non-glycosylated M protein that is anchored in the viral envelope. Exhibiting a molecular mass of approximately 19 kDa in yellow fever virus and 24â€“27 kDa in tick-borne flaviviruses, the PrM protein is significantly larger than the M protein in infectious particles. The amino-terminal part of the PrM protein is cleaved by the cellular protease furin at a late stage of viral morphogenesis during the passage of the immature virus through the Golgi apparatus. This cleavage reaction is essential for the infectivity of virus particles; it induces the fusogenic properties of the E protein to fuse endosomes with the viral envelope after the virus has entered the cell.</p>
