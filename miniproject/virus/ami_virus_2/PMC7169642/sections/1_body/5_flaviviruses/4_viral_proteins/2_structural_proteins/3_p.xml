<p>In addition, the viral envelope contains 90 dimers of glycosylated E proteins. The structure of the E protein of TBEV was elucidated by Félix A. Rey and colleagues by means of X-ray diffraction in 1995. In comparison with other structurally known viral surface proteins (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16; haemagglutinin of influenza viruses), the E protein has an unusual structure: it is anchored in the membrane by a hydrophobic amino acid sequence in the carboxy-terminal region, it lies flat on the membrane and determines the size of the particle because of a bending effect caused by protein folding (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001412" ref-type="fig">14.12</xref>). The E protein mediates attachment of the virus to target cells, and induces fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes by low pH after entry of the virus via receptor-mediated endocytosis. It is also responsible for the haemagglutination properties of flaviviruses. Virus-neutralizing antibodies directed against the E protein are induced during infection. They protect against reinfections with the same virus type.
