<p>The non-structural proteins of pestiviruses have some peculiarities: in BVDV, they are responsible for the formation of different biotypes and play an important role in the pathogenesis of mucosal disease (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec0014144" ref-type="sec">14.5.6</xref>). Unique is the already mentioned N
 <sup>pro</sup> protein, which acts as a protease and constitutes the first domain of the polyprotein. It is capable of autocatalytic cleavage from the precursor protein. Additionally, N
 <sup>pro</sup> has another function that is important for the pathogenesis of pestivirus infections. Both in classical swine fever virus and in BVDV, it is apparent that N
 <sup>pro</sup> binds to IRF-3 and that this interaction induces the ubiquitination and degradation of IRF-3 via proteasomes. Thus, infected cells have a significantly reduced expression of IFN-β (see also 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_7 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_8).
