<p>The protein arrangement is different in hepatitis C virus: the polyprotein, which comprises on average 3,000 amino acids, does not contain the sequences of the PrM protein. The E1 protein, a glycosylated envelope protein with a molecular mass of about 33 kDa, is localized after the capsid protein. Thereafter follow the sequences of a second glycoprotein (E2, gp68–72) and the small protein p7. In hepatitis C virus, NS1 is present neither as a gene nor as a protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001411" ref-type="fig">14.11</xref>). The protein succession C–E1–E2–p7 is followed by non-structural proteins NS2 to NS5B. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab001412" ref-type="table">14.12</xref> provides a comparative summary of the properties of the proteins.
