<p>Many viruses can cause haemagglutination by the respective activities of their surface proteins. That means the virus-induced agglutination and aggregation of red blood cells. Before the development of highly specific ELISA and PCR tests for detection of viral infections, the haemagglutination and haemagglutination-inhibition tests were very important diagnostic methods (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_13). In rare cases, they are still used today.</p>
