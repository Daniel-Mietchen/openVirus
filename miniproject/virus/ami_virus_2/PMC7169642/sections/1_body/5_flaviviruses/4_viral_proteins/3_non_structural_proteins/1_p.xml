<p>The flavivirus NS1 protein is associated with the cell membrane. In infections of mammalian cells, but not insect cells, a soluble variant of the NS1 protein which is secreted by the cells can be observed. There is evidence that the membrane-associated NS1 protein exists as a dimer; in contrast, the secreted form is present as a hexamer. In some flaviviruses, NS1-specific antibodies seem to induce the antibody-mediated lysis of infected cells, thus exerting a protective effect. The function of the protein during the infection cycle is unknown. It is possibly involved in the replication of viral genomes, as well as in intracellular transport of viral structural proteins and in release of the virus. An immunomodulatory function has recently been found for the NS1 protein of West Nile virus: it blocks the signal transduction pathway that is mediated by TLR3 by impeding the transport of IRF-3 and nuclear factor κB into the nucleus. As a result, the production of IFN-β and proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 is inhibited. Furthermore, both the soluble and the membrane-associated variant of the West Nile virus NS1 protein bind to protein factor H, a regulator of complement activation. This leads to decreased accumulation of both the C3 component and the membrane attack complex (C5B to C9; see 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_7).</p>
