<p>The glycosylated E1 and E2 proteins of hepatitis C virus share sequence homologies with the corresponding proteins of pestiviruses. E1 proteins are not covalently associated with E2 proteins; they are anchored in the membrane by hydrophobic, carboxy-terminal amino acid sequences. There is a highly variable region in the C-terminal region of the E2 protein, and this differs among the different serotypes of hepatitis C virus and also among individual virus isolates.</p>
