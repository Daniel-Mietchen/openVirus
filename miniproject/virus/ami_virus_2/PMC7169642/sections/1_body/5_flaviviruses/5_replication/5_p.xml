<p>As soon as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the NS5 and NS5B proteins are available in the cytoplasm, they catalyse the transcription of the positive-sense RNA genome into complementary negative-sense RNA molecules, which in turn serve as templates for the synthesis of new positive-sense RNA genomes; in hepatitis C virus, the hairpin structure in the UTR at the 5′ end of the RNA genome is essential for this process (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001412" ref-type="fig">14.12d</xref>). It seems to have a function similar to that of the cloverleaf structure of the picornavirus genome (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec00141" ref-type="sec">14.1</xref>). The newly synthesized positive strands are used as both genomic RNAs and mRNAs for the synthesis of further polyproteins. The details of these processes are largely unknown. In general, however, the mechanism is similar to that of picornavirus replication. Since viral replication occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm, where cellular capping enzymes are not accessible, flaviviruses have evolved their own capping enzymes. The NS5 methyltransferase is responsible for the synthesis of 5′-cap structures of positive RNA strands.
