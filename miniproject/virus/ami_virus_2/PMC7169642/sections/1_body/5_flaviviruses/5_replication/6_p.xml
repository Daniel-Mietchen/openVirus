<p>In flaviviruses, morphogenesis and formation of infectious particles is performed at the ER membrane. Analogous processes are presumed in hepatitis C virus and pestiviruses. The C, PrM and E components as well as the E1 and E2 polypeptides are inserted into the lipid layer during translation, where they accumulate and form regions containing high concentrations of viral proteins. The membrane-associated C proteins interact with both the carboxy-terminal domain of E proteins, probably also with that of NS2A proteins, and the RNA genomes via basic amino acids. The membrane invaginates into the ER lumen, thus forming the initial budding complex, which is finally released. In this phase of viral morphogenesis, the virus particles are not yet infectious: E proteins of flaviviruses are present as a heterodimer complex with PrM polypeptides. During the following transport through the Golgi apparatus, the envelope proteins are glycosylated and PrM is processed into the M protein by the protease furin. As a consequence, the complex between E and PrM proteins is resolved and the E proteins form homodimers. Thereby the immature, non-infectious virus particles become mature virus particles. Finally, the Golgi vesicles fuse with the cytoplasmic membrane, releasing the infectious virus particles into the surrounding environment. The replication cycle of flaviviruses is illustrated schematically in Fig.Â
