<p>In the next steps, the 5′ end of the genome interacts with cellular ribosomal subunits. In flaviviruses, the 5′ cap structure is responsible for this process; it binds to the components of the cap-binding complex and mediates the interaction with the ribosomes. In the case of hepatitis C virus and pestiviruses, the IRES sequence, which is located in the UTR at the 5′ terminus, is responsible for binding of ribosomes. If the C protein is present at the amino-terminal region of the polyprotein after initiation of translation, the elongation of the amino acid chain stops temporarily: the hydrophobic domain in the carboxy-terminal region of the C protein acts as a signal peptide. It interacts with the signal recognition particle, a complex of cellular polypeptides and the 5S RNA, which induces the transport of the translation complex to the ER membrane. There, the nascent amino acid chain is translocated through the ER membrane, whereby the transmembrane domains of PrM and E proteins cotranslationally anchor the polyprotein in the lipid layer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001415" ref-type="fig">14.15</xref>). Signalases perform the processing reactions between the C, PrM, E and NS1 moieties. Further cleavage reactions of the polyprotein are performed by NS2B/NS3 (flaviviruses) and NS3/NS4A (hepatitis C and pestiviruses) proteases (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001412" ref-type="fig">14.12</xref>). Most of the non-structural proteins have hydrophobic domains that contribute to their anchorage in the ER membrane. This ensures that the synthesis of the polyprotein and the subsequent steps of replication can be executed in association with this intracellular membrane compartment.
