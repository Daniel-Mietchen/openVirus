<p>The cellular receptors of many flaviviruses are known. In hepatitis C virus, receptor binding is a very complex and multifaceted process. The initial attachment to the target cells requires glycosaminoglycan and LDL receptors. Thereafter follow interactions of the viral E2 proteins with at least three entry factors, namely scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), tetraspanin 28 (CD81) and the tight-junction protein claudin 1. The E2 protein binds to CD81 (25 kDa), a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, which spans the cytoplasmic membrane with four transmembrane regions, thereby forming two extracellular domains. CD81 has functional activities in cell adhesion, cell activation and cell motility, as well as in signal transduction pathways; it is found on the surface of many cell types, such as hepatocytes and B lymphocytes, which can be infected by hepatitis C viruses. The E2 proteins also bind to SR-B1, an 87-kDa protein found on the surface of many different cell types that are involved in cellular lipid metabolism. Serum proteins such as high-density lipoproteins are ligands for the SR-B1 receptor and enhance the infectivity of hepatitis C virus, possibly because they form complexes with the E1/E2 proteins on the surface of the virus and mediate the interaction with the SR-B1 receptor. A similar binding mechanism has also been proposed for LDLs: these serum proteins can also bind to virus particles, thereby mediating the interaction with the LDL receptor.</p>
