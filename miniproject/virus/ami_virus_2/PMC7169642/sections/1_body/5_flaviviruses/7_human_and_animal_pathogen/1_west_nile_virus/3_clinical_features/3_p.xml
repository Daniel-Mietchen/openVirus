<p>Although in the USA there are a large number of infected horses, clinically inapparent infection is the rule in this species. Experimental infections with mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus resulted in clinical symptoms in only about 10Â % of the exposed and infected horses. In contrast to infections in birds, almost exclusively neurological symptoms are found in horses as a result of poliomeningoencephalitis; other manifestations are practically not observed.</p>
