 <bold>Humans</bold> After an incubation period of 3 days to 2 weeks, patients develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, headaches and back, joint and muscle pains. Nausea, diarrhoea and general lymph node swelling are also observed in some cases; there are also signs of a skin rash especially among children. In severe clinical courses, which are frequently found in elderly patients, the initial symptoms are followed by liver and heart muscle inflammations as well as encephalitis. About 5–10 % of patients with neurological symptoms die.
