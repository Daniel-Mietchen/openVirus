<p>The chemokine receptor CCR5 attracted attention a few years ago: it was identified as a coreceptor, to which human immunodeficiency virus binds on the surface of monocytes and macrophages to initiate the infection (see 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18). The importance was additionally underscored by the finding that people with genetic defects in the CCR5 gene cannot be infected by human immunodeficiency virus; they are largely resistant. These data constitute the basis for the development of new therapeutics which are aimed at blocking the interaction between human immunodeficiency virus and the CCR5 protein on the cell surface, and should prevent infections. However, the use of such inhibitors could increase susceptibility for developing severe infections with West Nile virus. In using them, we would possibly combat one evil, while accepting another.</p>
