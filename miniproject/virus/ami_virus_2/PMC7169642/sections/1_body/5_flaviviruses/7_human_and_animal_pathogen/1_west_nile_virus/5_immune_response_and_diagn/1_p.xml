<p>The diagnosis is done by RT-PCR by cultivating the pathogen in chicken eggs or in cell cultures and subsequent isolation of the virus. The virus agglutinates goose erythrocytes, and thus can be detected by haemagglutination or haemagglutination-inhibition tests. IgM and IgG antibodies can only be detected by ELISA.</p>
