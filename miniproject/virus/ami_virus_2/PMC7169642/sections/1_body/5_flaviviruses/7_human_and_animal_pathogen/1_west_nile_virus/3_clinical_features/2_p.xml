 <bold>Animals</bold> Avian infections are systemic and also result in encephalomyelitis; extraneuronal lesions are very common. Therefore, myocarditis, muscle degeneration and lymphocytic infiltrations are found in various organs, such as pancreas, lung and liver. An atrophy of the bursa of Fabricius is also frequent. In addition, clinically asymptomatic infections are typical. Among birds, there are considerable differences in susceptibility. Corvids and raptors are considered to be highly susceptible and often have severe disease patterns; thus, monitoring programmes should especially include these birds.
