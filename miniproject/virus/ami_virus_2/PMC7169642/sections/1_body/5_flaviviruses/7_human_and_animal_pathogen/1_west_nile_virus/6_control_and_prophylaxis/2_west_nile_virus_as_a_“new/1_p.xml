<p>West Nile virus caused a series of fatal encephalitis cases in humans in New York in 1999. This attracted much attention at that time, especially because the virus was considered as a classic pathogen of the Old World and it was entirely unknown on the American continent and in the urban area of New York. West Nile virus usually infects birds (songbirds, crows), which constitute the reservoir for the pathogen. They can transport the virus over long distances. The virus can be transmitted to horses and humans by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Culex</italic>. The virus spread in just 1 year throughout the eastern USA. Diseases and deaths due to West Nile virus infections were reported especially in the eastern USA in the years after 1999. In 2002, the pathogen had spread into more than 39 states and 4,156 infections were documented in humans, 248 of whom died. The deaths occurred primarily in people of advanced age (the average age of the people who died was 79 years). Furthermore, during this period more than 3,400 confirmed infection cases were recorded in horses, which develop a clinical picture similar to that in humans. The infection wave reached its climax in 2003, when West Nile virus infections were diagnosed in almost 10,000 patients in all states of the USA. Since then, dead birds are extensively examined to determine whether they are infected with West Nile virus, especially the highly susceptible crows. In subsequent years, the number of infections decreased to 3,000–4,000 per year. To minimize the risk of infection, a very intensive and costly monitoring programme has been implemented, which includes five levels: mosquitoes, sentinel chicken flocks, diseased birds, other sick animals and diseased humans. Because of the infection wave and the risk of transmission of infection through contaminated blood donations, all blood donations have been tested by PCR for the presence of West Nile virus in the USA since 2003; along with the decrease in the number of new infections, the number of detections of West Nile virus in blood donations decreased from 818 in 2003 to below 200 in 2008. In European blood donors, West Nile virus is detected much less frequently; in Germany, for example, it was found with an antibody prevalence of only 0.03 % without evidence of viral RNA in blood donations.
