<p>During infection of humans, West Nile virus is introduced into the bloodstream through a mosquito bite, and binds to integrins (α
 <sub>v</sub>β
 <sub>3</sub>) on the surface of monocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells, and invades the whole organism; furthermore, interaction with the proteins ICAM-3 and dendritic-cell-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) has also been described. There are only a few data concerning the details of the pathogenesis. Similarly to TBEV, for West Nile virus, patients with genetic defects in the chemokine receptor CCR5 have increased risk of developing neurological symptoms and thus severe diseases from infection. Possibly, this receptor and its interaction with the ligand are responsible for the regulation of migration of macrophages and T lymphocytes into the infected tissues.
