<p>Hepatitis G virus was originally isolated by Friedrich Deinhard. In 1967, he inoculated marmosets with the serum of a surgeon who had hepatitis (G. Barker, according to his initials the virus is sometimes also referred to as GB virus), and was able to isolate a virus from the infected monkeys. In 1995, the genome of this virus was sequenced by Scott Muerhoff and co-workers; it was classified into the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> owing to the arrangement of its genes. Since an IRES sequence was identified at the 5′ end of the RNA genome, and genes are present coding for two glycoproteins (E1 and E2), it is related to hepatitis C virus. Subsequently, infections with this pathogen, which had been designated hepatitis G virus and is named human pegivirus today, were identified in many people who responded to the infection with the formation of specific antibodies. Meanwhile, different subtypes of this virus have been identified. The initial presumption that hepatitis G viruses cause liver inflammation in humans has not been verified. Occasionally, these viruses were also isolated from patients with hepatitis because of the high prevalence rates – up to 4 % of blood donors are viraemic. Both the acute and the persistent infection are apparently asymptomatic. There is even evidence that in patients who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus and human pegivirus, the human immunodeficiency virus infection shows an attenuated clinical course. This effect may be a result of the properties of the E2 protein of human pegivirus, which inhibits the replication cycle of human immunodeficiency virus, possibly on the basis of similar epitopes, and leads to cross-reacting immune responses.
