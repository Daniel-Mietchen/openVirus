<p>The identification and characterization of hepatitis C virus was done using molecular-biological methods. The blood of an experimentally infected chimpanzee was the source for the isolation of the viral RNA. Representative complementary DNA clones were synthesized from the viral RNA. The encoded proteins were expressed. It was attempted to identify proteins that react with sera from patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. The respective clone was sequenced. Then, oligonucleotides were synthesized, and were used to amplify the viral RNA genome from the blood of the chimpanzee by PCR. Finally, the genome was completely sequenced. In the last step, monoclonal antibodies against the viral proteins were produced, which allowed the identification of the virus particles.</p>
