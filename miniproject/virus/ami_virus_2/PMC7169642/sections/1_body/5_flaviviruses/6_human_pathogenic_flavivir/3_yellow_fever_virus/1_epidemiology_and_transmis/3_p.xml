<p>Yellow fever virus is genetically very stable, and there is only one serotype. It is present in the blood of infected individuals for several days during the disease. If they are bitten by a mosquito during this time, the virus is absorbed with the blood. The virus proliferates in the intestinal epithelium as well as in body and salivary gland cells of insects. This process lasts approximately 1 week, and has been named the extrinsic incubation period. Thereafter, the mosquito is able to transmit the yellow fever virus with the salivary secretion by biting.</p>
