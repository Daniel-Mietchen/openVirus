<p>Hepatitis C virus is found only in humans. Before the introduction of appropriate test procedures, it was transmitted mostly through blood transfusions or blood products. Today, the residual risk of becoming infected by receiving a positive blood transfusion is 1:100,000. Nearly 70 % of all new infections with hepatitis C virus now occur among drug addicts, and are caused by the common use of syringes. Further methods of transmission are sexual intercourse and, in rare cases, household contact with infected patients under poor hygiene conditions. Hospital staff are endangered by injuries with needles. Even so, the source of infection is not known in approximately 30 % of cases. The virus can be transmitted vertically from mother to child during pregnancy or at birth. However, a hepatitis C virus infection of the gestating mother is not considered an indication for caesarean section.</p>
