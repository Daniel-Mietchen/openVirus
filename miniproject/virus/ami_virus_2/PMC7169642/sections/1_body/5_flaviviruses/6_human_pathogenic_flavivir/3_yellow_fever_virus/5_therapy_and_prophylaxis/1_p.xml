<p>By continuous cultivation of yellow fever virus in embryonated chicken eggs, in 1937 Max Theiler was able to breed an attenuated yellow fever virus (strain 17D) which in humans does not cause any symptoms. In 1951, Theiler was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the first development of a live vaccine. The molecular basis of attenuation is unknown. In comparison with the wild-type genome, strain 17D has a total of 68 nucleotide mutations, which lead to 32 amino acid changes in viral proteins. Most mutations are located in the gene encoding the E protein, so it is suspected that the vaccine virus may bind less efficiently to the receptors on liver cells. As a consequence, less virus is produced, which results in slower infection rates, and hence in a mild or attenuated form of infection. Low virus concentrations are found in the blood of vaccinated individuals about 3–5 days after inoculation; viraemia lasts for 1–2 days. The first immune response is detectable in 95 % of vaccinated individuals 10 days after vaccination. To maintain protection, booster vaccinations are needed in 10-year intervals. Back mutations to the wild type have never been observed; thus, the yellow fever vaccine is regarded as very successful and safe worldwide. Millions of people have been vaccinated to date. Hence, significant control and reduction of yellow fever infections has been achieved in tropical countries; large-scale epidemics are reported only very rarely today. The attenuated yellow fever vaccine is manufactured and distributed worldwide under the control of the WHO. It must be administered only in government-approved vaccination centres. Yellow fever vaccination is obligatory in many countries for travellers to or from endemic yellow fever regions.</p>
