<p>In ELISA or in immunoblotting, recombinant viral proteins are used to detect specific antibodies. IgM antibodies against the NS4 and C proteins can be found in acute infections. However, since these may persist or correlate with the level of liver injury and also with the genotype, IgM diagnostic tests are not of great importance. This is further indication that both viral gene expression and protein synthesis are constantly occurring in chronic infections. IgG antibodies against the C protein can be detected a few days to a few weeks after the onset of symptoms; IgG antibodies against non-structural proteins (NS3, NS4, NS5) are detectable later. Immunoglobulins against envelope proteins E1 and E2 are detected at an early stage in only about 10Â % of acute infections. It is unknown whether these antibodies are not formed or whether they cannot be detected owing to the variability of the amino acid sequence and the lack of sensitivity of the test systems. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes can be detected in the blood of patients after stimulation by peptides that are derived from viral proteins.</p>
