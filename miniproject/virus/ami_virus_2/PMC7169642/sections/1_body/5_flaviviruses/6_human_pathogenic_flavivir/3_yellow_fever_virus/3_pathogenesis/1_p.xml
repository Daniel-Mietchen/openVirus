<p>After having been introduced into the bloodstream by a mosquito bite, yellow fever viruses infect endothelial cells, lymphocytes and preferably macrophages and monocytes near the injection site. These cells transport the virus via lymphatic vessels to the lymph nodes and lymphoid tissues, where they encounter other susceptible target cells. During viraemia, high amounts of infectious viruses are produced that infect liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), which die as a result of viral replication. Next, the virus infects and destroys hepatocytes. This leads to a strong increase in the concentration of transaminases in the blood. In rare cases, infected macrophages may transport the yellow fever virus to the brain, where it may cause encephalitis. The haemorrhages, which become obvious by internal bleeding in the kidney, brain and other organs during the symptomatic phase of infection, are ascribed to a reduced production of clotting factors due to infection and subsequent destruction of liver cells.</p>
