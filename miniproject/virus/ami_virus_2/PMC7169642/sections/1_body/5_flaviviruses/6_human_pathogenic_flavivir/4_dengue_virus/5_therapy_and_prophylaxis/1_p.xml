<p>So far, there are neither vaccines for prevention nor suitable antiviral drugs against dengue virus infections. The immunopathogenesis of antibody-dependent enhancement (also referred to as immune enhancement) which is related to dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome renders the development of suitable vaccines very difficult. However, attenuated viruses of all four serotypes have been developed in Thailand with financial support from the Rockefeller Foundation. They are being tested as live vaccines in clinical trials. In addition, the fight against mosquitoes as the carrier of the disease and the combat against their breeding grounds is still of paramount importance.</p>
