<p>Infections with the central European virus type are relatively mild in comparison with infections with the eastern European virus type. About 70–90 % of individuals infected remain asymptomatic, whereas the other 10–30 % develop a mostly gentle illness without lasting complications. The time between contact with the virus and the onset of the first symptoms is 1–2 weeks. The first signs of disease are flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea and sensitivity to light. They last about 1 week. During this time, viruses can be isolated from the blood. After this period, the health improves in most cases, but in about 10 % of patients only a transient improvement is observed for about 1 week. The second phase can range from a mild form of meningitis (inflammation of the meninx in the brain or spine; in roughly 55 % of cases) to severe forms of meningoencephalitis (inflammation of the brain; 35 % of cases) with tremor, dizziness, altered perception and paralysis. The involvement of the spinal cord is referred to as a meningomyelitis (5 %) or meningomyeloencephalitis (5 %). The mortality rate is approximately 1 % of patients with severe clinical courses. About 7 % of survivors of the second phase of infection have neurological sequelae such as paralysis, speech problems and epileptic seizures.</p>
