<p>Hepatitis C virus has long been classified into the so-called non-A, non-B hepatitis viruses. In 1989, Daniel W. Bradley characterized the genome of these viruses. Today, six genotypes of hepatitis C virus are known from different geographical regions; their nucleic acid sequences differ by 31–34 %. The genotypes are also subdivided into various subtypes. The most common genotype, 1b, is found in Europe, followed by genotypes 2a, 3b, 2c and 3a; however, in North America, genotype 1a is commonest, followed by genotype 1b. Genotypes 4 and 5 have only been found in Africa; on the other hand, genotype 6 prevails in some regions of Asia (China, Korea). The number of people who are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus has been estimated to be 200 million worldwide. In Germany, the prevalence is 0.5–0.6 %.</p>
