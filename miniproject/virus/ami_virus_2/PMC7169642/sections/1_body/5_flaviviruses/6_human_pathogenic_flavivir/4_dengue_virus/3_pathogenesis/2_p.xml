<p>Dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are characterized by increased permeability of capillary vessel walls. Immunopathogenetic mechanisms seem to be responsible for the development of this severe disease form. The four dengue virus serotypes display homology of 63–68 % at the amino acid sequence level of their E proteins; contrarily, the homology between different variants of one dengue virus serotype is more than 90 %. Severe diseases occur especially if patients are infected with dengue virus for a second time, but now with a serotype different from that of the initial infection. Because of the primary infection, these patients possess dengue-virus-specific antibodies, which partially cross-react with the other serotypes. They can bind to the E protein on the surface of the virus. Owing to a low affinity determined by differences in the amino acid sequence of the epitopes, they are not neutralizing, but they enable the viruses, which are complexed with antibodies, to interact with Fc receptors on macrophages, thus preferentially facilitating a more efficient penetration into the cells; therefore, the cross-reacting IgG molecules exert an infection-enhancing effect (Fig.
