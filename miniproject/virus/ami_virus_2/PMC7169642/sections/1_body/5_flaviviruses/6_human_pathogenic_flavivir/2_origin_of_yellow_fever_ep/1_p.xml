<p>Under natural conditions, yellow fever virus can undergo two infection cycles: jungle or savannah yellow fever and urban yellow fever. Jungle or savannah yellow fever is transmitted by mosquitoes of the species 
 <italic>Aedes africanus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes haemagogus</italic>. They breed in water accumulations in tree holes, puddles or holes in the ground. Female insects can vertically transmit the virus to their offspring. Monkeys, as intermediate hosts, also maintain the infection chain of jungle or savannah yellow fever. New World monkeys in South America become sick and may die from the infection, whereas Old World monkeys in Africa have apparently adapted well to the virus during evolution and are often infected only subclinically. As side links in the transmission chain, the virus can be transmitted to people who stay in those regions, causing sporadic diseases. Yellow fever virus can be carried by infected individuals into urban regions where the mosquito species 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is ubiquitous; these species become infected with the virus, leading to its epidemic dissemination.
