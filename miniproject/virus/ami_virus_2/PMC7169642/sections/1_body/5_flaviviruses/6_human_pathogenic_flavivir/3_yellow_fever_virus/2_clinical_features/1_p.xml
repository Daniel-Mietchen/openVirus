<p>Usually, the first symptoms of fever, nausea, headache and muscle pain appear 3–6 days after the mosquito bite; at this stage, infected people are viraemic. After a short-term improvement, in a subset of patients the symptoms may appear more pronounced, accompanied by resurging fever, vomiting of blood (signalizing haemorrhage), dehydration, hypotension, abdominal pain and signs of renal failure. In this stage of the disease, patients develop the signs of jaundice because of the destruction of liver cells and the associated increase of the level of bilirubin. The virus is then no longer present in the blood. Half of patients who enter the second phase die of severe kidney and liver failure, shock and delirium within 7–10 days. Subclinical or abortive forms of infection, in which the symptoms appear in a mitigated form or do not emerge at all, are more frequent than fulminant forms of yellow fever. The overall lethality of yellow fever is 20–50 %.</p>
