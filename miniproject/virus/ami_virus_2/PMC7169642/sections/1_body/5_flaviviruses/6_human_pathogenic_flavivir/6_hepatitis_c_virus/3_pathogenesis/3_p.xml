<p>It has not been conclusively resolved in which way hepatitis C virus promotes carcinogenesis. There is evidence that specific sequences of the C protein interact with cellular Ras proteins and that this interaction induces transformation. The time span between infection and the formation of a primary hepatocellular carcinoma is approximately 20â€“40 years. The origin is a chronic infection in adolescents and adults. It is thought that persistent inflammation processes are responsible for the development of cancer over the years. Because of the infiltration of immunologically active cells and their secretion of cytokines, liver cells are destroyed. This cell-damaging process can be intensified by certain cofactors, such as alcohol consumption. In individual cases, mutations can arise in the cellular genome during such processes, which then stimulate liver cells to proliferate continuously, and contribute to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>
