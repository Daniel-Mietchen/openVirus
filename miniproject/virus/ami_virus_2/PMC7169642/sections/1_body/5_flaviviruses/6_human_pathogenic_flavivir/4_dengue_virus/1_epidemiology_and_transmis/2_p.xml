<p>The spread of mosquitoes on the Asian continent particularly during the Second World War and the subsequent urbanization of the population led to a dramatic increase of dengue fever cases in Asia. Inasmuch as tourist traffic also increased at that time, infected mosquitoes were imported by aircraft from the Pacific regions to Central America and South America as well as to the USA. Today, dengue virus infects approximately 50 million people worldwide each year; hence, it is the most common insect-borne viral infection in humans, and is endemic in most urban areas of tropical countries. Epidemics emerge in intervals of 3â€“5 years. Every year, millions of people become sick from dengue fever and hundreds of thousands become sick from the associated haemorrhagic fever and the dengue shock syndrome. Whether individual dengue virus isolates differ in their virulence, and thus in determining of the severity of the disease, is uncertain. Possibly, such differences may explain the partially epidemic occurrence of dengue haemorrhagic fever, even in people who have been infected with dengue virus for the first time.</p>
