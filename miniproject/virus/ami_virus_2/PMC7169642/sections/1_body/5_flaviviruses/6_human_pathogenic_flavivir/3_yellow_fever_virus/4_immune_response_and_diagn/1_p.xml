<p>Yellow fever virus can be easily cultivated in human cells (HeLa and KB cell lines) and in monkey kidney cells (Vero cells) in vitro. It may also be reproduced in chicken and duck embryonic cells as well as in continuously growing rodent cell lines. In infected individuals, IgM and IgG antibodies against the E and M proteins can be detected about 1–2 weeks after infection (i.e. 5–7 days after the onset of symptoms) by ELISA, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence, haemagglutination-inhibition and virus-neutralization tests. In addition to these serological methods, detection of viral genomes by RT-PCR in blood samples is the method of choice in the early stages of infection. Neutralizing antibodies persist lifelong, and confer durable protection against reinfections. During the viraemia, NS1-specific antibodies can induce antibody-dependent lysis of infected cells, thus making an important contribution to the control of infection and to the clearance of the virus from the organism. To what extent the cellular immune system is involved in clearance of the virus by induction of cytotoxic T cells is unclear.</p>
