<p>Dengue fever has been known as a human disease for more than 200 years and was formerly called dandy fever or break-bone fever owing to the very strong joint and muscle pain. The first reports of an epidemic occurrence were from Indonesia and Egypt. A dengue fever epidemic also occurred in North America (Philadelphia) in 1780. Further outbreaks were subsequently observed periodically in almost all tropical and subtropical regions. In 1903, Harris Graham, working as a physician in Beirut, isolated a filterable pathogen from the blood of patients. Thomas L. Bancroft, an Australian physician and botanist, demonstrated its transferability by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in 1906. In 1944, Albert Sabin and R. Walter Schlesinger identified dengue viruses as pathogens by transferring blood of infected soldiers into mice. Four different serotypes of dengue virus are known. Similarly to yellow fever, there are urban and rural forms of dengue fever. The latter is spread by 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. scutellaris</italic>; their natural hosts are considered to be non-human primates in tropical forests of Southeast Asia and South America. 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> is especially involved in propagation and transmission of the infection in urban centres. Not all strains of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are able to transmit dengue viruses. Genetic variants of the mosquitoes which do not produce receptor protein R67/R64 (molecular mass 67 kDa) in their intestinal epithelial cells are responsible for this. These mosquito strains (e.g. IBO-11) are not permissive for dengue virus infections; therefore, they cannot transmit the pathogens.
