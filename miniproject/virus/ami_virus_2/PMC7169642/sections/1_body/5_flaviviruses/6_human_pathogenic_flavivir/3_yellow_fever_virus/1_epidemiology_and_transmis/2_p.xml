<p>Today, yellow fever is endemic in regions of Africa south of the Sahara – mainly in the tropical forests of West Africa – and in South America. Yellow fever virus can proliferate with differing efficiency in various 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species, which are well adapted to different environmental conditions in jungles, savannahs and urban centres. In Asian countries, the disease has not emerged so far. It is assumed that Asian 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species are less susceptible to the virus, and thus constitute bad carrier vectors. On the other hand, it seems conceivable that cross-immunities with dengue viruses, which are widespread in Asian countries, might prevent the occurrence of apparent yellow fever infections. It also seems possible that people in Africa may have developed a wide cross-reactive immunity owing to numerous viral infections by insects. These conditions may have prevented major epidemics of yellow fever in the population; therefore, only non-immune Europeans were affected. However, because of the advancing urbanization in recent decades, the living conditions in Africa have changed greatly, so yellow fever is now frequently observed. In recent years, epidemic outbreaks of yellow fever with more than 100,000 cases have been reported in Nigeria. The annual number of officially reported infections is approximately 2,000 in South America. Presumably, the number of unreported cases may be very high.
