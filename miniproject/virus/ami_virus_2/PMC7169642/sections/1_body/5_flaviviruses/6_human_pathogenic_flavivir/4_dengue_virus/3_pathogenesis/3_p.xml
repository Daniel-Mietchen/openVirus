<p>Binding of both antibody-complexed and free dengue viruses on the surface of macrophages leads to the interaction of viral proteins with CLEC5A protein (C-type lectin domain family 5, member A, also known as myeloid DAP12-associating lectin, MDL-1). This surface protein does not act as a receptor for the interaction with dengue virus, but is involved in this process. The consequence is the induction of a signalling cascade that results in the release of large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. If the interaction between the virus and CLEC5A is blocked by CLEC5A-specific antibodies in a mouse model, cytokine release does not occur, preventing the increase of vascular permeability.</p>
