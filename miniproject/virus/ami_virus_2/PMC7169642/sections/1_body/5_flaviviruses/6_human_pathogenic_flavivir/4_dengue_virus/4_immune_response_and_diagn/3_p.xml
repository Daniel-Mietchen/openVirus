<p>Since dengue-virus-specific antibodies cross-react with other flaviviruses, particularly in countries where many different members of these viruses are endemic, the diagnosis of an acute infection is difficult by means of antibody detection. Therefore, explicit assertions can only be arrived at by a virus-neutralization test, by detecting viral RNA by RT-PCR or by isolation of the virus from blood samples of infected individuals; dengue viruses can be reproduced in vitro in various continuous cell lines (Vero or baby hamster kidney cells).</p>
