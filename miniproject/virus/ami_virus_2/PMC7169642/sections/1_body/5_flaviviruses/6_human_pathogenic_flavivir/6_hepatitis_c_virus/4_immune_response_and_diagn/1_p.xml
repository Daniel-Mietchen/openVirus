<p>Increased transaminase levels may be elucidative for the diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infections, although this does not allow any further assignment of the pathogen. The main approach for diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infections is ELISA, which is used for screening. If the test findings are positive, it can be inferred that a fresh, chronic or past hepatitis C virus infection has occurred. A more exact serological differentiation is not possible. Owing to the high sensitivity of these screening tests, immunoblotting or analogous methods have additionally been introduced as confirmatory tests to exclude non-specific results. Quantitative RT-PCR for detection of viral RNA genomes is the most important method used today, and is usually applied as a confirmatory test, especially since this method immediately provides the level of the viral load. In general, serum or plasma is used as the source material; liver biopsies are used only in exceptional cases. In addition, the genotype is usually determined by PCR and hybridization tests, as this is crucial for determining the duration of therapy. Since the phase in which an acute hepatitis C infection cannot be serologically diagnosed with certainty lasts several months, automated tests have been introduced for the detection of viral C proteins in order to shorten this phase.</p>
