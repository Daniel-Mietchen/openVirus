<p>The WHO has established strict criteria for the diagnosis of dengue haemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome: these include severe fever, haemorrhagic symptoms, swelling of the liver and circulatory failure. The disease has been classified, depending on the severity, into four stages: stages I and II correspond to dengue haemorrhagic fever, and stages III and IV correspond to dengue shock syndrome.</p>
