<p>The isolation of vaccine strain 17D of yellow fever virus by Max Theiler was serendipitous, i.e. a fortunate and accidental discovery: this strain was isolated by continuous cultivation of the wild-type virus in embryonated chicken eggs after 89â€“114 passages. All attempts to reproduce the result have not been successful so far.</p>
