<p>There is an inactivated vaccine made of purified and formalin-inactivated virus particles, which are cultivated, for example, in primary chicken embryonic cells. The vaccine usually contains aluminium hydroxide as an adjuvant. It exhibits a very good seroconversion rate and protective efficacy after primary immunization (three vaccinations), which lasts 3–5 years. Thereafter, booster vaccinations are required at regular intervals. Preferentially, vaccination is usually performed for people in highly endemic regions or in population groups with a high risk of being bitten by ticks because they have to remain in forests and meadows for a long time for job-related reasons. The formerly postinfection passive immunization is no longer recommended because the vaccine exerts a negative influence on the course of infection in children. A postinfection active vaccination within 3–4 days after a tick bite is currently under discussion. Effective antiviral agents for symptomatic TBEV infections are not available.</p>
