<p>The members of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> that are pathogenic for humans are transmitted to humans by mosquito or tick bites. The tick-borne viruses are found in Europe and Asia, where they preferentially infect rodents as natural hosts; in central Europe, TBEV belongs to this group. Viruses that are transmitted by mosquito bites can be divided into two groups. Mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> preferably bite mammals. Viruses that are transmitted by these mosquitoes, such as the pathogens of yellow fever and dengue fever or dengue shock syndrome, may cause febrile illnesses in humans, and these can be associated with haemorrhage. 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes prefer birds as hosts and transmit viruses such as the pathogens of West Nile fever, St. Louis encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis that cause neurological diseases such as meningitis and encephalitis in humans. The hepatitis C and hepatitis G viruses are primarily transmitted through contaminated blood or other body fluids; an arthropod-mediated transmission is not known for these infectious agents. As no illnesses have been observed in infections with hepatitis G virus so far, they will not be discussed in detail in the next section.
