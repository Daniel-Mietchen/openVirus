<p>It is uncertain to what extent the various activities of the non-structural proteins which suppress the IFN-α- and IFN-β-mediated defence strategies in vivo also influence the pathogenesis of the disease. This also applies to the property of dengue viruses to increase the expression of MHC class I antigens in infected cells in vitro. The high concentration of MHC class I proteins together with increased binding to the receptors, which are inhibitory for NK cells, lead to infected cells evading NK-cell-mediated lysis.</p>
