<p>Classical swine fever is characterized by a peracute to acute disease pattern, which may be accompanied by respiratory or gastrointestinal disorders. Central nervous system symptoms have also been described, such as tremor, paralysis and convulsions. The morbidity can be up to 100Â % in livestock. The atypical or chronic infections are less dramatic, and thus can be easily overlooked. In pregnant sows, classical swine fever can cause miscarriages of mummified piglets, or farrowing of weak piglets.</p>
