<p>The viral persistence is based on a BVDV-type-specific central immune tolerance, which is established in the embryo against a non-cytopathogenic biotype in the course of infection. These calves are completely immunocompetent against other viral infections, even against BVDV infections with a serologically distinct virus type. During persistence of BVDV, mutations occur in the viral genome, which lead to the development of a virus with a new biotype. This cytopathogenic virus then causes the lethal clinical picture of mucosal disease.</p>
