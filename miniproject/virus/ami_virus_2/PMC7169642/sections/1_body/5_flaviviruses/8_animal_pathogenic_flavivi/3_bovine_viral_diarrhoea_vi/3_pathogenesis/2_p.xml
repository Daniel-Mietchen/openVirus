<p>The molecular basis for the emergence of the cytopathogenic virus resides in genetic mutations that lead to different processing of the non-structural protein NS3. Whereas it is produced as the NS2–NS3 fusion protein in non-cytopathogenic BVDV, NS3 proteins do not possess the NS2 fusion part in the corresponding cytopathogenic viruses. The altered processing occurs when cellular genome sequences are integrated into the NS2 coding region within the viral genome. This process changes the pattern of proteolytic cleavage in the precursor protein. It has been shown by homologous RNA recombination that a number of cellular genes have been integrated into the viral genome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001416" ref-type="fig">14.16</xref>). Besides the integration of cellular gene sequences, e.g. by incorporating ubiquitin-coding sequences, rearrangements or deletions of viral genome segments have also been described. All these processes lead to the production of free NS3 proteins, which are generated by cleavage of the precursor protein by the cellular ubiquitin hydrolase or the viral protease N
 <sup>pro</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001416" ref-type="fig">14.16</xref>). The underlying mechanisms that lead to the enhanced virulence are unclear. Classical swine fever virus and border disease virus of sheep (another pestivirus) also produce free NS3 proteins during infection, but without inducing the severe symptoms which are developed in mucosal disease.
