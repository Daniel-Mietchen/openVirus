<p>Interestingly, a highly effective live vaccine has long been available, and has been used in many European countries for many years. It is based on a virus that was attenuated by numerous passages in rabbits (C strain, “lapinized virus”). This virus is now used only for oral immunization of wild boars with bait vaccines in the wild. It is no longer used for immunization of the well-controlled pig populations because trade of meat from vaccinated animals is accompanied by strict requirements, which make its application economically (currently) unattractive.</p>
