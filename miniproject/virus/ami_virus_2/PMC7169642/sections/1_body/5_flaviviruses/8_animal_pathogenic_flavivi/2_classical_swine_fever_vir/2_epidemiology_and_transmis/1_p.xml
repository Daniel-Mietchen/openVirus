<p>The clinical picture of classical swine fever is characterized by severe haemorrhagic and general symptoms. In addition to this severe form, clinically atypical infections occur very frequently (nowadays almost exclusively), and exhibit only few clear and partially mild symptoms. This complicates the rapid clinical diagnosis and can contribute to fast dissemination, considering the high contagiousness of the virus.</p>
