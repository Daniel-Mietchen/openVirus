<p>The diagnosis of classical swine fever is initiated by the veterinary authority after notification. Diagnosis is possible by detection of antibodies using ELISA or neutralization tests. In this context, it is important to distinguish between antibodies against classical swine fever virus and antibodies against BVDV, which can also infect swine, but does not induce any disease, and hence is not subject to compulsory supervision for animal health purposes. Differentiation requires the parallel titration of sera which contain the proteins of BVDV or classical swine fever virus as antigens. However, more important is the direct detection of the virus, which can be achieved by isolating the pathogen in permanent porcine kidney cell cultures, by serological characterization by monoclonal antibodies in immunofluorescence tests (if necessary by flow cytometry) or by genetic characterization by means of PCR.</p>
