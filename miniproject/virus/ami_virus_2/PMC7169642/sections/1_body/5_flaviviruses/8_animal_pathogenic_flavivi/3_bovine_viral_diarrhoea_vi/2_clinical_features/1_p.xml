<p>In adult animals, BVDV causes a subclinical infection or mild, self-limiting diarrhoeas. Peracute haemorrhagic symptoms are rarely observed. Whether in such cases particular strains or biotypes of BVDV are responsible is being discussed. After infection, the animals develop lifelong immunity. Economic damage is caused by the virus if susceptible, i.e. immunologically unprotected, pregnant cows are infected. Depending on the time of infection, infection leads to abortion, birth of malformed calves or birth of persistently infected, viraemic calves. These animals can develop mucosal disease, a fatal disease form.</p>
