<p>BVDV is an economically important animal pathogen. For years, there has been discussion of whether there are two separate pestiviruses, namely BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, or whether they are different genotypes of a single species of virus. Although they cause the same symptoms, they can be distinguished by their genome sequences and the antibody response induced in cattle. The virus is excreted in the faeces and via mucosal secretions, and is ingested orally.</p>
