<p>There are a number of pathogenic flaviviruses within the genus 
 <italic>Pestivirus</italic> which cause economically important diseases in swine and ruminants. These include primarily classical swine fever virus, whose infections cause the classical (“European”) swine fever in pigs. Clinically, it cannot be distinguished from the similar African swine fever. The latter is induced by African swine fever virus, a DNA virus from the new family 
 <italic>Asfarviridae</italic> (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19).
