<p>A series of vaccines are available. They contain either inactivated or attenuated viruses with reproduction capacity. The former are generally not able to prevent intrauterine transmission of the virus. Live vaccines, however, are based on a cytopathogenic BVDV strain. In persistently infected animals, the live vaccine triggers mucosal disease immediately after vaccination or after recombination between the wild type and the vaccine strain. These vaccines are therefore problematic. Furthermore, persistently infected calves can be produced after inoculation of pregnant animals with the live vaccine. It is hence desirable to develop potent inactivated vaccines which reliably prevent intrauterine transmission and protect against the known BVDV genotypes.</p>
