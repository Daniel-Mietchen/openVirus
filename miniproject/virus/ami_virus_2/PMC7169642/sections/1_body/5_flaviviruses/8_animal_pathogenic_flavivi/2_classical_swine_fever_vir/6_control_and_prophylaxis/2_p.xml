<p>Recently, genetically engineered vaccines against swine fever have been developed. They contain glycoprotein E2, which is produced by means of recombinant baculoviruses. These marker vaccines induce an immune reaction exclusively against glycoprotein E2, which allows differentiation between vaccinated and infected swine. However, they are not suitable for emergency vaccinations because a robust protection can be developed only a few days after vaccination.</p>
