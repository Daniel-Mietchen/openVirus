<p>BVDV infections are usually diagnosed by isolating the virus in cell culture, by RT-PCR or by detection of the BVDV antigen in peripheral blood lymphocytes using immunofluorescence tests (flow cytometry) or ELISA. Maternal antibodies can interfere with these tests, and their usage yields reliable results only from the sixth month of life. Therefore, the detection of the viral E
 <sup>rns</sup> protein in serum is usual today. It is secreted by virus-infected cells. Maternal antibodies against the E
 <sup>rns</sup> protein are hardly present in calves, so verification of infection is possible from the 20th day of life by detection of E
 <sup>rns</sup> proteins using ELISA.
