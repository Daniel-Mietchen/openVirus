<p>Another human pathogenic picornavirus was characterized much later: hepatitis A virus, the pathogen of an epidemic form of liver inflammation for which the genus 
 <italic>Hepatovirus</italic> was created. Epidemiologically and diagnostically, hepatitis A was distinguished at an early date from hepatitis B. The first electron-microscopic detection of hepatitis A virus was performed by Stephen F. Feinstone and colleagues in 1973. However, the successful cultivation of this virus was only achieved in 1979; it was assigned to the picornavirus family in 1982. Besides the pathogens mentioned, there are also picornaviruses that can infect humans very frequently: namely rhinoviruses as the causative agent of the common cold.
