<p>The genome of picornaviruses contains a long single open reading frame that encodes a large precursor protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00142" ref-type="fig">14.2</xref>). This experimentally not isolable protein is processed by proteolytic cleavage during its synthesis, thus leading to all the various viral components, i.e. structural and non-structural proteins as well as viral enzymes. A large untranslated sequence region (5′ UTR) is located between Vpg at the 5′ terminus of the genome and the start codon of the precursor protein; it has a length of 412 nucleotides in porcine teschovirus, 1,624 nucleotides in rhinoviruses and 1,199 nucleotides in FMD virus. The vast majority of the 5′-terminal non-coding nucleotides form intramolecular base pairings, resulting in a pronounced secondary structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00143" ref-type="fig">14.3</xref>). The first 88 nucleotides immediately adjacent to the 5′ terminus form a secondary structure resembling a cloverleaf, which is involved in the initiation of genome replication for generating new positive-sense RNA molecules. The further downstream located sequence region possesses an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that facilitates binding of ribosomes independently of the 5′-cap structure that is usually present at the 5′ end of eukaryotic mRNA molecules. Mutations in this region can strongly influence the translatability of the mRNA and virulence. Furthermore, a short untranslated sequence region is located between the stop codon for the polyprotein and the poly(A) tail at the 3′ terminus of the genome, which comprises 47 and 100 nucleotides in rhinoviruses and coxsackieviruses, respectively.
