<p>The virions of enteroviruses, parechoviruses, kobuviruses, cardioviruses, teschoviruses and hepatoviruses are very stable and cannot be compromised even by an acid environment with pH values of 3 and below. This suggests that a very tight interaction must exist between the various capsid proteins within the particle of such viruses. Furthermore, these viruses also exhibit a very high resistance against detergents. Even as free virus particles, they are able to survive in the environment for relatively long periods of time.</p>
