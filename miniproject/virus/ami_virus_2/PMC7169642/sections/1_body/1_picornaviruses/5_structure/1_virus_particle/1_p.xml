<p>All picornaviruses have a very similar structure, which consists of a non-enveloped icosahedral nucleocapsid with a diameter of approximately 30 nm. The capsids are composed of four viral proteins: VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4. Occasionally, a fifth polypeptide is found in inconstant quantities; it is denominated VP0 and is the precursor of components VP2 and VP4, which arise by proteolytic cleavage during viral maturation. Especially in parechoviruses, VP0 is barely cleaved; therefore, their particles contain large quantities of the precursor protein. Inasmuch as the particle structure of several picornaviruses has been elucidated by X-ray diffraction analysis, the arrangement of the different viral structural proteins in the particles is well known. The virions are composed of 60 units of each of the four single proteins VP1, VP2, VP3 and VP4, in which VP4 is localized inside the particle and in association with the RNA genome. The hepatovirus VP4 is very small (21–23 amino acid residues), and its presence in the virion has not been definitively resolved. VP1, VP2 and VP3 form the surface of the icosahedron (Fig.
