<p>In addition to this taxonomic classification, picornaviruses can be subdivided into two principal groups according to their molecular properties that are closely associated with pathogenesis: (1) acid-stable viruses that can survive in the acid environment of the stomach without a loss of infectivity, thus infecting the host organism preferentially through the digestive tract â€“ to this group belong enteroviruses, parechoviruses, hepatoviruses, avihepatoviruses, sapeloviruses and teschoviruses; (2) acid-labile viruses that infect the host organism preferentially via the upper respiratory tract, such as rhinoviruses, aphthoviruses and erboviruses.</p>
