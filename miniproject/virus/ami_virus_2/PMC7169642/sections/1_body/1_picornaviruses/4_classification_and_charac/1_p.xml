<p>The family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> is classified into the order 
 <italic>Picornavirales</italic> together with the families 
 <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Iflaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Marnavidirae</italic> and 
 <italic>Secoviridae</italic>. Whereas members of the families 
 <italic>Dicistroviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Iflavividae</italic> infect various species of insects and other invertebrates, those belonging to the families 
 <italic>Marnaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Secoviridae</italic> are pathogenic in algae and plants. The family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> comprises a large number of virus groups and virus types (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab00141" ref-type="table">14.1</xref>) that infect vertebrates. The members of this family can cause completely different disorders in humans, and partially also severe diseases. The name “picorna” is an abbreviation that alludes to two molecular properties of the virus family, i.e. small (
 <italic>pico</italic>) viruses with an RNA genome. The classification of picornaviruses into 17 genera is based on their respective molecular-biological properties, sequence homologies as well as on the diseases they induce: 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Parechovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Hepatovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cardiovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Sapelovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Teschovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Kobuvirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aphthovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Erbovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Avihepato</italic>virus, 
 <italic>Tremovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Senecavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aquamavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cosavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Dicipivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Megrivirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Salivirus</italic>. More than 150 known human pathogenic viruses that belong to the genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> have been newly classified on the basis of new sequence data of the viral genomes. Until recently, human rhinoviruses were also assigned to the genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic>, which comprises a large number of different species and types of viruses which can infect both animals and humans. Today, this genus is subdivided into 12 species, namely enteroviruses A-I and rhinoviruses A, B and C. All species differ by certain molecular properties (e.g. human enteroviruses A and B differ from human enteroviruses C and D by distinct sequence elements within the 5′ untranslated region, UTR) and/or in regard to their infection courses. Owing to its similarity to human enterovirus C, poliovirus has been assigned to this species; however, poliovirus differs from human enteroviruses by its property of causing poliomyelitis. Genome sequencing revealed that many of the different types of coxsackieviruses, enteroviruses and echoviruses have arisen by genetic recombination between various enteroviruses. For example, the animal pathogenic swine vesicular disease virus is a recombinant between the genomes of human coxsackievirus B5 – from which the coding region for the structural proteins is derived – and echovirus 9, from which the sequences encoding the non-structural proteins originated. 
 <italic>Aichi virus</italic>, a member of the genus 
 <italic>Kobuvirus</italic>, is widely spread as a pathogen of gastrointestinal infections especially in Asia. Similar manifestations have been observed with Cosa- and Saliviruses. Human rhinoviruses are grouped into three distinct species: rhinoviruses A, B, and C. This subdivision is based on differences in the amino acid sequences of capsid proteins. Nonetheless, many of the currently known virus types have still not been assigned to any of these species. The genera 
 <italic>Cardiovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Sapelovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Teschovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Erbovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cadicivirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Aquamavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Aphthovirus</italic> comprise primarily animal pathogenic picornaviruses that partly cause animal epidemic diseases and have considerable importance for animal breeding and food technology; e.g. FMD virus, which has been classified into the genus 
 <italic>Aphthovirus</italic>. Seven different serotypes can be distinguished worldwide today. The name of this genus alludes to the blisters or cysts (aphthae) that arise in the mucosa of infected animals. The genera 
 <italic>Avihepatovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Megrivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Tremovirus</italic> have been created for species that have been isolated from birds. Only one viral species has been assigned to the genus 
 <italic>Senecavirus</italic>: Seneca valley virus was identified in the cultured cell line PER C6; its natural host has not yet been identified. The 5′ UTR of this new virus displays some similarities to that of pestiviruses and hepaciviruses (Sect.
