<p>In the first step of the infection process, picornaviruses attach to specific cellular membrane proteins. On the virus side, the structures and amino acids of the canyon are the prevailing factors that mediate receptor binding. The cellular receptors of several viruses have been identified and are also molecularly well characterized; for attachment, all picornaviruses seem to use cell surface proteins that are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab00144" ref-type="table">14.4</xref>). In some cases, coreceptors have been identified that additionally support binding, or interact with the actual receptors.
