<p>Following the initial translation steps, the whole polyprotein is uniformly synthesized. During translation, it is folded into the individual protein domains. In most picornaviruses (exceptions are hepatitis A virus and parechoviruses), the first proteolytic cleavage reactions occur cotranslationally during the synthesis of the polyprotein, namely immediately after translation of the sequences encoding the 2A protease. This enzyme operates autocatalytically, leading to cleavage of the protomer region at the amino terminus. The 3C and 3CD proteases are involved in processing the other viral components; owing to their carboxy-terminal location within the polyprotein, they are synthesized later. In hepatitis A virus and parechoviruses, the protomer remains linked with the 2A domain. Owing to proteolytic cleavage, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D
 <sup>pol</sup>) and Vpg are available as a prerequisite for the replication of the viral genome in the infected cell. In vitro, the synthesis of the polyprotein takes approximately 15 min.
