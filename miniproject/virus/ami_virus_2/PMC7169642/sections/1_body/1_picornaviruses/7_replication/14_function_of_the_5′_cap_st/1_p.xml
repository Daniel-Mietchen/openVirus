<p>In eukaryotic protein translation, the cap-binding complex attaches to the cap region, a methylated guanosine nucleotide that is linked to the 5′ terminus of the messenger RNA via a 5′–5′ ester bond. The cap-binding complex is composed of the cap-binding protein, which interacts with the 5′ terminus, factor eIF-3 and proteins eI-4A and eI-4B, which bind to the region located up to 100 nucleotides directly upstream of the start codon, maintaining it in a single-stranded extended configuration. The small ribosomal subunit along with tRNA
 <sup>Met</sup>, initiation factor eIF-2 and GTP interact with this 5′ terminally associated complex to initiate protein translation. The genome of picornaviruses functions as mRNA, but does not possess a 5′-cap structure. Therefore, it cannot perform the necessary interaction with the components of the cap-binding complex to interact with the ribosomes.
