<p>Polioviruses bind to the glycosylated surface protein CD155, which belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily. It possesses three immunoglobulin-like domains: an amino-terminal, variable V region, followed by two conserved C2 domains. There are four variants of CD155 that are generated by alternative splicing: CD155α and CD155δ are membrane-anchored forms and serve as receptors for polioviruses; CD155β and CD155γ are soluble isoforms. The three serotypes of poliovirus compete for the same attachment site, which is localized in the V domain of the receptor. The neighbouring C2 region seems to stabilize the appropriate structures needed to facilitate receptor binding.</p>
