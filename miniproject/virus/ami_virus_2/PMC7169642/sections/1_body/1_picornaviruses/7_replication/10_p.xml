<p>The cellular metabolism is strongly influenced by viral replication. The large number of newly synthesized viral genomes that are present in the cell shortly after infection and the high affinity of their IRES elements for cellular ribosomes result in the cellular translation machinery being involved exclusively in the synthesis of viral proteins. In addition, the 2A protease of poliovirus and rhinoviruses induces the degradation of p220 (eIF-4G), a member of the cap-binding complex that is essential for initiation of translation of eukaryotic mRNA molecules. This is a second mechanism for inhibition of cellular protein synthesis. The poliovirus 2B and 3A proteins influence both the transport and the secretion of cellular glycoproteins. Furthermore, as described above, proteolytic degradation of TFIIIC by 3C
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibits RNA polymerase III dependent transcription. Finally, even mRNA synthesis is blocked. In this case, a still unknown viral protein apparently affects the activity of RNA polymerase II. These processes are responsible for virus-host shutoff, i.e. the virus-mediated deactivation of the cellular metabolism.
