<p>The intracellular processes during viral replication and apoptosis lead to morphologic alterations of the cell structure, which can be microscopically observed as a cytopathic effect: the chromatin structure is disintegrated and nucleic acid/protein complexes accumulate at the inner side of the nuclear membrane. The cytoskeleton also undergoes alterations by structural rearrangements in proteins that are associated with the microtubules. The cells take on a rounded morphology. Numerous vesicles are formed in the cytoplasm during viral replication. Finally, the cell membranes change their permeability and become more permeable because of the incorporation of increased amounts of phosphocholine.</p>
