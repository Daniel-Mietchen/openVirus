<p>Coxsackieviruses bind to the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), also a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which is anchored in the cytoplasmic membrane by a hydrophobic domain in the carboxy-terminal region and exhibits two immunoglobulin-like domains. This cell surface protein, which is also used as a receptor by adenoviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19), is structurally and functionally similar to adhesion molecules. The amino-terminal domain of the CAR protein fits into the canyon on coxsackievirus capsids. Apart from the CAR protein, there are further cell surface proteins that can function as coreceptors for the various coxsackievirus types: some coxsackieviruses bind to ICAM-1 (coxsackieviruses A13, A18 and A21); coxsackievirus A9 interacts, like echovirus 9, with the vitronectin receptor, a protein that has been classified in the group of integrins (α
 <sub>v</sub>β
 <sub>3</sub>) within the immunoglobulin superfamily. Furthermore, echoviruses 1 and 5 as well as parechovirus 1 bind to integrin α
 <sub>2</sub>β
 <sub>1</sub>, which is also known as VLA-2. Other enteroviruses and echoviruses as well as Coxsackie B viruses use the surface protein CD55 (decay accelerating factor) as an additional interaction partner. This member of the immunoglobulin superfamily is responsible for protecting cells from lysis by the complement system. All these cell membrane proteins are expressed in different phases of leucocyte differentiation, and are involved in adhesion and recognition processes between different cell types. Another additional factor involved in the interaction between the host cell and coxsackievirus B3 is a protein with homology to nucleolin. This protein (110 kDa) is involved in the transport of ribosomal proteins from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, and is possibly also involved in attachment and penetration of adeno-associated adenovirus 2 (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20).
