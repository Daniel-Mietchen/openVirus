<p>So far, IRES sequences have been identified in the genomes of picornaviruses and pestiviruses and hepatitis C virus, which belong to the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec0014109" ref-type="sec">14.5</xref>). This sequence motif facilitates the translation of eukaryotic mRNA independently of both the 5′-cap structure and the cap-binding complex. Nevertheless, also a cellular gene was found to contain an IRES within the 5′ UTR of its mRNA: it encodes the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP; immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein; an alternative designation is 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, GRP-78). This protein is a protein-folding enzyme (chaperone) which is active in the ER and in the Golgi apparatus. It is involved in the interaction between light and heavy chains of immunoglobulins that leads to functional antibodies.
