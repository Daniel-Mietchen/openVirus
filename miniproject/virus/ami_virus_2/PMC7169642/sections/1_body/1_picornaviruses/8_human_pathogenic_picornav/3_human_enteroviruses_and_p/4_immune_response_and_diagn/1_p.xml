<p>During the course of the infection, virus-type-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies are produced, and have, in part, neutralizing properties. The IgG-mediated immune reaction is possibly boosted by cross-reacting epitopes during reinfections with other virus types. In individual cases, a protective effect of IgA antibodies on the gastrointestinal tract has been found. The IgM response plays only a minor role. Little is known about the influence of the cellular immune response on elimination of viruses; however, cytotoxic T cells seem to be responsible for the elimination of coxsackievirus B4 from the myocardium.</p>
