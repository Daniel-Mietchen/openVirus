<p>Pathohistologically, hyperaemia and oedema as well as intensified production of mucous secretion with threefold to fivefold increased protein content can be observed at the onset of the disease. The secretion contains a number of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 und IL-11 as well as chemokines such as IL-8, CCL5 (RANTES) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1; particularly IL-8 induces the migration of neutrophils, monocytes and dendritic cells to the infected regions. Bradykinin, lysylbradykinin and other vasoactive substances which increase vessel permeability are produced and secreted intensively like vascular endothelial growth factor. Altogether, the viral infection stimulates the local production of many inflammation mediators, and thus causes the typical symptoms.</p>
