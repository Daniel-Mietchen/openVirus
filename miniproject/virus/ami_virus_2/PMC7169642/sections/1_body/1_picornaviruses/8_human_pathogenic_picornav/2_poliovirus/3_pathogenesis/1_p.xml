<p>After being transmitted, polioviruses infect the lymphatic tissue of the gastrointestinal tract and proliferate in the lymphatic tissue of the nasopharyngeal region. They are transported through the stomach into the intestine, where they preferentially infect the Peyer plaques, which represent the lymphatic tissue of the small intestine, and the mesenteric lymph nodes. The viruses are released directly into the bloodstream or the intestine through the lymphatic vessels. The virus infects activated monocytes expressing CD155 (the poliovirus receptor), and proliferates within them. The consequence is a mild viraemia, which elicits an initial fever attack (preliminary disease, abortive polio). Subsequently, the viruses spread throughout the organism and proliferate in the reticulohistiocytic system as well as in endothelial cells; this process is associated with a second viraemia, in which neurons can be infected, leading to a retrograde progression of the infection penetrating further into the spinal cord and brain. Especially, the large anterior horn cells and the motor neurons are infected, resulting in damage to and destruction of these cells. Poliomyelitis arises by infection of the cell-rich grey matter of the brain (
 <italic>polios</italic> is Greek for “grey”). Muscle cells and brain regions that were formerly innervated by the infected nerves are no longer innervated. The consequences are flaccid paralyses. If they are lasting, then the musculature atrophies because of inactivity. Subsequently, destroyed neurons are removed by macrophages (neuronophagy). The motor neurons remain atrophic: even years after the acute disease, generation of new glial cells (gliosis) as well as mild inflammations can be observed. Patients with paralysis symptoms of the intercostal musculature can survive the acute phase only with the aid of an iron lung. Extirpation of the tonsils, which is usually performed at the time of epidemic poliomyelitis, and irritations of the musculature (by movement, injections, etc.) frequently lead to respiratory paralysis; in such cases, the virus reaches the medulla oblongata along the damaged nerve fibres, destroying there the respective motor neurons.
