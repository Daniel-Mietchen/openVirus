<p>Because of imported single infections with hepatitis A virus which have been acquired abroad, small epidemics repeatedly emerge also in Europe; occasionally larger mini epidemics can also be observed, and these can affect more than 100 people. For example, a German butcher was infected with hepatitis A virus during his holydays in the Canary Islands. Thereafter, he infected members of his family and at least five co-workers in the butcher’s shop in Germany. Apparently, there was contamination of sausage products with this very stable virus. In this way, more people were infected by foodstuff. Further hepatitis A virus infections emerged in small hospitals that were supplied by the contaminated butcher’s shop. After identification of the infection chain, public health authorities initiated appropriate measures to control the mini epidemics: This was followed by simultaneous active and passive vaccinations of the workers in the butcher’s shop, the exposed customers and the physicians involved. Furthermore, even effective chlorination of public swimming pools was performed. Additionally, relevant blood donor services were informed because hepatitis A viruses can also be transmitted by blood during the viraemic phase.</p>
