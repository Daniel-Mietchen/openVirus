<p>Today, human enteroviruses are subdivided into four species (A–D) and represent, together with the two serotypes of parechoviruses (originally known as echoviruses 22 and 23), a large number of infectious pathogens. Genetic recombination events between members of the same viral species are frequent and contribute to a broad range of virus variants. The viruses are distributed worldwide and their epidemiology resembles that of polioviruses as they are primarily transmitted via the faecal–oral route and less frequently by aerosol or airborne particles. Infections with human enteroviruses occur principally in the warm months (summer flu), but in tropical regions they occur throughout the year. Seven percent of examined individuals excrete such viruses in the USA, but in tropical regions a level of up to 50 % has been reported. Therefore, recurrent epidemics are reported particularly in tropical countries of Southeast Asia, where outbreaks of enterovirus 71 are frequent. This virus type is considered among the so-called non-polio enteroviruses as the virus whose infections most frequently lead to diseases. Coxsackieviruses cause diseases only in humans; however, after experimental infections of chimpanzees, the viruses induce a clinically inapparent infection. The original classification of coxsackieviruses into subgroup A (serotypes 1–22, 24) and subgroup B (six serotypes) was based on differences concerning the histopathological lesions that they cause in experimentally infected newborn mice. Today the cultivation of coxsackieviruses is also possible in vitro (monkey kidney cells, human HeLa cells or human A549 lung carcinoma cells).</p>
