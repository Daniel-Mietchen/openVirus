<p>In the course of a poliovirus infection, IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies are produced against both capsid and non-structural proteins. Cross-reactivity between the three poliovirus types can only be observed by using heat-denaturated viruses. Reinfections lead to a new increase of antibody concentrations. Immunoglobulins against specific epitopes of structural proteins are neutralizing, and are measured in three discretely performed neutralization tests (polioviruses 1â€“3). Polioviruses can easily be cultivated in cell cultures (e.g. in primary monkey kidney cells, HeLa cells or Vero cells). The typing of isolates from faeces, pharyngeal lavage or cerebrospinal fluid is performed by neutralization tests using type-specific sera. This is the only way to reliably determine prevalence rates or increasing titres. In appropriate cases, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can alternatively be applied for viral genome detection and for identification of mutants. For such purposes, a pan-enterovirus PCR analysis is performed as a preliminary screening test and facilitates the identification of all human enteroviruses.</p>
