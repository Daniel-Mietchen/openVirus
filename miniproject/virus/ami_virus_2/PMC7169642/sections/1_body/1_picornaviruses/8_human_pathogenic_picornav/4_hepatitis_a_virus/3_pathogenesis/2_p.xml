<p>Initially, hepatitis A virus proliferates very slowly in infected patients; the incubation period lasts several weeks until the appearance of the first symptoms, which indicate liver cell destruction. Infected liver cells synthesize only marginal amounts of interferon-α (IFN-α) and IFN-β, with the consequence of a delayed activation of the host immune response. Phosphorylation and activation of IRF-3 is inhibited. IRF-3 activation is usually achieved by the signal transduction cascades induced either by activation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) or the RIG helicase by double-stranded RNA molecules (see 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_7 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_8) which arise during the replication cycle of hepatitis A viruses. The viral non-structural protein 2B seems to block this process. Therefore, the synthesis of IFN-β is inhibited in infected cells, and the virus is able to proliferate largely uninfluenced by the immune system during the early infection.</p>
