<p>During hepatitis A virus infection, IgM antibodies are already present in serum at the onset of the clinical disease. IgG antibodies against capsid proteins, and to a lesser extent also against non-structural proteins, are subsequently produced, and persist lifelong. Both IgM and IgG antibodies are capable of neutralizing the virus; they account for the control of viral proliferation and for the rapid decrease of the viral titre in blood and faeces. Neutralizing antibodies target specific domains on the capsid surface of hepatitis A virus particles. They form an immunodominant region, which involves amino acids 102â€“114 of VP1 and the amino acid at position 70 of VP3. Another VP1-specific epitope has been characterized around residue 221. Diagnosis of acute infection is performed by detecting viral RNA genomes in blood and stool by PCR as well as by detecting specific IgM antibodies in the serum. The presence of IgG indicates a past infection. As usual for each type of hepatitis, the transaminase and bilirubin levels are additionally determined.</p>
