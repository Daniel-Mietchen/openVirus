<p>The poliovirus vaccine (oral polio vaccine) that was developed by Albert Sabin is an attenuated live vaccine. Only 0.4â€“1.0 cases of reactions per million vaccinations have been observed. This vaccine induces the generation of virus-neutralizing IgG and IgA antibodies. Its efficiency has been demonstrated, for example, in the control of ongoing polio epidemics (outbreak-control immunization). It is hoped that poliovirus infections can be eradicated in the coming years by the consequent and worldwide application of this vaccine, particularly in developing countries. However, because of the possibility that polio infection symptoms can appear (vaccination-induced polio), this live vaccine must not be used in people with humoral immunodeficiencies (e.g. agammaglobulinaemia), or in patients who are immunocompromised owing to medicament usage, infections or for hereditary reasons. Since the vaccine virus is temporarily excreted in the faeces of vaccinated individuals, it can be transmitted to other members of the family; immunosuppressed individuals are particularly endangered.</p>
