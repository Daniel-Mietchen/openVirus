<p>The uptake of human enteroviruses and their spread throughout the organism are similar to those for polioviruses. After initial proliferation in (the) intestinal and pharyngeal lymphatic tissues, the viruses are transported by the blood system as free virus particles or by infected lymphocytes during the second viraemic phase into the different target organs; these include the musculature, skin, meninges, myocardium, intestinal epithelia, central nervous system and respiratory system, where they settle, depending on the virus type. The molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of the different symptoms are largely unknown. Besides hyperaemia, the following have been found in the conjunctiva of patients infected with enterovirus 70: dot-shaped bleedings (petechiae) and haemorrhages as well as infiltrations with mononuclear cells with diffuse distributed lymphocytes, which develop into striking large and swollen lymph follicles. In such cases, the cornea can be affected by epithelial opacity. Flaccid paralysis symptoms, which rarely occur during infections with enterovirus 70, are associated with degeneration of motor neurons, with haemorrhages and with neuroglial proliferation. The presence of viral proteins in microglia and neurons was demonstrated by immunofluorescence.</p>
