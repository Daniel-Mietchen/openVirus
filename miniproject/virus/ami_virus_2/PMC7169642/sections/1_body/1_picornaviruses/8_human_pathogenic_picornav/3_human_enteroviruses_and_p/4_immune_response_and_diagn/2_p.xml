<p>Human enterovirus infections are diagnosed by isolation of the virus and subsequent in vitro neutralization assays or by detection of viral RNA by PCR in faeces, urine, pharyngeal lavage, cerebrospinal fluid or eye secretions. Antibodies can be detected by virus-specific neutralization tests. Some viruses possess haemagglutination properties, which can be used for diagnosis. Because of the high prevalence, cross-reactions are frequent; therefore, ELISAs are only applicable for primary infections and often do not provide information about the virus type.</p>
