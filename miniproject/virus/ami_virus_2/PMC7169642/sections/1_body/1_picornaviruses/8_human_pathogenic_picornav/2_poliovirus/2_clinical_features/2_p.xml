<p>In recent years, the phenomenon of the so-called post-polio syndrome has been observed. The symptoms emerge 15â€“40 years after the occurrence of the original polio disease. It is a recurrent progressive myasthenia in association with muscle pain, joint aches and severe fatigue. It is believed that originally hardly damaged or also undamaged neural cells die owing to permanent strain, thus leading to the syndrome; many cases of such late complications are expected in the USA.</p>
