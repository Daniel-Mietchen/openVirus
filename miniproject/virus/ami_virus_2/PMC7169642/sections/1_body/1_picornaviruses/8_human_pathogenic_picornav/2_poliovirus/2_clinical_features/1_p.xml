<p>The vast majority of poliovirus infections are asymptomatic. After an incubation period of 1–2 weeks, only a few cases of poliovirus infection lead to stomach and intestinal disorders, followed by fever and flu-like symptoms, which typically resemble summer influenza. Most patients recover completely from this type of poliovirus infection (abortive polio). Approximately 1–2 % of patients subsequently develop a non-paralytic poliovirus infection; in such cases the virus infects the central nervous system, causing aseptic meningitis accompanied by muscle cramps and back pain, which may persist for about 2–10 days. In up to 2 % of patients, this illness is subsequently accompanied by symptoms of flaccid paralysis because the anterior horn cells are damaged (paralytic poliovirus infection). Approximately 10 % of these patients have a lethal outcome, e.g. due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles; about a further 10 % recover without lasting health impairments; however, in around 80 % of cases, paralyses of different magnitudes remain as permanent injury.</p>
