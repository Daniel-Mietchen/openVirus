<p>Five to 10 days after the infection, IgM, IgG und IgA antibodies against viral proteins can be found in secretions and blood. Whereas IgG is detectable for several years, IgA can be detected for only a few months; particularly IgA mediates protection against reinfections, but only against the same virus type. Most people produce CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, which exhibit cross-reactivity with epitopes of various rhinovirus types. Nothing is known about the occurrence of cytotoxic T cells. Diagnosis is performed only clinically. Antibody determination and virus detection are not done in routine diagnostics.
