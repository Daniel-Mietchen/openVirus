<p>Vaccines based on in vitro cultivated and formalin-inactivated hepatitis A viruses confer very good protection after two immunizations. Whether the vaccine can last lifelong or whether subsequent booster immunizations are necessary cannot yet be definitely assessed. In fact, the vaccine against hepatitis A is considered as very effective. Current studies based on 10–12 years of vaccination experience have revealed that protecting antibodies have been detected in more than 95 % of all vaccinated individuals. Mathematical calculations predict a persistence of more than 25 years for vaccine-induced antibodies in more than 95 % of all vaccinated individuals.</p>
