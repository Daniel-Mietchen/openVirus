<p>The attenuated virus of the live vaccine against poliovirus 1 differs from the wild-type virus by 57 mutated nucleotides, which lead to 21 alterations in the amino acid sequence. In comparison with the wild type, the vaccine virus of poliovirus 3 exhibits ten mutations. However, the mutations that lead to the attenuation of poliovirus 2 are still unknown because the source virus for the vaccine strain has not been identified so far. Especially mutations in the nucleotide sequence of the IRES region seem to be responsible for the attenuation effect (positions 480, 481 and 472 in vaccine strains Sabin 1, 2 and 3, respectively). They influence the stability of the secondary structure of the IRES element, and consequently the association with the ribosomes, thereby affecting the effectiveness of translation. In addition, the attenuated vaccine strains exhibit mutations in genome sequences that encode for the capsid protein VP1. In this respect, vaccine polioviruses 1 and 3 exhibit 12 and two amino acid substitutions, respectively, which contribute to attenuation. In countries where poliovirus infections no longer occur, the live vaccine has not been used since 1999. The risk of acquiring a vaccine-induced poliomyelitis from the attenuated virus in such countries is higher than the risk of contracting the disease by a natural polio infection. A vaccine based on inactivated polioviruses was developed by Jonas Salk a few years before the live vaccine was developed. An improved variant of this vaccine with an enhanced antigen content is available and is now applied for basic immunizations. This inactivated vaccine is also able to induce the production of IgG antibodies. Booster vaccinations are recommended especially when travelling to developing countries (in Asia and Africa).</p>
