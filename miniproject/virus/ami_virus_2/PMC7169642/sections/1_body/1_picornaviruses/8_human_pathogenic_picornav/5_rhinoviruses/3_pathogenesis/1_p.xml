<p>Rhinoviruses invade the body through the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract, where they bind to their cellular receptors by the canyon structures. Rhinovirus replication has adapted to the temperature of the mucosae (32–33 °C) and proceeds very fast. Progeny viruses are released by cell lysis 8–10 h after infection of epithelial cells. Maximum viral titres are found after 2–3 days. Release of the virus decreases approximately 4 days after infection. With the scanning electron microscope one can see that large quantities of cells are shed from the ciliated epithelium. This is directly caused by the cell-damaging effect of the virus, and is an ideal basis for bacterial superinfections.</p>
