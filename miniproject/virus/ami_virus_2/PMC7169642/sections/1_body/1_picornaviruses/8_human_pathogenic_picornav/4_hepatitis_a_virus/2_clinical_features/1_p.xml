<p>The incubation period until the appearance of the first symptoms lasts 3â€“6 weeks. The principal symptom of a hepatitis A virus infection is liver inflammation with jaundice (icterus), which arises by the transfer of bile salts (bilirubin) into the blood (hyperbilirubinaemia) and their elimination in the urine. The disease is, especially in children, usually inapparent, i.e. without symptoms. Jaundice symptoms begin suddenly, and are accompanied by nausea, fever and a general state of sickness that can continue for several weeks; particularly in older adults, occasionally there are also fulminant forms that can have a lethal outcome owing to cirrhosis and severe hepatic failure. The hepatitis A virus genome can be detected in the faeces by PCR even several weeks after remission of symptoms. In immunosuppressed patients, it is detectable for a considerably longer time. Persistent infections have not been observed.</p>
