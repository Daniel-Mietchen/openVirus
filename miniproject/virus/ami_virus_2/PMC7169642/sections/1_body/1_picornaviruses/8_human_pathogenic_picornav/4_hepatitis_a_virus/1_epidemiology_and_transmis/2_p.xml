<p>The virus is very stable against environmental influences and is excreted in large amounts in the faeces of infected individuals during the incubation period of 3–6 weeks. The virus is primarily transmitted via the faecal–oral route, by contact with dirt or smears as well as by contaminated food and drinking water. In rare cases, the infection can be transmitted by blood and saliva of ill people during viraemia. The virus is frequently transmitted among residents of asylums and retirement homes, among drug-addicted individuals, but also in kindergartens, vacation camps and in population groups with low socio-economic status.</p>
