<p>The incubation period of human enterovirus infections lasts up to 2 weeks until the onset of the disease, and in rare cases more than 4 weeks. The viruses are excreted through the throat and the intestine for several weeks. The infections are characterized by a broad spectrum of different clinical manifestations. It is not possible to make unambiguous correlations between individual virus types and a particular clinical manifestation: different virus types can cause the same symptoms, whereas the same virus type can frequently be associated with many different symptoms. Patients are often simultaneously infected with several virus types; therefore, it is difficult to associate individual virus types with specific clinical pictures or symptoms. Human enteroviruses generally cause mild, cold-like illnesses, which can be associated with diarrhoea (“summer flu”); many infections are asymptomatic. Severe courses with neurological symptoms, meningitis, gastroenteritis, hand, foot and mouth disease, acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, myalgia, myocarditis, pleurodynia (Bornholm disease) or uveitis are only rarely observed. Patients with inherited or acquired immunological deficiencies frequently develop persistent infections, which can be associated with chronic enteritis, arthritis or meningoencephalitis. Meningitis is the predominant clinical picture in severe infections with human enteroviruses. In addition to herpesviruses, enteroviruses are considered the most frequent viral pathogens for meningitis and encephalitis. Coxsackie B viruses, particularly type B3, are believed to be the pathogen of viral myocarditis (perimyocarditis). Infantile myocarditis is frequently lethal in newborn babies. It occurs predominantly by infections acquired during delivery, when the mother has not produced antibodies against the coxsackievirus. Besides such acute forms, chronic disease types (dilatative cardiomyopathy) are also seen, especially in adults.</p>
