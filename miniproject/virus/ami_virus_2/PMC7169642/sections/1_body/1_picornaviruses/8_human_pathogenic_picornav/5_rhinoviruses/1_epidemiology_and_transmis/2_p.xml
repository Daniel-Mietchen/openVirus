<p>Rhinovirus infections appear especially in both the spring and the autumn. Presumably, they cause 40Â % of all acute infections of the respiratory tract. Every person experiences one to three rhinovirus infections per year, the number decreasing with increasing age. Rhinovirus infections cause high morbidity and have great economic importance because of the associated loss of working hours. Transmission generally occurs indirectly by contact with contaminated hands or door handles and only seldom by aerosols or droplets. Rhinoviruses spread rapidly within families, kindergartens and schools.</p>
