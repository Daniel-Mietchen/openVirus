<p>Vaccines against rhinovirus infections are not available. Because of the large number of different virus types, the development of vaccines is very difficult. It is possible to avoid a rhinovirus infection by application of interferon. However, a long-term interferon therapy should not be performed owing to the associated injuries to mucous membranes. Pleconaril, which embeds within the canyon structures of virus particles, can decrease the infection, but it also induces the fast formation of resistant viruses, so administration of this substance seems to be futile.</p>
