<p>Human rhinoviruses infect only humans. However, they can be transmitted to some ape species and ferrets. There are more than 100 serotypes, and these are classified into groups A and B. Another classification is based on receptor binding: 90 members of the rhinoviruses (major group) bind to ICAM-1 as a cellular receptor, whereas the rest (minor group) bind to the LDL receptor. Rhinoviruses 54 and 89 use heparan sulphate for attachment to host cells. Several serotypes exist simultaneously in a single virus population.</p>
