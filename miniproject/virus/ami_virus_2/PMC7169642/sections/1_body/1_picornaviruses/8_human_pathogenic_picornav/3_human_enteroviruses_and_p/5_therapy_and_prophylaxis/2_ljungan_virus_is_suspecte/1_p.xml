<p>Human parechoviruses have a global distribution and cause, like human enteroviruses, disorders of the respiratory system and the gastrointestinal tract; severe diseases are only rarely observed. A species closely related to human parechoviruses is Ljungan virus, which is endemic in bank voles (
 <italic>Clethrionomys glareolus</italic>), especially in northern Sweden. These rodents appear in intervals of 3–4 years in large quantities and trek into barns and houses in autumn. The viruses are excreted in faeces and urine and can be transmitted to humans. Zoonotic transmissions to pregnant women are suspected of causing intrauterine fetal death in the late phase of gestation. In a Swedish study, viral genomes were detected in the placenta and in the brain of deceased fetuses in nearly 50 % of all cases examined.
