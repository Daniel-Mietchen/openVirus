<p>The transmission of hepatitis A virus by contaminated mussels is known. In some regions of the world, untreated domestic sewage is released into rivers, lakes and seas. Since in such countries infections with hepatitis A viruses are frequent, this stable virus can reach the natural environment in this way. Mussels that grow in seas containing contaminated sewage near large towns are effectively able to filtrate the viruses from the surrounding water, thus leading to accumulation and concentration of the virus in the mussels. If such mussels are insufficiently heated during the cooking process, the virus is transmitted to the gastrointestinal tract after consumption of infected mussels.</p>
