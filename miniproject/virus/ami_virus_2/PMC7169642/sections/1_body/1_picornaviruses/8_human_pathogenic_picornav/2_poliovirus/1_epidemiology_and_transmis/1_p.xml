<p>Poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) was known as long ago as 1,500 BC. Major epidemics appeared especially when there were large numbers of susceptible individuals within a population, e.g. in the years between 1940 and 1950. Many of the infected children died, whereas in other cases the consequences were lifelong paralysis symptoms. Some children survived the poliovirus infection only by temporary placement in an iron lung, which allowed breathing for a limited period of time. Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the USA from 1933 to 1945, was infected with poliovirus as an adult, and had lifelong muscular dysfunctions.</p>
