<p>During past centuries, poliovirus infections were widespread and occurred mostly during the first 6 months of life under the protection of the maternal IgG antibodies, which are transferred through the placenta. Children did not become ill if they were infected in this early stage of life, but they developed an active immune protection. Later contacts with the poliovirus led to diseases only in children who had not experienced such an infection in that early period of life, because of the now lacking maternal immune protection. All in all, less than 1Â % of all seronegative children became ill with poliomyelitis after contact with the virus. These data indicate that poliovirus is not highly neuroinvasive. Indeed, non-paralytic poliovirus infections were the most frequent reason for summer flu. With the increase of living standards, the first contact with poliovirus has been postponed to an advanced age; thus, the infantile paralysis became an adult paralysis.</p>
