<p>In the case of coxsackievirus infections, there is a primary infiltration of granulocytes, and this is followed by infiltration of mononuclear cells. The infected muscles exhibit focally necroses and the cells are disintegrated in a clod-like pattern. Necrotic areas can also be observed in neurons and glial cells of the central nervous system. After in vitro infection with coxsackievirus B3, monocytes release the cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6. These are probably involved in the inflammation reaction. The chronic persistent myocarditis associated with coxsackievirus infections is characterized by significant lower quantities of infiltrating cells. Only single muscle cells disintegrate. Coxsackievirus RNA can be detected in heart muscle. Apparently, in this case the ratio between positive-sense and negative-sense RNA molecules is shifted to 2:1, whereas usually a larger excess of genomic RNA molecules is present in infected cells. In such cases, only a few viral genomes are synthesized and also the number of infectious coxsackieviruses is clearly lower in chronically infected regions. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is often diagnosed after infections with coxsackievirus B4, is probably triggered by autoimmune processes. There is evidence that similarities between viral proteins and cellular glutamate decarboxylase may be involved.</p>
