<p>FMD virus is considered as a prototype of the genus 
 <italic>Aphthovirus</italic>. It is acid-sensitive and infects all cloven-hoofed animals; that means in Europe it infects cattle, small ruminants such as sheep and goats, including endemic and exotic ruminants (deer and also antelopes and wild cattle in zoos), and domestic swine and boars.
