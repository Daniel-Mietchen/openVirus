<p>The infection confers a serotype-specific immunity. It is believed that it does not last lifelong. The diagnosis is performed by propagation of the virus in cell culture, preferentially in baby hamster kidney cells or in diverse primary and permanent bovine cell lines. Subsequently, the virus serotype can be determined by using specific antibodies in ELISAs or by means of the complement fixation reaction. Alternatively, the serotype analysis is performed by PCR followed by sequencing of the amplified fragments.</p>
