<p>Other picornaviruses (various types of enterovirus and encephalomyocarditis virus) can induce fertility disorders or general diseases in swine, but these are relatively rare today. A formerly very important viral disease in swine is induced by porcine teschoviruses. They cause, in rare cases, a polioencephalitis in swine which largely resembles the poliovirus-induced poliomyelitis in humans. An antigenetically very similar strain of porcine teschoviruses (Talfan virus) has a substantially lower virulence. Generally, its infection is clinically inapparent, but it induces a resilient, protective cross-immunity against the virulent techovirus. Talfan virus is spread worldwide in swine populations. Therefore, clinical cases of Teschen disease are only rarely observed owing to the high infection rate of Talfan virus.</p>
