<p>Infected animals excrete the viruses before the appearance of the first clinical symptoms during an incubation period of a few days. The typical aphthae appear in the planum nasolabiale of cattle as well as in the planum rostrale and in the tongue of swine, in the coronary band of the hoofs and in distinct mucosal regions of the gastrointestinal tract, e.g. in the rumina of cattle. The aphthae contain large quantities of viruses. Whereas alterations in the planum nasolabiale and in the mucous membranes of the gastrointestinal tract are the main symptoms in cattle, inflammation of the coronary band (coronitis) is usually the prevalent symptom in swine. The morbidity is high, but the mortality is low. The virus can persist in infected cattle or sheep for several weeks.</p>
