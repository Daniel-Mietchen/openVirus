<p>Of further epidemiological importance is the fact that there are different serotypes of FMD virus, and against which the infected animals do not develop cross-immunity – similarly to what is found in human infections with the three different poliovirus serotypes. Besides the seven serotypes – O (Oise), A (Allemagne), C, Asia 1 and SAT (South African Territories) 1–3 – there are numerous subtypes, whose infections induce partially only a slight cross-immunity. This antigen diversity plays an important role in the control of FMD.</p>
