<p>The virus is transmitted by droplet infections. It is relatively stable and contagious, so under favourable climatic conditions infections can be spread through the air even over long distances. This was demonstrated during an FMD outbreak on the Isle of Wight in 1981. Starting from the French mainland, the viruses were transmitted to the island over the English Channel. The distance is 250 km. Inasmuch as the virus is also excreted in milk, transmission to swine is also possible by feeding with milk products from infected cattle. The virus is acid-labile; therefore, it is inactivated in the meat of slaughtered animals after sufficiently long meat maturation. However, it remains infectious over extended periods of time in insufficiently salted and smocked raw sausages. Hence, it can be transmitted by such products that are prepared from infected animals.</p>
