<p>A large number of picornaviruses have been described in various animal species and they induce a broad spectrum of diseases. FMD virus is of eminent economic importance, and can infect all ungulates (ruminants and swine). For the differential diagnosis of FMD, swine vesicular disease virus plays an important role in pigs. This virus is a member of porcine enterovirus B and causes a disease in swine that is clinically indistinguishable from FMD. Swine vesicular disease virus is acid-resistant, and is predominantly transmitted by meat products from infected swine. It remains infectious for several months in non-heated meat products such as raw sausages (e.g. salami). Diagnosis is performed by cultivation of the virus or PCR, as well as by antibody detection.</p>
