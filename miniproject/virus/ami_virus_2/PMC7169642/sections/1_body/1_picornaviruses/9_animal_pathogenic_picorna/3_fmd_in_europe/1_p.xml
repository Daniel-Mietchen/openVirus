<p>Most countries in Europe and all countries of the European Union were free from FMD for many years. This status was essentially achieved by stringent measures in cases of epidemic outbreaks and by the extensive annual vaccination of all cattle older than 6 months from the reference date. In 1991, vaccination was stopped because the virus was eradicated within the countries of the European Union and the control of FMD was uniformly implemented throughout the European Union. From then, only sporadic outbreaks were registered until 2001, e.g. in Italy in 1993 and 1994 and in Greece in 1996. However, a massive FMD outbreak occurred in the UK in 2001. The virus (serotype 01) was probably introduced by infected pork from Asia which was used as animal food. After the initial porcine infection cycle, the virus was mainly spread by infected sheep, a species which develops only mild symptoms. Nearly 10,000 farmsteads were affected in the UK by January 2002. More than four million cloven-hoofed animals (cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and deer) were killed in the course of veterinary measures. From England, the virus was only sporadically transmitted to other countries, and the outbreaks (25 in the Netherlands, two in France and one in Ireland) were rapidly controlled by culling, and partially also by ring vaccinations. From 21 January 2002, Europe was considered to be free from FMD once more. However, on 2 August 2007, new cases of FMD emerged in southern England, and further cases were also diagnosed in the surrounding cattle farms a little later. During this outbreak, the agent was FMD virus strain BFS 1860 O1 1967 (British Field Strain 1860, serotype O, subtype 1, isolated in 1967), which was cultivated in the immediate vicinity of the Pirbright Laboratory of the Institute for Animal Health for the purpose of vaccination. Most probably, a laboratory virus escaped through old and leaky sewage systems into the environment. Owing to the rapid action of the relevant authorities, the setting up of security zones and the culling of all infected livestock, the virus was contained rapidly.</p>
