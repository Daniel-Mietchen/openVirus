<p>In addition to the structural proteins and enzymes already mentioned, further protein components are located within the sequence of the polyprotein, and are generated by the activity of the 3C protease during the infection cycle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00142" ref-type="fig">14.2</xref>). The very small 3B component was mentioned already; it constitutes Vpg, which is covalently linked to the 5′ terminus of the viral genome. The Vpg sequence is repeated three times in the polyprotein of aphthoviruses. The direct precursor of Vpg is 3AB. It is generally accepted that 3AB is anchored to intracellular membranes (e.g. endoplasmic reticulum, ER, membrane) by a hydrophobic amino acid sequence present in the 3A moiety. The tyrosine residue at position 3 of the 3B domain becomes uridylylated and functions as a primer for initiation of RNA synthesis during genome replication. Directly following uridylylation, the 3C protease cleaves the precursor at the cleavage site between 3A and 3B, leading to the release of Vpg from membrane anchoring. Mutations within the hydrophobic domain of the 3A protein inhibit uridylylation and RNA synthesis.
