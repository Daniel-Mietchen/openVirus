<p>During the replication cycle of picornaviruses, the positive-sense RNA genome is transcribed into an intermediate, negative-sense RNA molecule, which, in turn, serves as a template for the synthesis of positive-sense progeny RNA genomes (for details, see Sect.Â 
 <xref rid="Sec001413" ref-type="sec">14.1.4</xref>). The synthesis of an RNA molecule by using an RNA template is a process that does not exist in cellular nucleic acid synthesis; hence, cells do not possess enzymes that can perform such (synthesis) reactions. For this reason, it is essential for picornaviruses to possess the genetic information encoding their own RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This enzyme is located at the carboxy terminus of the polyprotein and is represented by the 3D region on the precursor molecule; the intermediate product 3CD
 <sup>pro</sup>, which is generated by proteolytic cleavage, possesses protease activity but no polymerase activity. The length of the 3D polymerase (3D
 <sup>pol</sup>) ranges between 460 amino acids in rhinoviruses and 491 amino acids in hepatitis A virus. The error rate of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases is relatively high, as has been demonstrated for 3D
 <sup>pol</sup> of poliovirus. On average, it causes one error per 2,200 polymerized nucleotides during synthesis of RNA chains. This implies that every newly synthesized RNA strand contains approximately four mutations.
