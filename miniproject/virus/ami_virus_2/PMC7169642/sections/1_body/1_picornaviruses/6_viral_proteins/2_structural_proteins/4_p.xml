<p>In 1985, when Michael Rossmann, James Hogle and their respective co-workers published the protein structure of the rhinovirus and poliovirus capsids, they revealed not only the above-mentioned common characteristics, but also further structural features that result from folding and reciprocal interactions between the components. They found a ditch-like groove or crevice of approximately 25 Å in depth on the surface of rhinovirus B (type 14) particles which surrounds the vertices of the icosahedron and arises from the structures and interactions between different amino acid residues of VP1, VP2 and VP3. This structure, which Rossmann denominated “canyon”, has been found in all picornaviruses, excepting in hepatitis A virus and FMD virus. The amino acids that line the walls of the canyon with their functional side groups facilitate binding of the respective virus particles to their specific cellular receptors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00141" ref-type="fig">14.1a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig00141" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Owing to their size, neutralizing antibodies are not able to penetrate into the canyon to impede binding of the virus to its specific cellular receptor. However, they can bind to epitopes on the upper surface of the particles located near the entrances to the canyons, thus indirectly impeding attachment of the virus by steric hindrance. Because of antibody binding, surface regions are exposed to a selection pressure that leads to a certain variability of the exposed amino acids, and to the development of differing capsid variants. On the other hand, the actual receptor binding site within the canyon does not underlie such a selection mechanism and remains unaffected, thus preserving the cell specificity of the corresponding virus type.
