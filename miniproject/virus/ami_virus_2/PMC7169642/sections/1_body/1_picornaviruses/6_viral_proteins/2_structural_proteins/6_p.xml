<p>The emergence of different serotypes that retain cell specificity is particularly pronounced in rhinoviruses, which comprise more than 100 different stable serotypes, which are especially characterized by the fact that neutralizing antibodies against them are strongly type-specific and cannot bind to the cell surface of other serotypes. Therefore, after a cold, people are protected against further infections with the same rhinovirus serotype, but not against other serotypes, which can continuously lead to recurrent colds. Such a plethora of different serotypes does not exist among enteroviruses. Poliovirus has three serotypes, and hepatitis A virus has only one serotype. The high genetic stability of enteroviruses, parechoviruses and hepatoviruses is probably correlated with the strong acid resistance of their capsids, which are able to survive in the acid environment of the stomach. Indeed, only a few amino acid sequences are capable of conferring such high acid stability, which, however, strongly limits the variability.</p>
