<p>In hepatoviruses and parechoviruses, the activity of the 3C protease, which recognizes the amino acid sequence glutamine–glycine, is responsible for all proteolytic reactions in the precursor protein which lead to the generation of the single components from the polyprotein; in enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, cardioviruses and aphthoviruses, the 3C protease is also responsible for all proteolytic reactions except the cleavage of the protomer, which is performed by the 2A protease. Exceptions are the processing of VP0 to VP4 and VP2 during viral maturation by the enzymatic activity of VP2 and the cleavage of VP1/2A by a cellular protease in hepatitis A virus. The 3C protease domain is located at the carboxy-terminal region of the polyprotein and comprises 182 amino acids in poliovirus and rhinoviruses, and 217 residues in hepatitis A virus (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab00143" ref-type="table">14.3</xref>). In a first reaction step, an intramolecular amino-terminal cleavage reaction occurs in front of the 3C moiety. The resulting intermediate product, 3CD
 <sup>pro</sup>, exhibits proteolytic activity. The 3D moiety present in 3CD
 <sup>pro</sup> is indeed essential for processing the protomer into capsid proteins, because an efficient cleavage between VP3 and VP1 is only possible when the 3D domain is still linked with the 3C protease (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00142" ref-type="fig">14.2</xref>). The cleavage of 3CD
 <sup>pro</sup> into 3C and 3D occurs intermolecularly (in 
 <italic>trans</italic>), i.e. active intermediate 3CD products interact and perform a reciprocal cleavage reaction.
