<p>The structural analyses also revealed the existence of a small hole-like cavity beneath the canyon floor. The cavity (pocket) is accessible from the canyon floor by a pore and has an additional connection to the inside of the particle. It contains a sphingosine-like fatty acid molecule, the “pocket factor”. It is removed from the pocket during structural rearrangements of capsid proteins which are triggered upon receptor binding. During this process, VP4 is lost as an inside-associated protein, leading to destabilization of the virus particle, which facilitates the release of the RNA genome into the cytoplasm through the vertices of the receptor-associated icosahedron. Knowledge of the predominantly hydrophobic amino acids that line the cavity facilitated the development of therapeutically active and optimally adapted drugs such as pleconaril (see 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_9) that stabilize virus particles and inhibit the release of the RNA genome. Therefore, the use of such compounds can prevent or at least restrict viral infections. Nevertheless, it also soon became apparent that viruses are rapidly able to develop resistances.</p>
