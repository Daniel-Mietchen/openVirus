<p>The 2C protein (length of 317 amino acids in aphthoviruses, 330 amino acids in rhinoviruses, 335 amino acids in hepatitis A virus) possesses an NTP-binding site and ATPase activity. It appears to be involved in initiation of RNA synthesis. In poliovirus and FMD virus, mutations in the 2C gene lead to resistance against guanidine hydrochloride and benzimidazole derivatives, two effective inhibitors of viral RNA synthesis. The amino acids phenylalanine and asparagine at positions 164 and 179 (as well as their corresponding substitutions with tyrosine and glycine) seem to be important for the acquirement of resistance. Mutations within the NTP-binding site are lethal for the viruses. Furthermore, there is evidence that 2C
 <sup>ATPase</sup> may act as a chaperone in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes, which must be formed during the replication of the viral genomes. In this connection, the 2C protein might promote the coordinated interaction of the cloverleaf structure at the 5′ terminus, with the 3′ UTR sequences, the poly(A) tail, the
