<p>CD155 is expressed in many cells of various tissues. The membrane-anchored variants CD155α and CD155δ are associated with proteins of the extracellular matrix, e.g. vitronectin and nectin-3. In addition, CD155α and CD155δ are associated with α
 <sub>v</sub> integrins in the cytoplasmic membrane. These properties characterize CD155 as a cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion molecule, which is linked with the cadherin adhesion system. The cytoplasmic domain of CD155α and CD155δ is associated with the protein Tctex-1, which is a subunit of the dynein motor protein complex. This protein is synthesized in all neurons, including the motor neurons of the spine. Possibly, this interaction may be important for the retrograde transport of polioviruses into the neurons, and thereby for the pathogenesis of poliomyelitis.
