<p>Besides the classical structural proteins, there are many products that are also detectable in the virus particles. They are encoded by the small reading frames within the structural gene region at the 3′ half of the genome. These include proteins 3a, 7a, and 7b, and the ORF6 protein. These are predominantly gene products with accessory functions: deletions of the corresponding genes do not fundamentally affect the infectiveness or the replicative capacity in vitro. Presumably, these proteins have important roles as virulence factors for infecting humans or animals. Little is known with regard to the function of these proteins (Table
