<p>The E protein (9â€“12 kDa) is found within infectious virus particles in different concentrations; it is necessary for particle assembly and morphogenesis. In some coronaviruses (mouse hepatitis virus and SARS-related coronavirus), the E protein has a proapoptotic function. Furthermore, it seems that E protein acts as viroporin, forming ion channels and altering the membrane permeability.</p>
