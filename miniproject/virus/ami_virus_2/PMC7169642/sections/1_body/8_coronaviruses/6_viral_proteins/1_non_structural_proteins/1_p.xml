<p>The viral genome serves as mRNA for the synthesis of the precursor proteins pp1a and pp1ab (486 and 790 kDa, respectively, in SARS-related coronavirus). To synthesize pp1ab, a ribosomal frameshift is necessary to skip the stop codon at the end of open reading frame1a. This occurs because of a defined secondary RNA structure, which forms a stem loop at the end of the first reading frame. The large, experimentally not isolable precursor protein pp1ab is autocatalytically cleaved by the activity of the proteases into 13–16 cleavage products, depending on the various virus types. The function of the resulting non-structural proteins has not been ascertained in all cases. The best investigated activities are those of the non-structural proteins NSP1–NSP16 in SARS-related coronavirus; here, there is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NSP12) that is required for both replication of the viral RNA genome and synthesis of subgenomic mRNAs. It constitutes part of the large precursor protein pp1ab along with the RNA helicase (NSP13) that probably binds Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions, an exoribonuclease (NSP14), an endoribonuclease (NSP15) and a 2′-
 <italic>O</italic>-ribose methyltransferase (NSP16). SARS-related coronavirus includes in precursor protein pp1a (486 kDa), which is cleaved in this virus into 11 proteins (NSP1–NSP11), the sequence of papain-like protease 2 (PL2
 <sup>pro</sup>; NSP3) and an enzyme that resembles the 3C protease of picornaviruses (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, NSP5). The enzyme 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> constitutes the most active protease and is responsible for 11 of the cleavage reactions in the precursor polyprotein. These two proteases are present in all coronaviruses. Most of them contain an additional papain-like cysteine protease (PL1
 <sup>pro</sup>) at the amino terminus of pp1a and pp1ab, which autocatalytically cleaves an amino-terminal domain from these polyproteins. Its function is not completely understood (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab001419" ref-type="table">14.19</xref>). In SARS-related coronavirus, instead of this proteolytic activity of non-structural protein NSP1, there is a function that interferes with the metabolism of the cells and causes the degradation of cellular mRNAs, including the transcripts that are necessary for the synthesis of class I interferons. In addition, the different coronaviruses encode some other non-structural proteins which are produced during the infectious cycle. The genetic information resides in the gene region encoding the structural proteins, but not regularly in all virus types. The function of these small ancillary proteins is largely unknown.
