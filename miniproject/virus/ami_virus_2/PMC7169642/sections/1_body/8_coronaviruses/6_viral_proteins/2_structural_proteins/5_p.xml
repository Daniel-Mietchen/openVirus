<p>M protein (“M” for “matrix”) is a surface protein with a molecular mass of 20–30 kDa and is glycosylated at the amino-terminal domain. The sugar groups are mainly linked to serine or threonine residues. In contrast to the normal N-glycosylation at asparagine residues, the glycosylation is an O-glycosylation. Only a few amino-terminal regions of this protein are exposed on the surface, and it has three transmembrane domains. The carboxy terminus resides inside the virus particle and interacts with the N protein of the nucleocapsid. The M protein is not transported to the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus, but it remains in the ER membrane throughout the infection cycle. By the interaction of theM protein with the nucleocapsid, the first steps of viral assembly occur at those sites, which initiate the budding process into the ER lumen. The E protein is also involved in viral morphogenesis. If M and E proteins are produced by genetic engineering methods in eukaryotic cells, they self-assemble into virus-like particles.</p>
