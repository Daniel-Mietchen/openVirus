<p>The N protein (“N” for “nucleic acid binding”) interacts with the viral genome; it is rich in basic amino acids and phosphorylated. It can also interact specifically with the carboxy-terminal regions of the M protein. Phylogenetic trees based on the nucleic acid sequences of the N genes correlate well with the classification of coronaviruses into different genera. N proteins are detectable in both the cytoplasm and the nucleolus of infected cells. Because of the cell-type-specific localization in the nucleus/nucleolus, it is assumed that N proteins interfere with various cellular processes.</p>
