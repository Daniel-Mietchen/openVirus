<p>Coronavirus infections cause predominantly harmless colds and infections of the upper respiratory tract in humans. Infections with coronaviruses are also known in some domestic mammals. Essentially, they are associated with acute gastroenteritis in cattle, swine, cats and dogs. However, there are also other disease patterns, such as encephalitis in pigs and a fatal systemic general infection in cats, known as feline infectious peritonitis, which is caused by the feline coronavirus. The mouse hepatitis virus, which provokes liver inflammation and bronchitis in rodents, is an important model system for unravelling pathogenetic mechanisms. Besides the different coronaviruses that infect mammals, there are some types that cause severe infections in poultry. Most notable is avian infectious bronchitis virus.</p>
