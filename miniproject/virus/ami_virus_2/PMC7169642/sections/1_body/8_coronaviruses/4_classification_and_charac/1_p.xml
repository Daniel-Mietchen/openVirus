<p>Coronaviruses are subdivided into two subfamilies, 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> and 
 <italic>Torovirinae</italic>. In the subfamily 
 <italic>Torovirinae</italic>, white bream virus is a member of the genus 
 <italic>Bafinivirus</italic> and is pathogenic for fish, whereas bovine torovirus equine torovirus, human torovirus and porcine torovirus belong to the genus 
 <italic>Torovirus</italic> and cause gastrointestinal infection in the respective animals. The biology of toroviruses and the diseases that they cause have barely been explored, however. The subfamily 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> is classified into four genera according to differences in genome organization and sequence (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab001418" ref-type="table">14.18</xref>). Coronaviruses that infect humans as well as many mammals such as ungulates, carnivores and bats have recently been assigned into the genera 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>. SARS-related coronavirus has been classified into the latter genus along with various related coronaviruses isolated from civet cats and bats. The genera 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> contain species that cause disease in various birds.
