<p>During virus morphogenesis, N proteins interact with genomic RNA molecules to shape the helical nucleocapsids and bind to the carboxy-terminal domains of the M and E proteins, which are integrated in the ER membrane. This triggers the budding process, during which the nucleocapsid is surrounded by the envelope containing M proteins and glycoproteins. The particles produced are released into the ER lumen and are transported by Golgi vesicles to the cell surface, where they are released into the environment.</p>
