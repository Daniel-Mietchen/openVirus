<p>In the next step, the complementary strand is synthesized by the concerted activities of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NSP12), RNA helicase (NSP13), exoribonuclease (NSP14) and endoribonuclease (NSP15) using the genomic RNA as a template. The newly synthesized complementary strand comprises the entire genome and has a negative polarity. It has two functions in the replication cycle: it serves as a template for the synthesis of new viral genomes and several subgenomic mRNA species. Eight subgenomic mRNAs have been found in SARS-related coronavirus infections, from which the various accessory and structural proteins are translated. They are characterized by their discontinuous synthesis: all have the same 3′ terminus, but their initiation sites are different and are located in the genomic region between the end of the reading frame of pp1ab and the 3′ end of the genome. Despite their different initiation sites, all subgenomic mRNA molecules possess a standard sequence of approximately 60–90 nucleotides at the 5′ terminus: the leader RNA. It has a capped 5′ end and is complementary to the 3′ terminus of the negative strand. It is believed that the leader sequence serves as a primer for the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA species; whether the activity of NSP8 is required for the synthesis of these short RNA molecules is unclear. The leader RNA has a conserved sequence (UCUAAAC) at the 3′ terminus. Sequences complementary to this motif are found in the negative-sense RNA at different regions. They are located upstream of the different initiation sites for the synthesis of the subgenomic mRNA species: the leader RNA can hybridize with them, thus providing a small double-stranded region with a free 3′-OH end to resume polymerization. Probably, the RNA polymerase is not capable of initiating synthesis of the subgenomic mRNA species at the different start sites. Therefore, it was probably necessary for the virus to develop the transfer mechanism of a leader RNA. The finding that multiple elements of the conserved heptamer sequence are present upstream of some of the transcription start sites, e.g. upstream of the start of the coding sequences for the N protein, suggests that RNA synthesis is preferably initiated at these sites, thus facilitating regulation of the quantity of the various proteins.</p>
