<p>Penetration of the particle seems to occur by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and subsequent fusion of the endosomal membranes with the viral envelope (as in flaviviruses and togaviruses; Sects.Â

 <xref rid="Sec0014164" ref-type="sec">14.6</xref>). Binding between S
 <sub>1</sub> and ACE-2 proteins induces conformational changes in the S proteins of SARS-related coronavirus, whereby a fusogenic domain in the S
 <sub>2</sub> moiety develops its activity at low pH, promoting fusion between the viral envelope and the cell membrane. A protease, cathepsin L, which is associated with endosomal membranes, promotes the infectivity of the virus by processing still uncleaved S polypeptides into S
 <sub>1</sub> and S
 <sub>2</sub> proteins.
