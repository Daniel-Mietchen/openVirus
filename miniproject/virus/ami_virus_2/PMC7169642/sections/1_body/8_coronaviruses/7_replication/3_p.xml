<p>All replication steps are executed in the cytoplasm. The RNA genome of coronaviruses contains a cap structure at the 5′ terminus and this mediates binding of ribosomes. As already mentioned, the non-structural polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab are primarily translated from the genomic RNA; pp1ab arises by induction of a translational frameshifting mechanism, and contains the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The precursor polyprotein pp1ab has a molecular mass of 700–800 kDa; however, it has not yet been directly detected in the cell during viral replication. Nevertheless, in vitro translation experiments in which the genomic RNA was used as a template revealed that this translation product is actually synthesized. The proteases that are encoded in its sequence (PL1
 <sup>pro</sup>, PL2
 <sup>pro</sup> and 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) cleave pp1ab into 16 non-structural proteins, one of which is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (NSP12).
