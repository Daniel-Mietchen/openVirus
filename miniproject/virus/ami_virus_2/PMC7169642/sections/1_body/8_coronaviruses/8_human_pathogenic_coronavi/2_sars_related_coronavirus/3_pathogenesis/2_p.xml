<p>In the early infection phase, a rapid activation of non-specific immune responses with increased production of various CC chemokines and chemokine receptors, proinflammatory interleukins and Toll-like receptor 9 are found in patients. This causes a rapid mobilization of monocytes and macrophages, which migrate into the infected organs, especially the lungs, and initiate the inflammatory process. Simultaneously, a rapid decrease in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes can be observed in patients during the acute phase of infection. The cause of this decline is unclear. SARS-related coronavirus is not able to infect lymphocytes; therefore, destruction of T cells cannot be a direct consequence of infection. Possibly, apoptotic processes induced by the infection may be involved. It has been found that several SARS-related coronavirus proteins, such as protein 7a, are able to induce a caspase-dependent apoptosis mechanism in cell lines from different tissues (lung, liver, kidney) in vitro.
