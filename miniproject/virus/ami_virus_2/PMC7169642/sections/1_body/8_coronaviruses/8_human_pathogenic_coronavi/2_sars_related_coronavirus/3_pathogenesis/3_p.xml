<p>Genetic factors in infected patients also seem to be important for the establishment of symptomatic SARS-related coronavirus infections. Individuals who can produce only small amounts of mannose-binding lectin appear to be predisposed to the establishment of a symptomatic infection. Mannose-binding lectin belongs, together with the pulmonary surfactant proteins A and D, to the collectins. They are proteins that attach to glycosylated regions of S proteins on the surface of the virus, facilitating penetration of the virus into granulocytes, and potentially preventing interactions with the target cells. In other studies, it has been found that SARS patients frequently exhibit haplotypes HLA-B*0703, HLA-B*4601 and HLA-DRB1*0301. However, these data are in part contradictory.</p>
