<p>Human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 have been known since 1966 and 1967, whereas the species NL63 and HKU1 together with some additional virus types were identified only a few years ago during an intensive search for human coronaviruses as a result of the SARS epidemic. All these coronavirus types have a worldwide distribution: between 75 % and 65 % of children of 3.5 years of age and up to 90 % of adults have antibodies against coronaviruses – an indication of their wide dissemination. It is estimated that globally 10 % of all infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract are caused by them. Coronaviruses are transmitted by infected people through droplet infection. Like other droplet infections, these viruses can also be transmitted by smear infections due to poor hygiene. Infections occur more frequently during the winter months. Reinfections – even with the same strain of the virus – are common and usually have an asymptomatic course.</p>
