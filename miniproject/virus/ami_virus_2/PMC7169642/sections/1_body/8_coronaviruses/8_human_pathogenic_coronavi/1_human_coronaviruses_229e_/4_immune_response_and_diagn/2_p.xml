<p>Coronaviruses can be cultivated only to a limited extent in cell culture. Human coronavirus 227E can be propagated in tissue cultures of embryonic trachea, human rhabdomyosarcoma cells or in the cell line MA-177, a diploid cell line from the intestinal epithelium. The cultivation of human coronavirus OC43 is much more difficult.</p>
