<p>The virus is transmitted from person to person by droplet or smear infections. The incubation period lasts 2â€“10 days, and the disease begins with flu-like symptoms, swollen lymph nodes and fever. Patients develop a dry cough associated with colds, limb pain, muscle pain, neck ache and headaches. At this stage, the disease is clinically virtually indistinguishable from an influenza infection. In addition to the severe respiratory symptoms, it is frequently also associated with disorders of the gastrointestinal system (diarrhoea, nausea) as well as with thrombocytopenia. About 1 week after the appearance of the first symptoms, a subset of patients develop a severe pneumonia, which is often associated with pulmonary fibrosis, myocardial infarction, acute renal failure and ultimately multiple organ failure.</p>
