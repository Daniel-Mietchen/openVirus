<p>Carlo Urbani was one of the first people to recognize that SARS is a new, unusual pneumonia, from which a considerable risk to human health may emanate. He was an expert of infectious diseases who worked at the WHO. Urbani along with the WHO and the governments of the SARS-affected countries initiated the implementation of appropriate measures in Vietnam and Southeast Asia in February/March 2003 that were aimed at preventing and controlling the dissemination of the infection. Unfortunately, he infected himself as a result of his investigations, and died from SARS on 29 March 2003.</p>
