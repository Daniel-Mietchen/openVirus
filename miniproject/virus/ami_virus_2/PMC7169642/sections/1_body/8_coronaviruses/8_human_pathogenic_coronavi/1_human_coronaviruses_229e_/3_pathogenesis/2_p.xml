<p>Diseases in which the virus infects macrophages and lymphocytes, proliferates in these cells and then spreads via the bloodstream into liver, endothelial, glial and kidney epithelial cells and infects these organs and tissues are only known from animal coronaviruses and SARS-related coronavirus. Whether the HE protein plays a role in the infection of these cell types and in the pathogenesis of the disease is not known. Mutations in the S protein alter both virulence and tropism, i.e. the specificity for different cell types. In addition to virus-specific factors, genetic factors appear to be important for the establishment of coronavirus infections: e.g. the susceptibility to human coronavirus 229E infections is apparently determined by a factor encoded on chromosome 15.</p>
