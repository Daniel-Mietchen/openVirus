<p>ELISAs for detection of specific antibodies against the S and N proteins are available. Isolation and cultivation of the virus is time-consuming and not always successful, and must be performed only in biosafety 3 (or higher) laboratories. Therefore, acute SARS-related coronavirus infections are usually diagnosed by detecting viral genomes through RT-PCR in sputum, pharyngeal lavage, stool or serum. In such cases, a region of reading frame 1b, which encodes for the viral RNA polymerase, is usually amplified. A positive detection has to be verified in additional tests and reference laboratories. SARS-related coronavirus is well cultivable in a number of cell lines. The viruses exhibit strong lytic or rather persistent infections, depending on the cell type.</p>
