<p>During a SARS-related coronavirus infection, IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies are produced against N and S proteins. They are detectable at the earliest on the fourth day after the onset of symptoms; however, in many patients they are detectable considerably later. Mainly immunoglobulins against the S protein are neutralizing antibodies. They are directed predominantly against epitopes of the domain determined by amino acid residues 441â€“700. Little is known about the relevance of the cellular immune response in humans during infection.</p>
