<p>During a coronavirus infection, IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies are produced. Immunoglobulins against the S protein are neutralizing. IgA antibodies and interferons, which are secreted in the nasal secretion, seem to be important for protecting against infections.

From mouse hepatitis virus is known that cytotoxic T cells are involved in the clearance of the virus from the organism.</p>
