<p>There is a naturally occurring mutant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus which carries a deletion within the gene encoding the S protein. This mutant virus has completely lost its enterotropism, and replicates primarily in macrophages of the respiratory tract. It causes no or only mild symptoms, but interferes significantly with the serological surveillance during the control of transmissible gastroenteritis.</p>
