<p>The virus is ingested orally, and infects enterocytes after gastric passage. They are lytically infected, destroyed and replaced by enterocytes from the Lieberkühn’s crypts. This process explains the typical symptoms of transient, non-bloody diarrhoea. Histologically, the classic clinical picture is that of acute enteritis with atrophy of villi (in the posterior sections of the small intestine). The gastric passage of the acid-labile coronavirus is achieved by the pH-buffering effect of milk and is additionally supported by the slightly acidic pH in the stomach of young animals.</p>
