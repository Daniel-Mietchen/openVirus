<p>An infection produces a durable and protective immunity against the homologous virus, which is normally based on antibodies against the S protein. The degree of cross-immunity is different for individual strains. Diagnosis is performed by detection of the virus (isolation of the virus in cell culture, PCR) or immunofluorescence with identification of viral proteins in tissues of infected animals, or, at the livestock level, by detection of virus-specific antibodies by neutralization and haemagglutination-inhibition tests or ELISA.</p>
