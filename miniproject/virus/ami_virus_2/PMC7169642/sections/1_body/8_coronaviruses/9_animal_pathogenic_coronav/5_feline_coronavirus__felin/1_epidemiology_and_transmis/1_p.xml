<p>So-called feline infectious peritonitis is caused by infection of cats with feline coronavirus. Infections with this pathogen are widespread in cat populations. The virus is able to persist in cats, and is excreted primarily in the faeces. The cats are usually infected at a very early age by social contact with the mother or other persistently infected cats.</p>
