<p>A vaccine is available on the basis of an attenuated vaccine containing a temperature-sensitive mutant of feline coronavirus; however, its efficacy is controversial. There are fundamental safety concerns regarding the use of live vaccines for the prevention of an infectious disease with unclarified (immuno) pathogenesis whose attenuated virus has scarcely been investigated and which possesses a broad host range. Furthermore, it has also been shown that coronaviruses from different species can recombine their genetic material to generate new virus variants. In the case of recombination with the vaccine virus, the emergence of virus variants with altered receptor binding is possible, and these in turn might infect other animal species.</p>
