<p>The virus commonly causes a subclinical infection or mild and transient enteritis. The enteritis-causing virus can change by mutations, which create a new biotype with altered tissue tropism. This virus variant replicates no longer exclusively in enterocytes, but is also able to infect macrophages, thus inducing a systemic infection. The virus variant is scattered by macrophages in virtually all organs, where it can induce, starting from a vasculitis, pseudo-granulomatous inflammations. This clinical picture is referred to as feline infectious peritonitis. From a pathological point of view, this disease pattern is a generalized polyserositis and vasculitis/perivasculitis.</p>
