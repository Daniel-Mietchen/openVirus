<p>The family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> encompasses many viruses that cause illnesses in animals. The most important are the pathogen of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis and feline coronavirus, which can cause peritonitis and polyserositis in cats. These viruses will be discussed in detail. Furthermore, there is also porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus, which induces encephalitis in newborn piglets. Occasionally, it is also associated with diarrhoea. The infection of the central nervous system occurs via peripheral nerves, to which the viruses are transported from the initial reproduction site, the mucosa of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract, without a viraemia developing. An immunoprophylaxis is not available. A globally important disease of poultry is caused by avian infectious bronchitis virus. Apart from an acute disease of the respiratory tract, substantial economic loss can arise from lesions of the fallopian tubes and the associated decline of egg production. Mouse hepatitis virus is widespread in mouse populations. It represents an important model system for studying the biology and pathogenesis of coronavirus infections. Mouse hepatitis virus causes a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, which can range from gastrointestinal, hepatic and respiratory symptoms to central nervous system disorders. Introduction into laboratory animal colonies occurs by inclusion of mice with persistent infections. The diagnosis is performed histopathologically or by cultivation of the virus. The elimination of the virus from infected colonies is almost impossible. Usually, it is necessary to annihilate the colony and to replace the infected livestock with new, virus-free animals. Therefore, regular examinations of mouse colonies are essential to detect infections with mouse hepatitis virus.
