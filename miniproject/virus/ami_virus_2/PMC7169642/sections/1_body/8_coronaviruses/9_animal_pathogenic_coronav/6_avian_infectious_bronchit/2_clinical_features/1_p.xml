<p>Avian Infectious bronchitis virus causes lesions in the kidney, in the oviduct and in the respiratory tract. The nature of the clinical manifestation depends on the virus strain and the host. In particular, the age and breed of the chicken influences the clinical picture. The disease is especially pronounced in few-day-old chicks. The morbidity is very high; thus, virtually all birds of a flock are infected. The mortality, however, is generally low (0–25 %).</p>
