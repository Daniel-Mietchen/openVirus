<p>Bovine coronavirus infections are a major cause of calf diarrhoea in the first few days of life. The infection is local and viral replication is restricted to enterocytes. A vaccine is available in the form of a so-called maternal prophylaxis, in which the cow is vaccinated twice before parturition. The actual immunization consists in the intake of antibodies with the colostrum.</p>
