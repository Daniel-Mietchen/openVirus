<p>The enveloped virions of coronaviruses have a diameter of 80–180 nm. The single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome is associated with the N protein as a nucleocapsid in the interior of the particle (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001422" ref-type="fig">14.22</xref>). The nucleocapsid has a helical shape. The helix has a diameter of 10–20 nm. Particular amino acids of the N protein interact with the carboxy-terminal domain of the M protein that is inserted in the envelope. In this way, the nucleocapsid is associated through protein interactions with the inner side of the envelope. Apart from the M protein, an amino-terminally glycosylated protein of 20–30 kDa, two other viral proteins are embedded in the envelope: the glycosylated S protein (180–200 kDa) is present in club-shaped trimers, which protrude about 20 nm from the envelope surface and are responsible for the appearance of the corona, and the E protein (9–12 kDa), which is present in only small amounts. Another membrane-associated protein, haemagglutinin esterase (HE), is present only in members of the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>. It has a molecular mass of 65 kDa, is present as a dimer and exhibits haemagglutination activity.
