<p>Coronaviruses possess the largest genome of all known RNA viruses: it has a length of 27,000–32,000 nucleotides (human coronavirus 229E, 27,317 nucleotides; avian infectious bronchitis virus, 27,608 nucleotides; porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, 28,580 nucleotides; SARS-related coronavirus, 29,727 nucleotides; mouse hepatitis virus, 31,357 nucleotides), is single-stranded and has a positive-sense polarity, and is modified at the 5′ end with a cap-structure and at the 3′ terminus with a poly(A) tail (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001423" ref-type="fig">14.23</xref>). The RNA is infectious. The genome contains multiple coding regions: two relatively large open reading frames, 1a and 1b, overlap at their ends by 40–60 nucleotides (1a starts immediately adjacent to the 5′ terminus). They span approximately 20,000 nucleotides and code together for a polyprotein, 1ab (pp1ab), of theoretically 700–800 kDa. A ribosomal frameshifting during translation leads to skipping the stop codon at the end of open reading frame 1a, facilitating the continuous synthesis until the end of open reading frame 1b. This process occurs in 20–30 % of all translation events and renders possible the synthesis of pp1ab, the precursor of the non-structural proteins. If this ribosomal frameshifting does not occur, then the translation will end at the stop codon at the end of open reading frame 1a, resulting in polyprotein 1a (pp1a; 450–500 kDa). These polyproteins contain the genetic information for two (in SARS-related coronavirus and avian infectious bronchitis virus) or three (in other coronaviruses) proteases, which autocatalytically cleave the precursor proteins pp1a and pp1ab, as well as a functionally active RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and an RNA helicase. The reading frames for the structural proteins are situated within the last third of the genome. In the 5′ to 3′ direction, they encode the envelope proteins S, HE (only in most betacoronaviruses, not in SARS-related coronavirus), E, M and, just before the 3′ end, N. In addition, there are various small open reading frames (2a, 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b) in the part of the genome encoding the structural proteins. The coronaviruses of different genera differ significantly in the occurrence of these small open reading frames that predominantly encode very small accessory proteins; most of them are not essential for viral replication.
