 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> is classified, together with the families 
 <italic>Arteriviridae</italic> (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec0014197" ref-type="sec">14.7</xref>) and Roniviridae, into the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. Human coronaviruses were discovered by David A.J. Tyrrell and colleagues during cold epidemics in 1965. They were originally defined as their own family on the basis of morphological differences from other viruses in 1968. Electron micrographs revealed virus particles that are surrounded by an envelope containing embedded proteins, which confer on them the appearance of a “halo” (Latin, 
 <italic>corona</italic>). When the molecular details of the genome structure and replication mechanisms became known later, they confirmed the original classification based strictly on morphological analyses.
