<p>The N protein interacts with genomic RNA to form the nucleocapsids and binds to the carboxy-terminal domain of the M protein, which is embedded in the ER membrane. This interaction triggers the budding process, during which the nucleocapsid is surrounded by the membrane containing M protein and glycoproteins. The particles formed are released into the ER lumen, and are further transported via Golgi vesicles to the cell surface, where they are released into the environment.</p>
