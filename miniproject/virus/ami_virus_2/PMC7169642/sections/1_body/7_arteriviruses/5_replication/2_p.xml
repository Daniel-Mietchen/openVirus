<p>In the next step, the complementary strand is synthesized by the polymerase activity of the enzyme using the genomic RNA as a template. It encompasses the entire genome and has a negative polarity. Later, it has two functions in the replication cycle: it serves as a template for the synthesis of new viral genomes and for the production of subgenomic mRNA species, from which the various structural proteins of arteriviruses are translated. All subgenomic mRNAs have the same 5′ and 3′ termini, which correspond to those of the viral genome. At the 5′ ends there is a uniform sequence, the leader RNA. It is capped at the 5′ terminus and corresponds to the sequences in the 5′ UTR of the genome. The leader sequence serves as a primer for the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA species. Near its 3′ end, the leader RNA exhibits a conserved sequence (UCAAC in equine arteritis virus). Sequences complementary to this motif are found in the negative-sense RNA at different regions. They are located upstream of the different initiation sites for the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA species in the region of the genome between the end of the reading frame encoding polyprotein 1ab and the 3′ end of the genome: they can hybridize with the leader RNA, thus providing a small double-stranded region with a free 3′-OH end to continue polymerization. As in coronaviruses, the RNA polymerase can itself probably not initiate the synthesis of subgenomic mRNA species at the different sites. Only the reading frames adjacent to the 5′ end of these nested transcripts are usually translated into proteins; transcription of an internal reading frame has only been observed in the case of the E protein.</p>
