<p>Arteriviruses preferably infect macrophages and gain access to the cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The receptors used by the virus for attachment are not definitively known. PRRSV appears to interact with heparan sulphate on the surface of macrophages. In addition, it has also been found that the virus binds to CD163 and to the amino-terminal variable immunoglobulin-like domain of sialoadhesin, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily on the surface of macrophages. Which viral glycoprotein mediates this interaction is not clear. The replication cycle is very similar to that of coronavirus; also in arteriviruses, all replication steps occur in the cytoplasm of the cell. As already mentioned, non-structural polyproteins 1a and 1ab are primarily translated from the genomic RNA by induction of a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. Protein 1ab comprises the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Fig.Â
