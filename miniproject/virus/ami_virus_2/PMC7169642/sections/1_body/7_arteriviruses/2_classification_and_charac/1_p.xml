<p>In the family of arteriviruses, which comprises exclusively animal pathogens, there is only one genus (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab001416" ref-type="table">14.16</xref>). The characteristic prototype is equine arteritis virus, which induces persistent asymptomatic infections in horses and donkeys; however, it can also cause miscarriages or haemorrhagic fever in these animals. Lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) and simian haemorrhagic fever virus infect mice and various African and Asian monkeys, respectively. These pathogens were described for the first time in the nineteenth century. By contrast, infections of swine with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) occurred for the first time in Europe and the USA nearly simultaneously between 1983 and 1988.
