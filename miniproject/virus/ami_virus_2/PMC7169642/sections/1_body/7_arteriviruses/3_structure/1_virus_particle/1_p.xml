<p>The infectious particles of arteriviruses have a diameter of 40–60 nm and consist of spherical or icosahedral nucleocapsids (diameter 25–35 nm), which are surrounded by an envelope (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001420" ref-type="fig">14.20</xref>). In contrast to coronaviruses, arteriviruses possess envelope proteins protruding only slightly from the surface of the particle (10–14 nm). Four viral glycoproteins are inserted in the envelope: GP
 <sub>2</sub>, GP
 <sub>3</sub>, GP
 <sub>4</sub> and GP
 <sub>5</sub>; in the case of LDV, GP
 <sub>2</sub>, GP
 <sub>3</sub>, GP
 <sub>4</sub> and GP
 <sub>7</sub>. In addition, the M and E proteins are associated with the viral membrane. The nucleocapsid inside the envelope is composed of N proteins and the single-stranded RNA genome.
