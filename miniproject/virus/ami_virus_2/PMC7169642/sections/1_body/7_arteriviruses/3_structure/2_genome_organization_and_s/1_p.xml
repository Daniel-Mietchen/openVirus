<p>The genomes of arteriviruses have an organization similar to that of coronaviruses; however, the succession of coding regions is much more densely packed than in the latter. Therefore, they are shorter and comprise between 12,704 nucleotides in equine arteritis virus and approximately 15,000 and 15,700 nucleotides in PRRSV and simian haemorrhagic fever virus, respectively. They consist of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA containing a methylated cap structure at the 5′ terminus and a poly(A) tail the 3′ end. The coding regions of the genome are flanked by 156–221 and 59–117 untranslated nucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ termini, respectively. Two large reading frames (1a and 1b), of which 1a begins at the 5′ terminus, have overlapping ends and cover approximately two thirds of the genome (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig001421" ref-type="fig">14.21</xref>). They contain the genetic information for the synthesis of two polyproteins (1a and 1ab), from which the non-structural proteins are generated by proteolytic cleavage. A ribosomal frameshift event during translation leads to skipping the stop codon at the end of reading frame 1a, resulting in the synthesis of the larger protein 1ab. Autocatalytic cleavage leads to the generation of three proteases (NSP1, NSP2, NSP4), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, a helicase and several other non-structural proteins of unknown function. Reading frames 2–7 (or 9 in PRRSV) encoding the structural proteins are located downstream of the genes of non-structural proteins. Towards the 3′ end, they encode the different glycoproteins and the M and N proteins; the E protein is encoded by an internal reading frame located on the second longest mRNA.
