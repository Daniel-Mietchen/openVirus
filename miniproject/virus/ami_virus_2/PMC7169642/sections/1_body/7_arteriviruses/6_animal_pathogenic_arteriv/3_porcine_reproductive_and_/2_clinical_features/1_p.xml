<p>PRRSV infections cause a disease in pigs which is very similar to equine arteritis. Typical symptoms include fertility problems, which are principally manifested as late abortions after a gestation period of more than 110 days (the normal gestation period in pigs is115 days). In addition, dead and mummified fetuses can also be aborted. In contrast to infection with porcine parvoviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20), pathological changes can be observed in aborting sows. These include endometritis and myometritis, frequently accompanied by haemorrhagic placenta. In non-pregnant animals, the infection is present as a febrile systemic disease that is often accompanied by respiratory symptoms. A classic symptom is an abnormal blue discoloration of the ears, the snout and the vulva owing to reduced blood flow.</p>
