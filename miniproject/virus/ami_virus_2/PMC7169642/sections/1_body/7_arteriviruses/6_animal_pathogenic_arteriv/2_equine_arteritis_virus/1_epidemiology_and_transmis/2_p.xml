<p>Only horses seem to be susceptible to the infection. The virus is transmitted by direct contact and through aerosols. The infection occurs more frequently at tournaments, fairs or exhibitions, where many horses from different regions come together. The virus can cause a persistent infection; some stallions excrete viruses in the ejaculate for many years. This is epidemiologically very important and constitutes an animal health problem because the virus can be spread in this way among the population even when artificial insemination is used.</p>
