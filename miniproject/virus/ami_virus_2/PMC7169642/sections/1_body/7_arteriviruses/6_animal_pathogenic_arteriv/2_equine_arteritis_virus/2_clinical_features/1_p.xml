<p>After an incubation period of about 3 days to 2 weeks, the animals develop fever and oedemas in the head, limbs and abdomen (preputial and scrotal oedema in stallions), as well as conjunctivitis. The disease is normally transient, and deaths are rarely observed. In pregnant mares, abortion can occur 10–30 days after infection. In a seronegative, and therefore susceptible livestock population, up to 80 % of gestating mares can abort (“abortion storms”). Temporary infertility can also be observed in stallions as a complication of equine arteritis virus infections. However, the infection usually develops subclinically and diseases are rarely observed.</p>
