<p>The target cells of the virus are macrophages and endothelial cells. The virus persists in macrophages despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease by an antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_7). There are indications that PRRSV prevents the induction of IFN-β: it inactivates IFN-β promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1), an adapter molecule for RIG-I helicase, and thus inhibits the RIG-I-mediated signalling cascade.</p>
