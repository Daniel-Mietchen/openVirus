 <xref rid="Sec0014219" ref-type="sec">14.8</xref>) and roniviruses the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. This classification is based on the genome organization, on the use of polycistronic mRNA transcripts for viral gene expression and on the transcription and translation strategies, i.e. on features and processes which are similar in the members of these virus families. The name of the order has its origin in the Latin word 
 <italic>nidus</italic> meaning “nest”. It refers to the unique transcriptional strategy of the members of the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. During mRNA synthesis, transcripts are synthesized with the same 5′ and 3′ termini, but in which the 5′ terminal sequence region is combined with different RNA segments that are localized farther downstream; therefore, sets of polycistronic (nested) mRNA molecules are generated. On the other hand, the differences in the size of the viral genomes and particles as well as in the sequence and nature of the structural proteins are so clear that they have been classified into separate families. Compared with the particles and the genomes of coronaviruses and roniviruses, those of arteriviruses are much smaller. Members of the Roniviridae and the Mesoniviridae, a recently designed virus family, infect only invertebrates and insects; therefore, they will not be discussed in more detail in this book.
