<p>The cellular endoribonuclease XendoU, originally discovered in 
 <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, is responsible for processing of nucleic RNA species and belongs to a small protein family, into which the nidoviral endoribonuclease NendoU is also classified. The enzymatic activity of NendoU is dependent on Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> ions. It preferentially cleaves double-stranded RNA before or after uridine residues in the sequences GUU and GU, generating molecules with 2′-3′-cyclic phosphate ends. Furthermore, NendoU enzymes, which have only been found in nidoviruses so far, seem to possess some additional, but not yet characterized activities.
