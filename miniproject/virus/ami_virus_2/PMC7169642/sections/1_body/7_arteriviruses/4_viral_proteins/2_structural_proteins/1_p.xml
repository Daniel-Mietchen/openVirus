<p>The structural proteins of arteriviruses can be subdivided into major and minor proteins. Major proteins are GP
 <sub>5</sub> (GP
 <sub>7</sub> in LDV), M and N. The other group includes GP
 <sub>2</sub>, GP
 <sub>3</sub>, GP
 <sub>4</sub> and E proteins. The function of the structural E protein has not been definitively resolved, but it is essential for infectivity, and there are indications that it might be an ion channel protein. The glycoproteins are present in complex arrangements, GP
 <sub>5</sub>/GP
 <sub>7</sub> and M proteins form heterodimers, whereas GP
 <sub>2</sub>, GP
 <sub>3</sub> and GP
 <sub>4</sub> form heterotrimers. In addition, intermediates of the GP
 <sub>2</sub> and GP
 <sub>4</sub> heterodimers can be observed, and associate with GP
 <sub>3</sub> by cysteine bonds in the subsequent step. This complex formation with GP
 <sub>3</sub> is a prerequisite for their installation in the viral envelope. The neutralizing epitopes are located primarily in the GP
 <sub>5</sub> or GP
 <sub>7</sub> proteins. However, the presence of heterodimeric structures with the M protein seems to be essential for their correct conformation.
