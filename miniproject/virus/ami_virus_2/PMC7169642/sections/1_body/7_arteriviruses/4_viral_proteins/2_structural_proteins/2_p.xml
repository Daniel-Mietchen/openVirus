<p>The M protein is the structural protein of arteriviruses with the highest degree of conservation. It resembles the M protein of coronaviruses. The carboxy-terminal domain is located inside the particle, whereas the short amino-terminal region is localized on the viral surface and is flanked by hydrophobic sequences that anchor the protein in the envelope. Through a cysteine residue in the amino-terminal domain, the M protein forms a disulphide bond with glycoprotein GP
 <sub>5</sub>, or GP
 <sub>7</sub> in LDV.
