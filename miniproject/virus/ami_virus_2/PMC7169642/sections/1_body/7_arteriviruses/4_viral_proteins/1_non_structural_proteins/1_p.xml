<p>Two major precursor products of the non-structural proteins are synthesized during translation of the genomic mRNA: protein 1a has a molecular mass of 187–260 kDa among the different members of arteriviruses, the amino-terminal half of protein 1ab (345–421 kDa) is identical to that of protein 1a. The three proteases (NSP1, NSP2, NSP4) that reside in the amino-terminal region of both proteins cleave the precursor proteins into a total of 12 non-structural proteins (NSP1–NSP12), whose functions are in some cases not resolved.</p>
