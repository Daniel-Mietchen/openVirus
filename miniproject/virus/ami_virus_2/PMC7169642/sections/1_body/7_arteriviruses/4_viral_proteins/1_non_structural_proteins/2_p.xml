<p>The NSP1 and NSP2 proteins are cysteine proteases which are autocatalytically cleaved from the polyproteins (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab001417" ref-type="table">14.17</xref>). NSP4 is a serine protease and is similar to the 3C protease of picornaviruses (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec00141" ref-type="sec">14.1</xref>). Its activity is required for subsequent processing of the precursor proteins 1a and 1ab at up to eight cleavage sites. This proteolytic processing generates, among others, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, metal ion binding protein MP and a helicase (NSP10). The latter has a Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> ion binding domain, which is needed for the synthesis of viral mRNAs, but is not necessary for genome replication. NSP11 constitutes the endoribonuclease (nidoviral uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, NendoU) which is present in all members of the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>. Its activity seems to be especially necessary for the synthesis of subgenomic RNA molecules. In most cases, the functional assignments have been made by comparative sequence analysis and not by direct purification and biochemical characterization of protein activities.
