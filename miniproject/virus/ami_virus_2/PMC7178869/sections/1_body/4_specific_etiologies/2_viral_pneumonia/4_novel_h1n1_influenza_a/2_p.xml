<p>The clinical symptoms can be typical for influenza; fever, sore throat, cough, and muscle aches with the addition of vomiting and diarrhea in children. A wide range of complications have been reported that include mild-to-moderate (otitis media, sinusitis, myositis, and febrile seizures) to more severe complications such as myocarditis, rhabdomyolysis or encephalitis.
