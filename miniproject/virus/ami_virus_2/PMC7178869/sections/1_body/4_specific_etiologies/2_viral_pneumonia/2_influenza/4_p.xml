<p>Rimantidine and amantadine can shorten the course for influenza type A disease by limiting viral replication, but only if given within the first 48 h of the disease. Prophylactic dosing is 70–90% effective and does not interfere with antibody production from the vaccine. Both drugs have central nervous system and gastrointestinal side effects, including an increase in the incidence of seizures. Oseltamivir and zanamivir have recently been approved for the treatment of influenza infections in children. They inhibit neuraminidase, an enzyme produced by influenza A and B. The course of disease in healthy adults can be reduced by 1–2 days, if started within 48 h of the onset of symptoms. Zanamivir is a dry powder aerosol that must be delivered by a special breath-activated device. Bronchospasm in patients with asthma has been reported. Aspirin or aspirin-containing products should be avoided due to the risk of Reye syndrome.</p>
