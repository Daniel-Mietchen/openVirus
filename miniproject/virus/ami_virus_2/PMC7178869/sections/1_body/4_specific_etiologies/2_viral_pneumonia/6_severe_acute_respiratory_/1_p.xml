<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a newly described pulmonary infection caused by a novel SARS-associated coronavirus. SARS-CoV is highly contagious and was coined “the first plague of the twenty-first century”. The disease rapidly spreads among household contacts and healthcare personnel. Children less than 18 years of age account for only approximately 5% of those affected, with a mean age of 12 years. No deaths were reported among children in the 2003 outbreak. Children and adults present with fever, malaise, cough, coryza, chills or rigor, sputum production, headache, myalgia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, mildly elevated activated partial thromboplastin times, and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase. Radiographs of the chest show non-specific infiltrates. Apart from diarrhea, patients have minimal extrapulmonary symptoms. Early diagnosis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can be made with 80% sensitivity on nasopharyngeal aspirates within the first 3 days of the illness. The clinical course follows a triphasic pattern. There is an incubation period of 2–10 days with a prodrome of high fever, chills, malaise, headache, and myalgias. Diarrhea occurs in up to 20% of adults. After 2–7 days, the disease progresses to involve the lower airways with a dry non-productive cough and dyspnea. In 10–20% of cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) follows and often patients require mechanical ventilation. Deaths occur from respiratory failure. Young children run a milder and shorter biphasic clinical course. Cough is found in approximately half the children, and crackles are rarely heard despite radiographic evidence of infiltrates. A regimen of antibiotics, ribavirin, and corticosteroids was proposed based on initial anecdotal success. However, ribavirin has demonstrated minimal activity against SARS-CoV isolates

  <p>SARS rarely affects children, and when it does, morbidity is less, with no reported mortalities.</p>
