<p>Hantavirus Cardiopulmonary Syndrome is a viral zoonotic disease that affects healthy children and adolescents who are exposed to aerosols of rodent excreta. The deer mouse is the main rodent reservoir. Most cases occur in the southwestern United States, but cases have been confirmed in 30 states. HCPS presents with a prodrome of fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Respiratory compromise requiring supplemental oxygen generally occurs within 72 h. The disease can progress to respiratory distress and ARDS. The majority of deaths result from hypoxemia and cardiac dysfunction with marked hypotension and ventricular arrhythmias. In adults, the case fatality rate is approximately 38%. A recent case series of 13 children aged 10–16 years, revealed that 92% of infected children developed HCPS, 33% died, and 67% were critically ill and required mechanical ventilation. Treatment is supportive as ribavirin has not been proven to reduce mortality. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used on two patients, one of which survived. Laboratory evaluation reveals thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, and circulating immunoblasts. An elevated prothrombin time of ≥14 s is predictive of severe disease. No deaths were reported in children younger than 14 years of age. Diagnosis can be made by detection of hantavirus-specific immunoglobulin M, hantavirus-specific RNA by polymerase chain reaction, or hantavirus antigen by immunohistochemistry.
