<p>Influenza is the main viral cause of pneumonia in school-aged children requiring hospitalization. There are three serotypes, A, B, and C which are further divided into subtypes based on the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. Hemagglutinin 1, 2, and 3 and neuraminidase 1 and 2 typically infect humans. The gene segments for the surface glycoproteins are unstable, so mutations, called antigenic shift, occur regularly. Epidemics occur annually during the winter months with a short, 1–3 day incubation period. The virus causes destruction of the ciliated respiratory epithelium within 1 day of symptoms. Airway edema and infiltration with inflammatory cells into the airway mucosa and epithelium follows. Slow repair occurs over 2–4 weeks. A severe fulminating pneumonia may result in hemorrhagic exudates that contain many polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells. Destruction of the respiratory epithelium often leads to secondary bacterial infections.

  <p>Although death from influenza pneumonia is uncommon, a significant number of the children that died were previously healthy.</p>
