<p>The H1N1 strain has been found to be resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, but is usually sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors, specifically oseltamivir or zanamir. In 2009, oseltamivir was emergently approved for treatment in children less than 12 months of age. Resistance to oseltamivir has been reported and is thought due to the H275Y mutation. Interestingly, the mutation confers resistance to oseltamivir, but not to zanamivir. Peramivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, an unapproved (investigational) antiviral available in an intravenous formulation received an emergency use authorization permit from the FDA for use in children with confirmed severe refractory H1N1 influenza. Its use should be restricted to children that are not responding to either oral or inhaled antiviral drugs or if the parenteral route is the only dependable method of drug delivery.</p>
