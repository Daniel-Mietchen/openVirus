<p>Avian influenza viruses do not normally infect species other than birds and pigs. However, in 1997, the first human death from avian influenza occurred in Hong Kong in a 3 year old with Reye syndrome. Subsequently, an epidemic occurred among humans in Hong Kong with close contact to live, infected poultry. The subtype H5N1 appears to be the most ominous due to its ability to rapidly mutate and infect new species. The overall mortality rate is greater than 70%. The avian viruses are not believed to be transmissible from person-to-person, but some recent cases are being investigated for this possibility. Children uniformly present with fever and cough. Symptoms range from typical influenza-like symptoms to conjunctivitis to respiratory disease and failure. Significant laboratory data include leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. All children who developed pneumonia and progressed to ARDS died. Diagnosis remains difficult, as no tests are widely available. Of the antiviral drugs available for influenza A, the most recent H5N1 strains in Southeast Asia are resistant to rimantadine and amantadine. Therefore, treatment is mainly supportive. A prototype H5N1 vaccine was made available to manufacturers in April 2004, but production is difficult because the standard means of producing influenza vaccines from specially grown chicken eggs is not feasible. H5N1 kills the embryo before enough viruses can be harvested for vaccine production.
