<p>Adenoviruses have been implicated in 4–10% of pneumonias in children. Adenoviruses are classified into 49 serotypes with types 3, 7, 7a, 11, and 21 being the most common etiologic agents of lower respiratory disease and causing a severe necrotizing pneumonitis. These serotypes are associated with serious pulmonary sequelae, such as bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans, unilateral hyperlucent lung, and persistently abnormal pulmonary function tests. Adenovirus infections peak between 6 months and 5 years of age. Mortality from severe respiratory infections can be high, because the disease often involves multiple organ systems. Survivors may have permanent lung injury often in the form of bronchiolitis obliterans. In the immunocompromised host, mortality rates are as high as 50–80%. Cidofovir has
