 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> is a Gram-positive diplococcus that is frequently found in the upper respiratory tract. There are over 80 capsular serotypes with 80% of infections caused by 14 serotypes. It is the most common bacterial cause for pneumonia occurring at a peak age of 13â€“18 months. Typically, it causes a lobar or segmental consolidation, but it may manifest as patchy infiltrates in infants. Pleural effusions occur in up to 20% of children that require hospitalization (Fig.
