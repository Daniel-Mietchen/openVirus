<p>Methicillin resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) was once considered to be restricted to hospitals and long-term care facilities. However, community acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is now a significant cause of a variety of infections (including pneumonia) in children without prior health care facility exposure. The majority of community acquired MRSA infections involve minor skin and soft tissue infections, but invasive and sometimes fatal infections can occur in otherwise healthy individuals. CA-MRSA and healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) can be distinguished by several important features. Patients with CA-MRSA by definition have not had recent hospitalization (acute or chronic care), prolonged antibiotic use or chronic underlying disease. Toxin production also distinguishes CA-MRSA from HA-MRSA. Panton valentine leukocidin (PVL) is a toxin which is present in most CA-MRSA isolates, but rarely in HA-MRSA isolates. PVL toxin lyses white blood cells leading to leukopenia and a decreased ability to kill

 <italic>aureus</italic>. Its production has been implicated as a contributor to the development of CA-MRSA necrotizing pneumonia. CA-MRSA isolates, unlike HA-MRSA, lack multi-drug resistance. CA-MRSA is generally more susceptible to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline than HA-MRSA, probably because HA-MRSA has developed resistance to survive in the healthcare setting.
