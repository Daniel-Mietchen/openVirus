 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is a Gram-positive organism that can be found on the skin, nasal mucosa, and other mucus membranes. About 20–30% of children are carriers. It is generally spread by direct contact or by respiratory particles.

 <italic>aureus</italic> is an unusual cause of lower airway disease in otherwise healthy children. It is more typically isolated from infants and young children with debilitating conditions. Primary 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic> pneumonia presents in the winter or early spring with a short febrile prodrome and a rapid onset of pulmonary symptoms. Blood cultures are positive in 20–30% of patients. Secondary staphylococcal pneumonia will have a more prolonged prodrome with no seasonal predilection, but is often seen after influenza infections. As this secondary pneumonia is usually a result of hematogenous spread, blood cultures are positive in about 90% of patients. Unilateral lobar disease is more typical with primary disease, while diffuse bilateral infiltrates are more frequent with secondary pneumonia. Effusions can be diagnosed in about 15% of children at presentation, but ultimately will develop in about 75% of cases. Pneumatocoeles occur in up to 45–65% of children. Treatment is with nafcillin or oxacillin, but more organisms are becoming resistant and require therapy for serious or invasive disease with vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, or quinupristin-dalfopristin.
