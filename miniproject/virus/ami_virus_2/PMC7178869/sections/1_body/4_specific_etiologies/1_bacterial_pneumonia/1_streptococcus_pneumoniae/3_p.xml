<p>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) have been developed that confer immunity against 7 and 13 serotypes. The 7-valent PCV (Prevnar) was licensed for use in the United States in 2000. A 13-valent PCV has been recently introduced and will replace the 7-valent PCV. The PCVs have been highly effective at reducing hospitalizations among children younger than 2 years for pneumococcal pneumonia.</p>
