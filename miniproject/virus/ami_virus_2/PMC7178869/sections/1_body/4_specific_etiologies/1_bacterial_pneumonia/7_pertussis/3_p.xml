<p>If administered during the early stages of the disease (first 7–10 days of illness), erythromycin for 14 days may decrease symptoms and reduce the risk of spread. A 5 day course of azithromycin or a 7–10 day course of clarithromycin has been found to be as effective with less gastrointestinal symptoms. Corticosteroids, bronchodilators, or intravenous immunoglobulins have not demonstrated efficacy. Supportive care with supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, intravenous fluids, maintenance of adequate caloric intake, and treatment of secondary bacterial infections are the mainstay of therapy. The use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in infants with hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure refractory to conventional mechanical ventilation has resulted in poorer outcomes than expected. Vaccination in infancy with booster doses in adolescence is preventative.</p>
