<p>Approximately 50–75% of infants born to 
 <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic>-infected mothers will become infected at one or more anatomical site, including conjunctiva, nasopharynx, rectum, and vagina. About 30% of infants with nasopharyngeal infections will develop pneumonia. The infants usually present at about 4–12 weeks of age with cough and congestion, but an absence of fever. The cough often interferes with the ability to feed. Infants generally have tachypnea and rales on examination and chest x-ray frequently shows hyperinflation. A peripheral eosinophilia may be present. 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>trachomatis</italic> is susceptible to macrolides, tetracyclines, quinolones, and sulfonamides. Erythromycin for 2–3 weeks is the treatment of choice for neonatal pneumonia.
