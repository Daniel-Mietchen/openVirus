 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Chlamydia pneumoniae</italic> play a greater role in causing respiratory tract disease in children then previously thought. An indolent course that develops over 5–7 days manifested by low-grade fever, scratchy sore throat, aches, and headaches characterizes both pathogens. After a few days, rales may be heard, particularly in the bases where the infiltrates tend to occur. These organisms have been associated with the initiation, promotion, and exacerbation of asthma in children. In addition, a pertussis-like illness with acute bronchitis has been described. A recent study has shown that nearly half of the cases of community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 2–14 years were associated with

 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> or 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>. Classic atypical pneumonias caused by these organisms are usually mild and self-limited. However, a number of studies have suggested that severe pulmonary infection may occur in otherwise healthy children. Pleural effusions, pneumatocoeles, lung abscesses, pneumothoraces, bronchiectasis, chronic interstitial fibrosis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome although rare complications, have all been reported. Serological testing is the most common means of diagnosis, but this is often retrospective. Cultures obtained from swabbing the nasopharynx may take several days to grow. PCR techniques are currently being refined and standardized. Treatment with antibiotics reduces the rate of recurrent wheezing episodes, decreases morbidity, and shortens the duration of symptoms. The organisms are susceptible to tetracyclines, macrolides, and quinolones. The optimal doses and duration of treatment is unclear; however, some data suggest that prolonged treatment for greater than 2 weeks may be more desirable to decrease symptoms and eradicate the organism from the nasopharynx.
