 <italic>Group A beta</italic>-
 <italic>hemolytic Streptococcus</italic> (GABHS) is a Gram-positive organism responsible for about 15% of pharyngitis and tonsillitis in children. It is rare as a primary cause of pneumonia. When it does occur, the children generally have high fever and appear toxic. The pneumonia is typically lobar. Associated empyemas are common and pneumatocoeles may develop. There are several virulent toxin-producing GABHS M-serotypes that are associated with toxic shock syndrome. Pre-existing varicella disease with disruption of skin and soft tissue as the port of entry is reported approximately 40–50% of the time. An associated pneumonia occurs in 10–20% of children with toxic shock syndrome. GABHS are highly susceptible to penicillins and cephalosporins. In cases of toxic shock, clindamycin is often added to inhibit the production of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins A (SPE-A) and B (SPE-B).
