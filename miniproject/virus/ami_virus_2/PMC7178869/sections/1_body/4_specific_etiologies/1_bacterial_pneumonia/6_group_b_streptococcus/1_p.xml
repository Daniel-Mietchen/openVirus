<p>About 30â€“40% of infants with perinatally acquired 
 <italic>Group B Streptococcus</italic> (GBS) infections will have pneumonia. The infant usually has systemic disease and blood cultures are frequently positive. Late-onset GBS is predominantly caused by the type III serotype. In these infants, the infection is usually manifest as bacteremia without a focus or with meningitis. Pneumonia is rare in late-onset disease. GBS is uniformly sensitive to penicillin.
