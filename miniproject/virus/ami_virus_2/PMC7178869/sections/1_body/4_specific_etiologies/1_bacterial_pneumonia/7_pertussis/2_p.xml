<p>Pertussis is often divided into catarrahal (fever, rhinnorhea and initiation of cough), paroxysmal (severe coughing episodes, lymphocytosis, potential for complications) and convalescent stages (slow waning of cough over weeks to months). Complications include secondary bacterial or viral pneumonia, apnea, malnutrition, pulmonary hypertension and neurologic involvement including seizures and encephalopathy. Infants less than 6 months of age are at highest risk for complications and mortality. Characteristic paroxysms of cough with an end inspiratory whoop occur in children. Infants may present with a nonspecific cough with associated apnea and cyanosis, without a whoop. Adolescents may be asymptomatic or have only a mild prolonged cough. An increased white blood count up to 100,000 with a lymphocytosis is characteristic early in the course of the disease. The preferred test for laboratory confirmation is the detection of
