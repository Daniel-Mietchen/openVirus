<p>PCV is now recommended universally for children younger than 24 months of age and older children at high risk due to underlying diseases. High risk children include those with sickle cell disease and other types of functional asplenia, human immunodeficiency ­syndrome, primary immunodeficiency, children receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and children with chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease. A 23-valent PCV is available for ­high risk children who need expanded serotype coverage. Children with sickle cell disease or functional asplenia should continue to receive antibiotic prophylaxis regardless of whether or not they have received pneumococcal vaccines.</p>
