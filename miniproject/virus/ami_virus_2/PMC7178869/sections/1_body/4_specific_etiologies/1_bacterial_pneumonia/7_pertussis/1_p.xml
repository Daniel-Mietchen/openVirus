<p>Pertussis, or “whooping cough” is a highly contagious respiratory tract infection caused by the Gram-negative pleomorphic bacillus 
 <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> and less commonly 
 <italic>Bordetella parapertussis</italic>. With the development and widespread use of a vaccine in the 1940s, a significant and sustained decrease in incidence has occurred. However, despite immunization rates greater than 80%, cyclical recurrences of the disease have occurred every 3–4 years since the 1980s. This is likely secondary to the waning of immunity in adolescents and young adults. Under-immunized or unimmunized infants are the most vulnerable. Nearly all deaths reported from pertussis occur in infants younger than 3 months of age.
