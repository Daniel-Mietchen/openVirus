<p>Respiratory infections in children with primary or acquired immunodeficiencies requiring intensive care are not uncommon. These infants and children are susceptible to many organisms that are rarely pathogenic in a normal host. Primary immunodefciencies include abnormalities or deficiencies in immunoglobulins and antibodies, T and B cells, phagocytes, natural killer cells, and complement. Acquired immunodeficiencies include asplenia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), corticosteroid therapy, and immunosuppresion used for marrow or solid organ transplants.</p>
