<p>Immunocompromised children can present with attenuated signs and symptoms of respiratory infections. In addition to physical examination and chest roentgenograms, these children often require chest computed tomography to better delineate the extent of disease. Bronchoalveolar lavage, needle aspiration, or lung biopsies might be required to make a definitive diagnosis. Pulmonary specimens should be tested for common bacteria as well as for Pneumocystis Carinii, acid-fast bacilli, Nocardia, Legionella, Crytococcus, Aspergillus, Candida, Histoplasma, Coccidioides, and Blastomyces. Viruses such as cytomegalovirus, varicella, herpes virus, and measles should be considered.</p>
