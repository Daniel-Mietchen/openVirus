<p>Some infants are at an increased risk for severe RSV disease such as those with chronic lung disease due to prematurity (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease, and immunodeficiencies. In children with cystic fibrosis, RSV accounted for 18% of symptomatic infections, 33% of hospitalizations for infants less than 1 year, and 43% of infants requiring mechanical ventilation. In a study of hospitalized infants with congenital heart disease infected with RSV, 33% required intensive care, 19% received mechanical ventilation, and 3.4% died. Children having undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplants who develop RSV infections have an extremely high mortality of 60â€“80% despite mechanical ventilation and antiviral therapy. Environmental factors such as crowding, passive exposure to tobacco smoke, and lack of breast-feeding are associated with the development of severe disease. Compared to national averages, Native American and Alaskan children younger than 1 year of age have higher rates of infections.</p>
