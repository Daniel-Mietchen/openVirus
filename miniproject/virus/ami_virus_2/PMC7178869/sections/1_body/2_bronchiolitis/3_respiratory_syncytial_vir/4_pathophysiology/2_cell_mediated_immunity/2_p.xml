<p>Children who require mechanical ventilation have lower peripheral T cell counts compared to hospitalized infants not requiring mechanical ventilation. These infants demonstrate low T cell proliferative responses and interferon (IFN-γ) production. IL-12 is required for the initiation of cellular immunity. The length of time requiring mechanical ventilation has been found to be inversely related to IL-12 production. The role of Th1/Th2-like cytokine profiles, expressed as IFN-γ/IL-4 ratios, is controversial. In some studies, these ratios decreased after polyclonal stimulation in hospitalized infants with RSV. However, more recent studies have shown normal ratios following polyclonal stimulation.</p>
