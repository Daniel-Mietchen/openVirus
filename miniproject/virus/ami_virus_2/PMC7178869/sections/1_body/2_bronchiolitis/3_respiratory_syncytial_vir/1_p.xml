<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for 50–80% of bronchiolitis, infecting one-half of all infants within the first year of life and hospitalizing approximately 120,000 infants yearly (about 3% of affected infants). Approximately 10% of these infants require mechanical ventilation. Co-infection with either hMPV or rhinovirus occurs in 10–30% of young children.
