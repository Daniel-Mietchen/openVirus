<p>Apnea often is the first presenting symptom of RSV bronchiolitis in small infants. The etiology of apnea remains unknown; however, is likely related to the immaturity of the respiratory control center in the brainstem. The incidence of apnea in infants with bronchiolitis is approximately 16â€“20%.</p>
