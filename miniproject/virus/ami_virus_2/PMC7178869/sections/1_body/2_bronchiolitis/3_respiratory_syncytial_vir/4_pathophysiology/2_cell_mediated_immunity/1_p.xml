<p>Epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages are key activators of cellular immunity. Although these cells enhance viral clearing, they also contribute to airway inflammation through the release of cytokines and chemokines. These include interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis Â­factor-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1-alpha and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted). Release of these cytokines and chemokines are believed to be partially responsible for airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. The effects of these mediators persist beyond the acute infection and contribute to prolonged pulmonary dysfunction.
