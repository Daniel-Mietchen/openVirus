<p>The anatomical differences between young infants and older children contribute to the severity of the disease in the young. Due to the highly compliant cartilaginous chest wall and poor thoracic musculature, the infant’s chest wall has difficulty countering the lung’s inherent tendency towards collapse. This leads to a greater propensity of small infants towards atelectasis compared with older children. The absence of effective collateral ventilation in infants also contributes to the development of atelectasis and impaired gas exchange. Cellular debris in small airways and peribronchial edema increase airways resistance leading to wheezing as the predominant symptom in some infants.</p>
