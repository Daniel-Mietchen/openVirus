<p>The heterogeneous nature of RSV induced lung disease can cause atelectasis in some areas and overdistension in others. Chest roentgenograms often show hyperinflation with flattening of the diaphragms and patchy or peribronchial infiltrates. Atelectasis, especially of the right upper lobe, is often seen. Infants may have high lung volumes with the functional residual capacity often being twice normal. The decrease in dynamic compliance and increase in airway resistance leads to marked increase in work of breathing, often worse during expiration from lower airway obstruction. Alterations in gas exchange and hypoxemia are secondary to a ventilation-perfusion mismatch.</p>
