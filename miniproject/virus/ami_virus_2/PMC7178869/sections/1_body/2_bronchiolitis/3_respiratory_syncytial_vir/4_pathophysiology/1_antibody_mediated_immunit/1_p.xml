<p>RSV introduced onto the nasal or conjunctival mucosal surface causes profuse rhinorrhea within a few days. During the first 2 months of life, passively acquired maternal antibodies are protective. However, as maternal antibody titers gradually decrease, infants become susceptible to severe disease. Cell-bound IgA may develop to help clear the virus. Circulating IgG directed against the glycoprotein (G) and fusion (F) proteins (operative in syncytia formation) on the viral surface will develop several days later. Infants less than 3 months of age appear to induce a weaker antibody response likely due to the presence of maternal antibodies. Virus-specific IgE in the respiratory tract is associated with disease severity. Often, complete and effective immune responses are not induced, thus re-infections are possible even during the same season.</p>
