<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was first isolated in 1957 and still represents the major cause of bronchiolitis. Other causative viruses include parainfluenza, adenovirus, enterovirus, influenza and most recently human metapneumovirus and human bocavirus (HBoV). In the northern hemisphere, RSV outbreaks occur from October to June. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) recently has been identified as the causative agent in 3–19% of bronchiolitis cases, possibly surpassing parainfluenza as the second most common etiology. Its prevalence is slightly higher in the late winter and spring. Parainfluenza infections peak at 10 months of age, representing approximately 7–10% of cases of bronchiolitis. Parainfluenza (PIV-3) is endemic throughout the year, but especially common in the late spring.</p>
