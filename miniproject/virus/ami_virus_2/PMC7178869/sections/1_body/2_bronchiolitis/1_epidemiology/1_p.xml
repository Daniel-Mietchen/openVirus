<p>Approximately one third of children develop bronchiolitis during the first 2 years of life. Of these, only 1 in 10 (3% of all infants in the United States) will require hospitalization. Although hospitalization rates have increased over the last three decades, mortality remains low. Overall mortality rate is 1â€“2%, but as high as 5% in high risk infants. Most deaths occur in infants younger than 6 months of age with co-morbidities such as prematurity, congenital heart disease, congenital or acquired lung disease or immunodeficiency.
