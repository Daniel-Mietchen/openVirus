<p>Palivizumab is a neutralizing humanized mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the RSV-F glycoprotein. It was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998 for premature infants and infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The randomized, double blind, placebo controlled IMpact-RSV trial involving 1,502 high risk infants found a significant reduction of 55% in hospitalizations. With the exception of very rare anaphylaxis, no significant adverse effects have been observed. Palivizumab has been approved for use in infants with congenital heart disease. The cardiac synagis study group included 1,287 children with congenital heart disease in a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial; it found a 45% relative reduction in RSV associated hospitalizations with no deaths attributable to the palivizumab. Since cardiopulmonary bypass can decrease serum drug concentrations by about 58%, it is recommended that an additional dose be given following surgery, if continued protection is desired.

  <p>Palivizumab should be used as preventive therapy in infants with chronic lung disease and congenital heart disease. Cardiopulmonary bypass significantly lowers the serum level of palivizumab, so it should be redosed following surgery if continued protection desired.</p>
