<p>In the 1990s, five randomized trials involving 225 infants, evaluating the effect of nebulized adrenaline (epinephrine) on bronchiolitis showed clinical improvement, with reductions in oxygen requirement, respiratory rate, wheezing, and decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance. Two of these studies showed lower hospital admission rates and earlier discharge. A 2004 Cochrane systematic review suggested a potential benefit with epinephrine administration. However, subsequent studies have not supported its routine use. As with albuterol, a clinical trial in selected infants seems reasonable.</p>
