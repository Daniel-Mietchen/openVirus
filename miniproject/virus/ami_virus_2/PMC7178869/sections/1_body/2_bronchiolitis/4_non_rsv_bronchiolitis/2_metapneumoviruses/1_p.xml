<p>The human metapneumoviruses (hMPV) are a group of RNA viruses of the Paramyxoviridae family identified in humans in 2001. hMPV appears to be the second most common cause of bronchiolitis in children throughout the world. The majority of children are born with maternal hMPV specific IgG which wanes to around 25% by 6–12 months of age. By age five, essentially 100% of children have been exposed to hMPV and will have neutralizing antibody to hMPV. There are two subgroups, A and B, with group A having more severe clinical symptoms. Clinical presentation of children with this virus is similar to RSV. The pulmonary inflammation generally peaks on day 5 which includes interstitial edema and inflammatory cell infiltrates of the bronchioles and alveoli. These inflammatory changes can persist for up to 21 days. About half of infected children are 0–12 months of age, and infection is primarily in the winter months.</p>
