<p>Human bocavirus (HBoV) was recently discovered in 2003. With amino acid sequencing, this new member of the Parvoviridae family was found to be closely related to the bovine parvovirus and the canine minute virus, hence the name bocavirus (BO for Bovine and CA for Canine). Detection of the HBoV from the respiratory tract in symptomatic children and its absence of detection in non-symptomatic controls strongly suggest the virus to have a role in respiratory infections in children. Co-infection is commonly described in up to 60% of samples. It remains unclear if HBoV is a primary pathogen or acts to exacerbate other viral illnesses. The pathogenesis of HBoV has not been well described, but with the high occurrence of wheezing and lower respiratory tract symptoms in children infected with the virus, it is speculated that this virus may be a significant contributor to asthma exacerbations. The majority of infected children have rhinorrhea, cough, and wheezing, however, diarrhea has been reported in up to 25% of these children. In children with high viral loads, HBoV has been detected in the serum suggesting the potential for disease beyond the respiratory tract.</p>
