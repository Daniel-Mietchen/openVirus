<p>Regardless of the viral etiology of bronchiolitis, supportive care remains the mainstay of treatment. Supplemental humidified oxygen is frequently needed. Due to many infants being obligate nasal breathers, frequent nasal suctioning may be beneficial to maintain an unobstructed upper airway. The affected infant or child is often unable to take adequate fluids complicated by increased insensible losses from the respiratory tract; hence, intravenous fluids may be required. Infants and children with severe respiratory distress should be kept NPO in the event respiratory failure ensues and endotracheal intubation is required. Antibiotics are not routinely indicated in previously healthy children infected with RSV. Progressive disease, leukocytosis, persistent fever, consolidation on radiograph or systemic toxicity should prompt an evaluation of bacterial co-infection and the use of empiric antibiotics.
