<p>Several studies have evaluated the benefit of surfactant and nitric oxide for severe respiratory distress. The results have been inconclusive and do not currently support their routine use. Heliox, a mixture of oxygen (20–30%) and helium (70–80%) with lower viscosity than air has been used successfully in cases of airway obstruction, croup, airway surgery, and asthma to reduce respiratory effort during the period of airway compromise. Several studies have shown improved respiratory distress scores in patients on heliox with continuous positive airway pressure obviating the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation.</p>
