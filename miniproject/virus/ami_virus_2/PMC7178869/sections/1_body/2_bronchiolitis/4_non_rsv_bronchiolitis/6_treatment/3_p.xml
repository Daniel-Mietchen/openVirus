<p>Ribavirin is the only FDA-approved antiviral drug for RSV. Ribavirin inhibits viral replication and is active against RSV, influenza A and B, adenoviruses, and hepatitis viruses. For lower respiratory tract diseases, ribavirin is typically administered via aerosolization. In 1996, a meta-analysis of studies involving ribavirin was discouraging and was consistent with the common clinical experience that ribavirin did not improve clinical outcomes. Therapy targeted at attenuating the virus-induced inflammatory cascade has also been disappointing. Corticosteroid administration was not associated with reduction in clinical scores, the need for hospitalization, or the length of hospitalization. Routine use of any corticosteroid given via any route (intravenous, enteral or aerosolized) is not indicated, except in patients with pre-existing chronic lung disease.</p>
