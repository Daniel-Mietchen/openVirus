<p>Rapid diagnostic assays are available for early detection of many viruses. The older assays are antigen-based and include indirect immunofluorescence/direct immunofluorescence (IFA/DFA), enzyme immunoassay (EIA), optical immunoassay (OIA), and neuraminidase activity assays. Although still widely used because they are inexpensive and technically simple, they have a low specificity and sensitivity. Molecular assays are becoming the new “gold standard” for respiratory virus detection – replacing tissue culture that may take days. The published sensitivities and specificities approach 100% when compared to tissue culture or antigen assay. These assays generally use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Significant advancements in these assays are being made to simplify the performance of the assay and decrease the required time. The most important cause of false negative test results remains poor specimen handling or inadequate sample collection. Other than aiding with cohorting of hospitalized patients, serologic detection of respiratory viruses is rarely clinically useful.</p>
