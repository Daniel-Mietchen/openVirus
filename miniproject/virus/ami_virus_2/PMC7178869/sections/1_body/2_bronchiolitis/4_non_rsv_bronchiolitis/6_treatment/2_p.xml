<p>High risk patients often require close monitoring and care in an intensive care unit. These include infants less than 6 weeks of age or infants with a history of prematurity, congenital heart disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, immunodeficiency or neurologic disease. Infants with RSV bronchiolitis typically have a combination of hyperinflation, pulmonary infiltrates, and atelectasis. Therefore, no one mode of ventilation can be recommended for all infants. Non-invasive positive pressure (NIIPP) modes (CPAP or BiPAP) may be attempted in infants where their primary respiratory embarrassment is secondary to atelectasis. However, this may not be suitable if the disease process appears severe or protracted as prolonged use of NIPP may make feeding difficult, cause breakdown of facial tissue, or be difficult to maintain without significant sedation that further compromises ventilation. If an infant requires endotracheal intubation, the mode of mechanical ventilation should be tailored to the predominant lung pathology present (i.e. atelectasis versus hyperinflation). Children with significant air trapping may need mechanical ventilation similar to a child with asthma, providing low respiratory rates and longer inspiration and exhalation times. The more typical infant will lose functional residual capacity (FRC) because of atelectasis and alveolar infiltrates. Therefore, despite having some air trapping, these infants often need PEEP to be adjusted to recruit alveoli and return FRC to normal. In the setting of elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) which may occur in infants with congenital heart disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia, lowering PVR by traditional methods such as maintaining oxygenation, deep sedation, muscle relaxation and even nitric oxide may be indicated.</p>
