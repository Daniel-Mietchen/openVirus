<p>There are three subtypes of human parainfluenza viruses. HPIV-3 is most frequently isolated from children with bronchiolitis, while PIV-1 and PIV-2 most commonly cause croup. Similar to RSV, both cell-mediated hyper-responsiveness to viral antigen and virus-specific IgE responses are observed in children with parainfluenza bronchiolitis. Upper airway edema with concomitant obstructive symptoms may be present. Children that are infected with parainfluenza have a significant likelihood of developing asthma later in life.</p>
