<p>Bronchodilators have not shown a clear benefit in patients with acute RSV bronchiolitis. In 12 randomized control trials, involving 843 infants, evaluating the effect of salbutamol or albuterol on bronchiolitis, 9 (75%) showed no effect. The remaining three studies demonstrated only a small transient improvement in the acute clinical score. Although the routine use of bronchodilator therapy cannot be recommended, it has become acceptable practice to attempt to see if individual infants are beta agonist responsive or not. If no clinical response is seen after a trial of a beta agonist, its use should be discontinued.</p>
