<p>Complicated parapneumonic effusions or empyemas occur when the fluid becomes purulent. During this stage, the effusions undergo a fibrinopurulent stage with many polymorphonuclear leukocytes, bacteria, and cellular debris entering the fluid. Fibrin is deposited over the pleural surfaces and loculations begin to form. The pH and glucose levels fall as the LDH levels rise. If untreated, they often progress to a third organizing stage in which the exudate develops into an inelastic, fibrotic peel that restricts the lung. Simple parapneumonic effusions usually resolve with thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy and antibiotic treatment of the pneumonia. More complicated parapneumonic effusions have been successfully treated with thoracotomy tubes and fibrinolytics. However, although risks for bleeding are reportedly low, this therapy requires close monitoring of chest tube drainage and instillation of expensive medications with intermittent clamping of the chest tube. No single recommendation for the choice of fibrinolytic agent or dosage has been established. Also, if tried late in the organizing phase, this is often unsuccessful due to loculations and the high viscosity of the purulent fluid. Surgical debridement either by open procedure or by video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) is often needed for organizing, complicated parapneumonic effusions. Multiple studies have reported that early VATS or thoracotomy for empyema leads to a shorter hospital stay. The treatment modality is best determined by the temporal stage and nature of the effusion.
