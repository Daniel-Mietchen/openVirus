<p>Pneumonias can often be complicated by the development of pleural effusions and empyemas. These occur when the fluid production by the interstitial lung tissue exceeds the maximum pleural lymphatic flow. Parapneumonic effusions often occur from pneumonia as white blood cells and other debris of infection block the lymphatics resulting in elevation of protein in the pleural space, increase in colloid osmotic pressure, and consequent failure of fluid reabsorption. On physical exam, the child will have decreased breath sounds over the effusion. In older children, auscultatory percussion changes might be appreciated. Plain chest radiographs can reveal most clinically significant effusions. Ultrasound and chest computed tomograms are useful in determining the volume and quality of the fluid and the presence of loculations. Simple parapneumonic effusions or transudates can also be differentiated from exudates by using the criteria of Light et al. (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2_25" ref-type="table">25-2</xref>). A pleural fluid pH less than 7.2 indicates a complicated effusion that is likely exudative and requires drainage whereas a pleural fluid pH more than 7.3 suggests that the effusion may be managed with systemic antibiotics alone.
