<p>Children with moderate or severe respiratory insufficiency often require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Children with respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia often require increased positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), increased inspiratory time, and aggressive pulmonary toilet to recruit alveoli. For patients requiring high levels of PEEP, adequate sedation is often required to prevent patient/ventilator asynchrony and barotrauma. Spontaneous respirations should be encouraged while on mechanical ventilation. Rarely, the use of neuromuscular blockade is required to allow mechanical ventilation. Prone positioning may improve ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatching in dependent lung regions. Lung protective strategies allowing permissive hypercapnea with small lung volumes to ventilate and appropriate PEEP to maintain alveolar recruitment is recommended for children with pneumonia. High frequency oscillatory ventilation can also be utilized to maintain mean airway pressure and alveolar recruitment. Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) provides recruitment of alveoli while allowing spontaneous respirations. In children with severe respiratory distress syndrome, treatment with bovine surfactant may improve oxygenation. Extracorporeal life support continues to have a role in children with reversible severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure refractory to mechanical ventilation.</p>
