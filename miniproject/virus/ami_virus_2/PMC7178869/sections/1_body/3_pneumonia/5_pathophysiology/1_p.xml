<p>Pathogens entering the lower airways evoke an exudative consolidation of pulmonary tissues. Initially, there is hyperemia of lung parenchyma due to vascular engorgement and capillary leak causing exudation and intra-alveolar fluid accumulation. Fibrin is then deposited and the airways are infiltrated with neutrophils. Consolidation causes a decrease in lung compliance and vital capacity and a total reduction in the surface area available for gas exchange. A physiologic shunt (V/Q mismatch) occurs as there is increased blood flow through poorly ventilated segments of lung, resulting in hypoxia. Compensatory hypoxic vasoconstriction may occur in an attempt to reduce V/Q mismatch and hypoxia, especially in localized areas of consolidation.</p>
