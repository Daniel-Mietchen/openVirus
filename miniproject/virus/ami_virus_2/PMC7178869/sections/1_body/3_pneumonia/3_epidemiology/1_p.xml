<p>Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common, and at times, a serious infection in children. The incidence of CAP is 35–40 cases per 1,000 children less than 5 years of age and 11–16 cases per 1,000 children 5–14 years of age. The exact prevalence of the etiologic agents causing pediatric pneumonia is difficult to ascertain. It is often difficult to differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia based solely on clinical examination. Specific pathogens causing CAP can be determined in only approximately one-third of children using commonly available cultures, antigen detection, or serologic techniques. Blood cultures yield pathogens in only about 10–15% of infants and children with bacterial CAP and many children do not undergo viral testing as it is often unnecessary. With these inherent limitations, it is generally thought that viruses account for approximately 80% of CAP in children under the age of 2 years and approximately 50% of CAP in preschool children ages 2–5 years. Viral causes decline in the school age and adolescent child and bacterial causes such as
