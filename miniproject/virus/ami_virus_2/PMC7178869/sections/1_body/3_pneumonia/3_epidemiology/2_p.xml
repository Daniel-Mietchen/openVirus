<p>Overall, bacteria account for 20–30% of community-acquired pneumonias. The likelihood of infection with different bacteria varies by age. In the newborn period, organisms from the maternal genital tract are likely causes and include 
 <italic>Group B Streptococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, enteric Gram-negative bacilli, 
 <italic>Listeria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Chlamydia</italic>. In older infants, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> becomes a significant cause and remains so until 6 years of age. 
 <italic>Group A Streptococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> are uncommon causes. 
 <italic>Moraxella catarralis</italic> is a common cause of upper respiratory tract disease, but rarely causes pneumonia. About 20% of infants with pertussis will have bacterial co-infection. In children older than 6 years of age, 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> remains the most common cause. 
 <italic>Hemophilus influenzae type B</italic> (HIB), and most recently 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, have decreased significantly as causes of CAP due to the widespread use of effective vaccines.

  <p>It is difficult to determine the etiologic agent causing pneumonia, but when microbial agents are identified, bacteria are isolated in 20–30%.</p>
