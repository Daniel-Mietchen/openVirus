<p>In the older child and young adolescent, the atypical pneumonias, 
 <italic>Mycoplasma</italic> and 
 <italic>Chlamydia</italic>, become more prevalent and viral causes less common. Rare bacterial pneumonias can occur with animal contact and include: 
 <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> (rabbits); 
 <italic>Chlamydia psittaci</italic> (parrots and birds); 
 <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> (sheep); and 
 <italic>Salmonella choleraesuis</italic> (pigs). Children with congenital anatomical defects, immunodeficiencies, and genetic disorders are at increased risk for bacterial, viral and fungal pneumonia.
