<p>The airways are normally sterile below the sublaryngeal area to the lung parenchyma. There are several protective mechanisms that include anatomic and mechanical factors, local immune defenses, and the systemic immune response. Microbes are filtered by nasal hairs or are expelled from the airways by the epiglottic reflex, cough reflex, and mucociliary apparatus. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the predominant immunoglobulin present in the upper respiratory tract. IgA is able to bind two antigens simultaneously, forming large antigen-antibody complexes. In this manner, the microbes are neutralized and removed by ciliary clearance, thus preventing microbial binding to the epithelium. In the lower tract, immunoglobulin G (IgG) provides humoral protection by opsonizing microbes for phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages, activating the complement cascade, and by neutralizing bacterial endotoxin. Alveolar macrophages produce superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radicals that serve an important role in the host defense; however, uncontrolled production can lead to lung injury. In addition to oxygen radicals, a number of cytokines are produced by the alveolar macrophages. These include IL–1, IL-6, TNF, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), chemotactic factors, platelet derived growth factor, and M-CSF. These cytokines play a central role in phagocytic recruitment and activation.</p>
