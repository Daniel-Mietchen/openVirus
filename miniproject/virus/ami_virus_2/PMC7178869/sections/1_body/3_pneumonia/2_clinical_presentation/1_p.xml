<p>Signs and symptoms of pneumonia are non-specific and may be occult in the young infant. Children often have fever, chills, headache, malaise, restlessness, and irritability. Gastrointestinal complaints such as abdominal pain, distention, or emesis may also be present in young children. The symptoms are often preceded by minor upper respiratory tract infections characterized by low-grade fever and rhinorrhea. With more significant involvement of the lower respiratory tract, tachypnea, dyspnea, cough, nasal flaring, grunting, or retractions may be seen. The older child may demonstrate productive sputum and complain of pleuritic chest pain. On auscultation of the chest, rales and/or decreased breath sounds might be heard over areas of consolidation or pleural effusions. However, due the short path for transmission of breath sounds and the small chest size in infants, breath sounds may not be decreased, even in the presence of effusions. Children with pleural irritation might prefer to lie on the affected side with legs flexed and may complain of radiating pain to the neck and shoulder or into the abdomen.</p>
