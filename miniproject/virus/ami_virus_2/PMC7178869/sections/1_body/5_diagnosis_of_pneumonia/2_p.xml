<p>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be safely used to obtain secretions from the lower airways for Gram stain and culture. It is especially useful in the diagnosis of pneumonia in the immunocompromised child. However, BAL performed directly through the bronchoscope carries a risk of contamination. The smallest bronchoscope that can accommodate a protected specimen brush is 4.8 mm and requires a 6.5 mm endotracheal tube for passage. The smallest flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope with a suction channel has an external diameter of 2.8 mm and is too small to admit a double-sheathed brush. Non-bronchoscopic double-lumen plugged catheters can be inserted blindly through the endotracheal tube to obtain a non-contaminated specimen. The sensitivity and specificity of these samples are similar to those obtained by a bronchoscopic guided protected specimen. Transthoracic needle aspirations are performed in some centers with good results. One study reported a diagnostic success rate in 59% of patients. The incidence of pneumothorax was approximately 20%, but none required subsequent placement of a pleural drainage catheter. A lung biopsy is rarely needed to make a definitive diagnosis.</p>
