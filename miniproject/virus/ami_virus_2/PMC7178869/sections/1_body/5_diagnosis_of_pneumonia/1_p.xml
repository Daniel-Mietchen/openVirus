<p>Determination of the etiologic agent in pneumonia is difficult. Fortunately, in most ­community-acquired pneumonias, identification of the specific causative organism is not critical. However, in children with a complicated course that fails to respond to standard therapies, definitive diagnosis of the etiologic agent is essential. Complete blood counts, inflammatory markers, and chest radiographs do not differentiate the causative agents for pneumonia. Blood cultures are rarely positive outside of the neonatal period. Rapid antigen tests are available for RSV, parainfluenza, influenza, and adenovirus. Nasopharyngeal swabs for viral cultures generally take 7–8 days to become positive, and in one study, 86% of the patients had been discharged prior to the positive results. Older children and adolescents might be able to produce sputum for Gram stain and culture. An adequate specimen should contain more the 25 leukocytes and fewer than 25 squamous epithelial cells per low-power field. In the intubated patient, sputum can be more easily acquired. However, interpretation of the results of Gram stains and cultures is at times difficult in differentiating colonizing from pathologic organisms. Colonization of the endotracheal tube may occur as early as 12 h, but most frequently between 60 and 96 h. The oropharynx becomes colonized within 36 h, the stomach at 36–60 h, and the lower respiratory tract between 60 and 84 h. In addition, a comparison of infectious agents isolated by both tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage found only 36% concordance.</p>
