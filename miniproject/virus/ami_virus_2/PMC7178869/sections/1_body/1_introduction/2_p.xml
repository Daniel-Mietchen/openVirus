<p>Viral bronchiolitis remains the leading cause for hospital admission in infancy and the most frequent cause of acute respiratory failure in children admitted to pediatric intensive care units in North America. Pneumonia in children younger than 5 years of age has an annual incidence of 34â€“40 cases per 1,000. Community acquired pneumonia can also lead to severe respiratory compromise especially in children with pre-existing disease.

This chapter will focus on bronchiolitis and pneumonia as the two leading causes of pulmonary infections leading to PICU admission.</p>
