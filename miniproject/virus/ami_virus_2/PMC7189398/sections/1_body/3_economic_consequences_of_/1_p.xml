   <p id="Par107">National and international relief funds have been constituted to mitigate the world through the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the SPRP estimates a funding support of nearly US$675 million for key response efforts against COVID-19 in countries most in need of help through April 2020. A first-of-its-kind COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund was constituted for arranging for funding support through individual and organizational donations on March 13, 2020.

   <p id="Par108">Increased fiscal distress due to decrease in tax revenues and increased expenditures are expected in low middle-income countries, where fiscal framework is weak.
