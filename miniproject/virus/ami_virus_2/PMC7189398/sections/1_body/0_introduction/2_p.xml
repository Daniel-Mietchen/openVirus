<p id="Par14">As against the earlier guidelines of WHO where it classified a pandemic into six stages, the 2009 revision in pandemic descriptors and stages stands today as follows:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par15">
    <italic>Predominantly animal infections, few human infections</italic>. This corresponds with the stages 1–3 of earlier classification, starting with phase 1 where the virus is in its animal host and has caused no known infection in humans, phase 2 where zoonosis has occurred and the virus has caused infection in humans, and phase 3 where sporadic cases or clusters of infectious disease occur in humans. Human-to-human transmission is limited in time and space and is insufficient to cause community-level outbreaks.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par16">
    <italic>Sustained human–human transmission</italic>. Corresponds with the stage 4 of the classical description wherein animal–human and human–human transmissions have sustained a community-level outbreak. The risk for pandemic is greatly increased.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par17">
    <italic>Widespread human infection</italic> or the stage 5–6 from the classical description where the same identified virus has caused a community-level outbreak in another country in another WHO region.

  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par18">
    <italic>Post-peak period</italic> where there exists a possibility of recurrence of infection.

   <p id="Par19">
    <italic>Post-pandemic phase</italic> when the disease activity is seasonal (
