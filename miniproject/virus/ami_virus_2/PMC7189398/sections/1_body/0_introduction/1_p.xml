<p id="Par13">The present-day pandemic spotlight on COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) was earlier placed on Zika virus, H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), chikangunya, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola. The “advancements” of the human race—increased urbanization, global travel, changes in land use, and fervent exploitation of the nature—are also the prime reasons for zoonosis and emergence of novel infectious diseases such as above (Madhav et al.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
