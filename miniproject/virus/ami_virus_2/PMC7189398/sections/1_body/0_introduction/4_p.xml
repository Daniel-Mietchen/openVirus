<p id="Par21">WHO and other leading epidemiology organizations unanimously agree on the indispensable role of pandemic preparation and planning at global and national levels to mitigate through the present public health emergency of COVID-19 and any future outbreaks. Pandemic preparation is not a job of single individual or organization. It requires inputs from each person susceptible to the infection agent as well as policy makers at national and international levels, frontline healthcare providers, infrastructure developers and maintenance personnel, pharmaceutical industry and researcher community, and so forth. Moreover, the pandemic preparedness plan needs constant reviewing and improvisation (

In line with the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide action plans have been activated on national and international levels. The United Nations’ 
 <italic>Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRS) Against COVID-19</italic>, in layman terms, is designed to control human–human transmission, preventing outbreaks and delaying spread; provide optimal care for all patients; and minimize the impact on healthcare systems and socioeconomic activities. Under SPRS each nation is assessed for risk and vulnerability, and the resource requirements to support the country to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 are estimated. Several nations are well placed to implement this action plan with minimal support. However, otherwise partners are to be introduced to facilitate implementation of measures where there is a gap in capacity, on either a national or a subnational level, in additional support to national governments. Thus, an extensive analysis and identification of an affected nation’s gaps and needs shall be the basis to develop a 
 <italic>COVID-19 Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP)</italic>. These CPRPs will need constant monitoring and reviewing using indicators charted in the SPRP and updated as the situation evolves (
