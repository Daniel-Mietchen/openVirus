<p id="Par88">Personal and public hygiene/disinfection implementation is a key step to control transmission and prevent community outbreaks. Good hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene have been aggressively promoted by WHO worldwide in this COVID-19 pandemic. The basic personal and public hygiene practices are depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">14.3</xref>. A key parameter to consider while disinfecting in households and public places hence avoid contact with infected surfaces is the estimation of decay rates of CoV-2 in aerosols and on various materials composing the surfaces. It has been estimated that CoV-2 in an aerosol (&lt;5 μm, similar to those observed in samples obtained from the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans) was viable for up to 3 h, up to 4 h on copper surfaces, up to 24 h on cardboard, and 2–3 days on plastic and stainless steel (van Doremalen et al.
