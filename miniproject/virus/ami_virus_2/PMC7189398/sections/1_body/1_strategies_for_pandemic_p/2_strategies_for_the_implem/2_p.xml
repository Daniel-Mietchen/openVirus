<p id="Par67">The coronavirus causing COVID-19 was first isolated from a clinical sample on January 7, 2020, and within weeks, several reliable and sensitive diagnostic tools were developed and deployed. By mid-January, the first RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 were accessible in Hubei. The viral sequences and PCR primers and probe sequences were open-sourced and uploaded to public platforms by the Centre for Disease Control, China. By February, there were ten kits for the detection of COVID-19 approved in China by the National Medical Products Association—six were RT-PCR kits, one isothermal amplification kit, one virus sequencing product, and two colloidal gold antibody detection kits (

As of today, when the disease has assumed pandemic proportions, the volume of diagnostic tools needs to be multiplied, and hence, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has provided regulatory relief to several testing companies like ThermoFisher, Hologic, and LabCorp under the Emergency Use Authorizations, to facilitate ease of diagnosis. Also it is keeping a tight watch on fraudulent companies claiming to sell interventions against COVID-19 (

Moreover, the world’s first CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based diagnostic kit has been developed for COVID-19 by Mammoth Biosciences, USA, and University of California. Notably, the diagnostic kit is a simple strip-based assay and is easy to use and allows rapid detection without the need of transporting samples over long distances. The kit is still under approval evaluation by the FDA (
