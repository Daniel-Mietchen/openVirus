 <sub>0</sub> was 2.68, each confirmed case infected 2–3 other people, and the epidemic doubling time was 6.4 days. Also, the size of the outbreak in Wuhan was estimated to be up to 75,815 people (statistical uncertainty presented at 95% credible intervals). Most striking feature of this model was that it took into account the travel data from and to Wuhan over the period of study. Thus, it was able to predict that multiple major Chinese cities—Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen—had already imported the infection to trigger local epidemics. It also recommended that controlling the transmissibility by 25–50% could eventually rein the local epidemics, and a control of ≥63% would phase out the epidemics (Wu et al.
