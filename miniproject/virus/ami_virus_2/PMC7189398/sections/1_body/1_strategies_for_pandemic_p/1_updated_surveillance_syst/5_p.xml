<p id="Par45">The most prominent mathematical model of COVID-19 infection is the 
 <italic>SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model</italic> put forth by Wu and coworkers and also endorsed by the WHO. This model estimates the size of epidemic in Wuhan between December 2019 and January 2020 and forecasts the extent of domestic and global public health risks of taking into account for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. It is a compartmental model comprising four compartments and the individuals comprising the sample population move through each compartment—“Susceptible” (not immune to infection) and get infected from other infection individuals and move to the “Exposed” compartment for the incubation period. Hereafter the infectious individuals move to the “Infected” compartment and eventually to the “Recovered” compartment after the disease has run its course, and they now have some immunity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">14.2</xref>). The changes in the population in each compartment are estimated using ordinary differential equations to simulate the progression of an infectious disease. The critical parameters associated with this model are:
