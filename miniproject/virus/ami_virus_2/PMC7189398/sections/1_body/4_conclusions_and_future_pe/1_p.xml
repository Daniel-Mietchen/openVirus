<p id="Par110">On March 19, 2020, worldwide 191,127 confirmed cases were reported, mortality was 7807 against 118,319 confirmed cases, and mortality of 280 on March 13, 2020 when the COVID-19 crisis was declared a pandemic (

It is increasingly becoming evident that no region of the world will remain untouched by CoV-2 invasion. However, pandemic preparedness is the key to tackle the present-day COVID-19 health emergency worldwide. The rapid and effective enforcement of existing international and national action plans, as well as parallel review and improvisation, is facilitating the affected countries to contain transmission and possibly delay the peak of outbreak and mortality and garner recovery. It is notable that in the present pandemic scenario, innovative AI-powered surveillance, quick and strategic response actions—the trinity of testing-isolation-contact tracing, committed social distancing measures—travel restrictions, self-isolation, implementation of personal and public hygiene, and extensive mobilization of medical care facilities are helping the world mitigate through. The most insightful trend emerging from the global clinical and epidemiological data is that the identification of asymptomatic infected individuals is a crucial step to contain community outbreaks. For preventing future outbreaks of CoV-2 infection, high-volume cutting-edge investigations are warranted in understanding the COVID-19 pathology, CoV-2 origin, biology, structural data of potential surface antigens, and precise anti-CoV-2 antiviral therapies. Although the global economy is suffering at the hands of CoV-2, it is important to review the current action plans and suitably improvise the future action plans to avoid potential recurrence.
