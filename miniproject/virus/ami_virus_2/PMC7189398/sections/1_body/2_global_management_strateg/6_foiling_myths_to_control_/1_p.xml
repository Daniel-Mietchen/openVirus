<p id="Par94">The COVID-19 pandemic in today’s times of excessive electronic connectivity and several social media platforms has a potential to alleviate the global mental stress levels. Especially, if local myths and rumors are circulated in the already home-quarantined population, restriction in fear of the disease can lead to additional mass hysteria. Thus it is important to create awareness and dispel any negative myth, as put forth by the WHO in context of CoV-2 (

Some myths dispelled are:

   <p id="Par95">COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates or cold and snowy climates. CoV-2 can be transmitted in all areas.</p>

   <p id="Par98">Heat generated from hand dryers is not effective against killing CoV-2 on your hands. The only way to disinfect hands is washing with soap-water or alcohol-based sanitizers.</p>

   <p id="Par99">Thermal scanners are effective in detecting only the elevated body temperatures. A confirmatory nucleic acid test is the most guaranteed test.</p>

   <p id="Par100">All age groups can be infected by CoV-2. Elderly people and people with pre-existing medical conditions—asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease— are more vulnerable to exhibit severe COVID-19. Thus, WHO advises people from all age groups to protect themselves by implementing good hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene.</p>

   <p id="Par101">SARS-CoV-2 is not a bioengineered organism arising out of manipulations from earlier SARS-CoV. Andersen and coworkers have analyzed the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus-2 and compared it with several other zoonotic viruses. They claim that the viral–human point of contact—the high affinity receptor binding domain of CoV-2 binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the target host—is acquired through natural selection. Also they have shed light of probable animal host being
