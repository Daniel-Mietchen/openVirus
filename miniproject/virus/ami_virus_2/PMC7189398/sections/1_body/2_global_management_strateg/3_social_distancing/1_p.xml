<p id="Par91">It is a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control intervention to avoid or control contact between infectious and uninfected individuals to rein the disease transmission in a community eventually culminating into decreased infection spread, morbidity and mortality. The individuals infected with CoV-2 shed the virus from their respiratory tract during the early infection stage when there are minor clinical manifestations leading to the extensive community transmission. While practicing social distancing, each healthy individual behaves like an infected individual, self-restricting contact with others. The main advantage is gleaned when an individual in incubation period/early infectious stage of COVID-19 restricts coming in contact with other healthy individuals. This strategy involves the policymakers, and strict advisories/orders are issued under the pandemic action plan to restrict public gatherings and events, shutting down of educational institutes/offices/restaurants, avoiding nonessential travel and use of public transport, maintaining a distance of 1Â m at least between two individuals, restricting visit to hospitals, and avoiding online shopping. Additionally, the elderly and individuals with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer are at a higher mortality risk (
