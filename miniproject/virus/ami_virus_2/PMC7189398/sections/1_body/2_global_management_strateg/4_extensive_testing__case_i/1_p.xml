<p id="Par92">The WHO Director-General at a media briefing on COVID-19 on March 16, 2020, recommends 
 <italic>testing</italic> of any suspected case,

 <italic>contact tracing</italic> for the prior 2 days the subject came in contact with and then testing them as well (

A case in point—South Korea carried out 286,716 COVID-19 tests until March 17, 2020—second highest across the world trailing behind China (

Social distancing combined with case isolation and contact tracing has demonstrated its effectiveness in controlling the transmission from imported infection cases to the community transmission scenario (Wilder-Smith and Freedman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). The relevance of case isolation and contact tracing are highlighted in a study by Hu and coworkers where they have performed a clinical characterization of 24 asymptomatic patients—confirming infection by a laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus nucleic acid from pharyngeal swab samples. The asymptomatic cases did not present any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. About 20.8% developed classical symptoms of fever, cough, and fatigue, during hospitalization; 50.0% presented CT images of ground-glass chest and 20.8% presented stripe shadowing in the lungs; 29.2% cases presented normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization, comprising the younger subset (median age: 14.0 years). None developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and no mortality was observed. However, epidemiological investigation indicated at typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This study puts a spotlight on close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Case isolation and continuous nucleic acid tests are also recommended (Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>). De-isolating of suspect cases where the first confirmatory test has returned negative is also an emerging issue of concern and needs improvement in testing capacity as well as strict implementation of social distancing during pandemic scenarios (Tay et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>).
