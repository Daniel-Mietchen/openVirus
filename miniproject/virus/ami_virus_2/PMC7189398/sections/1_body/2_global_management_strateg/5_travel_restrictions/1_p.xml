<p id="Par93">Approaching January 13, 2020, the daily risk of exporting at least a one COVID-19 infected individual from mainland China through international travel exceeded 95%. For containment of the global spread of CoV-2 and a COVID-19 epidemic, China implemented border control measures—airport screening and travel restrictions, and were later also adopted by several other countries. Wells and coworkers in their study in Proceedings of Natural Academy of Sciences used daily incidence data of COVID-19 outbreak from China from December 8, 2019, to February 15, 2020, as well as airline network data, to predict the number of exported cases with and without measures of travel restriction and screening. The group put forth that the lockdown of Wuhan and 15 more cities in Hubei province on January 23–24, 2020, averted export of 779 more COVID-19 cases by mid-February. However, it is to be highlighted that these travel restrictions and lockdown measures only slowed the rate of infection exportation from China to other countries. The global spread of COVID-19 was based on most cases arriving during the asymptomatic incubation period. The authors recommend rapid contact tracing at the epicenter and at importation sites to limit human-to-human transmission outside of the location of first outbreak (Wells et al.
