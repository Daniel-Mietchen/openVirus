Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">COVID-19, arising from novel, zoonotic coronavirus-2, has gripped the world in a pandemic. The present chapter discusses the current internationally implemented pandemic preparedness strategies succeeding/recommended to curb the COVID-19 threat to humankind. The updated phase-wise categorization of a pandemic as recommended by the WHO is described, and associated innovations in surveillance, response, and medical measures/advisory in practice across the globe are elaborated. From a birdâ€™s eye view, the COVID-19 pandemic management relies on revolutionizing the disease surveillance by incorporating artificial intelligence and data analytics, boosting the response strategiesâ€"extensive testing, case isolation, contact tracing, and social distancingâ€"and promoting awareness and access to pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are discussed in the present chapter. We also preview the economic bearing of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="Par13">The present-day pandemic spotlight on COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-2019) was earlier placed on Zika virus, H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), chikangunya, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola. The â€œadvancementsâ€� of the human raceâ€"increased urbanization, global travel, changes in land use, and fervent exploitation of the natureâ€"are also the prime reasons for zoonosis and emergence of novel infectious diseases such as above (Madhav et al. <a href="#CR17">2017</a>; Ahmed et al. <a href="#CR2">2019</a>). This rapid emergence of novel infectious diseases transmitting from surrounding animal life to humans and then from human to human, traveling quickly across the globe can trigger worldwide public health emergency situations, as prevalent today (<a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19-11March2020">https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19-11March2020</a>, <a href="http://www.emro.who.int/fr/about-who/rc61/zoonotic-diseases.html">http://www.emro.who.int/fr/about-who/rc61/zoonotic-diseases.html</a>). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020. MeSH database defines pandemics asâ€"â€œEpidemics of infectious disease that have spread to many countries, often more than one continent, and usually affecting a large number of people.â€� Such emergencies compromise human health, society, economics, and politicsâ€"a case in point: the COVID-19 pandemic is forecasted to cost the global economy one trillion US dollars (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=pandemics">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/?term=pandemics</a>, <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059011">https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059011</a>).</p> <p id="Par14">As against the earlier guidelines of WHO where it classified a pandemic into six stages, the 2009 revision in pandemic descriptors and stages stands today as follows: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par15"><i>Predominantly animal infections, few human infections</i>. This corresponds with the stages 1â€"3 of earlier classification, starting with phase 1 where the virus is in its animal host and has caused no known infection in humans, phase 2 where zoonosis has occurred and the virus has caused infection in humans, and phase 3 where sporadic cases or clusters of infectious disease occur in humans. Human-to-human transmission is limited in time and space and is insufficient to cause community-level outbreaks.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par16"><i>Sustained humanâ€"human transmission</i>. Corresponds with the stage 4 of the classical description wherein animalâ€"human and humanâ€"human transmissions have sustained a community-level outbreak. The risk for pandemic is greatly increased.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par17"><i>Widespread human infection</i> or the stage 5â€"6 from the classical description where the same identified virus has caused a community-level outbreak in another country in another WHO region.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par18"><i>Post-peak period</i> where there exists a possibility of recurrence of infection.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par19"><i>Post-pandemic phase</i> when the disease activity is seasonal (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110910112007/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf">https://web.archive.org/web/20110910112007/http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/GIPA3AideMemoire.pdf</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-health-who-idUKKCN20I0PD">https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-health-who-idUKKCN20I0PD</a>).</p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p id="Par20">At the time of writing this chapter, coronavirus-2 (CoV-2)/COVID-19, though originated in Wuhan, China, the first case being reported in November 2019, had pervaded Africa, Americas, Europe, South-East Asia, Eastern Mediterranean, and the Western Pacific nations with 191,127 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and claimed 7807 lives, globally (<a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200318-sitrep-58-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=20876712_2">https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200318-sitrep-58-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=20876712_2</a>). Europe was declared the new epicenter of the pandemic on March 13, 2020. The number of new cases in China though declining and is believed to be in post-peak stage, the numbers are alarmingly increasing worldwide (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/europe-now-epicenter-pandemic-who-says-n1158341">https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/europe-now-epicenter-pandemic-who-says-n1158341</a>).</p> <p id="Par21">WHO and other leading epidemiology organizations unanimously agree on the indispensable role of pandemic preparation and planning at global and national levels to mitigate through the present public health emergency of COVID-19 and any future outbreaks. Pandemic preparation is not a job of single individual or organization. It requires inputs from each person susceptible to the infection agent as well as policy makers at national and international levels, frontline healthcare providers, infrastructure developers and maintenance personnel, pharmaceutical industry and researcher community, and so forth. Moreover, the pandemic preparedness plan needs constant reviewing and improvisation (<a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/seasonal-influenza/preparedness/why-pandemic-preparedness">https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/seasonal-influenza/preparedness/why-pandemic-preparedness</a>). In line with the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide action plans have been activated on national and international levels. The United Nationsâ€™ <i>Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRS) Against COVID-19</i>, in layman terms, is designed to control humanâ€"human transmission, preventing outbreaks and delaying spread; provide optimal care for all patients; and minimize the impact on healthcare systems and socioeconomic activities. Under SPRS each nation is assessed for risk and vulnerability, and the resource requirements to support the country to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 are estimated. Several nations are well placed to implement this action plan with minimal support. However, otherwise partners are to be introduced to facilitate implementation of measures where there is a gap in capacity, on either a national or a subnational level, in additional support to national governments. Thus, an extensive analysis and identification of an affected nationâ€™s gaps and needs shall be the basis to develop a <i>COVID-19 Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP)</i>. These CPRPs will need constant monitoring and reviewing using indicators charted in the SPRP and updated as the situation evolves (<a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/covid-19-sprp-unct-guidelines.pdf">https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/covid-19-sprp-unct-guidelines.pdf</a>).</p> <p id="Par22">Grossly, the extent of success of each pandemic action plan stands on the following pillars: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par23">Surveillance of coronavirus-2 and COVID-19 infection: characterization of the virus, infection modes, diagnosing and detecting infection, contact tracing, annotation of data from confirmed cases, predicting mass infection outbreak, keeping a count, and estimation of mortality.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par24">Response management: bulk production and supply of protective/preventive pharmaceutical interventions or non-pharmaceutical interventions.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par25">Facilitating timely medical help: access to hospitals/healthcare providers, personal and public hygiene, disinfection, and quarantine services.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par26">Lesson learning from the present outbreak of COVID-19 to facilitate future action plans and preparedness.</p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p id="Par27">Hereafter we discuss the present salient strategies under the aegis of the COVID-19 pandemic preparation plan, globally, which are helping the humankind mitigate through this emergency. We also discuss the impact of COVID-19 on world economy and its bearing on future preparedness plans.</p> </div> <div class="strategiesforpandemicpreparednessforcoronavirus" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Strategies for Pandemic Preparedness for Coronavirus</div> <div class="updatedsurveillancesystems" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Updated Surveillance Systems</div> <p id="Par28">As defined by the WHO, surveillance during pandemics is defined as â€œthe ongoing collection, interpretation and dissemination of data to enable the development and implementation of evidence-based interventions during a pandemic eventâ€� (<a href="https://www.who.int/influenza/preparedness/pandemic/WHO_Guidance_for_surveillance_during_an_influenza_pandemic_082017.pdf">https://www.who.int/influenza/preparedness/pandemic/WHO_Guidance_for_surveillance_during_an_influenza_pandemic_082017.pdf</a>). The present-day key worldwide surveillance activities against COVID-19 include: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par29">Detection of coronavirus-2 and verification of COVID-19</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par30">Risk and severity assessment</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par31">Monitoring the pandemic</p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p id="Par32">The rapidly expanding array of PCR/reverse transcriptase PCR-based diagnostics which are quick and efficient in identifying the virus (Pang et al. <a href="#CR19">2020</a>; Lake <a href="#CR16">2020</a>, <a href="https://www.finddx.org/covid-19/">https://www.finddx.org/covid-19/</a>) are basic requirements for surveillance at every phase of the pandemic for identifying and segregating the infected from non-infected and risk assessment, as well as monitoring recurrences and seasonal disease activity. COVID-19 diagnostics have been discussed previously in this publication.</p> <p id="Par33">An emerging exciting field of disease surveillance is infectious disease modeling and incorporation of artificial intelligence. Notably, these are <i>predictive techniques</i> applicable to each of the three facets of disease surveillance (Siettos and Russo <a href="#CR21">2013</a>). A classical epidemiological surveillance parameter is quantitation of <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> (<i>R</i> nought, basic reproductive number) using mathematical models (<a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article">https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article</a>). <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> is a crucial metric indicating that on average the number of new infection cases are generated by a confirmed infection case, i.e., the potential transmissibility of an infectious disease. <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> of COVID-19 infection is estimated as 2â€"3.5 in the early phase, as even the asymptomatic patients or with mild pneumonia extruded large amounts of virus (Wang et al. <a href="#CR24">2020</a>). Important characteristics of <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> are: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par34">It is a dynamic number and changes with </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par35">Each stage of the disease</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par36">With interventions, e.g., vaccination, antivirals</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par37">Precautionary measures such as personal/community disinfection, social distancing, and travel restrictions</p> </li> </ul> <p /> </li> <li> <p id="Par38">With the knowledge of <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>, one can predict: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par39">New cases expected on a daily basis, and hence facilitate arrangement of healthcare services and interventions locally</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par40">Outbreak size and the dates of peak infection of the pandemic</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par41">Probable decline timeline</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par42">The extent of vaccination coverage required to prevent future outbreaks</p> </li> </ul> <p /> </li> <li> <p id="Par43">An <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>Â &amp;gt;Â 1 indicates that each infected individual is transmitting the disease to more than 1 new individual, and the infection is spreading increasingly. <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>Â =Â 1 indicates stable transmission and <i>R</i><sub>0</sub>Â <div class="â_UNKNOWN" href="#Fig1">
14.1).

The study used a stochastic transmission model of CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan and estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December 2019 and February 2020 (Kucharski et al. <a href="#CR15">2020</a>).</p> <p id="Par45">The most prominent mathematical model of COVID-19 infection is the <i>SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model</i> put forth by Wu and coworkers and also endorsed by the WHO. This model estimates the size of epidemic in Wuhan between December 2019 and January 2020 and forecasts the extent of domestic and global public health risks of taking into account for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. It is a compartmental model comprising four compartments and the individuals comprising the sample population move through each compartmentâ€"â€œSusceptibleâ€� (not immune to infection) and get infected from other infection individuals and move to the â€œExposedâ€� compartment for the incubation period. Hereafter the infectious individuals move to the â€œInfectedâ€� compartment and eventually to the â€œRecoveredâ€� compartment after the disease has run its course, and they now have some immunity (Fig. <a href="#Fig2">14.2</a>). The changes in the population in each compartment are estimated using ordinary differential equations to simulate the progression of an infectious disease. The critical parameters associated with this model are: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par46">Force of infection (<i>Î»</i>) is the rate at which susceptible individuals are exposed.

Also, the size of the outbreak in Wuhan was estimated to be up to 75,815 people (statistical uncertainty presented at 95% credible intervals). Most striking feature of this model was that it took into account the travel data from and to Wuhan over the period of study. Thus, it was able to predict that multiple major Chinese citiesâ€"Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhenâ€"had already imported the infection to trigger local epidemics. It also recommended that controlling the transmissibility by 25â€"50% could eventually rein the local epidemics, and a control of â‰¥63% would phase out the epidemics (Wu et al. <a href="#CR27">2020</a>).</p> <p id="Par50">The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in close conjunction with technology in pandemic surveillance has demonstrated manifold advantages in surveillance activities as exemplified by China and other severely hit nations during the present COVID-19 outbreak.

High to moderate correlations between Google relative search volume and COVID-19 cases were evident in several major cities of Taiwan (Husnayain et al. <a href="#CR13">2020</a>). Similarly, in China an AI-based company SenseTime has developed a â€œSmart AI Epidemic Prevention Solutionsâ€�â€"a quick and effective system based on facial recognition and thermal imaging to screen for individuals with fever in a crowd without physical contact and hence preventing transmission.

By mid-January, the first RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 were accessible in Hubei. The viral sequences and PCR primers and probe sequences were open-sourced and uploaded to public platforms by the Centre for Disease Control, China. By February, there were ten kits for the detection of COVID-19 approved in China by the National Medical Products Associationâ€"six were RT-PCR kits, one isothermal amplification kit, one virus sequencing product, and two colloidal gold antibody detection kits (<a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf">https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf</a>). As of today, when the disease has assumed pandemic proportions, the volume of diagnostic tools needs to be multiplied, and hence, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has provided regulatory relief to several testing companies like ThermoFisher, Hologic, and LabCorp under the Emergency Use Authorizations, to facilitate ease of diagnosis. Also it is keeping a tight watch on fraudulent companies claiming to sell interventions against COVID-19 (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-issues/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19">https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-issues/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19</a>). Moreover, the worldâ€™s first CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based diagnostic kit has been developed for COVID-19 by Mammoth Biosciences, USA, and University of California. Notably, the diagnostic kit is a simple strip-based assay and is easy to use and allows rapid detection without the need of transporting samples over long distances. The kit is still under approval evaluation by the FDA (<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032334v1">https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.06.20032334v1</a>).</p> <p id="Par68">Nose and mouth swabs, the most widespread samples for CoV-2 diagnostics, require trained personnel to procure samples. However, the study by To and coworkers recommends saliva as an easy-to-procure, noninvasive sample not requiring any trained personnel in COVID-19 screening. They detected CoV-2 in 11 out of 12 patient samples and also could trace the declining titers post-hospitalization (To et al. <a href="#CR23">2020</a>).</p> <p id="Par69">Additionally, a long-term goal of evolving the diagnostics for this novel disease is to develop a prognostic marker of COVID-19. Although it is too soon to say, Qu and coworkers have proposed platelet counts and platelet to lymphocyte ratios as prognostic marker to distinguish between severe and non-severe patients. Severe patients had higher platelet peaking and platelet to lymphocyte ratio correlating with deranged chest CT and longer hospital stays against the lower platelet peaks and platelet to lymphocyte ratios and lesser hospitalization stay (Qu et al. <a href="#CR20">2020</a>).</p> </div> <div class="managementofbulkvaccinesandantiviraldrugs" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Management of Bulk Vaccines and Antiviral Drugs</div> <p id="Par70">Vaccines and antiviral drugs are the prophylactic and therapeutic measures against a viral disease CoV-2. On March 17, 2020, Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech announced to co-develop and distribute a potential mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine which is likely to enter clinical testing by the end of April 2020 (<a href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_and_biontech_to_co_develop_potential_covid_19_vaccine">https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer_and_biontech_to_co_develop_potential_covid_19_vaccine</a>). However, in pandemic scenarios of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19, vaccine supplies will be limited or nonexistent at the early phase in lieu of the novelty of the disease and the unpredictability of the pandemic occurrence. Thus, vaccines cannot be stockpiled, and production can only start once the novel virus has been recognized. With the current state-of the-art, the first doses of vaccine are not likely to become available in the early months of the pandemic. However, the pandemic action plans have accounted for forward planning to increase the likelihood that the vaccine will progressively become available as the pandemic unfolds. Importantly, national or regional priorities need to be fixed in the action plan for the rational use of the building/limited supply of the novel vaccine. Also, production and use of vaccines during the inter-pandemic period will influence their availability during a pandemic. Thus, improving the infrastructure and logistics for vaccine production, administration, cold-chain, and professional training with the novel vaccines are important to avert/cruise through future outbreak events. The WHO advisory on prioritizing the population groups are as enlisted in descending order. However, the priorities need tailoring in each country/region according to local needs and epidemiological circumstances.</p> <p id="Par71">Recommended prioritizing of the groups is as follows: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par72">Healthcare workers and essential service providers</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par73">Groups at high risk of death and severe complications requiring hospitalization</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par74">Individuals (adults and children aged more than 6Â months) in the community who have chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic or renal disease, or are immunocompromised</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par75">Persons without risk factors for complications (<a href="https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/11_29_01_A.pdf">https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/11_29_01_A.pdf</a>)</p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p id="Par76">Antivirals are a crucial adjunct to vaccination as a potential strategy for managing COVID-19. Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to establish their efficacy and safety against COVID-19. It is important to establish a regular supply chain of antivirals and a high surge capacity in the face of CoV-2 pandemic and future outbreaks. Antivirals have a significant impact in reducing morbidity and mortality in light of unlikelihood of availability of vaccine against in early phases of pandemic. It is important to evaluate the non-interference of the antiviral interventions with the eventual vaccination, as well as the epidemiology of the group of individuals most seriously affected. It is also advisable to make available the information about the performance characteristics, side effects, and costs of antiviral therapy to public. Also the commonly used neuraminidase inhibitors in influenza pandemics are ineffective in the case of CoV-2 mediated infection and outbreaks (Pang et al. <a href="#CR19">2020</a>; Dong et al. <a href="#CR7">2020a</a>, <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/11_29_01_A.pdf">https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/11_29_01_A.pdf</a>). The incorporation of antiviral therapy can be categorized as a prophylactic and for treatment use. As with vaccines, prioritizing of groups for antiviral therapy is advised as follows: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par77">Essential service providers, including healthcare workers (prophylaxis or treatment). Especially, healthcare providers are in a position to be in direct contact with infectious individuals and are thus entitled to priority antiviral therapy. Other community services such as those responsible for vaccine manufacture and delivery and personnel responsible for enforcing law and order and public safety.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par78">Groups at high risk of death and severe complications requiring hospitalization. The goal of prophylaxis or treatment here is to rein the mortality and morbidity. Thus, high-risk persons living in the community outbreaks, seriously ill hospitalized patients, patients for whom a potential CoV-2 vaccination is contraindicated are prioritized.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par79">Persons without known risk factors for complications from COVID-19. Here the approach is generally therapeutic and aims to rein the morbidity and rationalize the use of healthcare resources such as antibiotics. Though, the logistics of this strategy are extensive and expensive (requires large quantities of antivirals and access to healthcare service providers), it is most likely to limit the economic and social destabilization associated with a pandemic (Monto <a href="#CR18">2006</a>; Henry <a href="#CR10">2019</a>, <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/11_29_01_A.pdf">https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/11_29_01_A.pdf</a>).</p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p id="Par80">A major step in ensuring bulk supplies of antivirals and vaccines is the setting up of <i>medical stockpiles</i> as a part of the pandemic preparedness plans. The USA has constituted a Strategic National Stockpile which is the nationâ€™s largest supply of potentially life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical suppliesâ€"antibiotics, chemical antidotes, antitoxins, vaccines, life-support medication, IV administrations, airway maintenance supplies, and other emergency medical and surgical items, for use in a public health emergency severe enough to deplete the local supplies. The facility also houses a data bank of other stockpiles and supply agencies, so that any emergency requirements can be procured in the shortest possible time (<a href="https://www.phe.gov/about/sns/Pages/default.aspx">https://www.phe.gov/about/sns/Pages/default.aspx</a>).</p> </div> <div class="promotingfacilitiesfortreatmentandhospitalization,healthcarepersonnel,maintenanceofhygieneanddisinfectionduringpandemics" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Under the Chinaâ€™s response plan, the healthcare workers were facilitated with personal protective equipment. Nosocomial infections accounted were reported to be nearly 2055 from 476 hospitals across China. The majority of this nosocomial infection (88%) were reported from Hubei. A deeper contact tracing indicates infection of the healthcare worker from households than the workplace and were pinpointed to the early stages of the epidemic when understanding of the COVID-19 transmission and medical supplies were limited (<a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf">https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf</a>). In fact a novel infection control system for averting nosocomial infections of COVID-19 was proposed by Chen and coworkers, titled â€œthe observing system.â€� Designated personnel called â€œinfection control observersâ€� were appointed by the Department of Infection Control and Nursing in Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital who underwent training to familiarize infection control requirements in the negative pressure isolation wards. The wards were under camera surveillance and the infection control observer monitors medical staff in real-time via computer monitors outside the ward. The observer ensures normal operation of the negative pressure isolation wards, supervise the implementation of disinfection, ensure a sufficient supply of protective materials, arrange specimens for inspection, and relieve anxiety of the medical personnel while treating patients (Chen et al. <a href="#CR5">2020</a>).</p> <p id="Par88">Personal and public hygiene/disinfection implementation is a key step to control transmission and prevent community outbreaks. Good hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene have been aggressively promoted by WHO worldwide in this COVID-19 pandemic. The basic personal and public hygiene practices are depicted in Fig. <a href="#Fig3">14.3</a>. A key parameter to consider while disinfecting in households and public places hence avoid contact with infected surfaces is the estimation of decay rates of CoV-2 in aerosols and on various materials composing the surfaces. It has been estimated that CoV-2 in an aerosol (&amp;lt;5Â Î¼m, similar to those observed in samples obtained from the upper and lower respiratory tract in humans) was viable for up to 3Â h, up to 4Â h on copper surfaces, up to 24Â h on cardboard, and 2â€"3Â days on plastic and stainless steel (van Doremalen et al. <a href="#CR9">2020</a>). On the basis of these findings, disinfection protocols can be set up for public places/medical facilities depending on the surfaces involved, and even in householdsâ€™ frequently touched surfaces like door handles, slabs, and tables be disinfected. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 14.3</span></a></div>   <p>The basic personal and public hygiene practices</p>   </div> <p /> </div> </div> <div class="globalmanagementstrategiesforcoronavirusinfection" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

This phenomenon has been described as â€œflattening of the curveâ€� and is much shared on social media platforms facilitating awareness in the public (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/community_mitigation-sm.pdf">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/pdf/community_mitigation-sm.pdf</a>).

Social Distancing</div> <p id="Par91">It is a non-pharmaceutical infection prevention and control intervention to avoid or control contact between infectious and uninfected individuals to rein the disease transmission in a community eventually culminating into decreased infection spread, morbidity and mortality. The individuals infected with CoV-2 shed the virus from their respiratory tract during the early infection stage when there are minor clinical manifestations leading to the extensive community transmission. While practicing social distancing, each healthy individual behaves like an infected individual, self-restricting contact with others. The main advantage is gleaned when an individual in incubation period/early infectious stage of COVID-19 restricts coming in contact with other healthy individuals. This strategy involves the policymakers, and strict advisories/orders are issued under the pandemic action plan to restrict public gatherings and events, shutting down of educational institutes/offices/restaurants, avoiding nonessential travel and use of public transport, maintaining a distance of 1Â m at least between two individuals, restricting visit to hospitals, and avoiding online shopping. Additionally, the elderly and individuals with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and cancer are at a higher mortality risk (<a href="https://www.mohfw.gov.in/SocialDistancingAdvisorybyMOHFW.pdf">https://www.mohfw.gov.in/SocialDistancingAdvisorybyMOHFW.pdf</a>, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ijcp.13501">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/ijcp.13501</a>; Zou et al. <a href="#CR28">2020</a>).</p> </div> <div class="extensivetesting,caseisolation,andcontacttracing" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Extensive Testing, Case Isolation, and Contact Tracing</div> <p id="Par92">The WHO Director-General at a media briefing on COVID-19 on March 16, 2020, recommends <i>testing</i> of any suspected case, <i>isolation</i> to break the chain of transmission, and <i>contact tracing</i> for the prior 2Â days the subject came in contact with and then testing them as well (<a href="https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19%2D%2D-16-march-2020">https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19%2D%2D-16-march-2020</a>).

Social distancing combined with case isolation and contact tracing has demonstrated its effectiveness in controlling the transmission from imported infection cases to the community transmission scenario (Wilder-Smith and Freedman <a href="#CR26">2020</a>). The relevance of case isolation and contact tracing are highlighted in a study by Hu and coworkers where they have performed a clinical characterization of 24 asymptomatic patientsâ€"confirming infection by a laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus nucleic acid from pharyngeal swab samples. The asymptomatic cases did not present any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. About 20.8% developed classical symptoms of fever, cough, and fatigue, during hospitalization; 50.0% presented CT images of ground-glass chest and 20.8% presented stripe shadowing in the lungs; 29.2% cases presented normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization, comprising the younger subset (median age: 14.0Â years). None developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and no mortality was observed. However, epidemiological investigation indicated at typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This study puts a spotlight on close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Case isolation and continuous nucleic acid tests are also recommended (Hu et al. <a href="#CR12">2020</a>). De-isolating of suspect cases where the first confirmatory test has returned negative is also an emerging issue of concern and needs improvement in testing capacity as well as strict implementation of social distancing during pandemic scenarios (Tay et al. <a href="#CR22">2020</a>).</p> </div> <div class="travelrestrictions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

For containment of the global spread of CoV-2 and a COVID-19 epidemic, China implemented border control measuresâ€"airport screening and travel restrictions, and were later also adopted by several other countries. Wells and coworkers in their study in Proceedings of Natural Academy of Sciences used daily incidence data of COVID-19 outbreak from China from December 8, 2019, to February 15, 2020, as well as airline network data, to predict the number of exported cases with and without measures of travel restriction and screening. The group put forth that the lockdown of Wuhan and 15 more cities in Hubei province on January 23â€"24, 2020, averted export of 779 more COVID-19 cases by mid-February. However, it is to be highlighted that these travel restrictions and lockdown measures only slowed the rate of infection exportation from China to other countries. The global spread of COVID-19 was based on most cases arriving during the asymptomatic incubation period. The authors recommend rapid contact tracing at the epicenter and at importation sites to limit human-to-human transmission outside of the location of first outbreak (Wells et al. <a href="#CR25">2020</a>).</p> </div> <div class="foilingmythstocontrolmasshysteria" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Foiling Myths to Control Mass Hysteria</div> <p id="Par94">The COVID-19 pandemic in todayâ€™s times of excessive electronic connectivity and several social media platforms has a potential to alleviate the global mental stress levels. Especially, if local myths and rumors are circulated in the already home-quarantined population, restriction in fear of the disease can lead to additional mass hysteria. Thus it is important to create awareness and dispel any negative myth, as put forth by the WHO in context of CoV-2 (<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters</a>). Some myths dispelled are: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par95">COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates or cold and snowy climates. CoV-2 can be transmitted in all areas.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par96">Hot bath cannot prevent CoV-2 transmission.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par97">CoV-2 is not transmitted by mosquito bites. It is a respiratory illness and respiratory hygiene is a key protective strategy.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par98">Heat generated from hand dryers is not effective against killing CoV-2 on your hands. The only way to disinfect hands is washing with soap-water or alcohol-based sanitizers.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par99">Thermal scanners are effective in detecting only the elevated body temperatures. A confirmatory nucleic acid test is the most guaranteed test.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par100">All age groups can be infected by CoV-2. Elderly people and people with pre-existing medical conditionsâ€"asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular diseaseâ€" are more vulnerable to exhibit severe COVID-19. Thus, WHO advises people from all age groups to protect themselves by implementing good hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par101">SARS-CoV-2 is not a bioengineered organism arising out of manipulations from earlier SARS-CoV. Andersen and coworkers have analyzed the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus-2 and compared it with several other zoonotic viruses. They claim that the viralâ€"human point of contactâ€"the high affinity receptor binding domain of CoV-2 binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the target hostâ€"is acquired through natural selection. Also they have shed light of probable animal host being <i>Rhinolophus affinis</i>, as another virus RaTG13, sampled from a bat, is ~96% identical overall to CoV-2 (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9</a>).</p> </li> </ul> <p /> </div> </div> <div class="economicconsequencesofpandemicrisk" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Economic Consequences of Pandemic Risk</div> <p id="Par102">The COVID-19 pandemic can cause short-term fiscal distress and longer-term damage to the global economic growth. If we trace the economic trajectory of a pandemic: </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par103">Early phase measures to contain/limit outbreakâ€"shutting down of workplaces and public businesses, mobilization of healthcare supplies and surveillance activities, contact tracing, social distancing by isolation of contacts/quarantines incur significant human resource and staffing costs (Achonu et al. <a href="#CR1">2005</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par104">As the scale of the epidemic expands, new medical infrastructure will need to be constructed to manage building number of confirmed infected individuals, the surge in demand for medical consumables can increase the health system expenditures (Herstein et al. <a href="#CR11">2016</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par105">The quarantine and lockdown impositions disrupt trans-national supply chains, transportation industry, agriculture, entertainment, and travel industry. Hoarding and black marketing of essential and medical commodities are expected.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par106">Behavioral changes during pandemicâ€"avoiding association with other people to avoid infectionâ€"are the major determinant for economic impact of pandemics (Fig. <a href="#Fig5">14.5</a>) and not mortality. The behavioral change fear driven which in turn is driven by awareness and ignorance (Burns et al. <a href="#CR4">2008</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par107">National and international relief funds have been constituted to mitigate the world through the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the SPRP estimates a funding support of nearly US$675 million for key response efforts against COVID-19 in countries most in need of help through April 2020. A first-of-its-kind COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund was constituted for arranging for funding support through individual and organizational donations on March 13, 2020. The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund is hosted by two foundations, the UN Foundation (registered in the United States) and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation (registered in Switzerland) in association with the WHO (<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par108">Increased fiscal distress due to decrease in tax revenues and increased expenditures are expected in low middle-income countries, where fiscal framework is weak. This situation aroused earlier in West Africa Ebola epidemic in Liberia: response costs surged, economic activity slowed, and quarantines and curfews compromised government capacity to collect revenue (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/HDN/Health/WDR14_bp_Pandemic_Risk_Jonas.pdf">https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/HDN/Health/WDR14_bp_Pandemic_Risk_Jonas.pdf</a>).</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par109">The high-income countries in scenario of a moderate pandemic can offset fiscal distress by providing official development assistance to affected countries and budgetary support. However, during a severe pandemic, a high-income country will also confront the same fiscal stresses and may be unwilling to provide assistance.</p> </li> </ul> <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 14.5</span></a></div>   <p>Pandemic outcomes leading to economic impact. During pandemics, economic disturbances are an outcome of averting public contact/fear to avoid infections, absent from workplace due to illness, and mortality (<a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/HDN/Health/WDR14_bp_Pandemic_Risk_Jonas.pdf">https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/HDN/Health/WDR14_bp_Pandemic_Risk_Jonas.pdf</a>)</p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="conclusionsandfutureperspectives" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions and Future Perspectives</div> <p id="Par110">On March 19, 2020, worldwide 191,127 confirmed cases were reported, mortality was 7807 against 118,319 confirmed cases, and mortality of 280 on March 13, 2020 when the COVID-19 crisis was declared a pandemic (<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports</a>). It is increasingly becoming evident that no region of the world will remain untouched by CoV-2 invasion. However, pandemic preparedness is the key to tackle the present-day COVID-19 health emergency worldwide. The rapid and effective enforcement of existing international and national action plans, as well as parallel review and improvisation, is facilitating the affected countries to contain transmission and possibly delay the peak of outbreak and mortality and garner recovery. It is notable that in the present pandemic scenario, innovative AI-powered surveillance, quick and strategic response actionsâ€"the trinity of testing-isolation-contact tracing, committed social distancing measuresâ€"travel restrictions, self-isolation, implementation of personal and public hygiene, and extensive mobilization of medical care facilities are helping the world mitigate through. The most insightful trend emerging from the global clinical and epidemiological data is that the identification of asymptomatic infected individuals is a crucial step to contain community outbreaks. For preventing future outbreaks of CoV-2 infection, high-volume cutting-edge investigations are warranted in understanding the COVID-19 pathology, CoV-2 origin, biology, structural data of potential surface antigens, and precise anti-CoV-2 antiviral therapies. Although the global economy is suffering at the hands of CoV-2, it is important to review the current action plans and suitably improvise the future action plans to avoid potential recurrence.</p> <div class="executivesummary" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
