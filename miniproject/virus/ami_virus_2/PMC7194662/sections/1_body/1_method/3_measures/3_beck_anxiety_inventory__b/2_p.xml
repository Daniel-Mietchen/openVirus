<p id="par0070">The BAI is a 21 item screening tool for assessing anxiety symptoms with intensity. This inventory assesses the physiological, emotional, and cognitive symptoms of anxiety. Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they have been bothered by each item over the last seven days (including the day of their completion of the BAI) on a four-point scale ranging from 0 (‘not at all’) to 3 (‘severely - I could barely stand it’). Total score ranged from 0 to 63. The authors reported high Cronbach’s alpha (.92) and good test-retest reliability (.75) for one week gap of the BAI. This scale had moderately high correlation (.51) with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (

The BAI Chinese version also has good internal consistency reliabilities (.91–.95) and high correlation (.71) with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety. In the present study, following cut off scores were used to assess different levels of anxiety: scores between 0 and 7 denotes no anxiety, scores between 8 and 15 denotes mild anxiety, 16–25 denotes moderate anxiety and 26–63 denotes severe anxiety (
