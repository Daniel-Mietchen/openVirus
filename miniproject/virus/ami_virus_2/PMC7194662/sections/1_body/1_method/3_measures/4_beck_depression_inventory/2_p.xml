 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">APA, 1994</xref>). Participants are asked to rate their appropriate on a four-point scale (0–3). Total score ranged from 0−63. This inventory takes 10 min approximately to complete. This scale had high internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .92) and test retest reliability (.93). The BDI Chinese version also has good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .94). Exploratory factor analysis revealed two factor structures (somatic-affective factor and cognitive factor) of Chinese BDI-II same as in English BDI-II. Following cut off scores were used to assess different level of depression in the present study: 0–13 (no depression), 14–19 (mild depression), 20–28 (moderate depression), and 29–63 (major depression) (
