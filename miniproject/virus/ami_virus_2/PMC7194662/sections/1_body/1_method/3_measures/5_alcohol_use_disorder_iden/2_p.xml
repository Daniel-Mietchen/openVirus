Respondents’ need to answer each question on a five-point scale (0–4). Total score ranged from 0 to 40. In the present study, following cut off score was used: scores between 0 and 7 denotes abstinence or low risk use, scores between 8 and 15 denotes hazardous use, scores between 16 and 19 denotes harmful use, and scores of 20–40 denotes possible dependence.

Exploratory factor analysis revealed three-factor structure as same as the original English version. In the present study, the AUDIT had good internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .893).
