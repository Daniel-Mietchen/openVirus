As the whole country under lockdown, face to face in-depth interview was impossible to conduct. Therefore, there are always risks of false judgement or over judgement. Moreover, self-report data are subjected to social desirability bias. As COVID-19 epidemic gets huge attention by the world, social desirability bias might present in the data.
