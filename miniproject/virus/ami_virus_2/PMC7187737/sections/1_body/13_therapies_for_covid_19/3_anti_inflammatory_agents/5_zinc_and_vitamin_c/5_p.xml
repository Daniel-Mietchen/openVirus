<p>Increasing intracellular zinc (Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>) with zinc-ionophores like pyrithione (PT) can efficiently impair the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including poliovirus and influenza virus. The combination of Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and PT at low concentrations (2 mM Zn
 <sup>2+</sup> and 2 mM PT) inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV in cell culture.(
