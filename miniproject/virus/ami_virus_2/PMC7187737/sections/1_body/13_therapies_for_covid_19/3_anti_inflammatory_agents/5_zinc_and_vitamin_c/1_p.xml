<p>There is evidence that the damage that occurs to the lungs occurs through the binding of the virus surface proteins to haemoglobin releasing free iron. The virus surface proteins ORF8 and surface glycoprotein bind to porphyrin, while other proteins orf1ab, ORF10 and ORF3a could coordinate an attack on the heme on the 1-beta chain of haemoglobin to dissociate iron. This results in decreased ability to carry oxygen and carbon dioxide and oxidant-mediated injury in the lung.(
