<p>The difficulty is of knowing precisely when to administer Tmab, whether it should be administered at the first presentation with hypoxaemia or whether one should wait for evidence of the hyperinflammatory response as evidenced by a rising CRP, ferritin, D-dimer and worsening hypoxaemia. We are initiating a study evaluating the use Tmab in patients with hypoxaemia, elevated CRP, ferritin and D-dimers, which will hopefully contribute more data to the body of evidence regarding therapy, including its safety, particularly regarding secondary infections. There are currently four ongoing randomized clinical trials of Tmab, as well as studies on numerous other biologicals which can be viewed at
