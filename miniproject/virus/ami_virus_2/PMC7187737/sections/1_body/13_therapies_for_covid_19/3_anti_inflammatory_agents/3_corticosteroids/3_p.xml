 <italic>F</italic> &lt; 200 mm Hg) with a positive end-expiratory pressure of ≥10 cm H2O and FiO2 of ≥0.5, 24 h after ARDS onset, patients were randomized to IV dexamethasone 20 mg daily (Days 1–5), then 10 mg daily (Days 6–10) or to continued routine care. Of 277 patients, 139 were assigned to the dexamethasone group. Ventilator-free days were higher in the dexamethasone group (4.8 days [95%CI 2.57–7.03];
