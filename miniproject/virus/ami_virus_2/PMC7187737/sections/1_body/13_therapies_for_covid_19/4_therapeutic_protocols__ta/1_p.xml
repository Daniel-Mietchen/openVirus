<p>In the first phase of the disease with mild upper respiratory symptoms, age &lt;65 years, no comorbid conditions, not hypoxaemic (saturations normal as monitored by pulse oximetry): isolate at home if possible; paracetamol 1 g PO 6–8 hourly as required; vitamin D (calciferol) 50,000 IU PO STAT; zinc 100–200 mg PO daily for 5 days. It is possible that CHQ may be helpful at this stage but resource limitations preclude this.</p>
