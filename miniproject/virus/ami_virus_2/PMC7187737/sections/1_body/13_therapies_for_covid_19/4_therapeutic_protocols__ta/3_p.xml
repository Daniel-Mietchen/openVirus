<p>In conclusion, we are dealing with a pandemic unprecedented in the era of modern health-care technology. We are as yet hamstrung by a lack of an effective vaccine or of effective therapies to halt spread of disease and progression to the potentially lethal hyperinflammatory phase of this illness. Some agents appear promising in this regard and in particular those that inhibit IL-6, which frequently appears to be the driver of the inflammatory process. Given the high mortality of those in this phase of the disease, therapy with these agents and potentially other anti-inflammatory agents such as pooled immunoglobulin would appear to be justified.</p>
