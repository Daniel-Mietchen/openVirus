<p>With reference to the above, possibly the most important marker of the hyperinflammatory state and worse outcome is the IL-6 level. A study that examined 40 patients admitted to a single hospital found that the 32.5% that required MV did not differ with regard to epidemiological factors such as age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score. However, an elevated IL-6 was strongly associated with MV (

 <sup>−5</sup>) and that a level &gt;80 pg/ml during the disease predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (

 <sup>−8</sup>, AUC = 0.98) with a rate of 22 times higher vs those with lower levels.(
