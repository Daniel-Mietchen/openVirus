<p>The aim of any therapy would be to intervene at a point that could prevent the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) and the occurrence of significant organ dysfunction, as the mortality for patients receiving MV exceeds 50% in most studies.(
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) In order to do so, patients must be assessed for features denoting the phase of the illness. Clinical markers of severity include older age, comorbidity (particularly diabetes and hypertension), hypoxaemia, requirement for MV and evidence of organ dysfunction, including myocardial ischaemia or heart failure.(

Overall, severe pneumonia occurred in 15.7%, and mortality in this study was 1.36%, which was lower than the other estimates at that time.(
