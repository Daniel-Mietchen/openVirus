<p>Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to develop myocardial injury with increased TnT levels, and the high-sensitivity CRP positively correlated with the rise in TnT and N-terminal proâ€“brain natriuretic peptide levels. Interestingly, the mortality of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% and 25.6%, respectively; however, this may just be due to a correlation between the use of these agents and underlying CVD.</p>
