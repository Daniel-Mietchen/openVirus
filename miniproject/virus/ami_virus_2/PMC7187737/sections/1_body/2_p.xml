<p>It appears that there are three phases to the disease that merge into each other although it is difficult to predict whether or when progression will occur (
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) – first, the viral response phase in which mild constitutional symptoms predominate and associated laboratory features such as lymphopaenia, increased prothrombin time, increased D-dimer and a mild increase in LDH occur. This merges over a variable time period in a proportion of patients into a phase in which pulmonary symptoms begin to emerge with dyspnoea and mild hypoxaemia with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO

An even smaller proportion then progresses to the hyperinflammatory phase in which a “cytokine storm” characterized by increased interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, interferon-
