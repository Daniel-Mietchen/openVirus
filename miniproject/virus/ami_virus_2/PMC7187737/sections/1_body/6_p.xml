<p>Laboratory parameters associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death include neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95%CI, 1.09–1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95%CI, 1.01–1.17, respectively), higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95%CI, 1.44–1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95%CI, 1.11–1.52] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95%CI, 1.01–1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95%CI, 1.01–1.04, respectively].(
