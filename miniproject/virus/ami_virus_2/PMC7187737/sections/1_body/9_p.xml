<p>Cardiac disease and thrombotic episodes appear to contribute to mortality. With regard to thrombosis, in a study of 449 patients with severe CoVID-19, 99 received heparin (mainly low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for ≥7 days). As seen in previous studies, in multivariate analysis, D-dimer, prothrombin time and age were positively, and platelet count negatively correlated with 28-day mortality. However, it appeared that heparin was only of benefit in those with more extensive thrombosis as evidenced by a sepsis-induced coagulopathy score ≥4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.029), or D-dimer &gt;6 fold of upper limit of normal (32.8% vs 52.4%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.017).(
