<p>With regard to cardiovascular disease (CVD), a recent study described the relationship between troponin levels and prior cardiac disease and outcome. Of 187 confirmed CoVID-19 patients, 23% died. Sixty-six (35.3%) had underlying CVD which included hypertension, coronary heart disease and cardiomyopathy, and of these and 52 (27.8%) had elevated troponin T (TnT) levels. There was an exponential increase in mortality according to the presence of CVD and or elevated TnT; 7.62% (no CVD; normal TnT), 13.33% (CVD; normal TnT), 37.50% (no CVD; elevated TnT) and 69.44% (CVD; elevated TnT).(
