 </xref> also identified and characterized COVID-19. They reported the isolation of the virus and provided the initial description of its specific cytopathic effects and morphology. COVID-19 seems to be the seventh member of the family of coronaviruses that infect humans. Notably, COVID-19 grew more readily in primary human airway epithelial cells than in standard tissue culture cells, unlike SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, suggesting the potential for increased infectivity. Homology modeling revealed that COVID-19 had some amino acid variations at key residues benchmarked with SARS-CoV.
