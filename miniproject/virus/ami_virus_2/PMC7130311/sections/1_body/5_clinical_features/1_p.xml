An understanding of the clinical features will help clinicians to recognize the infected patients and minimize the risk of exposure to others. It was inferred that the target cells might be in the lower airway, due to features of presentation such as the lack of prominent upper respiratory tract signs and symptoms and the ground-glass opacities on chest CT images. Older male subjects with comorbidities have been reported to have more severe and even fatal respiratory diseases.

 </xref> Additional studies will help in assessing for host risk factors for disease severity and mortality. Laboratory evaluation has found lymphopenia in 63% of patients and a cytokine storm profile in those who are critically ill. The combination of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and an aberrant immune response may have an impact on the severity of illness, similar to what has been proven in SARS and MERS.
