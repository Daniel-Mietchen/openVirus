<p id="p680010">In December 2019, Wuhan, Hubei province, China, one of the six megalopolises with a population of 14 million, became the center of an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause. Because the early cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Market, the market was shut down on January 1, 2020. One week later, on January 7, 2020, Chinese health authorities confirmed that they had identified a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization Director-General made the final decision on the determination of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding the outbreak in China, with exportations to other countries.
