<p id="p0015">As of mid-February, &gt; 50,000 cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 have been detected in China, of whom &gt; 1,600 have died. It has spread to all 34 provinces in China within 1Â month. The Spring Festival travel rush, in which an estimated 5 million people traveled from Wuhan to throughout the country, was one of the key factors that led to the rapid intercity spread. Approximately 680 exported cases of COVID-19 infection have been reported in &gt; 25 countries.</p>
