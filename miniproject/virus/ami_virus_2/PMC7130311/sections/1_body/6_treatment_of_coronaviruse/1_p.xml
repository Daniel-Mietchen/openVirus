 </xref> Results from in vitro cell and in vivo animal studies suggest that a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-β1 may be effective against MERS-CoV. A placebo-controlled trial of interferon-β1 and lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated in patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS requiring hospital admission in Saudi Arabia.
