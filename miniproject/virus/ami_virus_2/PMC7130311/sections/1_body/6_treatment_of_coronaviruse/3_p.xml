<p id="p0070">China established an effective detection network in response to an outbreak of infectious diseases after the SARS pandemic. It is of great significance to share what is known of COVID-19 genome sequences, the epidemiology, and clinical features of the illness. In this social media era, when an epidemic occurs, a great deal of misinformation is readily available.

 </xref> Hopefully, the early suggestion that COVID-19 infection is of lower lethality than SARS holds true. In contrast, a low health threat on the individual level means there is potential to cause disruptions of global public health systems and a long duration of person-to-person transmissibility. Mild illnesses and asymptomatic carriers may be potential sources of infection, sustaining a local epidemic and global spread. To reduce panic and economic loss, and to manage and save the infected, much remains to be done. The goal is to break the transmission chain of COVID-19. This will require effective programs to trace, diagnose, and cure every infected patient. We all need to be aware of the risks of another zoonotic virus crossing species to infect the human population in the future. It is of great imperative that we call for global action to deal with this major public health emergency.
