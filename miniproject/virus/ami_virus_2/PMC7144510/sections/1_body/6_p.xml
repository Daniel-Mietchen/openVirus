<p id="p0045">The finding of people in a small sample of rural communities in southern China seropositive for a bat SARSr-CoV suggests that bat-origin coronaviruses commonly spillover in the region [
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Single cases or small clusters of human infection may evade surveillance — particularly in regions and countries that border China with less healthcare capacity or rural areas where people don't seek diagnosis or treatment in a timely fashion. Surveillance programs can be designed by local public health authorities to identify communities living in regions with high wildlife diversity and likely high diversity of novel viruses [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. People with frequent contact with wild or domestic animals related to their livelihood and occupation, and patients presenting acute respiratory infection (ARI) or influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms with unknown etiology can be included into the surveillance as a cost-effective method to identify novel virus spillovers. This ‘pre-outbreak surveillance’ strategy can be coordinated with different sectors of public health, healthcare, agriculture and forestry to implement sample collection and testing of wildlife, domestic animals, and people in collaboration with research institutions. These efforts will help identify and characterize viral genetic sequence, identify high-risk human populations with antibodies and cell-mediated immunity responses to wildlife-origin CoVs [
