<p id="p0020">The second question is what is the source of this virus? The evidence is fairly clear: Most of the initial cases were linked to a seafood market that also sold butchered livestock meat and some wildlife. The virus itself appears to have a wildlife (bat) origin similar to SARS-CoV, which also emerged in a wildlife market through the interactions of humans and other animals that acted as the intermediate hosts of the virus [

With two disease outbreaks originating in China significantly linked to wildlife markets, this is an obvious target for control programs to prevent future epedemics and pandemics. Indeed, there have already been calls from Chinese conservationists, public health leaders and policy makers to reduce the wildlife consumption. However, banning or even reducing the sale of wild game may not be straightforward and it is challenging to change behaviors that are influenced by Chinese culture and traditions. In addition to a strong belief in the purported curative power of wildlife and their by-products, the consumption of the rare and expensive wildlife has become a social statement of wealth boosted by economic growth. Changing these cultural habits will take time, however, recent behavioral questionnaire data suggests a generational transformation with reduced wildlife consumption in the younger generation [
