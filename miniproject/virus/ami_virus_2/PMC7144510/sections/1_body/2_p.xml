<p id="p0015">The first question is why did this virus spread so rapidly, and how can we deal with this risk? China has changed significantly since the emergence of SARS in 2002–2003. The economy has expanded, and many people have become wealthier, leading to an expansion of air and high-speed train travel. It is estimated that 3 billion individual journeys were planned during the Lunar New Year holiday (Chunyun), around 80 million of these being flights. The flight habits of Chinese citizens have changed also — with many more flying internationally for business or tourism. In addition, since 2003, there has been an increase in travel between China and African countries, across Southeast Asia and into the New World as part of China's expansion of business and trade. This largely explains why the virus was able to spread out of China much more rapidly than SARS-CoV, which took over 2 months to move to Hong Kong then to the rest of the world.</p>
