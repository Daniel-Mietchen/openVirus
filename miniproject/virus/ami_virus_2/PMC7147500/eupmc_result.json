    "New evidence on the T-cell immuno-pathology in patient's with Corona Virus Disease 2019 (CoViD-19) was reported by Diao et al. in MedRxiv (doi: 10.1101/2020.02.18.20024364) [1]. It reports observations on 522 patients with confirmed CoViD-19 symptomatology, compared to 40 control subjects. In brief, notable T cytopoenia was recorded by flow cytometry in the CD4+ and the CD8+ populations, which were significantly yet inversely correlated with remarkably increased serum levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a. Flow cytometry established a progressive increase in the expression of programmed cell death marker-1 (PD-1) and T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (Tim-3) as patients (n=14) deteriorated from prodromal to symptomatic CoViD-19 requiring intensive care. Here, we interpret these observations of Diao et al from our current understanding of T cell immunophysiology and immunopathology following an immune challenge in the form of sustained viral infection, as is the case in CoViD-19, with emphasis on exhausted T cells (Tex). Recent clinical trials to rescue Tex show promising outcomes. The relevance of these interventions for the prevention and treatment of CoViD-19 is discussed. Taken together, the data of Diao et al could proffer the first glimpse of immunopathology and possible immunotherapy for patients with CoViD-19."
