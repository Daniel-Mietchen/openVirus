<p>In short, the evidence on Tex to date lends considerable clinical relevance to the preliminary observations reported by Diao and collaborators [
 <xref rid="R01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Their data point to significant T cytopoenia in circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with confirmed CoViD-19. The serum of these patients had significantly elevated levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a. Further analyses showed a progressive increase in PD-1+CD8+ and Tim-3+CD8+ subpopulation as patients deteriorated from prodromal to symptomatic CoViD-19 requiring intensive care. Taken together, the reported profile suggests the emergence of Tex in patients with confirmed CoViD-19. If those findings were to be replicated, then it would behoove clinical research scientists to develop a diagnostic protocol for CoViD-19 that include flow cytometric assessment of CD8+CD279+, and for good measure of CD8+CD366+ subpopulations. Patients with predominantly CD8+CD279
 <sup>low/medium</sup> should be entered into vigorous immunotherapeutic protocols designed to restore CD8 cytotoxic potential by blocking the PD-1/PD-1L pathway and/or the Tim3 pathways. By contrast, palliative care only should be proffered to patients with CD8+CD366
 <sup>high</sup>, as Tex is likely overwhelming their cellular immune surveillance. It is unclear at this time whether is not the two identified subsets of Tex are differentially modulated by gonadal hormones that is to say whether or not estrogen or testosterone affect inter mediate stage or advanced stage Tex differentially or at all Tex that matter. Clinical and epidemiological observations to date indicate that men are more susceptible than women to covid-19. Data also show that the elderly are significantly more at risk to covid-19 than younger patient populations. It is possible therefore and exam problem that Tex exacerbate immuno-senescence. It is also our contention that an AI algorithm of the type described previously will be found to be relevant in the context of CoViD-19 [
 <xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This is of particular importance here as it could yield clinically important benefit in the immuno-pathological diagnostics of patients afflicted with CoVid-19, and directed immunotherapeutic interventions. Case in point, the specialized AI algorithm could establish the means and protocol for the restoration of T cell homeostasis from immuno-senescence and from T cell exhaustion, which should be key in the development of new and improved immuno-therapies [
