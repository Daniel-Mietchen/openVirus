<p>In conclusion, acquired cellular immune surveillance is a finely regulated set of processes and events that involve specific populations and sub-populations of T lymphocytes. CD8+CD3+TcR+ cells are principally responsible for the cytotoxic clearance of virally infected and tumor cells. One component of the regulatory arm of cellular immunity results in 'exhausted T cells' (Tex), which are primarily of the CD8+ population and emerge in chronic high-grade viral infection, such as what is observed in CoViD-19. Tex is broadly divided into 2 subsets: at the initial and intermediate stage, Tex
 <sup>in</sup> are CD8+CD279
 <sup>low/medium</sup>, they retain quasi-normal mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity (SRC), and are generally responsive to PD-1 blockade of the kind outlined above. At the more advanced stage, Tex
 <sup>ad</sup> are CD8+CD279
 <sup>high</sup>, have lower mitochondrial SRC, and are terminally exhausted and largely unresponsive to PD-1 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Broadly speaking, the expression of CD366 (Tim-3) in Tex parallels that of CD279 (PD-1), as well as the production of IL-10, TNF-a and other cytokines that modulate the expression of either CD279 or CD366, or both, and mediate apoptotic T cytopaenia in these patients.
