<p>Recent work in cellular immunology has uncovered that, in high-grade chronic viral infections, CD8+ T cells cannot sustain long-term activation, and enter a stage of 'exhaustion'. Not all antigenic specificities are equally prone to exhaustion, and such differential T cell exhaustion and silencing of T cell responses can be observed across hosts and even within the same host. Exhausted T cells (Tex) are epitope-specific, and different and distinct from anergic T cells. High-grade chronic viral infections may, or may not, lead to depletion of specific Tex subpopulations via apoptosis. Tex express certain specific markers, including CD279 (programmed cell death marker-1, PD-1) and CD366 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3, Tim-3), and either produce or are modulated by certain cytokines, including IL-10. Tex cells are characterized by progressive loss of effector functions, high and sustained inhibitory receptor expression, metabolic dysregulation, poor memory and homeostatic self-renewal, and distinct transcriptional and epigenetic programs. PD-1 (CD279) and Tim-3 (CD366) expression are critical checkpoints for T cell exhaustion, as are several other biomarkers of Tex. Indeed, in vitro IL-10 blockade, or administration of IL-2, which overides PD-1 inhibitory signaling, can reverse T cell exhaustion in experimental settings. In brief, Tex is heterogeneous and includes progenitor and terminal subsets with unique characteristics and responses to checkpoint blockade [
