<p>High-grade chronic viral infections, or persistent tumor antigen stimulation results in CD8+ T cell exhaustion, which mirrors decreased effector function and proliferative capacity. Tex manifest over-expression of inhibitory receptors, including CD279 (PD-1), a lymphoid cell surface protein of the Ig superfamily, and a member of the extended CD28/CTLA-4 family of T cell regulators, which acts as a mature T cell checkpoint for the modulation of apoptosis. PD-1 interaction with either of its ligands (PD-1L1, CD274 or PD-1L2, CD273, both members of the B7 family of T cell co-receptors that includes CD28) constitute significant negative immune checkpoints in the pathway responsible for blunting cell-mediated immune responses, specifically CD8+ responses, and for upregulating resulting pathologies (e.g., CoViD-19) and malignancies [
