<p>CD4+ T cells are often recognized as the T helper population because their productive proliferation leads to the activation and maturation of B cells for the generation of antibodies to contain and neutralize bacterial and parasitic antigens. C8+ cells orchestrate the cytotoxic response to viral and cancer antigens. A third population of T cells suppress the proliferative response of activated CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes, and are called regulatory T cells (Tregs). Most Tregs express the CD4 moiety, although Tregs can also be CD8+ T cells. All Tregs express the marker FoxP3. Treg-cell activation is antigen-specific, which implies that suppressive activities of Treg cells are antigen-dependent. Certain cytokines (e.g., IL-10) enhance Tregs, and therefore dampen T cell activation.</p>
