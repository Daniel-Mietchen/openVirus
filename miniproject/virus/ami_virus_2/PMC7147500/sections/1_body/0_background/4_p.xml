<p>In brief, the T cell response in the normal state is a finely balanced set of events orchestrated by the three principal populations of reactive T cells: effector CD4+, effector CD8+ and FoxP3+CD4+ or FoxP3+CD8+ Tregs, and the cytokine storm they, and their corresponding antigen-presenting cells produce. Whether the activated T cells engage in productive proliferation and maturation, or unproductive anergy, or self-imposed programmed cell death is determined by certain specific receptor- and co-receptor-ligand interactions between the T cell and the antigen-presenting cell, including CD28 and its ligand. Together, these processes ensure the proper dynamic unfolding of events in a complex, yet homeostatic immunophysiologic environment. These traditional canonical immune mechanisms and other related immunoregulatory mechanisms described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="R02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] converge to maintain the organism in a state of immuno physiological balance. When challenged by an antigen, a specific series of coordinated heterostasis events are engaged that drive the organism to regain homeostasis. That collection of immunophysiologic adaptive events represents immune allostasis, and is characterized by laboratory evidence that point to a statistical modeling algorithm, which can be informed as an artificial model (AI) of T cell-mediated immune surveillance. The implications for the containment of epidemics by Ebola virus, Dengue virus, Zika virus, H#Na# influenza virus, as well as SARS and MERS in the context of the future immune surveillance within translational healthcare were discussed elsewhere [
