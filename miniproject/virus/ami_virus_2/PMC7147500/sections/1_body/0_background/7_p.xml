<p>The development of monoclonal antibodies, peptide-based and non-peptide small-molecule inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-1L pathway hold strong promise as effective beneficial immunodulators of CD8-mediated immune surveillance (9-11). Blockade of the PD-1 pathway in CD8+CD279+ subpopulation in vitro and in vivo has opened a new therapeutic avenue for abrogating functional exhaustion in these cells, and reinstating vigorous T cell cytotoxicity against the viral antigen [
