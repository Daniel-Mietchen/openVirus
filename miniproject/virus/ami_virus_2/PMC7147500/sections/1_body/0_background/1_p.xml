<p>In normal healthy subjects, about 70% of the peripheral blood lymphocytes are T cells and express the T cell receptor (TcR) in association with the cluster of differentiation # 3 (CD3). Two principal populations of T cells express either the CD4 or the CD8 moeity. CD4+CD3+ T cells recognize non-self presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on myeloid cells, dendritic cells and other specialized antigen-presenting cells. That step is accompanied by the production of cytokines, certain immune factors that favor immune cell proliferation. The cytokines produced at that step typically enhance the inflammatory process,and are recognized as the pro-inflammatory cytokines. They include interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, and others. Upon presentation of the nonself antigen by MHC-II, two critical binding events must occur to engage productive CD4+ cell activation, leading to proliferation aided by the pro-inflammatory cytokines and the T cell proliferation factor, IL-2, produced by the activated T cell. These binding events engage both TcR and the secondary activation site, CD28. Triggering TcR alone leads to an unproductive activation that engenders not active proliferation but a lack thereof, known as anergy. Triggering CD28 alone, signals of the CD4 cell faulty activation, and leads to programmed cell death, apoptosis.</p>
