<p>Influenza, the most studied of respiratory viruses, provides broad insights for other common myxovirus and paramyxovirus respiratory agents. A review of healthy adult human volunteer studies showed that viral shedding increased sharply between 0.5 and 1 day after influenza virus challenge, peaking on day two; shedding can be detected 24 to 28 h before clinical onset, and has a mean duration of 4.8 days; two-thirds of subjects had symptomatic infection, and total symptom scores peaked on day three [

For example, pre-symptomatic influenza virus shedding has been seen for 6 days before clinical onset and mean duration of virus isolation from hospitalised children not receiving an antiviral was 6.8 days [
