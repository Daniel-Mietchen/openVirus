<p>Respiratory viruses can be transmitted through a number of modes: direct contact and fomites, large droplet, and airborne small particles. The importance of each of these modes depends on the virus in question, the site of infection, and the environment. For example, the eyes and nose appear to be much more important routes of infection for RSV than the mouth.</p>
