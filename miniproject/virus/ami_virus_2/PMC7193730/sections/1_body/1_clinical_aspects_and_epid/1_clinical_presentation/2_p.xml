<p>Diagnosis in individual mild illnesses may not alter management, but can prevent unnecessary hospitalisation, antibiotic therapy, or further invasive investigation. Laboratory confirmation of the cause of infections has been made more sensitive and rapid through the use of PCR technology. PCR has taught us that the constellation and severity of symptoms can cluster with particular infectious agents. For example, recent findings from the New Vaccine Surveillance Network in the United States show that despite respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) all being common in early childhood; RSV and PIVs are more common causes of hospital admission with acute febrile and respiratory illness than HCoVs [

Despite such clustering, in individual illnesses it can be said that even viruses more typically associated with severe childhood illness can cause milder symptoms, modified by immune or possibly genetic factors, and that severe disease, whilst more commonly caused by a small group of well-studied viruses, can result from infection due to any virus. Viruses that are typically considered to cause infrequent or mild disease, such as influenza C virus and PIV-4, may cause more significant illness in vulnerable populations, including the young and immunocompromised.
