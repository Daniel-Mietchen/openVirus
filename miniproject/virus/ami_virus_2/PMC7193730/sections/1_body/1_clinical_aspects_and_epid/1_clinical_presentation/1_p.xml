<p>A wide variety of well known and newly identified agents cause respiratory illness and disease in humans. It is not possible to differentiate with certainty the aetiological agent in an infection based on clinical symptoms alone. In pre-school aged children, for example, illnesses due to respiratory viruses have seasonal variations and differences in the presence of fever and other symptoms, the likelihood of household transmission, and the impact they have in terms of medical visits and disruption to family life. But none of these features in isolation or combination is sufficiently specific to link illness to a pathogen with certainty.</p>
