<p>Modern molecular methods have resulted in the identification of previously unknown viruses from specimens collected from the respiratory tract. Testing for new viruses along with known viruses, including rhinoviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] by PCR, is filling the diagnostic void in respiratory illness and infection, and has improved our understanding of the epidemiology of such illnesses. In all but tropical climates there are a group of respiratory viruses that occur more frequently in the non-summer months, often peaking in winter; these viruses include influenza viruses, RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), PIVs, and HCoVs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">5.2</xref>). Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most commonly identified group of viruses in both community-managed and more severe respiratory illness in children and older age-groups, having a year round presence but being more common in the spring and autumn months [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Whilst it is clear rhinoviruses are a major pathogenic group, there is still uncertainty about the predictive value of a positive molecular test for a picornavirus, particularly from children. In tropical settings, influenza and other respiratory viruses can have a high background year-long presence [
