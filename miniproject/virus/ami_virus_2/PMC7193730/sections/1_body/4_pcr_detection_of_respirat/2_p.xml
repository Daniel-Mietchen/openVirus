<p>Standard quality control practices should be implemented when testing for respiratory viruses by PCR, including the use of a suitable positive control, negative control, extraction control and inhibition control. 
 <italic>Sequence-related</italic> issues (discussed in more detail in 10.1007/978-90-481-9039-3_8) are also very relevant to respiratory viruses. Consideration needs to be given to the type of probe used when designing real-time PCR methods for respiratory viruses. The main issue is that respiratory viruses, particularly the RNA viruses, show considerable genetic variation. For this reason, it is often difficult to identify a sufficiently large and conserved region to accommodate two hybridisation probes and so the single-probe TaqMan format is more commonly utilised for respiratory virus detection. On the other hand, we have also observed problems using the smaller minor-groove binder (MGB) TaqMan probes. The issue stems from MGB TaqMan probes being more susceptible to single nucleotide polymorphisms than standard TaqMan probes. For example, we have found that some RSV strains provided poor fluorescent signal, barely above the background negative signal, in an RSV MGB assay [
