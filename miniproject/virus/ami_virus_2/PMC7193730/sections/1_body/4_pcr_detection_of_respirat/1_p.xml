<p>Cell culture and direct immunofluorescent assay (DFA) staining using monoclonal antibodies were previously the most commonly used laboratory techniques for detecting respiratory viruses. Although still used widely in the United States, these traditional techniques have gradually been superseded by highly sensitive and rapid reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays, with most laboratories in Australia now using RT-PCR methods. Additional advantages of RT-PCR detection of respiratory viruses include results that are not significantly affected by a loss of viral viability during specimen transport or storage, and that RT-PCR does not require the presence of intact, infected cells within the specimen. The PCR revolution has also been further stimulated through improvements in the technology, including the advent of real-time PCR and multiplex PCR methods, both of which reduce staff hands-on time, decrease result turnaround-times, increase through-put and are more user friendly compared to conventional PCR techniques.</p>
