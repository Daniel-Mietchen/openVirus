<p>Human bocavirus was first described in 2005 with a prevalence of 3.1% in Swedish children with LRTI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and subsequently in Australia with 5.2% prevalence in children with ARTI during winter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although a positive association of HBoV with ARTI was suggested, the results remain inconclusive, because a high prevalence of other respiratory viruses was found in HBoV-positive patients. To confirm the role of HBoV as a respiratory pathogen, more extensive studies including matched control populations need to be performed. One such study using control subjects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] proposed HBoV as a cause of acute wheezing in children.
