<p>Recently, three new human polyomaviruses, KIV, WUV and MCV were detected in specimens of patients with ARTI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Allander et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] reported a prevalence of 1% for KIV in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) collected from a Swedish population and Gaynor et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] showed a prevalence of 3% and 0.6% for WUV in respiratory samples from Australia and the USA respectively. More recently, although originally found in Merkel cell carcinoma, MCV was also found in 5.9% of NPA collected from Australian subjects with ARTI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Since these first reports, KIV, WUV and MCV have been detected in a number of geographic locations, suggesting a global presence for these viruses.
