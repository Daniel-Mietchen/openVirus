<p>Recent advances in molecular biology have greatly improved the detection of viral respiratory pathogens. Yet, even with the most sensitive molecular techniques, only 40â€“60% of infections are consistently diagnosed. This suggests that additional respiratory viruses are likely to exist. In fact, since 2001, seven previously undescribed viruses have been identified by analysis of clinical specimens from the human respiratory tract (Table
