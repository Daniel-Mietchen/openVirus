<p>The causative fungi of respiratory infections vary with the population selected and the geographical region. The majority of fungal infections in lung-transplant recipients involve 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp., followed by 
 <italic>Candida, Pneumocystis, Cryptococcus</italic>, geographically restricted agents and newly emerging fungal pathogens. 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> infection remains the main fungal complication in lung-transplantation recipients. There are various fungal agents responsible for pulmonary fungal infection in patients with haematological malignancies, but 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> spp. and other molds such as zygomycetes or 
 <italic>Fusarium</italic> spp. represent the most frequently isolated microorganisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Less commonly, pneumonia could be due to 
 <italic>Candida</italic> spp., 
 <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> spp. or 
 <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although invasive aspergillosis is an uncommon complication of haematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) and solid organ transplants (SOT), it continues to be associated with poor outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is rare in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and is commonly associated with high doses of corticosteroids and multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics [
