 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (pneumococcus) was identified in 30–50% of bacterial pneumonia cases in developing countries in the 1990s, followed by 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b (Hib; 10–30% of cases), then 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> [

 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> (NTHI), and non-typhoid 
 <italic>Salmonella spp</italic>. have also been implicated in some but not all studies. Other organisms, such as 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae,</italic> Chlamydia spp., Pseudomonas spp. and 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> also can cause pneumonia. The most common syndromes associated with 
 <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> infections are acute bronchitis, pharyngitis and otitis, but 10% of infected children develop pneumonia [
