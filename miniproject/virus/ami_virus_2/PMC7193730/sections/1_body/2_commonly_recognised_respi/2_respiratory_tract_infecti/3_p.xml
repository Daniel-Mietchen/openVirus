 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is estimated to cause more than one-third of the 2 million deaths due to ARIs, especially in developing countries where the bacterium is one of the most important bacterial pathogens of infancy and early childhood [

Virtually every child in the world is colonised with one or more strains of pneumococcus and becomes a nasopharyngeal carrier during their first few years of life. Many children will go on to develop otitis media, and a few will eventually develop invasive pneumococcal disease including bacteraemic pneumonia and/or meningitis. The introduction of the conjugate pneumococcal vaccine in routine infant immunization should have a major impact on pneumonia in children less than 5 years of age worldwide, as already documented in the USA [
