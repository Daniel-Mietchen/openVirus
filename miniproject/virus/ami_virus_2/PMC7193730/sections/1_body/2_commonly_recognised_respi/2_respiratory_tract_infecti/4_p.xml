<p>Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a leading cause of deaths worldwide, with an estimated one third of humanity infected and about 1.7 million deaths each year, a global toll of 4,650 lives daily. The emergence of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) strains carrying drug-resistance mutations against first-line dugs (MDR-TB) and, more recently, against both first- and second-line drugs (XDR-TB), shows that it will most probably be impossible to contain the TB pandemic with drugs alone. More than one hundred new TB vaccine candidates have been tested in animal models and some have moved into clinical trials. Testing such a wide variety of vaccine types using different strategies will obviously require time and a lot of coordination, especially as surrogate markers of protection still remain mostly unknown at this time.
