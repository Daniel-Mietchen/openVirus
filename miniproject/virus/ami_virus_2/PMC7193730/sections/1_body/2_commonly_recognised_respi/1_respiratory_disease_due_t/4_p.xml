<p>Regarding influenza virus, the average global burden of inter-pandemic influenza may be on the order of 1 billion cases per year, leading to 300,000–500,000 deaths worldwide. However, the substantial reduction in ARI mortality observed in developing countries that have implemented simple case management, including provision of antibiotics to children with ARI, suggests that bacterial pneumonia contributes to a large proportion of deaths in these populations. Available data suggest that dual infections with viral and bacterial pathogens may be quite common, as seen by the fact that, in the industrialized world, epidemics of RSV and/or influenza coincide with epidemics of

While influenza virus is the most commonly met pathogen in this context, other respiratory viruses, including RSV, measles virus, parainfluenza viruses, or adenoviruses may also predispose to secondary bacterial infections. Several different bacterial species may be implicated, including

 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, and, most importantly of all, 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> [
