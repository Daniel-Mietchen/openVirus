<p>In the elderly, influenza-related pneumonia remains a leading cause of infectious disease-related deaths. The threat of an avian influenza pandemic has been looming ever since the emergence in 1997 in Hong Kong of the H5N1 avian influenza virus, especially since the reappearance of human cases in 2003–2004. The new H5N1 variant is highly pathogenic for poultry and wild birds and can lethally infect cats and humans. At this time, however, it still is not possible to predict which virus is going to eventually cause a pandemic and when it is going to happen, but the preparation of pandemic influenza vaccines is being actively pursued, generating broad new knowledge on how to improve seasonal influenza vaccine immunogenicity. This has proven to be of the utmost importance with the recent emergence of influenza virus A H1N1 (2009) (“Human Swine Influenza”) in Mexico and the USA in 2009.</p>
