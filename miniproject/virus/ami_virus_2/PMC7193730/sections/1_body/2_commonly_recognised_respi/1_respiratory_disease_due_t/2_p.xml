<p>Human metapneumovirus, a member of the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, is a recognised cause of a large fraction of severe ARIs in infant, elderly and immunocompromised populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Other viruses that cause respiratory infections are coronaviruses, adenoviruses and rhinoviruses. Recently discovered coronaviruses HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are significant pathogens that contribute to the hospitalisation of children for ARI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Among other members of the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> are human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, agents of the common cold. Another recently identified coronavirus is that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS-CoV, which emerged in southern China in late 2002 and spread in the spring of 2003 to some 30 countries within Asia, Europe and North America.
