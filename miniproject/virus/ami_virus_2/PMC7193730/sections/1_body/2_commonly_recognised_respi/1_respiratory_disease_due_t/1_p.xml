<p>In spite of the inclusion of the live attenuated measles vaccine in the Expanded Program of Immunization (EPI), measles virus was still responsible in 2002 for some 213,000 deaths worldwide, essentially due to insufficient vaccine coverage [

The situation has fortunately been substantially improved lately, but the leading cause of serious respiratory illness in young children is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the agent of infantile bronchiolitis, which is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality [

All children by the age of 2 years have had at least one episode of PIV and/or RSV illness. In addition, both viruses can cause severe disease in the elderly, especially in patients with a chronic respiratory or cardiac condition [

Although the disease burden due to these pathogens has not been accurately quantified in developing countries, extrapolation from known figures in industrialised countries, such as 125,000 reported cases of RSV per year in the USA, leads to the impressive global estimates of 64 million cases and 160,000 deaths per year from RSV infection worldwide. RSV was identified in 15–40% of pneumonia or bronchiolitis cases admitted to hospital in developing countries, followed by influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [
