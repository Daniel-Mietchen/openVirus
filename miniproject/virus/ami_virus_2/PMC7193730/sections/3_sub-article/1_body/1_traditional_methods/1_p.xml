<p>Traditional laboratory respiratory virus diagnosis involved virus culture with, or without immunofluorescence staining with specific antibodies. Culture is highly sensitive if the appropriate cell lines are utilised and once a virus is isolated it can be further characterised and amplified if required. Viral culture provides the added advantage that it will only detect infectious virus and not persistent nucleic acid. It has the disadvantages however of being expensive due to the requirement to maintain cells lines and tissue culture media and the requirement for expertise in sterile technique and interpretation of cytopathic effect (CPE) and fluorescence staining.</p>
