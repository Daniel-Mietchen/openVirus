<p>In the case of influenza virus detection, the CDC recommends that Viral Transport Medium (VTM) is added to swabs to assist in virus preservation. If VTM is to be added to dry swabs, they should be vortexed to release cells in to the medium and transferred to a sterile vial for transportation to the laboratory. VTM cannot be added to swab receptacles as they will invariably leak in transit and pose an infection risk. All respiratory specimen types should be transported to the laboratory at 4 Â°C. Some NPAs and sputum samples received in the laboratory are very mucoid. These may either be diluted in VTM or digested with sputasol to facilitate the extraction process prior to molecular analysis.</p>
