<p>Laboratory diagnosis of respiratory virus infections requires specimens containing cells from the respiratory tract collected early in the clinical illness. The most appropriate specimens are NPAs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Where the generation of aerosols may pose an infection risk to collection personnel, nose and throat swabs are a viable alternative. Recent studies however, have shown that swabs are not as effective as NPAs for the detection of adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus. Limited data is available suggesting that flocked swabs are superior to traditional swabs for detecting respiratory virus infections.</p>
