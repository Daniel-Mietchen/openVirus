<p>Direct antigen tests are available commercially for some respiratory viruses but lack sensitivity (approximately 70%) although the positive predictive value is high. The expense and false negative rate of direct antigen tests need to be balanced with their rapidity and ease of use. Negative direct antigen results should be confirmed by a more sensitive assay such as PCR.</p>
