 </xref> The hematologic complications of SARS included 63% of patients demonstrating isolated transient elevations of the activated partial thromboplastin time in the first 2 weeks of infection, but most patients had normal prothrombin times and no elevation of D‐dimers. A total of 2.5% of SARS patients showed evidence of DIC, and this was frequently associated with mortality.
