<p>In their timely report, Tang et al describe the outcome of 183 patients admitted to the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan with RNA detection confirmed 2019‐nCoV pneumonia during the period January 1 through February 3, 2020. The clinical outcomes are reported up to February 13, 2020. The mean age of patients was 54 years, and 41% had comorbid chronic diseases (cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer, liver, and kidney). All patients received treatment with supportive care and antiviral agents. At the time of reporting, 42.6% of patients had been discharged from the hospital, 45.9% remained as inpatients, and the overall mortality was 11.5%. Patients were tested for prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, antithrombin, fibrinogen, D‐dimer, and fibrin degradation products every 3 days for the first 2 weeks of hospital stay. Applying the validated International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis DIC score,

 </xref> 71.4% of nonsurvivors and 0.6% of survivors showed evidence of overt DIC, with the median time to DIC detection being 4 days. The authors conclude, based on these preliminary results from a single center, that DIC is a frequent occurrence in worsening 2019‐nCoV pneumonia and is often associated with mortality. Evidence of DIC, especially elevated D‐dimer levels, may be used in therapy considerations.
