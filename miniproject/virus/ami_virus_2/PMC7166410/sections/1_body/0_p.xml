<p>In late December 2019, a new infectious disease emerged in the city of Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. A novel betacoronavirus, 2019‐nCoV, capable of human‐to‐human transmission, has been identified as the causative pathogen in this disease.

 </xref> In recent years, two other betacoronavirus epidemics have been identified as the cause of acute severe respiratory disease: in 2003, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and in 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). In all of these diseases, the initial source of the virus appears to be other animal species (civets for SARS and dromedary camels for MERS), and although the immediate animal source for the 2019‐nCoV agent remains to be determined, bats are likely the common source for all of these RNA betacoronaviruses.
