<p>The pathophysiology of DIC is complex and multifactorial, involving an interplay between cellular and plasmatic elements of the hemostatic system and components of the innate immune response to the infecting pathogen.

 </xref> Activation of the vascular endothelium, platelets, and leukocytes results in dysregulated thrombin generation that occurs both systemically and locally in the lungs of patients with severe pneumonia, resulting in the deposition of fibrin with subsequent tissue damage and microangiopathic pathology. There is evolving evidence that a combination of activation events initiated by exposure of the endothelium, platelets, and leukocytes to pathogen‐ and damage‐associated molecular patterns are the primary instigators of this pathophysiology.

 </xref> The effects of dysregulated thrombin generation are further exacerbated by an inhibition of fibrinolysis and the impairment of natural anticoagulant mechanisms. To date, treatment of DIC has been focused on strategies to target the primary associated pathology

Otherwise, supportive care to maintain critical organ function is required. Trials of natural anticoagulant infusions have met with variable outcomes,
