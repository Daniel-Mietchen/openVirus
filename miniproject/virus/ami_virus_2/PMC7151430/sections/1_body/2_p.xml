<p id="p0015">Unfortunately, the truth is that we have only a rudimentary knowledge of several aspects of infection spread, including on one critical aspect of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: how THIS virus transmits (

 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">Brosseau, 2020</xref>). In general it is considered that viral respiratory infections spread by direct contact, such as touching an infected person or the surfaces and fomites that the person has either touched, or on which large virus-containing droplets expired by the person have landed (
 <xref rid="b0070" ref-type="bibr">Morawska 2006</xref>), and there the virus can remain stable for days (
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">van Doremalen et al. 2020</xref>). The droplets can also be deposited directly on a person in close proximity to the infected person. Therefore, frequent hand-washing and maintaining a distance of at least one meter (armâ€™s length) are considered the main precautions against contracting the infection (
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">WHO 2020a</xref>). One transmission route that is mentioned only in passing, or not at all, is the transport of virus-laden particles in the air. Immediately after droplets are expired, the liquid content starts to evaporate, and some droplets become so small that transport by air current affects them more than gravitation. Such small droplets are free to travel in the air and carry their viral content meters and tens of meters from where they originated (e.g.
