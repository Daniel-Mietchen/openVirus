<p id="p0030">It is difficult to explain why public health authorities marginalize the significance of airborne transmission of influenza or coronaviruses, but a possible reason is that it is difficult to directly detect the viruses traveling in the air. Immediately after expiration, the plume carrying the expired viral content is diluted, and as it travels in the air carried by the air flow. In the process, the concentration of the virus does not increase uniformly in the interior environment of the enclosed space, but it is elevated only in the flow (if there is adequate ventilation, which is normally the case in medical facilities or on aircraft) (

Therefore, sampling for the presence of the virus requires knowledge of the air flow from the infected person, and a sufficiently long sampling period to collect enough copies of the viruses. Both these requirements present major challenges: microbiologists collecting viral samples are not normally experts in building flow dynamics, and practicality prevents long sampling times that would be adequate for the sensitivity of existing viral detection methods (
