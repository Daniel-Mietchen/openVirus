<p id="p0110">Almost every study on CP inactivation of viruses is unique because they either use a specific plasma source [e.g., 
 <bold>dielectric barrier discharge (DBD)</bold>, 
 <bold>plasma (micro)jet</bold>
 <bold>s</bold>] (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) with different characteristics (e.g., power, gas, treatment time) or they deal with the treatment of different liquid volumes (from microliters to several milliliters), matrices (e.g., water, other solutions, surfaces, cells), and viruses (surrogates of human viruses, human, animal, and plant viruses). Such wide diversity makes it difficult to directly compare these studies and to define the mechanistic conclusions or any universal inactivation parameters. To simplify these complexities, we consider here the individual types of viruses that have been subjected to CP treatments. A complete list of the treatments published to date is given in
