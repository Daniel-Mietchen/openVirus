<p id="p0100">Plasma-mediated virus inactivation is a relatively young field of research (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) which started only about 20 years ago [
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This is despite the decades-old knowledge that ozone, that is usually synthesized from O
 <sub>2</sub> subjected to plasma conditions, can inactivate viruses [
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, over the past few years the number of publications in the CPâ€“virus field has doubled, and research has expanded from only defining the virucidal properties of plasma to describing its modes of inactivation.
