<p id="p0095">Plasma is the fourth state of matter. It is a partially or fully ionized gas where the atoms and/or molecules are stripped of their outer-shell electrons (

 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among its complex constituents, the emission of UV radiation and 
 <bold>reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species (RONS)</bold> have the most important antimicrobial properties [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. UV can damage nucleic acids [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], whereas RONS can oxidize nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, with different affinities that depend on the species [
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These inherent properties of plasma, and more specifically of CP, have motivated extensive studies on the use of CP for inactivation of various pathogenic microorganisms. The main target has been bacteria, with investigations across different fields such as food production [
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], medicine, and dentistry [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These have even extended to oncotherapy applications, where cancer cells are targeted instead of pathogenic microorganisms [

  <p id="p0015">Plasma is the most abundant state of matter and comprises 99% of the visible universe. The sun and other stars, nebulae, solar winds, lightning, and aurora borealis are all in the plasma state. Plasma TVs as well as neon and fluorescent lights are the best-known man-made uses of plasma. Generally, plasma contains free electrons, atoms, and molecules in neutral, ionized, and/or excited states (including ROS/RNS). Plasma of many gases represents an extensive source of UV and vacuum UV radiation [
   <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The possibility to use a particular or a combination of constituents makes plasma a unique material-treatment technique.

  <p id="p0020">Plasma can be roughly divided into thermal or equilibrium plasma, where all particles have approximately the same temperature (average kinetic energy of random motion), and nonthermal, nonequilibrium, or CP, where light electrons have much higher temperatures compared with heavy atoms and molecules, which often remain close to room temperature. In other words, CP is at the point of application at room temperature, and is therefore suitable for treating diverse biological material including solids, liquids, and aerosols. CP can be further classified into low pressure and atmospheric pressure. The latter is limited to the volume where there are large electric fields, whereas low-pressure plasma spreads in a large volume [
   <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. CP is usually sustained with an electrical discharge. The gas temperature is usually almost unaffected, but the chemical reactivity is vast compared with the source gas because of the presence of reactive species. In most cases of virus inactivation, atmospheric pressure plasma has been used because of practical considerations ([

  <p id="p0025">Plasmas are used in various industries, mainly for tailoring the surfaces of solids (e.g., oxidation, cleaning, nanostructuring, binding different atom/molecule groups), but also for the destruction of microorganisms such as viruses. Plasma can also be used for treatment of liquids; however, inactivation of viruses in liquid media is more challenging than for surfaces because plasma cannot be sustained in liquids, and is only present in gaseous bubbles inside the liquid or above the liquid surface. Depending on the place of their generation, RONS interact with either the bubble surface or the surface of the liquid, where many dissolve. They can then diffuse within the liquid, and may eventually interact with the virus. Furthermore, UV radiation penetrates liquids with a penetration depth that depends greatly on the wavelength, and the concentration, and type of impurities [
   <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. There are various techniques for measuring both long- and short-lived RONS in liquids [
   <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], but these are not used frequently by researchers working on the destruction of viruses. Many authors state the discharge parameters (voltage, current, power) rather than the plasma parameters (concentration of reactive species) which are necessary to compare various plasma sources. The plasma–virus scientific niche is therefore in its infancy at present.
