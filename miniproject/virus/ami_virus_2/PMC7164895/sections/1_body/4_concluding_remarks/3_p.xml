<p id="p0245">Despite the high efficiency of virus inactivation, the exact modes of action and the plasma functionality in scaled-up systems remain largely unexplored (see Outstanding Questions), and further research needs to be focused in this direction. Insufficient knowledge of plasma/virus interactions present the biggest obstacle to expansion of this field. To understand these interactions, it is important to know the flux of reactive species (RONS or radiation) on the surface of the virus, the probability that a particular type of reactive species inactivates the virus, and synergetic effects between different reactive species for viral deactivation. None of these parameters are currently understood completely. Another issue to be dealt with is how to scale up CP reactors without altering the composition and amount of reactive species achieved at small scale. This could be overcome by a scale-out approach, where several small-scale reactors could be used in parallel, thus increasing the amount of treated material but maintaining the desired plasma composition. Such an approach would also abolish the need for specialized equipment for characterizing plasma chemistry in scaled-up systems because they would be the same as those already characterized at laboratory scale.</p>
