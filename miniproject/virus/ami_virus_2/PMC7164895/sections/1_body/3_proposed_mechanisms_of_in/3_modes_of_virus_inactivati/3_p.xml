<p id="p0220">It is evident that the high oxidative power of CP derivatives can disrupt virus integrity at both the structural and genomic levels by affecting both proteins and nucleic acids. Minor disruption or conformational changes of the capsid proteins (or the lipid envelope when present) caused by RONS can result in loss of viral infectivity owing to disruption of the virus binding to receptors on the host cell surface. In cases where genomic nucleic acids are damaged, viruses will no longer be infective because intact genetic material is necessary for virus genome translation and replication. Even in cases where the damage was shown to be inflicted only to nucleic acids, it is likely that RONS also damaged or disrupted the outer protein layer to some extent because otherwise it would not be possible for the RONS to penetrate the virus and reach the genetic material.</p>
