<p id="p0215">Capsid protein damage and nucleic acid degradation were reported for bacteriophages T4 [
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], MS2 [
 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], and λ [
 <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], as well as for NDV [
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and FCV [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In the case of the enveloped virus influenza A, in addition to capsid and nucleic acid damage, changes in lipid components from the envelope have been reported [
 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Only in the case of bacteriophage λ [
 <xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and FCV [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] has it been shown that the main mode of inactivation is degradation of the capsid proteins, which preceded the degradation of nucleic acids. In other studies it was not possible to determine which degradation path contributed more to the decay in viral infectivity. The aforementioned detailed study of FCV [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] identified primary targets of CP oxidation, which included specific amino acids in different regions of the capsid protein, and specific functional peptide residues in the capsid protein region that were responsible for virus attachment and entry into the host cell. CP treatments resulted in nucleic acid degradation for FCV [
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and PVY [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] (although protein degradation was not measured), as well as for adenovirus [
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], RSV [
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and TMV [
 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], where nucleic acid degradation was indicated as the only mode of inactivation (the viral proteins or their subunits remained intact).
