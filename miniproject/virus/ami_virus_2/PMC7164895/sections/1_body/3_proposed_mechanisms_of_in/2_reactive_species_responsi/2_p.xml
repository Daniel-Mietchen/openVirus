<p id="p0200">Singlet O
 <sub>2</sub> (
 <sup>1</sup>O

 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and bacteriophage T4 [

 <sup>1</sup>O
 <sub>2</sub> causes oxidative modification of histidine residues and a shift in molecular mass of methionine residues [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It also reacts with cysteine, tyrosine, and tryptophan, and oxidizes guanine [
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Ozone (O
 <sub>3</sub>) has been reported as the main [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or additional inactivation factor [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in FCV treatment, and it was proposed to also have roles in the inactivation of the bacteriophage MS2 [
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and adenovirus [
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Hydrogen peroxide (H

 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and influenza A virus [
 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], but to have a secondary role in the inactivation of FCV [
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], PVY [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and adenovirus [
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. RNS have been proposed as the principal inactivation factors only in studies with FCV, where the main RNS species were ONOOH (in an acidic environment) [
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], ONOO

 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and NO
 <sub>x</sub> [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Other groups have measured increases in different RONS during CP treatments [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,

 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but these studies did not expand their research to determine the precise involvement of each of the RONS in virus inactivation.
