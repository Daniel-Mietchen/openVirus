<p id="p0205">In summary, RONS are the main contributors to CP-mediated virus inactivation; however, the particular reactive species that are responsible vary and are highly dependent on the experimental conditions, such as the gas used for the CP generation, the matrix, the virus treated, and the method used for RONS determination. Increased availability and development of more accurate methods for measurement of RONS and UV intensity will enable determination of the exact CP properties that are crucial for virus inactivation. In addition to determining the CP properties that contribute most to virus inactivation, for a better mechanistic understanding of the inactivation process it is also important to explore which virus component is disrupted.</p>
