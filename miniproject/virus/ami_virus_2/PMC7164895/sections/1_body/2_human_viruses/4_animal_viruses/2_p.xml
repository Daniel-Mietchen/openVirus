<p id="p0175">PRRSv is economically one of the most important pathogens in the pork industry, and can be transmitted as aerosols and remain infective after traveling long distances, making it a potential threat even to distant barns [
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Most commonly used methods for air treatment in general rely either on physically limiting virus transmission (e.g., the use of various filters) or on lowering virus infectivity (e.g., UV irradiation). CP could potentially achieve both goals by stopping viral spread and abolishing virus infectivity, by charge-driven filtration and RONS, respectively [

 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40.</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41.</xref>]. Aerosolized PRRSv has been treated in two studies by different DBDs [
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Promising results with complete virus inactivation (~3.5 log reduction) were achieved with one DBD system [
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], whereas the other system was only partly successful [
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and authors have suggested potential improvements that would increase inactivation efficiency. Based on these and the results on bacteriophages (
