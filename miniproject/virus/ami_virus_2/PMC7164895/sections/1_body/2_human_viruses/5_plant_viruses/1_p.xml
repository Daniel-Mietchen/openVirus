<p id="p0180">Plant viruses were the first viruses to be discovered [
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although most virus-to-plant transmission occurs via insects [
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], the increasing reuse of untreated wastewater and the use of closed irrigation systems as an answer to water scarcity are promoting viral spread. Plant viruses can result in tremendous economic losses, estimated at ~30 billion US dollars annually [
 <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Despite this, there are only two reports of their deactivation by CP treatments. Inactivation of the most important potato viral pathogen, potato virus Y (PVY), in water samples was achieved using plasma jet [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This water-transmissible virus [
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] was successfully inactivated in polluted and clean water with treatments of only 5-min and 1-min, respectively. Other economically relevant plant viruses that are highly stable, resistant to classic inactivation methods, and water-transmissible are the members of the genus 
 <italic>Tobamovirus</italic>, such as tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Despite the inherent stability of TMV, a 10 min treatment by DBD was shown to be sufficient to inactivate it [
