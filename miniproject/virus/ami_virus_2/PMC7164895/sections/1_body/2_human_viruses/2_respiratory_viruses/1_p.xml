 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] have only been performed with the already mentioned pulsed high-voltage CP source. RSV is the most frequent causative agent of lower respiratory tract infections in infants, and is one of the most important viruses in pediatric medicine, particularly because it spreads easily through contact with contaminated surfaces [

 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], a simpler and more portable plasma configuration would be needed for efficient decontamination of hospital surfaces, and the previously described method would be practical only for decontamination of tools and smaller objects. Some respiratory viruses can also remain stable as aerosols for longer periods of time (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and, to stop their spread, it is crucial to treat the air and not only surfaces (see the section on Animal Viruses and
