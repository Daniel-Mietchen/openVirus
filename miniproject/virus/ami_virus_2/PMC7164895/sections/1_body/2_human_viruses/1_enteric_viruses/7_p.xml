<p id="p0150">Different CP sources have also been applied to the surfaces of various foods, such as blueberries [

 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and meat [
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and viruses were successfully inactivated without altering the appearance of the treated food. It was also shown that DBD could be used to treat packaged food [
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; however, inactivation was not as good as for nonpackaged food, and this process would therefore require further improvement before implementation. Application of CP in food industry for decontamination has multiple advantages over the most widely used thermal processing of food because it can sustain the freshness and quality of food with minimal impact on the environment because of shorter treatment times and energy requirements [
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One must be careful when using CP for treating sensitive material such as food because, although CP is generally at room temperature at the point of application, the temperatures can rise in some cases because of the specific CP generation conditions. To prevent thermal damage during treatment of sensitive materials, the CP discharge needs to be placed far enough from the treated material [
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and/or have additional cooling provided. Another option is to use indirect treatments with plasma-activated liquids.
