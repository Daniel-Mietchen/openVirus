<p id="p0140">FCV was also inactivated by a DBD plasma torch on a glass surface [
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], indicating that both this device, and the previously mentioned DBD, have good potential to inactivate enteric viruses on various surfaces. On the other hand, inactivation of adenovirus on a glass surface with a pulsed high-voltage source that sustains plasma at 0.5 bar was not as successful and would thus not be as suitable as DBD for this purpose [
