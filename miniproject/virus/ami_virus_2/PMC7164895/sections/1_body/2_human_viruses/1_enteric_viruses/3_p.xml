 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Three studies reported on the comparative use of both surrogates and enteric viruses [
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It was shown that the inactivation of a chosen surrogate virus is more efficient than that of the target enteric virus [
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], suggesting that the effects of CP on such surrogates might not always mirror the effects on their enteric virus counterparts, and should thus be interpreted with caution.
