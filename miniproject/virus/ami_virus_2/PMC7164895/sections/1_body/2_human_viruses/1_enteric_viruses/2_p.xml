<p id="p0125">Animal viruses such as feline calicivirus (FCV), murine norovirus (MNV), and Tulane virus (TV) have been used as surrogates for norovirus owing to their similar sizes, morphologies, and genetic material. Furthermore, these surrogate viruses are easy to culture/reproduce, and are safe to work with [
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Opinions are divided over which of these surrogate viruses best resembles the stability of norovirus, and the final choice strongly depends on the inactivation method used and the environmental properties [

 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14.</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15.</xref>]. In addition to animal viruses, bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) can be used as surrogates for enteric viruses and other human pathogens (

   <title>Bacteriophages as Surrogates, and an Alternative CP Treatment</title>
  </caption>
  <p id="p0030">Bacteriophages are the first choice in many studies to establish proof of concept for virus inactivation methods because of their many advantages. They are relatively inexpensive to culture/produce, easy and safe to work with, they can be produced in large quantities, and plaque-based infectivity assays are time-efficient [
   <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, care must be taken when interpreting the results because they do not always correlate with the response of the actual virus to the inactivation method.
  </p>
  <p id="p0035">The first study that triggered the expansion of the plasma–virus field was conducted on bacteriophages [
   <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In recent years, bacteriophages have been used to test the use of CP for air purification [
   <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
   <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and to study CP effects on waterborne viral pathogens [
   <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
   <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].
  </p>
  <p id="p0045">Bacteriophages have been successfully inactivated in water, where almost complete inactivation of MS2 was obtained after 3 minutes using a plasma microjet [
   <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Waterborne MS2, T4, and ⌽174 were treated directly with surface DBD or indirectly with CP-activated water [
   <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. All three bacteriophages were successfully inactivated with both treatments, but shorter treatment times were needed for inactivation of ⌽174 and MS2 than for T4 (
   <xref rid="ec0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>). In general, CP-activated liquids are gaining increasing attention [
   <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] because they can be produced in more controlled ways than can direct CP treatments. Such a strategy is likely to be a better choice when working with irregular and sensitive samples because CP-activated liquids can be applied evenly and can reduce potentially unwanted mechanical changes in a treated material [
   <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>].

  <p id="p0055">Airborne human viral pathogens pose a serious threat to human health. In two studies, aerosolized MS2 bacteriophages were successfully inactivated by CP after only 0.12 s [
   <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] or 0.25 s [
   <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] of contact time of the aerosol with the plasma. Although these are very promising results, one of the biggest concerns when using plasma for air purification is the production of ozone because it can be hazardous at high concentrations. Future applications of plasma should consider this, and thus aim to lower ozone concentrations below the recommended limit [
   <xref rid="bb0335" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].
  </p>
  <p id="p0060">Another plasma-based alternative to protect against aerosolized pathogenic viruses would be a protective mask equipped with a miniature plasma source. Such a mask would have the potential to stop the spread of various viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) that are transmitted by droplets because droplets are ideal for dissolution of radicals owing to their large surface-to-volume ratio. However, the problem again arises because radicals such as ozone and nitric oxides would be inhaled, and a mask would need to include a radical catalyzer or, even better, a two-membrane design in which the first plasma membrane inactivates the virus, and the second membrane serves as a catalyzer to remove toxic species created by the plasma. We believe that such an innovative mask configuration could be highly beneficial in future outbreaks.</p>
