<p id="p0145">One of the most successful events of inactivation in liquid medium, including work on bacteriophages (
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 3</xref>), was achieved by a 15 s treatment of FCV using a plasma jet [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,

This extremely short treatment time indicates that plasma jets could be an important tool for enteric virus inactivation in liquids; however, based on its present configuration, it would be limited to the treatment of smaller objects contaminated with potentially infected droplets.
