<p id="p0135">Norovirus is one of the most, if not the most, problematic enteric virus. Its inactivation in comparison with FCV as its surrogate has been investigated using CP for diluted stool samples on a stainless steel surface and lettuce leaves. Because no infectivity assays are available to date for norovirus, inactivation was determined using 
 <bold>ethidium monoazide-coupled reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (EMA-RT-qPCR)</bold> [
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A decrease of ~2.6 log units of gene copies was observed after 5 minutes of treatment with DBD on both surfaces. The inactivation of the surrogate FCV measured by EMA-RT-qPCR in the same medium on the stainless steel surface was similar to that of norovirus, although the cell culture-based infectivity assays showed complete FCV inactivation after 3 min (also confirmed in [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). The underestimation of FCV inactivation based on EMA-RT-qPCR in comparison with the infectivity assay might also indicate underestimation of norovirus inactivation. Because FCV and norovirus were similarly affected by the CP treatment, FCV can be considered as an appropriate surrogate. However, it remains to be determined if this would also apply when using different treatment conditions.
