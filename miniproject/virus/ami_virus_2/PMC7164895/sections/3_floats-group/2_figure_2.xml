  <p>Key Figure. Inactivation of Viruses Using Cold Plasma (CP).</p>
  <p>(A) Morphologically different viruses treated with CP. (B) Close-up of CP properties responsible for virus inactivation. The most essential moieties in virus inactivation are reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species (RONS), although UV radiation and charged particles (e.g., ions, electrons) can also play a role. Molecules in the ground state are neutral and do not have any effects on virus inactivation. CP can target both viral proteins and nucleic acids (or even the virus envelope, when present). (C) After CP treatment, the virus particles and nucleic acids are partly or completely degraded to noninfective particles that cannot cause harm to their hosts.</p>
