    <bold>Acute gastroenteritis</bold>
   </term>
   <def>
    <p>inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that is mainly caused by viruses, especially rotaviruses and noroviruses. The most common symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.</p>

    <bold>Enteric viruses</bold>
   </term>
   <def>
    <p>a diverse group of human viruses that are most commonly transmitted via the fecal/oral route (including contaminated food and water), including norovirus, rotavirus, hepatitis A, sapovirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus. They infect the gastrointestinal tract, where they replicate and are then excreted in high concentrations. They can cause illness at low doses, and they can survive in the environment for long periods of time because they are resistant to physiological changes such as pH and temperature.</p>

    <bold>Ethidium monoazide-coupled reverse-transcription qPCR (EMA-RT-qPCR)</bold>
   </term>
   <def>
    <p>this method combines a nucleic acid-intercalating dye that polymerizes nucleic acid upon exposure to light (ethidium monoazide), which blocks the targeted part of the genome from PCR amplification. As a result, the EMA-RT-qPCR method only detects infectious viruses with an intact capsid after treatment. This has been proposed to be used instead of infectivity assays.</p>

    <bold>Virus inactivation</bold>
   </term>
   <def>
    <p>decreased host infection by a virus. The most reliable method to determine inactivation efficiency is an infectivity assay in which appropriate hosts (e.g., bacterial or eukaryotic cells, plants, chicken embryos) are inoculated with a virus. Inoculation is followed by the observation/measurement of different factors such as plaque formation, cytopathic effects, and symptoms in plants, embryo survival, or the integrity of viral nucleic acids.</p>
