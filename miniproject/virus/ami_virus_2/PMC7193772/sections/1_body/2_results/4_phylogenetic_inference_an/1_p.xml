<p>To better understand patterns of SAV movement in Norwegian aquaculture, we performed a Bayesian phylogeographic analysis (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lemey et al., 2009</xref>) including samples generated in the study, along with other publicly available SAV3 genome sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The phylogeny suggests that SAV3 consists of two distinct clades (previously observed in 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Karlsen et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Jansen et al., 2010</xref>), here defined as SAV3a and SAV3b (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), which diverged approximately 18.9 years ago or Feb/March of 2000 (95% HPD, 17.15–21.08 years) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), relatively early on in the SAV3 epidemic. These two clades differ by silent substitutions in just two locations in the genome, one in nsP2 (703
 <sub>K</sub>) and the other in E2 (539
 <sub>S</sub>). The two sequences that branched basal to the two SAV3 clades contain a variant from each clade, indicating that this may have been the ancestral genotype of SAV3 in Norway before splitting into two clades. Moreover, while strains sampled in 2009–2010 fall in both clades, all of the sequences generated in this study (sampled from 2016 to 2019) fall into the SAV3b clade and are highly conserved. Interestingly, the absence of any SAV3a clade strains in the sequences generated in this study – even in samples from the heavily populated Hordaland region - suggests that this lineage may have gone extinct. While the estimated backbone of the phylogeny is Hordaland (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), there appears to be several distinct lineages that share a MRCA that is 7.85 years (95% HPD, 5.39–10.39 years) or older (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; green-colored node). The oldest lineage currently active has been evolving separately for around 15 years (95% HPD, 12.51–17.7 years), which indicates that several small-scale, local epidemics are co-circulating at the same time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>; indicated by red-colored node). All but one of the strains from Sogn of Fjordane were monophyletic, indicating that an individual seeding event from Hordaland (independent of previous strains in this county) resulted in this outbreak. While only a single strain from Rogaland was sequenced in this study, it branched internal to many Hordaland strains, again indicating that the ancestor of this strain originated in Hordaland and was recently introduced to Rogaland.
