<p>Combining Nanopore reads from single-subtype infections sequenced using the above approach allowed us to test this methodâ€™s ability to correctly detect SAV subtype level co-infections by mapping reads simultaneously to multiple reference genomes. A similar method has been used recently to provide evidence of SAV co-infections using high accuracy Illumina data (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gallagher et al., 2020</xref>), but its applicability to error-prone long-reads was not previously established. Reads from SAV2 and SAV3 were combined in a range of ratios, producing bioinformatic mimics of co-infection scenarios. All ratios of SAV2:SAV3 tested resulted in highly accurate mapping with less than 0.3% of the reads being mapped to the incorrect reference sequence across all samples (mean: 0.16% error rate). All naturally infected samples sequenced in this study were analyzed with this approach to detect any subtype co-infections, however, all samples proved to be single subtype in origin.
