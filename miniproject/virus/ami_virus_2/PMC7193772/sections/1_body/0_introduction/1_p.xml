 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>) with a ∼12 kb genome consisting of two open reading frames (ORFs), encoding the structural polyprotein (∼4 kb), and the non-structural polyprotein (∼8 kb) (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Weston et al., 2002</xref>). The viral genome exists as a polyadenylated ∼12 kb genomic RNA molecule from which the non-structural polyprotein is translated, and a transcribed ∼4 kb sub-genomic RNA, also polyadenylated, from which the structural polyprotein is translated (
