<p>Similar to other RNA viruses, the high rate of evolution in SAV can be detected at a genetic level within timeframes of a few years (

Previous work on Norwegian SAV3 showed the presence of two co-circulating strains that overlap both temporally and spatially, across wide geographic distances, indicating significant genetic diversity within SAV3 available for molecular epidemiological studies (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Karlsen et al., 2014</xref>). Both SAV subtypes present in Norway are geographically structured with the counties of Rogaland and Hordaland having a SAV3 epidemic, Trøndelag having a SAV2 epidemic, and Møre og Romsdal reporting cases of both SAV2 and SAV3 (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Norwegian Veterinary Institute, 2018</xref>). These regions of overlapping epidemics provide ample opportunity for co-infections to arise between the two subtypes, observed recently in Møre og Romsdal in a case of PD (
