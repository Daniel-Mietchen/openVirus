<p>Therefore, to characterize the current phylogenetic structure of SAV3 and thus test the hypothesis that passive drift by water currents has been the dominating transmission mechanism, an established Nanopore amplicon sequencing approach (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gallagher et al., 2018</xref>) was used in the current study. After first confirming the accuracy of this approach for distinguishing sub-type level co-infections of SAV2 and SAV3, which we considered a hypothetical possibility in regions with overlapping epidemics, twenty-four SAV3 genomes were sequenced from heart tissues sampled between 2016 and 2019. This dataset allowed us to characterize the current genetic diversity of SAV3 in Norwegian aquaculture. We found that several distinct lineages of SAV3, representing independent transmission chains, are active in Norway. Lack of clear geographical structuring in these lineages further suggested that anthropogenic transport of the virus likely played a significant role in shaping the current genetic structure and is an important transmission route that acts not only over large geographic distances, but also locally.
