<p>Twenty-three naturally SAV-infected heart tissues of Atlantic salmon and one heart tissue from rainbow trout stored in RNAlater were obtained from PHARMAQ Analytiq (Zoetis) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Samples were selected from across as wide a geographic range as possible and were sampled between 2016 and 2019. Total RNA was extracted from each sample using a phenol-chloroform approach, and integrity assessed using gel electrophoresis. cDNA was synthesized using Protoscript II Reverse Transcriptase (New England Biolabs) and a mix of random hexamer and anchored-dT (dT
 <sub>23</sub>VN) primers. First strand cDNA was used as template for PCR reactions.
