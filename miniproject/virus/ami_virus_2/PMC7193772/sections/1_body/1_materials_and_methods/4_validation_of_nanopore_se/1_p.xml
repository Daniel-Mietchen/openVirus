<p>As several of the samples sequenced in this study were from regions where both SAV2 and SAV3 have been detected, the effectiveness of this sequencing method at detecting subtype-level co-infections was determined. This rationale also follows our recent work, which provided evidence for SAV subtype-level infections in the same samples using a short-read sequencing approach (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gallagher et al., 2020</xref>). In the current study, Nanopore reads from samples of confirmed single-subtype infections were individually mapped to a structural polyprotein reference sequence of the relevant SAV subtype using MiniMap2 (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2018</xref>) with default parameters. Mapped reads were extracted and only reads of &gt;1,500 bp were used for subsequent analyses. Reads from each sample were sequenced on separate flow cells and so were labeled with a different run ID. To simulate subtype-level co-infections, reads were combined in different proportions from each sample so that each “co-infection” had 10,000 reads in total ranging from 5% SAV2 reads to 95% SAV2 reads, and the corresponding ratio of SAV3 reads. These artificial “co-infections” were then simultaneously mapped to reference sequences of both SAV2 and SAV3 using MiniMap2 and default parameters. The alignment files were visualized in Geneious v.2019.0.4 and the number of reads that mapped to the incorrect reference was calculated as the mapping error rate.
