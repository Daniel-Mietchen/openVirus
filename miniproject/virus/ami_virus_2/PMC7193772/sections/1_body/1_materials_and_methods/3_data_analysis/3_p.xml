<p>Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the twenty-four consensus sequences generated in this study as well as all previously published whole genome sequences of SAV3 strains with sampling dates and locations, obtained from NCBI (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v.7 with default parameters (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>) and the best fit substitution model was determined using IQTREE (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017</xref>) (TIM2 + G4; 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Posada, 2003</xref>). To further imply the evolutionary rate and divergence estimations, a regression of root-to-tip genetic distances against date of sampling was performed using TempEst (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2016</xref>) with the input tree generated in IQTREE (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>) with the same best fit substitution model as above. A 11,681 bp alignment of 37 sequences was used for phylogenetic analysis in BEAST2 (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bouckaert et al., 2014</xref>) using tip-date time calibration, an uncorrelated relaxed clock model (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al., 2006</xref>), and a Coalescent Bayesian Skyline tree prior (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al., 2005</xref>). Ancestral state location reconstruction was used to estimate the likely geographic location of each node of the tree (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Lemey et al., 2009</xref>). A single MCMC chain was run for 200 million generations, sampled every 20,000 generations and sampling convergence was confirmed with Tracer v1.7.1, evidenced by effective sample sizes &gt;200 for all parameters (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2018</xref>). A maximum clade credibility tree was created using TreeAnnotator v2.5.1 (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Drummond et al., 2012</xref>) after removing the first 10% of trees as burn-in. The resulting trees were visualized in FigTree v1.4.4.
