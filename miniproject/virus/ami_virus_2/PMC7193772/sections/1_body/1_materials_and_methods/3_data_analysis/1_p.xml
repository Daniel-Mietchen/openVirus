<p>MinION sequence basecalling and demultiplexing was performed with Guppy v3.1.5 using the high accuracy basecaller on a Linux CPU system with default parameters. Resulting FASTQ files were aligned to reference sequences for SAV2 (MH708652) and SAV3 (JQ799139) simultaneously using MiniMap2 (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Li, 2018</xref>) with default parameters. Resulting alignment files were visualized in Geneious v.2019.0.4 and consensus sequences were generated using the “Highest Quality” threshold parameter. Consensus sequences were inspected manually for alignment errors or frameshift mutations that would disrupt the protein coding sequence of the genome.
