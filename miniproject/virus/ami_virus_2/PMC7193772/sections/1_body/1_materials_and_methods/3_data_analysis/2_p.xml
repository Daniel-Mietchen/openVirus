<p>FASTQ files were also aligned to a reference genome using the NGMLR mapper and analyzed for structural variants (deletions, duplications, and inversions) using Sniffles (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Sedlazeck et al., 2018</xref>) with the following parameters: a minimum coverage of 50 reads per variant and a minimum variant size of 10 bp. Anything smaller than 10 bp was not reliably detected by this software due to the prevalence of random indels generated during Nanopore sequencing. Resulting variant calling files were visualized in IGV and structural variants were manually inspected to reduce false positive calls.
