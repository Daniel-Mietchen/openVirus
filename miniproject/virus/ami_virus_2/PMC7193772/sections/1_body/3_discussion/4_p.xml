<p>Finally, as several of the samples used in this study were from regions that have had outbreaks of both SAV2 and SAV3 in the past, our sequencing method was tested on the sensitivity and accuracy of detecting both subtypes in the same sample. Our previous study has shown that multiple SAV subtypes are commonly co-circulating on the same farm, and may also be found as co-infections within individual fish (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Gallagher et al., 2020</xref>). At an error rate of less than 0.3%, our results show that sequencing âˆ¼2 kb amplicons and sequencing on the MinION platform enables highly accurate detection of such co-infections, even when the second subtype is at a relatively low titer (as low as 5% of the total SAV reads). However, these data are based on 
 <italic>in silico</italic> co-infections as none of the samples sequenced in this study showed natural co-infections of SAV2 and SAV3, and future work should include samples that have been mixed in the lab prior to sequencing, as well as natural co-infections when identified.
