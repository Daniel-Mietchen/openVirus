<p>An interesting finding was the presence of multiple presumably defective viral RNA sequences carrying numerous deletions across the genome (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). All samples apart from one contained deletions ranging from 1 to 40 deletions per isolate, across a range of lengths from 11 bp to 378 bp. Deletion mutations have previously been described in Venezuelan equine encephalitis, a closely related member of the alphavirus genus (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Forrester et al., 2011</xref>), and in SAV (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Petterson et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), with the latter showing the presence of the same or similar deletions in multiple samples. The non-random distribution of deletions across the SAV genome, seen clearly in our analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), suggests that template switching during RNA synthesis is a plausible source of origin, with factors such as secondary RNA structure, sequence identity and the kinetics of transcription influencing template switching (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011</xref>). While it is unlikely that viral genomes missing large sections of either the structural or non-structural polyprotein are viable, it is impossible to rule that all of the deletions observed result in a defective viral particle, considering that approximately 34% of the deletions did not cause a disruption to the protein coding sequence (in-frame deletions) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Additionally, in-frame deletions located in the non-structural polyprotein may only affect the replication of the virus, not the packaging of the virus particles, though more research into this area would shed light on the impact of such deletions on the packaging signals of SAV. As SAV has been shown to recombine 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> to rescue viral genomes with otherwise fatal mutation errors (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Petterson et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible that defective RNA molecules may be packaged into viral particles in the eventuality that more than one particle infects a single cell. Additionally, very similar deletions were found in closely related strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>), which is compatible with deleted genomes being transmitted between infected fish. However, equally similar deletions are found across relatively distant strains which strongly suggests an independent origin of at least the majority of the deletion mutations.
