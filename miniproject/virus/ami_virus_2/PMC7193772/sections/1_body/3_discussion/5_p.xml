<p>In conclusion, whole genome analyses has helped increase our knowledge of the genetic diversity found in SAV infections impacting farmed salmon, and can thus be used to understand transmission pathways, viral population dynamics and the potential role that wild reservoirs play in ongoing PD epidemics. The apparent repeated seeding of SAV3 from “source” counties like Hordaland to surrounding “sink” counties implies that effective mitigating strategies might be able to limit the PD epidemic in “sink” regions with improved biosecurity approaches. Future investigations into this would benefit from higher geographical resolution than was available in this study (i.e., at the farm level). However, more work is required to understand the relative impact that passive transmission (i.e., water currents) has on viral spread compared to the transportation of viral material via infected fish, especially on different geographical and temporal scales.</p>
