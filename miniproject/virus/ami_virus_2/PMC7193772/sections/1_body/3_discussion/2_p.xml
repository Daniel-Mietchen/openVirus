<p>Considering the presence of sequence diversity within each host, we considered the consensus sequence (i.e., the most abundant viral strain in a sample) to be informative for epidemiological analysis. Our data suggests that Hordaland sources are seemingly seeding introductions of SAV3 strains to surrounding counties where pathogen persistence is shorter than in Hordaland (i.e., Rogaland and Sogn og Fjordane). This dynamic is compatible with a source-sink model (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2018</xref>) where viral lineages move from an area which can support a sustained epidemic (the source) to regions that cannot support the epidemic indefinitely (the sink). This is particularly apparent when comparing strains sampled in 2010 and those sampled between 2016 and 2019. In 2010, there were two distinct co-circulating clades of SAV3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). However, samples from 2016 to 2019 fell into only one of these clades, and while this data cannot confirm the extinction of SAV3a, the absence of any recent SAV3a strains supports a source-sink model. These two SAV3 clades have been reported before (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Karlsen et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Jansen et al., 2010</xref>), however, the timing of the split between the two clades had not yet been estimated. It is somewhat unsurprising to find Hordaland as an occasional source of virus, since the county has the highest density of seawater sites and the highest number of reported SAV3 cases per year (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Norwegian Veterinary Institute, 2018</xref>). The lack of long-term established SAV local reservoirs in Sogn og Fjordane and Rogaland is, however, more noteworthy. A possible explanation to this pattern could be that a significant number of SAV3 transmissions across large geographic distances are not a result of passive transport with water currents, but rather of anthropogenic origin. However, it is still likely that passive transport plays a role in short-term local outbreaks.
