  <p>Bayesian phylogeny of the 24 SAV3 genomes generated in this study along with all publicly available SAV3 genome sequences from NCBI. The tree was built from an 11,681 bp alignment and analyzed in BEAST2 using the best fit nucleotide substitution model (TIM2 + G4), a relaxed molecular clock model, tip-dating, and a coalescent Bayesian Skyline population model. A discrete phylogeographical analysis was performed using ancestral reconstruction with branch colors indicating the estimated geographic location of each node. Statistical support for key nodes is indicated by posterior probability values in bold, and the ancestral location probability in brackets. Strains sequenced in this study are indicated by an *.</p>
