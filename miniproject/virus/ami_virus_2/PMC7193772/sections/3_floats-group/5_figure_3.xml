  <p>Distribution of deletions (â‰¥10 bp) throughout the SAV3 genome of isolates sequenced on the MinION platform. Only deletions with &gt;50 supporting reads were considered, and all deletions were manually inspected to reduce the rate of false-positive calls. Bars indicate regions with a deletion and are colored by estimated frequency. Isolates are plotted according to phylogenetic relationships shown elsewhere in this study (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and the genomic position of each gene is used as a reference.
