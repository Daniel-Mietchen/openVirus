In Italy, after the shutdown of the educational system (schools and Universities will remain closed at least for one month) and the collapse of the touristic sector (90% of travels and reservations cancelled), the Government officially locked down residents of all the region of Milan (Lombardia) and other 11 provinces. To avoid the imprisonment, hundreds thousand people left those areas with any possible mean in the night of March 7th, just before the law was signed by the prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, thus turning his purpose of slowing down the epidemics exactly into the opposite. The Governors of Southern regions adopted limitations for this huge mass of potentially infected incoming people, with the risk of disseminating suspicion in the population (“hunting the greaser”). Violence exploded in several prisons, due to the cancellation of all the family visits and fear of the virus. Just 48 hours later, the Italian Government has extended these exceptional war-like measures to the entire nation: nobody is allowed to exit from home other than for compelling job or health reasons; museums, cinemas, theatres, sport facilities, and even churches have been closed; restaurants and bars must stop at 6 PM their activity. Further restrictions are probably going to be considered in next days. The Italian prime minister was clear in his video-message of March 5th: the emergency does not come from the lethality of the virus, but from the impossibility of the Italian healthcare system to cope with the impact of a rapid epidemic spreading of the Covid-19.
