<p id="Par26">For saliva droplets as transmission routine in coronavirus infection, a retrospective cohort study of SARS-CoV transmission reported that students who were in the same cubicle with the SARS patient contracted SARS-CoV, telling us that proximity to SARS patients increases chances of SARS-CoV infection.

 </sup> Virus-laden droplets were found in a study as a routine of transmission in SARS epidemics.

 </sup> van Doremalen et al. evaluated the stability of 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV in aerosils using a Bayesian regression model, and found that 2019-nCoV remained viable ins aerosols throughout 3-h experiment duration, which is similar to SARS-CoV.

 </sup> SARS-CoV dissemination belongs to opportunistically airborne transmission.

 </sup> 2019-nCoV also possibly belong to the same transmission type, dissemination of virus occurs if individuals are exposed to a high concentration of infectious aerosols in comparatively sealed space for long time.
