<p id="Par24">For the diagnostic value of saliva in coronavirus infection, high expression level of SARS-CoV RNA was detected in saliva specimens from 17 SARS patients, four of which had not yet lung lesion, suggesting value of early diagnosis of saliva, similarly to 2019-nCoV.

 </sup> A previous animal study on early events of SARS-CoV infection showed that SARS-CoV was detected in oral swabs before blood test turned positive on second day after viral challenge through nasal cavity.

 </sup> The viral load profile in saliva of 2019-nCoV nearly peaks at the time of symptom onset, while SARS-CoV peaks at around 10 days after symptoms.

 </sup> The high viral load of 2019-nCoV suggests it can be transmitted even if symptom is mild or less obvious. Older age was associated with higher SARS-CoV in saliva, and a high initial SARS-CoV load was associated with death.

 </sup> 2019-nCoV RNA could be detected in saliva for 20 days or even longer, and the prolonged detection of viral RNA also exist in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection.
