<p id="Par23">2019-nCoV, which is also named as SARS-CoV-2,
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>
 </sup> shares about 79% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>
 </sup> SARS-CoV have a higher mortality rate, while 2019-nCoV spreads much faster.

 </sup> The similarities and differences of saliva are summarized as follows in terms of diagnosis value of saliva, direct invasion to oral tissues, and saliva droplet transmission between SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV, hopefully explaining the faster transmission speed of 2019-nCoV (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
