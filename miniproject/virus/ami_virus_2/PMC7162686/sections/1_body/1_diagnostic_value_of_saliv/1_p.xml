 </sup> Throat swabs are relatively invasive, induce coughing and cause bleeding occasionally, which may increase risks of healthcare workers infection. Saliva stands at the entry of respiratory system and was also found 2019-nCoV nucleic acid positive.

 </sup> With the nature of noninvasion and less hazard to healthcare workers, saliva specimen collection has the advantages of being more acceptable for patients and more secured for healthcare workers for diagnosis of coronavirus. Till now, three approaches have been reported to collect saliva—coughing out, saliva swabs, and directly from salivary gland duct. In two studies on coughed out saliva, 11 cases out of 12 (91.67%)

 </sup> COVID-19 patients were 2019-nCoV RNA positive in saliva, respectively. In one study of saliva swabs, half of 15 (50%)

 </sup> COVID-19 patients were 2019-nCoV RNA positive in saliva. In one study of saliva directly from salivary gland duct, four cases of 31 (12.90%)

 </sup> COVID-19 patients were 2019-nCoV RNA positive in saliva, three of which were critically ill. Early diagnosis of 2019-nCoV is still difficult, diagnostic value of saliva specimens for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid examination remains limited but promising, which we should still be cautious but expected about.
