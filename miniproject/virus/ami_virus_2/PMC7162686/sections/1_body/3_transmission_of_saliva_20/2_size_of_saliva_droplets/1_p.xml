 </sup> Most communicable respiratory infections are transmitted via large droplets within short distance or by contacting contaminated surfaces.

 </sup> Large droplets (diameter &gt; 60 μm) tend to quickly settle form the air, so the risk of pathogen transmission is limited to individuals in close proximity to the saliva droplet source.

 </sup> Small droplets (diameter ≤ 60 μm) may get involved in short-range transmission (distance between individuals less than 1 m). Small droplets are likely to evaporate into droplet nuclei (diameter &lt; 10 μm) in favorable environment, then become potential for long-distance aerosol transmission.
