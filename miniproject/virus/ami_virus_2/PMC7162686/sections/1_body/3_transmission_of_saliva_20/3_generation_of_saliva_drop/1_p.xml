 </sup> The amount, distance, and size of saliva droplets varies among people, suggesting the infectious strength and transmission path of saliva droplets differ when same pathogen was contracted.

 </sup> Around 40,000 saliva droplets reaching several meters in air can be generated by one sneeze.

 </sup> One normal exhalation can generate saliva droplets reaching the distance of 1â€‰m in air.

 </sup> Large saliva droplets with more mass tends to fall ballistically to the ground and small saliva droplets travel like a cloud over longer distance by air flow.
