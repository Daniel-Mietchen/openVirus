<p id="Par20">Whether saliva droplets can become truly long-distance aerosol transmission is determined by how long the saliva droplets can reside in the air (physical decay), how long the pathogen in saliva droplets remain infectious (biological decay), and whether theses infectious saliva droplets can be acquired by another person (acquisition).

 </sup> In terms of physical decay, saliva droplets evaporate fast into reduced mass in dry air, tending to stay longer along with air flow.

 </sup> The composition of droplet nuclei determines its terminal size.

 </sup> For droplets with slow biological decay, temperature differences and opened door set up droplets exchange along with air flow.

 </sup> Biological decay is determined by dehydration, exposure to ultraviolet and chemicals.

 </sup> Only hardy organism such as 
 <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> can survive long in air to form long-distance transmission.

 </sup> A recent review summarized that coronavirus stay vital on surfaces of metal, glass, or plastic for up to 9 days, but no solid evidence has been found how long in air.

 </sup> The coronavirus on inanimate surfaces could be efficiently inactivated by 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 62–71% ethanol, or 0.5% hydrogen peroxide within 1 min as summarized in the literature.
