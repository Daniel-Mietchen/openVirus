 </sup> About half of the victims reported symptoms of dry mouth and amblygeustia.

 </sup> These symptoms probably came from dysfunction of tongue expressing ACE2 and furin, and salivary gland expression ACE2. However, there is no histopathological evidence to support the direct invasion of 2019-nCoV to oral tissue so far. While it suggests that cells expressing ACE2 and furin have lower restriction for virus entry theoretically, the molecular mechanism of 2019-nCoV infection is not yet fully unfolded and we should still be cautious about and not overstating the current virus-invade-host theory.
