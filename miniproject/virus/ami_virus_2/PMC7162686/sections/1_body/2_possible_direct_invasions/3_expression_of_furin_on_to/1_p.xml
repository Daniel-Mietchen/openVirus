 </sup> A furin-like cleavage site in the Spike protein of 2019-nCoV has been identified.

 </sup> Furin is highly expressed in lung tissue, possibly providing a gain-of-function to infectivity of 2019-nCoV.

 </sup> Furin expression was detected by immunostaining in human tongue epithelia, and significantly upregulated when squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) occured.

 </sup> Combined with high expression of ACE2, tongue has high risk of coronavirus infection among oral cavity and SSC even increases the risk once exposed to coronavirus. While it suggests that cells expressing furin have lower restriction for virus entry theoretically, it should still be cautious whether the furin-like cleavage site plays a big role in 2019-nCoV infection.
