<p>Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an artificial recurrent neural network that is an effective model for the prediction of time series where data are sequential [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. By storing the past in hidden states, they can predict the outputs more accurately. In this study, the aim was to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases through time; as this is a well-suited task for the LSTM model, we used this model in our study.
