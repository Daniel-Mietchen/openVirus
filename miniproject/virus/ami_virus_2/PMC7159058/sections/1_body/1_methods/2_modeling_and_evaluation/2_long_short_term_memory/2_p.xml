<p>The linear regression model and a 3-layer LSTM model (
 <xref rid="figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) are employed to predict the daily new cases. RapidMiner Studio 9.3.001 (RapidMiner GmbH) and Python 3.7.3 (Python Software Foundation) were used for modeling and evaluation. Tensorflow (Google Brain Team) and Keras (Fran√ßois Cholle) were used as frameworks for training LSTM models. In addition, 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the models, and the root mean square error (RMSE) metric was chosen for performance evaluation:
