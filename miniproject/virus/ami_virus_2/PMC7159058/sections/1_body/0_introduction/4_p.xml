<p>The tasks in data mining fall into two categories: (1) descriptive tasks that deal with the general properties of the data and (2) predictive tasks, wherein the goal is to build models that can estimate the mapping from inputs to outputs by using a sample of data called training data. The trained models can be deployed to make predictions of the outputs for unseen inputs. These techniques are more flexible and efficient for exploratory analysis than the traditional statistical analysis [
