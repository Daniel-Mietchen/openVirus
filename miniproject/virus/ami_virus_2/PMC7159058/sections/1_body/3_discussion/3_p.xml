<p>The LSTM model showed a fluctuated performance in the folds while training loss was low. This indicates overfitting in the LSTM model because of the limited amount of training data. However, a low training error shows that the LSTM model can extract the pattern in the data. Therefore, we believe that by increasing the amount of training data, the LSTM model can outperform other models for this task. In addition, owing to the presence of just a few samples in each test fold (4 instances) and the subsequent high variation in RMSE, evaluation of the LSTM model was repeated with 3-fold cross-validation and the obtained RMSE was 13.45 (SD 7.90).</p>
