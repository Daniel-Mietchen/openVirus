<p>In 2017, McGough et al [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also proposed a Zika virus prediction system by using Zika-related Google searches, Twitter microblogs, and a digital surveillance system. They also showed that the internet-based sources were useful to predict weekly Zika cases. In another related study in 2016, Majumder et al [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] used HealthMap surveillance data and Google Trends to predict cases of Zika virus in Colombia [
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and showed that digital surveillance data could be useful for the prediction of Zika cases. Further, in 2017, Teng et al [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] proposed a prediction model for Zika virus using search data from Google Trends and built the model using an autoregressive integrated moving average. They found a strong correlation between Zika-related searches and Zika cases. For the incidence prediction of influenza, socioenvironmental factors were considered when developing an epidemiological model named Susceptible Exposed to Infectious Recovered (SEIR) [
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The model supports decision makers to factor the mass media and climate factors into the classical epidemic models. Another study emphasized the importance of environmental factors for the development of an influenza prediction model [
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The findings of these studies along with our study show that internet resources could be helpful in pandemic forecasting.
