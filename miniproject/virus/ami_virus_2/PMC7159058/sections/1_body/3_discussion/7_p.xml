<p>In contrast, one major limitation of this study is the limited access to the Google Search data. Since Google Trends just provides data based on “interest” measure, more accurate and informative models could be built if the absolute search frequency is available for the researchers. It is worth mentioning that we used some of the keywords related to COVID-19 for extracting Google search frequencies; the selected keywords may have been incomplete and further research could aim to identify the most relevant set of keywords. In addition, future research should combine other data sources such as social media information, people’s contacts with the special call center for COVID-19, mass media, environmental and climate factors, and screening registries. Furthermore, in the broader context, such predictions could be made for other countries and even globally.</p>
