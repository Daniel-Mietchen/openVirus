<p id="Par6">A 31-year-old man voluntarily participated in the study and signed informed consent. Two kinds of samples were provided for SARS-CoV-2 testing (semen and urine). The patient’s medical history featured a recent diagnosis of dyslipidemia, for which treatment with Simvastatin 20 mg/die was started about one year prior to SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Other relevant entries included a diagnosis of androgenetic alopecia currently treated with topical finasteride 1 mg/die and a knee trauma which required surgical reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in 2012. The subject had no relevant andrological pathologies. He referred a state of well-being until March 12th 2020, when he experienced the onset of fever above 38 °C and myalgia (predominantly in the interscapular region) in the absence of chills, pharyngodynia, cough and dyspnea. Since he previously visited a site where COVID-19 cases were reported, he started home isolation, as indicated by current COVID-19 protocols, and began treatment with oral paracetamol 1 g twice a day. The further onset of anosmia and ageusia together with the persistence of fever compelled the execution of a pharyngeal swab on March 19th, which was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The clinical conditions showed a slow but stable improvement with complete resolution reported on March 31st. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the detailed development of the clinical picture from the onset until resolution. Control pharyngeal swabs were repeated on March 28th and April 1st.
