<p id="Par8">In this study, for the first time, we studied SARS-CoV-2 in semen and urine samples of a 31-year-old man who volunteered for analyses. The subject, after experiencing symptoms compatible with COVID-19 performed a first pharyngeal swab on March 19th where SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected. Since he experienced a mild disease, he was isolated at home and received only treatment with paracetamol. Eight days after, when symptoms were partially improved, he agreed to provide a semen and urine sample for testing. In both these samples, we did not detect the presence SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Further pharyngeal swabs were performed on March 28th and April 1st, both of them resulting negative.</p>
