<p id="Par42"> Current surveillance systems for viral zoonoses are highly reactive, largely capturing threats once they have emerged in humans or have caused extensive livestock or wildlife morbidity or mortality. While current systems are inadequate for prevention and early detection, existing programs may be leveraged as a starting point (Murray et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2012</xref>). For example, many countries conduct wild bird surveillance for avian influenza, but screening is typically limited to only a subset of HA and NA subtypes, limiting knowledge of viral diversity circulating in populations (Hoye et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>). Targeted surveillance for broader indicators of viral diversity (e.g., whole genome sequencing or at least typing for all 8 AI gene segments) can provide baseline monitoring to capture changes, including risk potential, over time. Coordinated global research priorities, such as set forward by the OIE-FAO OFFLU global network of expertise on influenza (
