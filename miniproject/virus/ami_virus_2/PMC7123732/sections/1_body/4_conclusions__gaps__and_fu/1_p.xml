<p id="Par41">Several key research gaps remain that limit our ability to recognize and prioritize needs for viral threat reduction related to wildlife. Firstly, we lack knowledge of most of the viral pathogens that are circulating in wildlife (most of which have not yet been discovered and characterized (Anthony et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>)), and how those pathogens are evolving in relation to our changing pressures on the environment. Secondly, we lack criteria to fully determine zoonotic potential of viral agents that are detected. Progress in these research areas is important for identifying practices that drive disease transmission risks and for prioritizing critical control points in risk analyses and risk reduction efforts (Morse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>).
