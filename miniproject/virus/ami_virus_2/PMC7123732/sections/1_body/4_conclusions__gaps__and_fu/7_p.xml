<p id="Par47">In addition to the benefits for strengthening public health capacity and infrastructure, there is a strong overall cost argument to detecting and preventing viral disease emergence from bushmeat and other wildlife sources. A recent study using ground-truthed data for viral discovery in bat species estimated that around 300,000 viruses exist in mammalian wildlife, 85 % of which could be detected through investments of approximately US$1.4 billion. Aiming for 100 % detection would be more expensive ($6.8 billion) due to diminishing returns on viral discovery, but even this figure is less than the cost of some major single outbreaks (e.g., SARS) (Anthony et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012a</xref>). Globally coordinated, mitigative responses that reduce the risks and frequency of diseases emerging in the first place and are implemented now are forecast to save approximately US$3.5 billion per year over a 100-year time horizon in comparison to a business-as-usual approach to EID response (Pike et al.
