<p id="Par33">Despite the globalization of foodsupply systems, there is no central global governance structure for foodborne or food-associated disease risks, and there is no precise estimate of foodborne or food-associated disease incidence or burden. To address this, the World Health Organization (WHO) is undergoing an assessment of the global impacts of foodborne illnesses through its Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses. While the FAO-WHO Codex Alimentarius provides benchmark international trade standards to promote food safety, the guidance is voluntary; the U.S., for example, does not require its producers and suppliers to adhere to its rigorous standards. The lack of a central authority for wildlife health has translated into limited infrastructure for disease surveillance and control around the safety of bushmeat in both source and demand settings. As a result, efforts have largely focused on reactive responses to disease emergence events, rather than prevention of disease risks. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) regulates trade of livestock for priority diseases, which include some potential zoonoses (e.g., HPAI), but does not address wildlife trade/pathogens specifically in its World Trade Organization-enforced sanitary standards. There is no comparable regulation for wildlife diseases, although in the USA, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specifically restricts imports of certain turtles in response to salmonellosis, bats in response to Nipah virus, African rodents in response to monkeypox, civets in response to SARS, and non-human primates (Smith et al.
