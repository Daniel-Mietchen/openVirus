<p id="Par31">Health and conservation goals and actions have not always aligned, with history of some rash disease control efforts unnecessarily resulting in harm to wildlife and domestic animal populations, and when conservation frameworks (e.g., the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) do not directly consider disease risks in their decision making. To more effectively address both public health and conservation concerns, it is necessary to improve synergy between the two communities with integrated, science-based approaches. This need is especially urgent in the food safety realm, where nutritional dependencies demand sustainable access to food sources. The UNâ€™s post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals set the stage for poverty reduction, food access/security, health, and environmental balance, potentially providing opportunities for integrated solutions that could be applied to food safety challenges related to wildlife and food systems.</p>
