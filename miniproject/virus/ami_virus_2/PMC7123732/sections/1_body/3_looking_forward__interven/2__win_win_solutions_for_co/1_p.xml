<p id="Par30">The number of hungry people globally has declined by more than 200 million since 1990, despite the addition of almost two billion people over the same period (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>). This largely can be attributed to ongoing improvements and increases in global food production and supply systems and global efforts to improve food security (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>). These improvements have improved human health more broadly by decreasing malnourishment, increasing life expectancy and reducing child mortality (Raudsepp-Hearne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2010</xref>; Godfray et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>). Health gains will of course continue to be an ongoing human objective, with food security being a central part of the development agenda (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2014</xref>). The health benefits of food production, however, need to be weighed against the health and environmental costs, including those associated with ecosystem degradation (McMichael et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2007</xref>). There have been calls for concerted redistribution of excess food and deployment of food production technologies to areas of the world most in need (Tilman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2011</xref>). These strategies might have secondary benefits to global health by reducing food demands in some regions, leading to reduced environmental and total area designated for food production.
