<p id="Par37">Strong regulations can be established to prohibit and provide disincentives for legal and illegal sale of bushmeat to overcome growing demand as a luxury product. High taxation levies may sufficiently raise the price to reduce demand and provide revenue for enforcement and surveillance efforts ( see Courchamp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>). The clandestine nature of the illegal wildlife trade remains a challenge for tracking and enforcement, but high penalties have not yet been enacted in many settings; steeper penalties may provide stronger disincentives to participation in the illegal wildlife trade, such that even if zero volume cannot be realistically achieved, a large reduction in volume will still have large benefits from a risk reduction viewpoint. Additionally, development projects that encroach into wildlife habitat can be managed to ensure they do not fuel demand for bushmeat. Governments can demand responsibility on the part of corporations to provide alternative food sources for employees and set policies to provide deterrents for bushmeat consumption. Governments could require wildlife disease risk analysis processes to be undertaken for proposed development projects to more proactively weigh risks and ensure risk prevention or mitigation measures are conducted. This type of analysis could be included within existing Health Impact Assessment (HIA) structures, because, while some HIAs include risk of zoonotic diseases from domestic animals and other vectors, few adequately address the range of potential zoonotic pathogens in their intended scope.
