<p id="Par36">Harvesting of wild meat holds acritical position in the diets, economies, and cultures of millions of people globally. Current governance and enforcement structures are therefore unlikely to be fully effective and in many cases unwarranted for reducing local demand (e.g., for local populations living in or on the periphery of forests with few suitable alternatives). In this context, some interventions may be low-resource and high-yield, such as working with hunters and foresters to convey risks of collecting deceased wildlife carcasses and encourage reporting of animal morbidity or mortality that can inform disease surveillance efforts (Rouquet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2005</xref>; Olson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2012</xref>). These interventions to prevent initial spillover are especially important given the challenges of influencing human behaviors when controlling human outbreaks. For example, the UN recently reported the dismissal of a local chief in Sierra Leone for failing to report secret burials that may have violated regulations intended to contain the spread of Ebola (UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response (UNMEER) 19 November

However, it seems inevitable that reducing demand for bushmeat will be fundamentally necessary to safeguard species from overhunting and extinction and to mitigate the disease risks. Reducing demand will be easiest for populations with access to alternative food sources. High demand and pricing for wild-harvest species may influence hunting practices, including expanding volumes and time of year spent hunting, whereas previously hunting pressure has been naturally limited by hunting for subsistence, traditional techniques, seasonality, and cultural taboos on harvesting certain species (Lindsey et al.
