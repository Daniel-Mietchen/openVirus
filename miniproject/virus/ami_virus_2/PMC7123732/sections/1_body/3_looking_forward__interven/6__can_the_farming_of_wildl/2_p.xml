<p id="Par39">Wildlife ranching (typically lower density, semi-free ranging stock) may provide a more suitable production option in areas where more conventional and higher intensity animal production is not supported. For example, regions with tsetse fly infestations affect cattle production through high morbidity and mortality burden from trypanosomiasis; while wildlife appear to carry infection, they are not highly susceptible to it (Steverding 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2008</xref>). In theory, wildlife ranching may provide a contained environment where disease may be controlled through adoption of effective biosecurity measures. For example, Zambiaâ€™s wildlife ranching is subject to inspection of animals or meat by veterinarians prior to sale (Lindsey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2013</xref>). However, the sensitivity of this approach in detecting disease risks is not known; visual inspections by veterinarians may not recognize all illness in animals, especially asymptomatic infections that wildlife may be carrying, and viral pathogens are often not evident in meat without laboratory screening. Challenges around traceability in the market chain also introduce risk if free-ranging and ranched animals cannot be distinguished.
