<p id="Par38">The farming of wildlife for food may reduce pressures on wild populations, and is increasingly becoming a way to sustain demand in the face of increasing prices of wild-caught individuals. For example, porcupines, snakes, frogs, tigers, and a range of other wildlife species are farmed in Southern China for food and medicine (Abbott and van Kooten 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>). While this has been debated widely as a tool for conservation (e.g., the farming of tigers to reduce poaching), it has not been proposed as a strategy to reduce the public health risks of the wildlife trade. We propose that the farming of wildlife species could reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover if similar health and biosecurity measures are applied to farmed wildlife as to livestock. In this scenario, specific known zoonoses are tested for, treated or infected animals removed from a farm’s founder wild-caught stock, resulting in reduced risk of zoonotic pathogen “spillover” to ranchers, traders, or butchers. Biosecurity measures will be critical to reducing risk because the intensive production of species that potentially carry novel zoonotic agents could result in increased pandemic risk. For example, civets have long been farmed in some parts of Africa (Eniang and Daniel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>; Tolosa and Regassa 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2007</xref>), and prior to the SARS outbreak in China in 2002, civets were farmed increasingly in China. While the role of civets in the emergence of SARS is not fully understood, it is thought that they may have acted as amplifier hosts, expanding transmission and evolution of a bat-origin SARS-like coronavirus (Wang and Eaton
