<p id="Par40">Ranch-raised wild animals may also potentially come into greater contact with wildlife (e.g., if ranches are at the periphery of protected areas), potentially shifting the dynamics of population genetics and pathogen flow. Since the main risk pathways from viral zoonoses originating in wildlife associated with animal production systems come from the spillover of wildlife pathogens to domestically farmed species, more research is needed on disease risks in wildlife farms versus in free-ranging wildlife, as well as the development of formal guidelines on biosecurity and other practices to reduce risks to and from native wildlife, such as guidelines on proximity to conserved areas. </p>
