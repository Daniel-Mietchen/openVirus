<p id="Par35">For example, the OIE-IUCN Guidelines for Wildlife Disease Risk Analysis promote analysis of disease risk in an ecosystem, rather than single-species, context (World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) &amp; International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2014</xref>). This perspective can help determine conservation risks as well as zoonotic disease risks. While uncertainty and complexity inherently exist in wildlife disease risk analysis (Jakob-Hoff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2014</xref>), useful information can be gained, especially for viral disease threats where initial knowledge on transmission pathways and pathogen dynamics can enable best practices to reduce risks while more information is gathered.
