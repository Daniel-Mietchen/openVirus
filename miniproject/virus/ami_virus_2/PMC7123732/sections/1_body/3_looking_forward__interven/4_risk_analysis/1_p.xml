<p id="Par34">Greater knowledge of disease emergence risks from wildlife can inform identification of key areas forintervention. Risk assessment is commonly conducted in food safety to identify vulnerabilities in the food supply, but more fully protecting health requires determining and addressing upstream or distal risks of viral emergence from harvested wild meat. Employing risk analysis tools can assist in science-based policies by anticipating and identifying ways to mitigate risk, as well as identifying priority knowledge gaps for research investments to refine future analyses. The structure of a formal risk analysis can help provide continuity and objectivity in the process, involving problem description, hazard identification, risk assessment, risk management, implementation and review, and risk communication throughout. More proactive risk analysis efforts can systematically identify critical control points for conservation and health benefits, and congruence among both where synergies can be maximized.</p>
