<p id="Par29">The range of both proximal and distal risk factors associated with disease emergence from food systems makes effective disease management a complex and daunting proposition. However, this also provides opportunities for mitigation and adaptation with a view to better managing food systems to reduce environmental and biodiversity impacts in addition to disease risks in the future. For proximal risk factors associated with specific contact events, better safety and biosecurity standards will be a core part of any strategy to reduce disease risks from wild harvest and animal production systems. However, the more distal drivers of disease emergence (e.g., land-use change) or global changes that occur in step with, or that directly facilitate, the expansion of food systems present a much more nebulous and diffuse range of risks. Managing these underlying drivers may ultimately provide solutions for sustainability and public health threats. We propose that direct mitigation of disease transmission is thus only ever going to be a part of what urgently needs to be a much more encompassing, proactive strategy targeting the distal risks of disease emergence (Murray et al.
