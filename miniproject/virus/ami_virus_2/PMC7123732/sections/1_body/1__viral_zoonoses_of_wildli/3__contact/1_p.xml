<p id="Par18">Contact events provide the “proximal” risk interfaces that allow disease transmission. Contact events can occur in many different contexts but their common feature is that they provide the opportunity for the transmission of a pathogen. Transmission interfaces could include: human–wildlife, human–vector, human–domestic animal, human–human, wildlife–vector, wildlife–domestic animal, and vector–domestic animal contact. The diversity of types of contact that have been relevant historically for the emergence of viral zoonoses from wildlife associated with food systems is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2.1</xref>. In wild harvest systems, contact events have typically occurred directly between a person and a range of wildlife species ultimately used for food (HIV, Ebola, SARS, Lassa, Monkeypox), via contact activities such as hunting, handling, butchering, consumption, and trade. In animal production systems, people have become infected most commonly from contact with domestic animals that had first been exposed to wildlife pathogens (e.g., HPAI influenza, Nipah, Menangle), where tending and treating domestic animals for illness resulted in human infection. Japanese Encephalitis represents an example where humans are infected when bitten by mosquito vectors, which acquire and maintain infection after feeding on wild hosts or infected domestic species (e.g., pigs). For diseases more diffusely associated with agricultural activities, infection often occurs via contact with virus present in wildlife excreta (e.g., hantaviruses) or fomites (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2.1</xref> and references therein).
