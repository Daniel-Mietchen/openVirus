<p id="Par19">While contact events serve as the fundamental infection interface, different types of contact maycarry very different levels of “riskiness” depending largely on the mode of transmission of a given pathogen. An important challenge in understanding the risks of viral zoonoses due to food systems is identifying the relevant transmission routes that allow for pathogen transmission between wild animal reservoirs, vectors, domestic animals, and humans. Transmission routes can be classified into five broad but distinct categories and used to analyze patterns of disease emergence (Loh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2015</xref>). These include direct contact (i.e., skin-to-skin contact; scratches; animal bites; contact with body fluids, organs, and tissues; direct large droplet &gt;5 μm exposure), airborne (i.e., via dust particles and airborne small droplets &lt;5 μm), vector-borne (i.e., by biting or mechanical transfer by arthropods), oral (i.e., consumption of contaminated food or water; ingestion of arthropods), and contamination (i.e., indirect contact with soil or vegetation, contact with water, indirect transmission by contaminated inanimate objects). Direct contact is the most common transmission pathway cited for diseases associated with food systems, although airborne transmission of virus associated with aerosolized wildlife excreta is also relatively common (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2.1</xref>). Nevertheless, the range of transmission pathways implicated in the emergence of viral zoonoses from food systems is relatively diverse, with each transmission pathway represented at least once.
