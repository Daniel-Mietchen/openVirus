<p id="Par21">If the diversity of previous disease emergence mechanisms is anything to go by, forecasting disease risks within food systems should not rely solely on historical precedence. While decomposing the risks of disease emergence into subcategories of proximal and distal risk factors can seem trivial, particularly for the well-known examples examined here (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2.1</xref>), the real utility and application of this approach is for forecasting future risks (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">4.3</xref> below). Such horizon scanning exercises are critical for anticipating the risks associated with the growth in scale and magnitude of food systems into the future. For example, in industrial food systems, airborne transmission may potentially be an under-recognized pathway as a recent study found a million-fold elevated concentration of aerosolized invisible dust in a poultry barn fan compared to the outside air (Leibler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2009</xref>). This could have implications for both human and animal health in addition to the spread of true airborne diseases such as Foot and Mouth disease (FMD), influenza, or Q fever.
