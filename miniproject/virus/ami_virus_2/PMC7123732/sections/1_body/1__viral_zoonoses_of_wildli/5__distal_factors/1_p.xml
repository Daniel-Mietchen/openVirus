<p id="Par20">While the type of contact, mediated by the various transmission pathways, represents theproximal risk factor for spillover (i.e., where and how transmission takes place), other factors may promote or reduce the likelihood that contact events occur in the first place or result in pathogen transmission, thereby altering the risk of emergence. These distal or upstream risk factors also include any condition or activity along any transmission pathway that intensifies the contact rate, increases the prevalence or diversity of available pathogens to be transmitted, or elevates the likelihood of successful disease transmission given contact (Murray and Daszak 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2013</xref>; Lloyd-Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2009</xref>). Distal risk factors could also include other “enabling” factors, such as climate or other environmental factors. The key distal factors that have been associated with the emergence of viral zoonoses from food systems are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2.1</xref>. Broadly speaking, large-scale ecosystem and environmental change, including deforestation, land-use change and conversion for agriculture, have been commonly implicated in disease emergence within food systems. Examples include the rodent-borne arenaviruses (Lassa, Junin, Machupo, Laguna Negra) that are often facilitated by agricultural land conversion, HIV which is thought to have emerged as a result of the changes in forest access and human connectivity attributable to industrial development, and Nipah and Menangle viruses which are thought to have emerged due to increasing niche overlap and contact between reservoirs and domestic animal species (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2.1</xref> and references therein). In addition to human-induced ecosystem changes, there are a range of social and demographic factors that have also played roles as distal risk factors, including the trade of wildlife species within markets with sophisticated transport networks and in which inter-species mixing has occurred (SARS, monkeypox), or increased domestic animal stocking densities (agricultural intensification) to meet growing human food demands while at the same time enhancing conditions for viral amplification (HPAI, Japanese Encephalitis) (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2.1</xref> and references therein).
