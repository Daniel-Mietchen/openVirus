<p id="Par17">Across the spectrum of animal-based food systems described above, there are a range of common features or activities (e.g., capture and handling, butchering, trade, transport, and consumption) that provide opportunities for pathogens to move from wildlife into humans, whether directly or indirectly via a domestic animal link or via vectors. The processes involved, however, can be complex. Below we use the diseases listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">2.1</xref> as examples to decompose these risks into three fundamental componentsâ€”the types of contact events associated with them, the various transmission pathways that are involved, and the upstream distal risk factors that promote the former to facilitate emergence. These together help highlight the activities and conditions common to food systems that may promote disease emergence.
