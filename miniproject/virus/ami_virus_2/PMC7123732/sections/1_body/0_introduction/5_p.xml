<p id="Par6">This review will focus on two distinct animal-based food systems that encompass potentially very different risk pathways for disease emergence. First, “ animal production systems” are typified by in situ stocking and raising of animals (both domestic and in some cases wild species) at small to very large scales and from low to very high densities. Secondly, “ wild harvest systems” typically involve direct harvest of wild, free-roaming animal species (including, for example, “ bushmeat”). In some cases these systems, and the disease risks associated with them, are nested or overlap. For example, wild-harvested species can be marketed through outlets that are associated with sophisticated sale and distribution systems (Milner-Gulland and Bennett

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>). Nevertheless, we feel that distinguishing between wild harvest and in situ produced is useful when considering the role of animal-based food systems in the emergence of viral zoonoses.
