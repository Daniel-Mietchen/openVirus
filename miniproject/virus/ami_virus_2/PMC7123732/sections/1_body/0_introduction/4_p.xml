<p id="Par5">More broadly, the costs of wild harvest and animal production systems to global environments are enormous and mounting. The resultant biodiversity loss due to overhunting, and ecosystem loss or degradation due to the expansion of areas suitable for livestock, are major environmental and societal challenges in themselves (Steinfeld et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2003</xref>). In addition to the threat of disease emergence, these impacts contribute to novel and damaging negative feedback costs and a direct toll on other aspects of human health and wellbeing (Raudsepp-Hearne et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2005</xref>; McMichael et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2007</xref>). To understand the risks, we must look to the combination between direct and indirect risk factors that together shape the disease risks of food systems; for example, the act of consuming a wild animal in addition to the upstream factors, such as deforestation, that can more broadly increase the availability of wildlife for food. To mitigate the risks, we concur with previous authors that opportunities exist to manipulate food systems to provide win-win or more equitable solutions for conservation and health (Tilman et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2009</xref>; McMichael et al.
