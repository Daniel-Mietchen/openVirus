<p id="Par14">Demographic, behavioral, ecological, and climatic changes have all been variably cited as drivers of historical and contemporary disease emergence (Patz et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2008</xref>; Smith et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). The increasing impact of an exponentially rising human population has led to an increase in these drivers over time which likely explains why the frequency of disease emergence appears to have increased in recent decades, even after correcting for increased capacity and effort to detect them (Pike et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2014</xref>; Jones et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). Systems in equilibrium are probably the least likely systems to give rise to EIDs.
