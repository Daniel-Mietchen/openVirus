<p id="Par13">Infectious diseases that appear in a new host (e.g., humans) for the first time or markedly increase in incidence or geographic range, or cause disease with apparently novel clinical patterns are often referred to as emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2001</xref>). Historically, many human diseases are thought to have arisen as a result of the environmental and demographic changes attributable to the advent of food systems (agriculture and/or animal domestication) (Pearce-Duvet 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2006</xref>; Wolfe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2007</xref>). Such “civilization diseases” include some likely acquired directly from domesticated species (e.g., measles, pertussis) or indirectly, either because domestic animals provided a more stable route of infection for pathogens to enter human populations from wildlife (e.g., smallpox) or due to the influence of environmental perturbation in elevating the risk of pathogen transmission to humans from wildlife hosts and vectors (e.g., 
 <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria) (Pearce-Duvet 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2006</xref>). All of the diseases mentioned above were at one time EIDs, highlighting how some of the emerging diseases of the recent past and present will almost certainly become the diseases of humanity in the future. Understanding the origins and drivers of EIDs is thus of considerable and growing public health interest (Morse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>).
