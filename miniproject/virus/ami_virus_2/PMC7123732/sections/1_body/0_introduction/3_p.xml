<p id="Par4"> Here we review the current status of EIDs, and in particular viral zoonoses originating in wildlife, as they relate to wild harvest and animal production systems . We conclude that both systems present considerable proximal and distal risks for disease emergence through a number of mechanisms. The reasons are that they frequently entail or promote human contact with a diversity of wildlife species, unusual assemblages of high numbers and densities of animals, rapid and widespread transportation networks and large-scale environmental perturbation, which are all key risk factors of disease emergence (Daszak et al.
