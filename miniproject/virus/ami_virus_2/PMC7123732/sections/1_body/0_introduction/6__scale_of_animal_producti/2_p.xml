<p id="Par8">These increases in animal production match or exceed human population growth, which has itself almost tripled over the same period. To put this in context, population growth has been so dramatic over the last century that 7â€“14 % of all humans ever born remain alive today (Bradshaw and Brook

The sheer scale and global reach of food production systems means that they are also major drivers of ecosystem change. In addition to the direct risks posed by high stocking densities and sophisticated transportation and trade networks, it is the associated environmental and demographic factors of animal production systems that present some of the biggest challenges from a disease emergence perspective (McMichael et al.
