<p id="Par7">Since 1950, there have been enormous increases in the production of, and trade in, domestic livestock species used for food (particularly chickens and pigs) (Godfray et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>; FAOSTAT 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">2.1</xref>). Although the density and composition of domestic species varies dramatically globally (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2.2</xref>), livestock systems alone now account for more than 30 % of the Earth’s ice-free terrestrial area (Steinfeld et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2006</xref>). In addition to growing populations, demand for higher volume and higher quality diets has driven these increases, and per capita production has also increased (FAOSTAT 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). In 2013 there were approximately 3.5 individual poultry and 0.5 common production mammals (cattle, sheep, and pigs) raised, on average, for every one of nearly seven billion people globally (calculated from FAOSTAT 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2014</xref>). Facilitating this growth, the global capacity to raise both more animals and more animals per unit of land area has increased, marking an increase in efficiency and intensity of food production. The highest densities and efficiencies are achieved with the aid of technological advances that were developed and are primarily used in the developed world (Tilman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2011</xref>).
