<p id="Par12">The monetary incentives for importation of wild-harvested meat have resulted in extensive trade networks, and an expansion of the public health risk of zoonotic disease spillover. An estimated 5 tons of bushmeat is smuggled through Paris Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport from Africa per week in passenger baggage (Chaber et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>). Even if the prevalence of potentially zoonotic pathogens in the animals traded is low, and viability of microbes much reduced after time in the trade, the sheer volume of bushmeat traded internationally, and lack of traceability through illegal or clandestine trade, suggests a significant public health risk. Measuring or controlling this risk is made more difficult because the global distribution of wild-harvested food is highly variable, poorly reported, and difficult to map (Fig.
