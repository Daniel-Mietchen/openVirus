<p id="Par10">Relative to other sources of meat, the contribution of wild-harvested meat to household diets, nutrition and local livelihoods is highest for the rural poor, who are often underserved by local animal production systems and/or have limited ability to raise animals for a variety of reasons (e.g., environmental constraints, lack of technology) (Brashares et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>). Some populations are essentially dependent on wild-harvested food to meet basic nutritional requirements; for example, in some parts of the Congo Basin, protein from bushmeat comprises as much as 94â€‰% of total protein of the household diet (Fa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2003</xref>). In Madagascar, restricting access to bushmeat would reportedly result in a significant increase of anemia cases among children, with the poorest households worst-affected (Golden et al.
