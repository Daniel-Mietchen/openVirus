<p id="Par2">Zoonotic viruses of wildlife origin have caused the majority of recent emerging infectious diseases ( EIDs ) that have had significant impacts on human health or economies (Morse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>; Jones et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). Animal consumption-based food systems, ranging from the harvest of free-ranging wild species (hereafter, wild harvest systems) to the in situ stocking of domestic or farmed wild animals (hereafter, animal production systems), have been implicated in the emergence of many of these viruses, including HIV, Ebola, SARS, and highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) (Karesh et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2012</xref>).
