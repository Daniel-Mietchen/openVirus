<p id="Par23">Harvesting wild animals for food and other uses has been increasing in the recent past, and is likely to continue its growth as one of the greatest threats to biodiversity (Fa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2002</xref>). This follows increasing reliance on wild animals to meet dietary needs for protein under conditions of food insecurity in many regions, especially developing countries in the tropics (Fa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2003</xref>). Exploitation of wildlife for food will likely be facilitated by increasing land-use change and deforestation activities, whatever their purpose, particularly in more remote regions where these activities make forests more accessible to hunters and create new markets for bushmeat (Poulsen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2009</xref>). Climate change is also expected to threaten food security in many regions, again promoting greater reliance on wild harvest species in some regions (Nkem et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2010</xref>). This is set against a background of exponentially increasing global air travel which already poses a significant risk to global health via the transportation of pathogens (Hufnagel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>), and is likely to promote increased global trade in wild-harvested meat.
