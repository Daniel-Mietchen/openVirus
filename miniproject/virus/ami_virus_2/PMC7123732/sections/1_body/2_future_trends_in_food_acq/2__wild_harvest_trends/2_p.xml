<p id="Par24">The development of roads may represent one of the most significant ways of increasing opportunities for wild harvest. Roads are considered critical infrastructure developments that can improve access to technologies, healthcare and education, forming a key component of many countries’ development plans. Approximately 60 % more roads are projected by 2050 compared to 2010, mostly in developing countries (Dulac

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2014</xref>). Road building has already increased the risk of some diseases associated with human development (e.g., agricultural intensification), with an increase in number of cases of human hantavirus reported following the completion of a highway through the Brazilian Amazon (Medeiros et al.

Road building, particularly on such a large scale, will almost certainly further facilitate bushmeat hunting in the most biodiverse regions of the planet and change the scale at which people are able to move wild animals out of newly exploited areas and into commodity chains, thereby increasing public health risks.
