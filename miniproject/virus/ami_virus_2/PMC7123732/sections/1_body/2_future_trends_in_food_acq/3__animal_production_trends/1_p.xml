<p id="Par25">Global food production is forecast to approximately double by 2050 to meet the food demands of a global population that is expected to plateau at around nine billion people (Godfray et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>; Tilman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2011</xref>). The biggest growth will be seen in domestic animal products, with predictions suggesting an increase in annual demand for meat of 6â€“23 kg per person per year worldwide by 2050. The largest increases will be in Latin America, the Caribbean, South East Asia and the Pacific, and demand per person will more than double in sub-Saharan Africa (Thornton and Herrero 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2010</xref>). Food production is expected to more intensely compete with the acquisition of other products from the environment such as land, water and energy, contributing to loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity, including some related to health (Tilman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2011</xref>; McMichael et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2007</xref>). Deforestation and associated human activities related to domestic animal production, for example, will continue to alter the structure and species composition of ecosystems and increase contact rates between humans, wildlife, vectors and domestic animals, resulting in disease emergence (Murray and Daszak
