<p id="Par28">Additionally, as intensification occurs, biosecurity measures become all the more necessary. For example, a lag in biosecurity practices during increases in poultry production has been attributed to the evolution of HPAI H5N1 in poultry flocks, which caused extensive impacts to the poultry and public health sectors, leading to mortality or culling of over 200 million birds, as well as several hundred human deaths (Karesh et al.

The lack of adequate infrastructure for biosecurity measures in low-income nations where bushmeat currently serves as a major form of subsistence nutrition thus presents vulnerability around potential intensified livestock production to shift protein sources. Agricultural practices may also pose risks to wildlife, including flow of pathogens between livestock and wild species, in addition to the more usual culprits of habitat destruction or degradation.
