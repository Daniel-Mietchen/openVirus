<p id="Par26">Food production will also continue to contribute to, and be strongly affected by, climate change (Godfray et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>; McMichael et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2007</xref>), particularly in developing and less developed countries, and this will coincide with changes in disease risk. For example, climate change may influence some key elements of the avian influenza A transmission cycle. Climate change is expected to influence migration patterns of migratory bird species that are the natural reservoirs for many AI viruses, alter transmission dynamics and affect the survival of virus outside of hosts, all of which have the potential to shift disease risks for this important group of viruses (Gilbert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>). In addition, the link between domestic duck production, which is expected to grow in scale and extent to build food security in Asia, and the persistence of HPAI H5N1 is often synchronously linked to the production of rice. The strong seasonal component of this system means that climate change has the potential to impact the distribution and persistence of HPAI in other more indirect ways as well (Gilbert et al.
