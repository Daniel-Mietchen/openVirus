<p id="Par27">The increasing intensification of food production, marked by high animal densities and stressful conditions, may facilitate rapid spread of diseases among immuno-compromised and genetically similar animals, potentially compromising food security and posing zoonotic disease risks. In addition to the risk of wildlife origin zoonoses making their way into humans via a domestic animal intermediary, the widespread use of antimicrobials in food production, primarily for non-therapeutic growth promotion in livestock and aquaculture production, may introduce rapid selection pressure for resistant bacterial and viral strains and further contribute to disease risks. While drug-resistant EIDs are more common in non-zoonotic EIDs than zoonotic EIDs (Zambrana-Torrelio et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2012</xref>), greater use of growth-promoting antimicrobials in animal production and human exposure via food as well as antimicrobials disseminated into the environment from animal production waste may potentially increase human susceptibility to infections (Marshall and Levy
