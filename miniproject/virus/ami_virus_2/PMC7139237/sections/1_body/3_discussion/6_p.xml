<p id="par0140">The study participants reported frequent use of sanitizers, hand wash, and masks during the past one week. This indicates the increasing concern of participants towards personal hygienic measures to avoid COVID-19 infection. Sensitization and awareness about COVID-19 are reflected in their behavior and attitude significantly as most of the participants (more than 4/5th) agreed with â€“ social distancing, avoiding travel, self-quarantine and adequate hygienic measures. However, their fear, apprehension and possibly stigma is reflected when they were asked about the inclusion of recovered COVID-19 patients to the mainstream of society. Stigma is associated with many such health conditions. Adequate awareness may minimize the stigma and facilitate acceptance in the general population.</p>
