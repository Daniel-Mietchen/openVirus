<p id="par0120">Epidemics and pandemics are a periodic phenomenon. People in the community face several challenges during such periods. Lack of awareness often leads to an unconcerned attitude, which may adversely affect the preparedness to meet these challenges. Impacts of these epidemics and pandemics are often intense, which may adversely affect the mental well-being of a given population. The fear and anxiety related to epidemics and pandemics also influence the behavior of people in the community. Hence, this study attempted to evaluate the awareness, attitude, anxiety and perceived mental healthcare needs in the society.</p>
