<p>There is considerable evidence that presymptomatic persons (those without current symptoms who eventually go on to develop symptoms) or asymptomatic persons (defined as individuals who never go on to develop symptoms) with SARS-CoV-2 can infect others. Asymptomatic or presymptomatic (heretofore combined into the single term of “paucisymptomatic”) transmission of a respiratory virus requires shedding of viable virus in the oropharynx, nasopharynx, or other body fluids. Mounting evidence that SARS-CoV-2 displays high rates of viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract (eg, nasopharynx, oropharynx), even among paucisymptomatic individuals, distinguishes it from SARS-CoV-1, in which replication occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract [
