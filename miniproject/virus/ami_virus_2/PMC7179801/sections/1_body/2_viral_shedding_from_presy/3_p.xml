<p>Two other studies besides the one from the Washington State SNF [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have demonstrated similar quantitative nasopharynx and oropharynx SARS-CoV-2 viral loads among paucisymptomatic and symptomatic individuals with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Analysis of presymptomatic and symptomatic patients demonstrates high viral loads and viable virus readily isolated in culture shortly before and after the onset of symptoms [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A study detailing the clinical and virological characteristics of 5 patients in France showed that 2 patients had high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal secretions soon after symptom onset [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Lower respiratory tract specimens may have higher viral loads than those in upper respiratory samples during the phase of active pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome with SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, high viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in upper respiratory tract samples among patients “without symptoms” suggest a high risk of transmissibility [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Modeling studies have also demonstrated that paucisymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV-2 could be responsible for a large proportion of transmissions [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], with early case reports and familial clusters also indicating asymptomatic transmission [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33–40</xref>]. In sum, the degree of transmissibility from asymptomatic individuals in SARS-CoV-2 is the most compelling argument for universal public masking.
