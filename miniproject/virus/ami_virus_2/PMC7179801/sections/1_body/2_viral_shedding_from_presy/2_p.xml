<p>Data from the Diamond Princess cruise ship suggest that up to 18% of cases were asymptomatic, despite detectable SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid in the nasopharynx or oropharynx [

 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] detailed clusters of cases in Singapore from January 23 to March 16, 2020 and estimated that more than 6% of transmissions occur from paucisymptomatic individuals. Finally, after identification of a case of COVID-19 in a HCW in a skilled nursing facility (SNF) in Washington State, 76 residents of the SNF were tested for SARS-CoV-2 and 48 (63%) had positive swabs, with 27 (56%) being paucisymptomatic. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 viral loads were quantitatively similar in those with symptoms and those who were asymptomatic [
