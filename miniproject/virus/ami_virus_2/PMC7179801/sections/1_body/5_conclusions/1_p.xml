<p>In conclusion, we strongly endorse universal public masking in the United States for crowded indoor or public spaces, including supermarkets, public gatherings, and in close workplaces. This recommendation does not replace our population-level, public health approaches, including social distancing in the short term, but it does serve as an adjunct, with the hope that we will be able to relax such measures as transmission slows.</p>
