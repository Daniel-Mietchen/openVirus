<p>Although the debate on whether SARS-CoV-2 is airborne versus droplet is still raging [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2–7</xref>], SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious compared with the following: SARS-CoV-1, the coronavirus that led to the SARS epidemic in 2002 [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]; Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the coronavirus that led to MERS in 2012 [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; and seasonal viral influenza. Coronavirus disease 2019 has spread exponentially worldwide since the cluster of infections in Wuhan Province was first reported to the WHO on December 31, 2019 [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As of this writing, worldwide estimates of COVID-19 cases exceed 1.8 million, a number that is likely grossly underestimated due to inadequate testing capability in many settings. Although the airborne versus droplet question is relevant to healthcare settings (which involve close contact) and has guided infection control recommendations and type of masks required accordingly [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the most compelling reason for public masking is due to the data on spread from asymptomatic individuals [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For the general public, surgical isolation masks (as part of an overall public health strategy) should be able to curb dissemination of both droplet-spread and airborne viruses to the breathing zones of nearby individuals [
