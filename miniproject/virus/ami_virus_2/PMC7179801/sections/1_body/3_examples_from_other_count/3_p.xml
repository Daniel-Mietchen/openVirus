<p>A major argument against universal public masking in addition to other public health measures has been limited supplies of personal protective equipment, including surgical masks, in the face of a sudden pandemic for which HCWs must be prioritized. We cannot conflate what we think should be done and what can be done. Industries in the United States can repurpose to produce surgical masks in vast quantities for the public [
