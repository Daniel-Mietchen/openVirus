<p>The SARS and MERS epidemics, and our treatment of other endemic and epidemic respiratory viruses, can provide some guidance on treatment strategies that may benefit patients with COVID‐19. There are currently no specific anti‐COVID‐19 therapies but over 80 clinical treatment trials have been initiated to tackle COVID‐19 [
 <xref rid="eji202070035-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>]. These trials include the HIV drug combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (protease inhibitors that have been reported to reduce SARS and MERS replication), and also remdesivir (an approved reverse transcriptase inhibitor that similarly has demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activity against SARS‐CoV‐2 [
 <xref rid="eji202070035-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>]). It may also be possible to enhance the protective host immune response to infection, or inhibit immunopathogenesis (which is thought to contribute to disease severity for some respiratory pathogens). In particular, ‘cytokine storms’ are thought to be major contributors to the severity of many lower respiratory tract infections, such as influenza [

 <xref rid="eji202070035-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>]. Host‐targeted therapies might therefore be aimed at either enhancement of innate immune clearance of SARS‐CoV‐2 or inhibition of inflammatory damage to the airway and the development of secondary bacterial pneumonias. In the first 41 cases, 22% were given systemic corticosteroids, with the aim of suppressing inflammation induced lung injury [
 <xref rid="eji202070035-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>]; however, current WHO guidelines do not recommend their use and data from SARS and MERS showed that corticosteroids did not reduce mortality and potentially delayed viral clearance [

 <xref rid="eji202070035-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref>]. Alternative strategies under investigation include immunomodulation with chloroquine (which might also have anti‐viral function [
 <xref rid="eji202070035-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>]), monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulins. These interventional studies, in addition to observational studies, will develop our understanding of severe COVID‐19 infections, particularly the relative contribution of viral load and sequence (though current data indicate little strain variation amongst cases so far), bacterial co‐infections, host genetics, environmental factors and immunopathogenesis (Figure
