<p>The SARS and MERS epidemics have put us in a better position to respond to COVID‐19. The transparency demonstrated in the rapid sharing of the SARS‐CoV‐2 genetic information has been critical in mediating a global approach to minimise the spread of disease. This has enabled the rapid development of diagnostic tests and their global implementation. In turn these diagnostic tests have facilitated the management of cases in those areas most affected, and the identification of cases in other countries, all of which has aided in limiting the global spread of SARS‐CoV‐2. However, current evidence indicates that these public health measures alone may be insufficient to eliminate COVID‐19. New treatments are urgently needed and the time that public health measures have bought us must be used productively. Ongoing clinical trials of existing drugs may provide further breakthroughs in limiting morbidity and mortality, but vaccines and prophylactics may be needed to prevent the spread of infections.</p>
