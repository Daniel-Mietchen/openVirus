<p>Within weeks of the first cases, a series of papers were released detailing the epidemiology of the disease (now termed COVID‐19) [

 <xref rid="eji202070035-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>]. By early January 2020 the virus was identified and the sequence determined. The virus (termed SARS‐CoV‐2) shares 88% sequence identity to two coronaviruses found in bats, bat‐SLCoVZC45 and bat‐SL‐CoVZXC21, 79% identity with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and 50% identity with Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus [

 <sup>4</sup> nucleotide substitutions per year, this suggests a recent single source emergence in early December or late November 2019 [

 <xref rid="eji202070035-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>]. The number of confirmed cases has increased rapidly, at a rate that far outstripped the rate of rise of cases of SARS in 2002/3, raising serious global health concerns. By the 21
 <sup>st</sup> January, COVID‐19 cases were widespread across mainland China, soon spreading beyond the Chinese borders.
