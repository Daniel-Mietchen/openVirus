This is only a small fraction of the total population of China (1,428 million), and strenuous efforts continue to limit spread. However, SARS‐CoV‐2 has now spread to 29 countries, the Republic of Korea having the 2

As of 25th of February 2020, 276 cases and 7 deaths have been identified in 7 EU/EEA countries. The majority of these cases have been from a spike in locally acquired cases in Italy resulting in 6 deaths. Iran has also had a recent increase in cases with 61 cases and 12 deaths [
