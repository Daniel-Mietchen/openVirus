<p>From the first 41 reported cases, the mortality rate was thought to be as high as 15%. The general fatality rate is currently uncertain but could be as high as 1–2% of all infections; however, as more cases are found with mild or unapparent disease this rate is expected to fall. The average incubation period is around 5 days, but also appears quite variable and may be as long as two weeks [
 <xref rid="eji202070035-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>]. With around 60,000 active cases awaiting a final outcome, the case fatality amongst those with COVID‐19 is difficult to determine at the present time. One case in Egypt is the first detected in Africa, while many developing, low resource, countries have had no cases. This apparently low transmission rate to such countries might be a consequence of public health measures enforced to limit spread of SARS‐CoV‐2 in China, or could reflect the limited diagnostic capacity in low resource settings.
