<p>Like SARS‐CoV‐2, SARS and MERS coronaviruses are thought to have originated from bats and transmitted to humans from an intermediate host, civets and dromedary camels respectively. For SARS‐CoV‐2, the zoonotic source and intermediate host is yet to be confirmed but with recent advances in whole genome sequencing, detailed phylogenetic analysis can be rapidly performed and used to establish detailed evolutionary links.</p>
