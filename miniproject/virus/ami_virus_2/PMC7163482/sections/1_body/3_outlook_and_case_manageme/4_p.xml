<p>Early supportive measures should be taken, including supportive oxygen therapy for respiratory distress and hypoxia, more invasive respiratory support if required, intravenous fluids, antimicrobials and anti‐viral medications. The current published data indicates a long mild incubation period followed by rapid progression of disease with 8 days being the median time from initial symptoms to the onset of breathlessness, 9 days to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 10.5 days to admission to intensive care [

Tools such as the MuLBSTA Score, which incorporates risk factors and comorbidities such as smoking, hypertension, age, bacterial co‐infections, lymphopenia and areas of the lung involved, may be useful to predict mortality in patients with viral pneumonia [
