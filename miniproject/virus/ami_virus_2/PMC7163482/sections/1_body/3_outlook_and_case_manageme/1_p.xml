<p>For now, the reported case numbers of COVID‚Äê19 continues to mount, but more slowly. However, with such widespread distribution both within and outside China, it seems likely that subsequent outbreaks will continue to be seen. Crucially there are substantial gaps in our knowledge regarding the epidemiology of disease, the major predisposing risks, transmission rates, clinical manifestations and phenotypes and treatment options. However, we have learnt much from the SARS and MERS outbreaks, which influenced the local and global response to the current outbreak. Our ability to rapidly identify novel pathogens using whole genome sequencing and to develop PCR based diagnostic tests from this data has expedited our ability to identify cases and understand the epidemiology of disease much earlier in the epidemic. This has informed the current strategy of reducing human to human transmissions, especially to healthcare professionals.</p>
