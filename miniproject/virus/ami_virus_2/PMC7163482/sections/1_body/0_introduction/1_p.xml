<p>In December 2019, a new pneumonic disease began to appear in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It seemed highly infectious and resistant to therapy, causing considerable concern amongst physicians. Within a month, 41 patients had been admitted to a single hospital and one had died. The initial cases were strongly associated with the Huanan seafood market, in which exotic animals were sold for food. The market was closed, but it was several weeks before public health officials were able to introduce strong public health quarantine measures in the local area.</p>
