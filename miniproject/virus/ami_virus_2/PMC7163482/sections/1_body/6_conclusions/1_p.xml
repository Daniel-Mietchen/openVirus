<p>In a little over two months SARS‐CoV‐2 has spread to 29 countries and caused far greater morbidity and mortality than either SARS or MERS, despite rapid identification and robust public health measures. The outlook is uncertain, but continued global spread seems likely and we must be prepared to face this threat. While continuing to delay the spread of disease we must rapidly initiate studies of potential therapeutics and develop our understanding of COVID‐19 pathogenesis.</p>
