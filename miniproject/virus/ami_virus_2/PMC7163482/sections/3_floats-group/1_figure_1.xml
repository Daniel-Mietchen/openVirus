  <p>Possible determinants of COVID‐19 severity. Many factors can contribute to the severity of lower respiratory tract infections. The sequence of the viral genome and the degree of viral replication (viral load) can influence severity and initiate an inflammatory response that can cause immunopathology. The airway microbiome and bacterial co‐infections can similar increase severity. Some hosts are more susceptible to severe disease based on genetic and environmental factors.</p>
