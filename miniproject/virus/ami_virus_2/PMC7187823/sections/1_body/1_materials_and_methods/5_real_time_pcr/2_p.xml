<p id="p0060">The Real-time PCR reactions were done in Step one real-time system (Applied Biosystems, USA) as one-step reverse transcriptase PCR for RNA or DNA PCR using AgPath-IDTM One Step RT-PCR kit. The primers and probes for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were designed based on the CDC protocol of real-time RTPCR for influenza A(H1N1). The primers and probes for other respiratory viruses were designed based on published literature: Influenza A(H3N2) &amp; Influenza B,
