<p id="p0065">Seasonality of respiratory viruses was plotted using the meteorological (temperature and rainfall) data of Puducherry for the period between November 2011 and March 2015 obtained from the Regional Meteorological Centre, Chennai [No. 8043/CS-(ER)-032 dated 30-07-2015]. Sequencing was done for representative isolates of each virus using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA) employing gene-specific forward and reverse primers of different genes of respiratory viruses. Most identical nucleotide sequences available in the sequence database were identified through NCBI BLAST program (

Sequences submitted from various countries were retrieved from the GenBank database and aligned; the evolutionary history was estimated using the Neighbor-Joining method. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA6. Genbank accession numbers of the study isolates are the following: KM281807, KM406324, KR347116, KR376140, KR608301, KR902754, KT002006-2008, KR704265, KX255651, KX268229, KX446979-6985, KX426263-6266.
