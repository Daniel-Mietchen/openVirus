 </xref> and it is known to cause severe respiratory illness and death in high-risk individuals. Although anti-influenza drugs and vaccines are available, due to the continuous antigenic variations (in the form of drifts and shifts), this virus can lead to yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics; hence influenza remains a global threat. The next common virus associated with significant hospitalization and respiratory distress, particularly in children, is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Nearly 70% of children are infected with RSV by the age of 1 year.

 </xref> Other common viruses are parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, measles, adenoviruses and bocavirus. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority as they mostly cause self-limiting disease and no specific antiviral drugs are available (except for influenza and RSV). However, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value.
