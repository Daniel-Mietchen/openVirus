<p id="p0155">In children, viruses are the most common cause of respiratory infections and they are considered as a significant health threat in this group. In the present study, of the 292 children with ARI, 44% (129) had one or more viruses and RSV was the most common cause of infection particularly in 0–5 year-old children. Worldwide, RSV predominance in children has been reported

This adult preponderance to HMPV is no more a rare phenomenon as recent reports indicate the severity of HMPV in adults’, particularly in elderly leading to hospitalization.
