<p id="p0175">This is the first Indian study to submit gene sequences of HCoV OC43 and 229E in the Genbank database, and hence, no intra-national evolutionary comparisons could be made. A few studies have reported human bocavirus (HBoV), but the strains isolated from Union territory of Puducherry, were not closely associated with other Indian strains. However, conclusive information could not be made with single gene sequencing. Co-circulation of RSV-A and RSV-B has been observed in many countries including India
