<p id="p0145">The case fatality rate of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (3.7%) reported in this study (2011–2015) was much lower when compared to 2009–2010.

Patients affected by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were mostly of age group 20–40 years; hence this study yet again corroborates this well-known observation made worldwide. This might be due to their active lifestyle environment, where they are at a higher risk of getting infected with this novel influenza A(H1N1) virus, to which they have never been exposed previously.
