<p id="p0170">A specific pattern in the seasonality of respiratory viruses (other than influenza) was not appreciated in this study as their prevalence was low in this population. In tropical countries, the seasonal pattern of respiratory viruses is reported to be less evident due to the local variations in precipitation, temperature and humidity. This can be demonstrated from the varied seasonality data reported from different parts of India by Chadha et al.

 </xref> In our study from the southern part of India, the maximum ARI cases were recorded during the months between August and December, except in 2012 and 2015. In both these years, a surge of suspected ARI cases was observed during the early months of these years, due to the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. As described in our earlier studies, both these outbreaks occurred during high mean maximum temperature period of these years and we found no correlation with rainfall.
