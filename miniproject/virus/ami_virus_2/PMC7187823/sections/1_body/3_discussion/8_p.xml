<p id="p0165">Clinical features of both influenza and non-influenza viruses were similar and non-specific except for a few symptoms like fever, myalgia and respiratory distress, which were more often associated with influenza ARI; however, this may not be useful for clinical diagnosis as &gt;25% respiratory infections are associated with febrile illness.

 </xref> Viral ARI is initiated with mild respiratory symptoms which are likely to be neglected in the first three to five days; during when the maximum virus shedding occurs. This has been well demonstrated in the pathogenesis of influenza and RSV infection

 </xref> and it is emphasized to collect samples in the first 3 days of symptoms onset. This study finding also suggests the importance of sample collection within 3 days of symptoms onset to achieve the maximum viral detection rate. Apart from the timing, the other important aspect of sample collection is the type of sample collected. In this study, we used nasopharyngeal sample collected using flocked nylon swabs, which have been shown to have excellent sensitivity when compared to rayon swabs, and is considered as an alternative to nasopharyngeal aspirate sampling.
