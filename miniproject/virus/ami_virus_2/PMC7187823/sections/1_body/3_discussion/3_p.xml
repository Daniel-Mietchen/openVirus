 </xref> Although WHO announced the end of the pandemic in August 2010, influenza viruses cause significant morbidity during the annual outbreaks. During this prospective study, we observed two influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreaks, one each in 2012 and 2015 with laboratory-confirmed infection in more than100 patients altogether. During this study, all the 109 cases with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, were treated with oseltamivir, despite this, four patients died due to ARDS (Acute respiratory disease syndrome).
