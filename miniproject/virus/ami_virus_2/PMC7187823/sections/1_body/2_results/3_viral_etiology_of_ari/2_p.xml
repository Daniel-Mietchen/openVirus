<p id="p0080">A total of 648 respiratory samples from an equal number of patients were collected during the study period (November 2011â€“March 2015) and real-time PCR identified respiratory viruses in 44% (287/648) of all patients (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). Influenza accounted for the maximum number of cases- 179/648 (27.6%); 109 (16.8%) cases of INF A/H1N1, 42 (6.5%) cases of INF B and 28 (4.3%) cases of INF A/H3N2.

Measles, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus type 1&amp; 2, human coronavirus OC43, human coronavirus 229E and human bocavirus were aggregated into a single group (OTHER) due to small numbers and to enable comparison statistically.
