INF A/H1N1, INF B, HMPV and PIV-3 were more common in adults, while RSV was common in children, but the proportional differences were only significant for INF A/H1N1 and RSV (P = 0.0001). Children were more commonly infected with OTHER viruses (PIV-1&amp;2, adenovirus, measles, corona virus or bocavirus) compared to adults (8.2% vs. 5.3%). Maximum positivity of INF A/H1N1 was found in age group of 21–50 years (
