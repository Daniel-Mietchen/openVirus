<p id="p0130">In Union territory of Puducherry, summer is from March through July and winter from December through February. September to December is the rainy months in this area. During this study, two outbreaks of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 occurred; first one in 2012 (58 cases) and the next in 2015 (50 cases). Seasonal influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B cases were found in all years, with a slight increase in 2013 and 2015 respectively. The detailed seasonality of influenza viruses in this region has been described in our earlier study on “Epidemiology of influenza viruses from 2009 to 2013”.
