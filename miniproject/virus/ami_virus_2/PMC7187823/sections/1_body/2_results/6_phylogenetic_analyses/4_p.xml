<p id="p0125">All the RSV strains sequenced belonged to type A and they formed a separate subgroup along with strains isolated from other parts of India like Chennai and Maharashtra (
 <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref> ). Two HMPV strains isolated in the same year, 2011 were entirely distinct from each other, forming two separate subgroups (
 <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> ). One of the HPIV-3 strains, KR704265, isolated in 2013 was closely related to the strain from the neighboring region Chennai which was isolated in the same year, while the other strain KR902754 had a molecular composition similar to isolates from Lithuania, Australia and Seattle (
 <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref> ). No Indian study has analyzed HCoV-229E virus and the strains isolated from this study were genetically similar to strains reported from Germany, Malaysia, Japan and Netherlands (
 <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref> ). Similarly, no study from India has analyzed the genetic sequence HCoV-OC43 and single isolate sequenced in our study showed a close relationship with a strain from the United Kingdom and the United States (
 <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref> ). The measles strains were of genotype D8 and closed circulation of measles strains between Pondicherry and other parts of the neighboring state, Tamil Nadu was observed. These strains were distinct from measles strains of Spain, Moscow, South Africa and it formed a separate subgroup along with other Indian strains (
 <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Fig. 14</xref> ). Human bocavirus strains of this study were not closely related to other Indian strains, particularly one isolate, KR376140, isolated in 2012 showed a distinct lineage (
