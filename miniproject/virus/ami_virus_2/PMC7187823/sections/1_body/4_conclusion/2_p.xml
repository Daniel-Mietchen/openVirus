Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated, followed by HMPV. This study is based on an active influenza surveillance initiated after 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, in the Union territory of Puducherry which has contributed significantly to the knowledge of the burden of influenza and non-influenza viruses among children and adults. Such surveillance network has paved the way for better diagnosis and therapeutic interventions.</p>
