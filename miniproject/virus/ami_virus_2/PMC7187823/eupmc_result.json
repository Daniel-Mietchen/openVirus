    "Background:Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the most common illnesses affecting people of all ages worldwide. Viruses contribute to 30-70% of acute respiratory infections. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority except influenza; however, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value. Methods:As a part of National Influenza-like illness surveillance programme, respiratory specimens were collected children and adults with symptoms of ILI or ARI, between January 2012 and March 2015 (including SARI cases). Real-time PCR was done to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Sequencing was done for representative isolates of each virus using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer. Results:During the study period between January 2012 and March 2015, a total of 648 patients with symptoms of ARI were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 20.2 years (SD = 19.13, median = 18); 292 (45.1%) were children (≤13 years) and 356 (54.9%) were adults. Respiratory viruses were identified in 44% (287/648) of all patients. Influenza accounted for the maximum number of cases- 179/648 (27.6%). Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated with 34 cases (5.2%), followed by HMPV 24 (3.7%) and PIV-3 20 (3%). Four patients died due to INF A/H1N1 as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (CFR 3.7%). Among the non-influenza viruses, no particular seasonality pattern was observed over the different months of the study period. Conclusion:Antibiotic usage in treating acute respiratory infections empirically is not justified as nearly half of ARI are due to viruses; nearly 28% of them were due to influenza viruses. Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated, followed by HMPV. This study is based on an active influenza surveillance initiated after 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, in the Union territory of Puducherry which has contributed significantly to the knowledge of the burden of influenza and non-influenza viruses among children and adults. Such surveillance network has paved the way for better diagnosis and timely therapeutic interventions."
