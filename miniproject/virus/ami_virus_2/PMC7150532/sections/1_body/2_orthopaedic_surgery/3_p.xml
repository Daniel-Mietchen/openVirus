<p id="Par5">Hopefully, orthopaedic associations have published and continuously update their information for their members on trauma and orthopaedic care during COVID-19 pandemia (

This information is aimed at non-elective patients, who are predominantly trauma-related, that cannot be postponed and will continue to need care. It classifies patients into four categories including obligatory in-patients, eg., hip fracture patients, that should avoid pre-operation delay and expedite rehabilitation to minimise length of stay; non-operative patients, eg., injuries that can reasonably be managed either operatively or non-operatively, non-operative care should be explored first, especially if this avoids admission; day-cases, for which surgery can be safely undertaken for a large number of conditions; and first contact and clinics, which should be kept to the safe minimum (

Telemedicine is used in some countries, however, although it might work for a tendinitis or carpal tunnel syndrome, it cannot be useful if the patient experiences a fracture. It is though, a useful technique for offering advice on pain control and rehabilitation.
