<p id="Par6">Most surgeons avoid operating at this stage. This is due to the dangers of poor protection and testing including the inability of routine checks on patients, lack of personal protective equipment, poor subsequent psychology for the risk of getting infected, and increased stress of going to the emergency room for non-urgent things. These factors increase the risk of contamination of the medical team. (

Operating rooms are sterilized environments, but that does not guarantee protection against COVID-19. Aerosols can leave the virus everywhere on plastic, metal and cardboard, and it can remain there for several hours or few days. The combination of power surgical tools and ventilation systems can produce a viral wind into the operating room. These may turn the operating rooms into viral labs with strong casualties amongst the operating room and surgical personnel (

Standard surgical face masks do not provide sufficient protection. As a result of the pandemia, we learned about the FFP2 and FFP3 face masks, however, these are not available for all, and the low quantity available is reserved only for front-line infectious diseases specialists that admit febrile patients with possible COVID-19. Blood products are not a favoured route of infection, but blood donors are now screened for the virus (
