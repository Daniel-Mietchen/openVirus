<p id="Par12">Medical education and writing should be continued, and should not be frightened of the crisis (Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>); it is a responsibility of a medical doctor to provide medical information and transfer knowledge despite casualties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Over the last weeks, we appreciated an unprecedented rise of submissions to International Orthopaedics. Most likely, restriction of circulation and services lockdown has led many surgeons staying more at home to write and to finalize scientific work, and to submit their papers that were pending for long. This is interesting material that we, as editors, acknowledge and review carefully. We are however very vigilant to the quality of submissions as many old studies (sometimes over 10 years old research) that were not published or rejected, are finally submitted to find an eventual place for publication. We try to identify and warn the authors for this type of behaviour. Finding good reviewers in crisis is not easy, but it turned out to be less difficult compared to other occasions such as summer holidays; we were pleased to see that the journalâ€™s reviewers reply promptly and accept a review assignment, and return on time with a good and constructive review [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The editors and reviewers of the journal opt for quality publications to increase the impact of the journal and the visibility of the submitted/published papers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Because we acknowledge the effort and amount of time that are required to perform a study and to prepare and submit a manuscript, our review process aims to improve and to accept an article. However, the workflow in these weeks seems to be slower because of the high number of submissions. As Editors, we support continuous orthopaedic education, looking forward to better quality submissions and publications in "International Orthopaedics".
