<p id="Par1">There is no doubt that 2020 did not start well. At the end of December 2019, an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), subsequently named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei region, China. Since then, the disease spread globally, resulting in the 2019–2020 coronavirus pandemia (from the Greek 
 <italic>pan-</italic> "all" and 
 <italic>dēmos</italic> "people"; meaning "pertaining to all people”). As of March 28, 2020, the pandemia led to worldwide crisis (from the Greek 
 <italic>krisis</italic> used by Hippocrates and Galen as the "turning point of a disease when an important change takes place, indicating recovery or death"); the overall rate of deaths per number of diagnosed cases was 4.6% ranging from 0.2% to 15% according to age group and other health problems [
