<p id="Par2">Currently, the ongoing pandemic of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a major global problem. The spread of this virus was so rapid that it quickly infected tens of thousands of people around the world including medical staffs and killed several thousands of them, and it still continues to infect and kill humans. So, thinkers and scientists are struggling to find a solution for this rebellious virus. Looking through the lens of basic science, achieving a solution is not out of reach. The biomolecular science approach may be one of the master keys to get the facts on how to control this deadly virus. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the coronavirus family, which has a crown-shaped (spike) protein that protrudes from its surface. Underneath its royal crown is an RNA strand acting as a genetic material for the virus. When virus infects human cells, it hijacks the existing molecular machinery to create its own proteins which are necessary to generate more viral copies. The interaction of viral spike protein with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on plasma membrane of particularly lung cells plays a central role in the infectious ability and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
