<p id="Par6">Finally, with two important approaches, one can look at the pandemic of new coronavirus. The first is the molecular and basic science perspective which provides new conditions for the exploitation of physicians and benefits of patients. Second, we can look at emergence and pandemic of this deadly virus as a lesson. Over the course of thousands of years, human history has repeatedly experienced epidemics and pandemics (global epidemics) of deadly infectious diseases, and the recent pandemic will not be the last. Therefore, joint investments of the world countries in strengthening the scientific and practical infrastructure of universities and pharmaceutical/biotechnology companies and creating highly equipped hospitals around the world will reduce the cost of overcoming similar health crises, which will inevitably occur in the future. Today, all countries need to empathize and bring science and technology together as convergent scientific data, and through the integration of science, technology, information, and experience to save people of the world from the damages of this deadly virus, wishing science and love for all nations. Finally, the reminder of Saadi Shiraz's advice is not without grace, as he says:
