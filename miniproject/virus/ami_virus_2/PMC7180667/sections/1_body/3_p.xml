<p id="Par5">The spike protein is also the molecular target for many antibodies being tested at various stages of clinical trials. These antibodies cover the surface of the virus after binding to the viral spike protein, thus preventing it from binding to the cell membrane receptor, ACE2. The attack of spike protein with its glycan shield to the membrane receptor ACE2 can also be neutralized using lectins. Plant lectin proteins which are found in abundance, especially in legumes, can be used to achieve this goal. Also, safe herbal alkaloid compounds and antimalarial medicine chloroquine, showing anti-glycosylation activity, are likely to affect the glycosylation of the viral spike protein and its membrane receptor ACE2 and may have an important therapeutic value. Moreover, the viral spike protein is primed by a specific transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 after being made inside the cells converting to its mature and active form. Therefore, the designed compounds that are similar to camostat mesylate, which specifically inhibit this peptidase, are important in preventing the coronavirus from growing and multiplying in the human body. The second molecular target is the cell membrane receptor (ACE2) serving as the main entrance of the coronavirus to human cells. The designing of either antibodies or small molecules that mask the interaction interface of this membrane receptor with the viral spike protein may have therapeutic values. Also, injection of either recombinant human ACE2 protein or even catalytic domain of this protein protruding from the cell membrane into the blood stream of COVID-19 patients is another important strategy to be considered as a possible treatment plan. Similar to the specific antibodies, the soluble and free form of this protein or its catalytic domain may bind to the spike protein of coronavirus and prevent the virus from binding to the cell membrane receptor, ACE2. The third important molecular targets are the interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) and chemokine receptor CCR5. These cytokine receptors can be targeted specifically by therapeutic antibodies such as Kevzara, Actemra, and Leronlimab or by new under-developing antibodies which subsequently reduce the presence of high levels of inflammatory cytokines, within the lungs, known as cytokine storm. In fact, the main cause of death in patients with acute respiratory symptoms is not the virus itself, but the development of an abnormal condition by coronavirus, leading to cytokine molecular storm. Also, with a similar mechanism, infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) facilitates patients' respiratory problems, reducing high level of the inflammatory molecules in their lungs. The fourth important molecular targets are the viral RNA polymerase and viral protease, which have recently been targeted with remdesivir, favipiravir, ritonavir, and lopinavir. The use of these antiviral medicines has also had a positive effect on the treatment of the reported cases of COVID-19.</p>
