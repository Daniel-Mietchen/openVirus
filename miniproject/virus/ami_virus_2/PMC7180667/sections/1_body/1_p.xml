<p id="Par3">To stop this dangerous virus outbreak, all the global solutions proposed by scientists and physicians are divided into different categories including designing new vaccines with the aim to prevent this disease (1), producing antibodies with the aim of neutralizing the virus (2), reusing the therapeutic existing medicines (drug repurposing), especially the antiviral drugs (e.g., lopinavir, ritonavir, and remdesivir) (3), using the existing plant-based traditional medicines (medicinal herbs) (4), using the therapeutic capacity of stem cells (5), and designing novel synthetic and innovative therapeutic molecules (6). With these solutions, what are the key molecular goals for controlling the new coronavirus? There are few important and key molecules providing suitable targets for hitting the virus. These molecular targets can be considered as the Achilles heel of this dangerous and deadly virus. The first molecular target is the highly glycosylated spike protein.</p>
