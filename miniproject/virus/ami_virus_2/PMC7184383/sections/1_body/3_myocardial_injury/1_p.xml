<p>This is recently reported in the CJC in a manuscript entitled ‘Impact of complicated myocardial injury on the clinical outcome of severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients’ by Professor Hesong Zeng and colleagues from Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
 <sup>7</sup> The retrospective study was conducted in 54 patients who were admitted to their hospital from 3 to 24 February 2020 and met the criteria of severe or critical conditions of COVID-19. The clinical characteristics and hospital mortality rate were analysed and compared between the patients with or without myocardial injury, which was defined as more than three times higher than the normal serum cardiac troponin level. During hospitalization, 24 of the patients were complicated with myocardial injury and 26 patients died in hospital. The in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in patients with myocardial injury than in patients without myocardial injury, 14 vs. 8. Moreover, the levels of C-reactive protein, average 153.6 ng/L vs. 49.8 ng/L, and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, 852.0 ng/L vs. 197.0 ng/L, were significantly higher than in patients without myocardial injury. Thus, the prevalence of myocardial injury is high among severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients, who face a significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The study suggests that it is important to monitor and manage myocardial injury during hospitalization for severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients.
