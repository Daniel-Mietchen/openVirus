<p>The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19, the pathogen called SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide outbreak since it occurred in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China in late December, 2019.
 <sup>1–3</sup> On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 is a ‘public-health emergency of international concern’. On March 11, the WHO declared the virus a global pandemic. As of 25 March 2020, more than 375 000 cases of COVID-19 had been reported, and over 16 000 people had lost their lives, and this number is still increasing rapidly. Therefore, global research actions on COVID-19 are desperately needed to meet this unprecedented challenge.
