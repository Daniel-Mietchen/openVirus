<p id="p0025">While DNA viruses are believed to have been evolving and diversifying for millions of years, most RNA viruses are likely to have a much more recent evolution and “human-adaptation” for only thousands of years. Owing to their error-prone polymerase/reverse-transcriptase (approx. 10
 <sup>−4</sup>/site/replication cycle) that seems to operate at optimal fidelity, RNA viruses exist as more genetically diversified populations than DNA viruses. Nevertheless, of the hitherto recognized 158 species of human RNA viruses consisting of 47 genera and 17 families, only a minority has adapted to humans (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds, 2001</xref>). In contrast, of the known 91 DNA virus species with 22 genera and 8 families, nearly 87% are adapted to human hosts. In the human-adaptation process, the viral genetic mutations, reassortment, or virus–host genetic recombination might lead to the establishment of stable virus lineages in human populations. So, there is the possibility that such human-adapted viruses could circulate in the body asymptomatically and remain undiagnosed till their new clinical manifestations are reported. To understand this clearly, a currently isolated HEV genotype 3 from a chronic hepatitis E patient containing a recombinant virus–host RNA genome was shown to infect cultured human, pig and deer hepatocytes (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Wolfe et al., 2007</xref>). It is assumed that there is a pool of human virus species still to be discovered. The composition of such a viral pool is dynamic, changing over time, that is, while some virus species tend to become extinct and others continue to evolve in their natural hosts. More commonly, new species arise as a result of jumps from one host to another, thus crossing the species barrier. Humans are, therefore, no more than “incidental” or “spillover” hosts for pathogens. However, only a minority of such viruses are capable of persisting in certain human populations (endemics) or spreading across populations (epidemics) in the absence of a reservoir. Differential host factors, such as age, health, physiology, nutritional status, exposure history, simultaneous infection with &gt;1 pathogen, immunocompetence and genetics, are determinants to human susceptibility to an infection. The field of phylodynamics, combining a modeling framework for host, epidemiological, and molecular data, especially for RNA viruses, shows particular promise for understanding the patterns of viral evolution during epidemics (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Gaynor et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, the underappreciated aspect of growing human populations, global changes in land usage and the introduction of anthropophilic vectors create selective pressure on hosts and reservoirs. For example, both WNV and CHIKV evolved rapidly after being introduced to new locations and encountering new vectors. When 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> rather than 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> became the main vector of CHIKV in the Indian subcontinent after the 2004–09 epidemic, the same viral strain spread rapidly, and the subsequent mutants seemed to circulate and persist more efficiently. A unique molecular signature of the CHIKV epidemic was a single amino acid substitution (A226V) in the envelope protein (E1). This mutation was identified in 90% of the strains reported during the later phase and was associated with a high epidemic potential for CHIKV (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kilpatrick and Randolph, 2012</xref>). ZIKV, initially known to be transmitted by mosquitoes, was recently reported as being transmitted, albeit more rarely, via sexual contact, saliva, breast milk, blood transfusions and from mother to child (
