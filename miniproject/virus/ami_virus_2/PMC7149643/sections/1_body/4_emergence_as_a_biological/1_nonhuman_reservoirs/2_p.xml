<p id="p0045">The remaining viruses only naturally infect humans (these are sometimes referred to as “specialist” human pathogens). Some of these (e.g., hepatitis B) may have coevolved with humans over very long time periods; others (e.g., HIV-1) have much more recent origins. Some of both kinds are believed to have originated in other mammal or bird species, including HIV-1 (derived from a simian immunodeficiency virus found in chimpanzees); HIV-2 (sooty mangabeys); SARS virus (horseshoe bats); hepatitis B, human T-lymphotropic virus-1 and -2, dengue, and yellow fever (all primates); human coronavirus OC43, measles, mumps, and smallpox (all livestock); and influenza A (wildfowl). However, the origins of the majority of specialist human viruses is still not known and a gap in knowledge has prompted calls for an “origins initiative” (
