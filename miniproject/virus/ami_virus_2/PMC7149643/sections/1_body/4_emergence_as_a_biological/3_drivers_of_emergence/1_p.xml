<p id="p0080">“Drivers” of the emergence of novel viruses or other pathogens have been studied recently. These constitute a diverse set of environmental and biological factors, many of which—such as “urbanization” or “land use”—seem intuitively reasonable but are too broad to relate to mechanistic causes of emergence. Moreover, identification of drivers is usually a subjective exercise: there are very few formal tests of the idea that a specific driver is associated with the emergence of a specific pathogen or set of pathogens. In many cases, this would be a challenging exercise: many drivers have only indirect effects on emergence (e.g., climate change, which is often linked with changing distributions of disease vectors); and often an emergence event has multiple causes (good examples would be the emergence of Nipah virus or SARS coronavirus). Other ideas about the drivers of emergence are even harder to test formally. One such is that we are currently living through a “perfect storm” in which many potential drivers of emergence events (such as population growth, urbanization, global travel and trade, and intensification of livestock production) are acting in concert. Upward trends in many drivers can be quantified, but it is not entirely clear that the frequency of emergence events is increasing: one recent study suggested that it increased during the first decade of the HIV/AIDS pandemic but has been decreased thereafter. A slightly different way of thinking about the drivers of emergence is to draw an analogy between emerging pathogens and weeds. The idea here is that there is a sufficient diversity of pathogens available—each with their own biology and epidemiology—that any change in the human environment (but especially in the way that humans interact with other animals, domestic or wild) is likely to favor one pathogen or another, which responds by invading the newly accessible habitat. This implies that emerging pathogens possess different life-history characteristic to established, long-term endemic pathogens (
