<p id="p0060">Level 1 represents the exposure of humans to a novel pathogen, such as a virus. The source of viruses of interest is most likely to be other mammals or birds and “exposure” implies any route by which a particular viral infection might be acquired, whether by contact with blood, saliva, or feces; contamination of food and water; or via an arthropod vector. The rate of such exposure is determined by a combination of the distribution and ecology of the nonhuman host and human activities. It is likely that exposure to nonhuman viruses occurs commonly: a process referred to as “chatter.”</p>
