<p id="p0095">The frequent emergence or reemergence of deadly viral infections has significantly affected human health despite extraordinary progress in biomedical knowledge. High population density, rampant constructions, poor sanitation, changing climate, and the introduction of anthropophilic vectors create selective pressure on hosts and pathogen reservoirs. Although we know that a substantial fraction of well-identified mammalian viruses is responsible for human etiology, there are large numbers of evolving viruses waiting to infect and adapt. The unpredictable nature of novel infections, the rare occasions of outbreaks, the small numbers of confirmed cases, the asymptomatic occurrence, and occurrence in remote areas severely hamper the assessment of control and preventive modalities. Surveillance of the emerging human viruses must include livestock, wild animals, and potential arthropod vectors as well as their environments at an international level of coordination. Furthermore, individuals, such as livestock herders, zookeepers, hunters, rangers, and veterinarians working with reservoir or high-risk animals, must take hygienic and general universal containment measures.</p>
