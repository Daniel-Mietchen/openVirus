<p id="p0100">Efficient vaccines are already available against important human viruses, such as HBV and human papillomavirus. Even though drug resistance in HBV and HIV has accelerated alarmingly, new generations of broad-spectrum antiviral agents as combination regimens hold promise. Moreover, specific geographical regions or interfaces between humans, livestock, wildlife, and the environment should be the targets for intense surveillance. In this way, further extensive research will surely enhance our understanding and capacity for predicting new pandemics and preparing control measures in advance. Furthermore, viral pathogen discovery is of critical importance to clinical microbiology, infectious diseases, and public health. Genomic approaches for pathogen discovery, including consensus PCR, microarrays, and unbiased next-generation sequencing (NGS), have the capacity to comprehensively identify novel microbes present in clinical samples. Although numerous challenges remain to be addressed, including the bioinformatics analysis and interpretation of large datasets, these technologies have been successful in rapidly identifying emerging outbreak threats, screening vaccines and other biological products for microbial contamination, and discovering novel viruses associated with both acute and chronic illnesses. Downstream studies such as genome assembly, epidemiologic screening, and cultures system or animal model of infection are necessary to establish an association of a candidate pathogen with disease. Although sometimes derided as a “fishing expedition” or a needle in haystack approach, pathogen discovery is, in actuality, a highly worthwhile scientific endeavor. Without a cause identified for many presumed infectious diseases, it is not possible to conduct downstream investigations in pathogenesis and host–microbial interactions nor is it possible to design effective vaccines or antimicrobial drugs to combat the associated illness. Potential applications of pathogen discovery range from outbreak investigation of emerging pathogens, to screening of blood products, vaccines, and other biologics for viral contaminants, to clinical diagnosis of unknown acute or chronic infectious diseases. The current availability of state-of-the-art genomic technologies such as pan-microbial microarrays and NGS provides an unprecedented opportunity to “cast a wide net” and surveys the full breadth of as-yet undiscovered pathogens in nature that pose significant threats to human health.</p>
