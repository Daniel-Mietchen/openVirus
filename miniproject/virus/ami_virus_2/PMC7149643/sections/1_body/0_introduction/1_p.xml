<p id="p0010"> Following on from the discovery of Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) in 1892 and Foot-and-Mouth disease virus in 1898, the first “filterable agent” to be discovered in humans was Yellow Fever (YF) virus in 1901 (

Landmark discoveries later were Rinderpest, Vaccinia and Rabies (1902–06), Avian leukosis and Poliomyelitis (1908–11), Bacteriophages (1915–17), and Spanish flu (1918–22; due to which 50 million people died). More than 65 viruses were described in the years 1920–27 (

Thereafter cultures of human Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and then YF virus were done, and first attenuated vaccine for YF was prepared (1929–31). First chorioallantoic membrane inoculation was done with fowlpox virus in 1931. Subsequently, nucleoprotein nature of viruses (1934–36), crystallization of TMV (1935–37), culture of polio viruses (1949), and DNA as genetic material of phages (1950–63) by Hershey Chase experiment were achieved and killed and live polio vaccines were prepared (

Reoviruses were discovered (1953–64), single stranded Ribonucleic acid (ssRNA) of TMV was translated into viral proteins (1962), and in vitro synthesis of both single stranded deoxyribo nucleicacid (ssDNA) and ssRNA bacteriophage genome was successful (1967). Later in 1979–80, discovery and characterization of infectious naked RNA viroids were shown to be circular ssRNA, complete genomic sequence of hepatitis, cauliflower mosaic virus (CMV) (1982) and complete genomic sequence of TMV (1986–89) was achieved. Historically, major developments in virological technology mark filtration in 1890, complement fixation test in 1929, tissue culture in 1948, monoclonal antibodies in the 1970s, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1985 and high-throughput sequencing in the 2000s (
