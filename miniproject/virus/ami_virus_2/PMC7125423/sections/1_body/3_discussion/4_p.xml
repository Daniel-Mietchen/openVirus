 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>; Kannan and Kolandaivel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2017</xref>) by interfering with hemagglutinin activity, while tetrahydrocurcumin is less effective in inhibiting IAV infection (Ou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>). Further SAR analysis showed that the two-tone functional group as a receptor for Michael addition conjugate contributes to the differential inhibition of curcuminoid. Simulated docking of curcumin with the hemagglutinin structure indicates that curcumin binds to the region that constitutes the sialic acid anchoring residue, supporting the results obtained by inhibition of hemagglutinin activity. These studies indicate that the presence of the double bond in the central seven-carbon chain enhances curcumin-dependent anti-IAV activity and interferes with IAV entry through interaction of curcumin with the receptor-binding region of the viral hemagglutinin protein.
