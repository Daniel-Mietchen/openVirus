<p id="Par37">In this study, we used a 3D-QSAR model and docking model to investigate the inhibitory effects of curcumin derivatives against neuraminidase and influenza A/Font Monmouth/47(H1N1, FM1) in MDCK cells in vitro. Then, we detected the anti-influenza virus effects of curcumin in mice and revealed that it could significantly inhibit IAV and decreased TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ pro-inflammatory cytokines in vivo.</p>
