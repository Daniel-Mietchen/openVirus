<p id="Par40">In this study, we reported the inhibitory effects of the curcumin derivatives on IAV neuraminidase. The addition of curcumin derivative after virus adsorption showed anti-influenza activity in MDCK cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the curcumin derivative inhibits the activity of NA, thereby preventing the release of virions from infected cells. Indeed, the inhibitory effect of curcumin derivatives on IAV replication was not the same as the inhibitory effect of NA expression. It can be seen that curcumin showed the best inhibitory effect on viral replication, followed by demethylcurcumin, tetramethylcurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin, and dihydrocurcumin showed a weak inhibitory effect, which is consistent with the results of Ou et al. (

However, tetramethylcurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin showed a similar effect on inhibition of NA, followed by curcumin, dihydrocurcumin and demethylcurcumin. These results indicated that curcumin derivatives may inhibit IAV through inhibiting many other proteins or signaling pathways, and not only neuraminidase protein. In addition, curcumin derivatives had different inhibitory effects on IAV neuraminidase protein, which was relative to their structures and binding models.
