<p id="Par38">In the present study, most of the curcumin derivatives exhibited significant inhibition of H1N1 neuraminidase. We established a meaningful 3D-QSAR model (CoMFA) to study the SAR between curcumin derivatives and neuraminidase, and predicted the activity of the ligand in the test set. In addition, establishment of the CoMFA model showed that the hydroxyl group at the meta-position of the benzene ring and the double bonds in the central seven-carbon chain in the curcumin derivatives may be essential for neuraminidase inhibitory activity. The docking model was also consistent with the predicted activity of QSAR.</p>
