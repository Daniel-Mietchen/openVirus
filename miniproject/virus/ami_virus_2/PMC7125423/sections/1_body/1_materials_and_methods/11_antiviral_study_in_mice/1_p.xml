<p id="Par18">NIH mice were randomly divided into six groups, 12 in each group: normal control group (NC); placebo control group (IAV-C + sterile saline, suspended in 0.5% Tween 80); curcumin groups (H1N1 virus + curcumin 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg); and positive control ribavirin (70 mg/kg). The challenge inoculation of ~ 10
 <sup>5</sup> 50% cell culture infectious doses (CCID
 <sub>50</sub>)/mouse was equivalent to five 50% mouse lethal challenge doses (MLD
 <sub>50</sub>). Under mild anesthesia, mice were infected with 50 μL 15 MLD
 <sub>50</sub> IAV (sterile in PBS, pH 7.2) intranasally (without the NC group). Then, mice were treated with intraperitoneal injection of curcumin (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) or ribavirin (70 mg/kg) for 1 day prior to viral challenge and received concomitant treatment for 3 days after infection. On day 4 after infection, the mice were sacrificed to collect relevant samples, and the body weight, lung wet weight, and the degree of lung pathological changes were measured.
