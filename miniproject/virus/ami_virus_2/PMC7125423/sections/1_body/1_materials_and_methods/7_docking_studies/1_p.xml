<p id="Par14">To investigate further the binding patterns and the SAR between curcumin derivatives and neuraminidase, we performed molecular docking. The docking procedure was performed using the Surflex-dock module of Sybyl-X2.1.1, and the receptor–ligand interactions were carried out by the Discovery Studio 2016 software. The curcumin derivatives were processed by adding polar hydrogen atoms, giving the Gasteiger–Huckel charge, and using Maxim’s genetic algorithm to perform energy minimization in the Tripos force field. The X-ray structure of influenza virus neuraminidase (code: 4HZZ) was taken from the RSCB Protein Data Bank (Fang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2011</xref>). The ligand-binding site of neuraminidase was defined by the reference ligand 39G. The semi-flexible method was used for docking, and the crystal structure of the original ligand as a reference for docking. The parameters in the docking process were set as follows: expansion coefficient 1, threshold parameter 0.5, and other parameters were system default values. The Total Score function was used to score the situation of molecular docking, which is an empirical scoring function derived from the binding energies of protein–ligand complexes and their X-ray structures. This function takes into account factors such as polarity, hydrophobicity, enthalpy, and solvation. The larger the value, the more stable the docking compound, which means better matching and binding of small molecules and large proteins (Li et al 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). It is generally accepted that Total Score is &gt; 6 for better activity, and ≥ 9 for very good activity.
