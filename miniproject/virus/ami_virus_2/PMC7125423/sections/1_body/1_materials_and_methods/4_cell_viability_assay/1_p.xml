Cell viability was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2–5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. The median cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated as the concentration of the compound that reduced the number of viable cells to 50% of the viability of the untreated controls. The maximal non-cytotoxic concentration was defined as the maximal concentration of the sample that did not exert a cytotoxic effect and resulted in &gt; 90% viable cells.
