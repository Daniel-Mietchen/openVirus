<p id="Par13">To predict the power of the 3D-QSAR model, we verified by the test set compounds (compounds marked * in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The QSAR model was validated by the leave-n-out techniques, which helped to assess the stability of the model to changes in the training set. We performed an external validation using a testing set whose structures and activities were not considered in the model building (Patel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). Gao et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2011</xref>) suggested that the 3D-QSAR model performed well with
