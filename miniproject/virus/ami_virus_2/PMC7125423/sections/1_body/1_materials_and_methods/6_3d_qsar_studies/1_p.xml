<p id="Par11">We selected compounds with quantitative IC
 <sub>50</sub> values as data set, and divided the 11 compounds randomly into a training set (nine compounds) and a testing set (three compounds). We converted the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values to pIC
 <sub>50</sub> values with the formula pIC
 <sub>50</sub> = Δlog IC
 <sub>50</sub>. We used the pIC
 <sub>50</sub> values to develop the 3D-QSAR model by combining the activity data with the generated hypothesis. The chemical structures and biological activities of the 11 compounds are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. We used the Sybyl-X2.1.1 molecular model package to perform the modeling studies.
