<p id="Par12">To derive the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) descriptor fields, we generated a 3D cubic lattice from the space covering the nine aligned compounds. The standard Tripos force fields were used to calculate the space and electrostatic potential fields of the CoMFA. To establish quantitative relationships between biological activities and molecular descriptors in CoMFA, we used partial least squares regression analysis (Golbraikh and Tropsha
