<p id="Par15">RT-PCR was used to assess the ability of curcumin derivatives and oseltamivir carboxylate to inhibit H1N1 virus. Confluent MDCK cell layers infected with 100 μL 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> IAV (H1N1) were treated with curcumin derivatives or oseltamivir carboxylate (20 mM, non-toxic concentration, data not shown) for 24 h. Then, cells were collected to detect the mRNA expression level of H1N1 M gene by using IAV nucleic acid test kit (RT-PCR). The primer sequences used for the detection of viral RNA were 5′-TTC TAA CCG AGG TCG AAA CG-3′ and 5′-ACA AAG CGT CTA CGC TGC AG-3′.
