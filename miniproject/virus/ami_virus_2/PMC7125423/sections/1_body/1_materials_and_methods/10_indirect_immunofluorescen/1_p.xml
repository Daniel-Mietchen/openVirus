<p id="Par17">Confluent MDCK cell layers were infected with 100 μL 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> IAV (H1N1) for 2 h at 37 °C. After removing the virus-containing medium, the cells were treated with curcumin derivatives at maximum non-toxic doses (MNTDs) in DMEM. Cells were fixed with ice-cold acetone/methanol (40:60, Mallinckrodt Baker B.V., Deventer, The Netherlands) for 15 min after 8 h infection. Then, cells were stained using the mouse monoclonal antibody (1 h incubation, 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline; PBS) directed against IAV nucleoprotein (NP) (Millipore, Molsheim, France). The Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H&amp;L) (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA) was used (1 h incubation, 1:100 in PBS) as secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma–Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Munich, Germany). An Olympus IX 1 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Planegg, Germany) was used to visualize fluorescence.
