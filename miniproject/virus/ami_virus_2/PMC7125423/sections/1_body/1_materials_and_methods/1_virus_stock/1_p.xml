<p id="Par6">Influenza virus strain, A/Font Monmouth/47(H1N1, FM1), adapted to mice, was originally obtained from Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus was adapted to replication in the lungs of BALB/c mice by eight sequential passages through mouse lungs. The inoculated virus was plaque-purified in MDCK cells, then replicated in 9-day-old chicken embryos and stored at− 80 °C. The virus titer was determined as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) in confluent cells of 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany).
