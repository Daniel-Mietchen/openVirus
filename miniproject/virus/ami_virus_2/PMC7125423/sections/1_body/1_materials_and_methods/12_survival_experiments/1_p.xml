<p id="Par19">NIH mice were anesthetized in a chamber containing absorbent cotton saturated with 30 mL diethyl ether for about 30 s and infected intranasally with 2 MLD
 <sub>50</sub> of IAV in sterile PBS (pre-cooled). Then, mice were treated with oral gavage of curcumin (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) or ribavirin (70 mg/kg) for 1 day before infection in the protective administration group, and mice in the therapeutic administration groups were treated 6 h after infection. Mice received these treatments for 12 days and were monitored daily for 15 days after infection. For the IAV-C group, the mice were given saline (0.5% Tween 80) only at the same intervals. Fifteen days after infection, the mice were continuously observed daily for weight loss, survival, and clinical symptoms of illness (e.g., wrinkled fur, inactivity, loss of appetite, hunchback posture, and rapid shallow breathing) to assess the survival rate and mean days to death. The lung index was calculated as follows: Lung index = A/B × 100, where A is the lung weight, and B is the body weight (Li et al.
