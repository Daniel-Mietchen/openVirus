<p id="Par32">Mice treated with curcumin at 100 mg/kg/day remained stable in weight and showed no significant clinical symptoms, indicating dose safety. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin against influenza A/Font Monmouth/47(H1N1, FM1) virus, a lethal murine infection model was used and all the mice were killed a few days after infection. The degree of lung pathological change of the placebo group was more serious than that of the normal control group, and the difference in lung index was significant (

 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Compared with the placebo control, the lung index of the ribavirin group was significantly improved, and the lung index inhibition rate was 43% (
