<p id="Par33">To investigate further the protective and therapeutic efficacy of curcumin against H1N1, mice were treated with curcumin at 100, 50, and 25 mg/kg/day before and after inoculation with IAV. Treatment with curcumin pre-infection and post-infection at all doses prolonged the average survival time and promote the death protection rate significantly, compared with placebo group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). It was observed that the death protection rate with pre-infection administration was dose dependent, while the death protection rate with post-infection administration at 100 mg/kg/day was the most obvious. These results showed that curcumin had a good death protection effect against IAV-induced pneumonia in mice.
