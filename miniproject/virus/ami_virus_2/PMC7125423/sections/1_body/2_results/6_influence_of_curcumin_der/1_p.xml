<p id="Par31">To investigate the influence of curcumin derivatives on the reduction of the viral NP, MDCK cells were infected with H1N1 (100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) for 2 h at 37 °C and then were treated with curcumin derivatives at MNTDs. NP localization was detected 8 h after infection, at which time viral replication and transcription were ongoing, and newly formed viral particles began to be released and spread from infected cells. No immunofluorescence of viral NP was observed in the control group, while green fluorescent signal was observed in cells infected with virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Viral NP was mainly localized in the cytoplasm, with lesser amounts in the nucleus. Compared to the virus group, less NP was observed in the cytoplasm in cells treated with tetramethylcurcumin and curcumin. In contrast, in cells treated with demethylcurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, and dihydrocurcumin, a strong green fluorescent signal was observed in the cytoplasm. These results suggested that tetramethylcurcumin and curcumin inhibited the nucleation of viral NP, leading to nuclear retention of NP, preventing viral assembly.
