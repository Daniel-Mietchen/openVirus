<p id="Par25">In the stereo contour map, the yellow and green regions represent areas where small and large volume groups enhance activity, respectively. We selected the most potent inhibitor, demethylcurcumin (pIC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.20), as a reference for assisted visualization. There were four green areas and five yellow areas around the composite zones. The green outline around the meta-hydroxyl group of the phenyl ring indicated where it favored the space volume, such as a meta-methoxy group of the other benzene ring. Large volume groups at these positions may facilitate interactions between the ligand and its receptor, which accounted for why demethoxycurcumin activity (pIC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.70) was lower than demethylcurcumin activity (pIC
 <sub>50</sub>) = 4.20. The difference in activity between bisdemethoxycurcumin (pIC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.15) and demethylcurcumin (pIC
 <sub>50</sub> = 4.20) was also reasonably explained. In addition, the green contour around the central seven carbon chain showed that the double bonds in the central seven-carbon chain may be beneficial for the interaction between the ligand and its receptor. For example, the activity of dihydrocurcumin (pIC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.66) and tetrahydrocurcumin (pIC
 <sub>50</sub> = 3.69) was higher than that of hexahydrocurcumin (pIC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.47) and octahydrocurcumin (pIC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2.81).
