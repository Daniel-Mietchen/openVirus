<p id="Par35">Elevation of proinflammatory cytokines is a typical response to IAV infection, so we established whether curcumin affected the virus-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Lung tissues were harvested from IAV-infected mice on day 5 after infection, and several cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ) were analyzed by ELISA. Compared to the control group, the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ in the lung homogenate were significantly increased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). However, curcumin at different doses significantly attenuated the increases in TNF-α, IL-6 and IFN-γ levels in similar lung homogenates, except for TNF-α level in mice treated with 25 mg/kg/day curcumin.
