<p id="Par26">In order to explore the binding patterns between curcumin derivatives and neuraminidase, molecular docking was performed to help understand the SARs between molecules and proteins. Sybyl-X2.1.1 was applied to carry out the docking studies. Oseltamivir carboxylate was used as a positive control to assess the ability of other molecules to bind to NA. The Total Score function was used to comprehensively score the situation of molecular docking, which is an empirical scoring function derived from the binding energies of protein–ligand complexes and their X-ray structures. It is generally accepted that Total Score is &gt; 6 for better activity, and ≥ 9 for very good activity (Golbraikh and Tropsha 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the Total Scores of 11 curcumin derivatives and oseltamivir carboxylate were all &gt; 6, indicating that these compounds were likely to have inhibited NA. Thus, according to NA inhibitory activity assays, the binding mode between demethylcurcumin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 62.77 μM) and oseltamivir carboxylate (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 225.42 μM) was further investigated in the docking study, and the top five compounds with higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> were selected for in vitro activity verification.
