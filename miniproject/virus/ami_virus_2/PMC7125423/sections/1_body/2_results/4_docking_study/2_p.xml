<p id="Par27">The 3D and 2D binding models between neuraminidase and demethylcurcumin (A and B), and neuraminidase and oseltamivir carboxylate (C and D) were analyzed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Key residues, H bonds, van der Waals forces, π-alkyl and alkyl groups were analytically labeled and visualized to understand further the details of neuraminidase binding to molecules. The chemical bonds corresponding to the residues are listed in Table
