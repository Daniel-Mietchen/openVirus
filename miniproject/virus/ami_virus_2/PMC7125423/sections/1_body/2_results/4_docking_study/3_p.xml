<p id="Par28">There were four conventional H bonds between the oseltamivir carboxylate and five residues of neuraminidase, which indicated that the binding region of this portion of the H-bond was important for the stable binding between oseltamivir carboxylate and NA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>D). The combination of demethylcurcumin with NA produces five conventional H bonds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>B), indicating that demethylcurcumin can be considered as a potential NA inhibitor. In addition, there were two π-donor H bonds and one π-alkyl bond between demethylcurcumin and NA, but only one alkyl bond between oseltamivir carboxylate.
