 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) to perform the neuraminidase inhibition screening assay. Most of them had an inhibitory effect on the structural protein NA of H1N1 virus, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranging from 62.77 to 33,695.47 μM, while oseltamivir carboxylate (positive control) had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 225.42 μM. Eleven active compounds were selected for 3D-QSAR and the docking study.
