<p id="Par22">The 11 curcumin derivatives selected in the neuraminidase inhibition screening assay were used to perform the 3D QSAR studies (CoMFA), and the CoMFA statistical coefficients are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. When the cross-validation correlation coefficient q
 <sup>2</sup> is &gt; 0.5, the prediction model is reliable (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>). The larger q
 <sup>2</sup> is, the stronger the prediction ability is. In the CoMFA model, the cross-validation coefficient q
 <sup>2</sup> was 0.527 and the best composition score was 4. Partial least squares regression analysis yielded a model correlation coefficient 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> of 0.997 and an F statistic of 282.663. The cross-validation coefficient was used to evaluate the predictive ability of the fitting equation. The higher 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> value is, the higher the ratio of the two variables, and the better the fitting degree of the model and data; the 
 <italic>F</italic> statistics are greater than the critical value K, that is, the effect of the regression analysis is significant.
