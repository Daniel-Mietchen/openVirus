<p id="Par23">Compared with the actual activities, the predicted activities of the CoMFA model were in general agreement with the original data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), indicating that the predictive ability of the model was credible. The results of the actual and predicted pIC
 <sub>50</sub> values for the training set and testing set are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. It can be seen from the figure that the actual value was close to the predicted value, and the prediction of the pIC
 <sub>50</sub> value by the 3D-QSAR model was reasonably accurate. The actual and predicted values were close, indicating that the model established in this study had statistical significance. The calculated and experimental values of the external verification test set were also similar (red triangle in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), indicating that the model had a strong predictive ability and was successfully constructed. Five active compounds with better inhibition of NA activity in vitro were selected for further study.
