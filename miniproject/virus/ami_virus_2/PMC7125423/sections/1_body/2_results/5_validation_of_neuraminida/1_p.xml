<p id="Par29">To validate the neuraminidase inhibition ability for the top five compounds that showed higher IC
 <sub>50</sub> in the neuraminidase inhibition screening experiments, experiments including viral replication inhibition assay and neuraminidase inhibition assay in vitro were carried out. First, MTT cell proliferation assay was performed to measure the MNTD of the compounds. The MNTDs for tetramethylcurcumin, demethylcurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin, dihydrocurcumin and curcumin were 15, 20, 20, 20 and 25 μM, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>A). The MNTDs of the compounds were used in the viral replication inhibition assay and neuraminidase inhibition assay. The five curcumin derivatives showed different degrees of inhibition of H1N1 M gene mRNA expression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>B). Demethylcurcumin and tetramethylcurcumin significantly decreased the mRNA expression levels of M gene about 4.17-fold (0.24 ± 0.07 μM) and about 3.85-fold (0.26 ± 0.07 μM) compared to mock-treated virus controls. Treatment with curcumin reduced expression about 5.26-fold (0.19 ± 0.03 μM). Bisdemethoxycurcumin and dihydrocurcumin decreased the M gene mRNA expression about 2.13-fold (0.47 ± 0.11 μM) and 1.20-fold (0.83 ± 0.09 μM), respectively. In addition, the positive drug group (oseltamivir carboxylate) almost inhibited the mRNA expression of M gene, which was about 11.11-fold compared to mock-treated virus controls.
