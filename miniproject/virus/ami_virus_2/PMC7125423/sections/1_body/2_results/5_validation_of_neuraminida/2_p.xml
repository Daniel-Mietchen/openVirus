<p id="Par30">Furthermore, the influence of curcumin derivatives on H1N1-induced neuraminidase activation in MDCK cells was analyzed by the supernatant. H1N1 infection decreased the neuraminidase activity relative to that in the mock-infected cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>C). Compared to virus controls, tetramethylcurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin decreased NA activity by 2.65-fold (0.37 ± 0.06 mU/mL) and 2.45-fold (0.40 ± 0.01 mU/mL), respectively, whose inhibitory effects were all better than that of the oseltamivir carboxylate group (0.44 ± 0.04 mU/mL). The other three derivatives also showed an inhibitory effect, in which curcumin, demethylcurcumin and dihydrocurcumin respectively decreased NA activity by about 2.04-fold (0.48 ± 0.03 mU/mL), 1.85-fold (0.53 ± 0.06 mU/mL) and 1.81-fold (0.54 ± 0.02 mU/mL).
