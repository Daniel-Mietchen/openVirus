<p id="Par3">Currently, amantadine, oseltamivir, and zanamivir are used for treatment of influenza A (Pica and Palese 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>), including inhibition of the matrix protein M2 (amantadine) and NA (oseltamivir and zanamivir). M2 ion channel blockers only inhibit IAV and have potential neurotoxicity (Zhao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2012</xref>). Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) prevent infected cells from releasing and transmitting progeny virions during the replication cycle by binding to the active site of viral neuraminidase (Belser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>). However, in recent years, because of the widespread use of these drugs, resistant strains of IAV have emerged (Hurt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Moscona 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>; Cho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>). Therefore, it is urgent to identify new antiviral drugs that are effective against influenza viruses.
