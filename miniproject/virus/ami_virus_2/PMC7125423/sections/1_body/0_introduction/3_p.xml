<p id="Par4">Due to its versatile pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-oxidant activities (Maheshwari et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>; Goel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>), curcumin has attracted considerable interest. In particular, curcumin is reported to have anti-influenza virus activity by interfering with the cellular signaling pathways (such as Toll-like receptor2/4, p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and nuclear factor-ÎºB pathways) or with proteins required for influenza virus replication (Dai et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>). Ou et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>) reported that the presence of the double bonds in the central seven-carbon chain enhances the curcumin-dependent anti-IAV activity and curcumin might interfere with IAV entry by its interaction with the receptor binding region of hemagglutinin. Chen et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>) also reported that curcumin can inhibit influenza virus by disrupting integrity of the viral envelope and liposomal membranes. However, it is not clear whether curcumin and its derivatives can inhibit neuraminidase of influenza virus.
