<p id="Par2">Influenza A virus (IAV), a type of orthomyxoviridae virus responsible for frequent seasonal epidemics, is closely related to human health (Taubenberger and Morens 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>; Scalera and Mossad 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>). It causes acute respiratory disease by infection of the upper respiratory tract mucosa (Taubenberger and Morens 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>). The glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are embedded in the envelope of the influenza virus, and play an important role in the invasion of host cells and viral transmission (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref>). In the procession of viral shedding, neuraminidase cuts the sialic acid linkage formed between the sialic acid receptor on the surface of the host cell and the hemagglutinin to promote viral replication (Nayak and Jabbar 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1989</xref>; Ohuchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>). Hence, neuraminidase is considered to be an important target for treatment of influenza (Ohuchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>).
