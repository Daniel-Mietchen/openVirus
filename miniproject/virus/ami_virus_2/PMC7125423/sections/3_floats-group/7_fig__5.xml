   <bold>B</bold>) Influence of five curcumin derivatives treatment on the mRNA expression of M gene in H1N1-infected MDCK cells. MDCK cells were infected with 100 μL of 100TCID
   <sub>50</sub> influenza virus A/Font Monmouth/47(H1N1, FM1) for 2 h at 37 °C. After removing the virus-containing medium, the cells were treated with curcumin derivatives at MNLDs in DMEM respectively. Cells were harvested 24 h after infection and mRNA expression levels of M genes were detected by real-time RT-PCR. Data represent the mean ± SD of 3 separate experiments.

   <bold>C</bold>) Influence of curcumin derivatives treatment on neuraminidase activation in H1N1-infected MDCK cells. MDCK cells were infected with 100 μL of 100TCID
   <sub>50</sub> influenza virus A/Font Monmouth/47(H1N1, FM1) for 2 h at 37 °C. After removing the virus-containing medium, the cells were treated with curcumin derivatives at MNLDs in DMEM respectively. Twenty-four hours post-infection the cell supernatant was analyzed for neuraminidase activity (expressed as mU/mL units) using Neuraminidase Activity Assay Kit. Data represent the mean ± SD of 3 separate experiments.
