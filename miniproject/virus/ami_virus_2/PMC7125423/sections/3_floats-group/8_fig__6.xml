  <p>Influence of curcumin derivatives treatment on nuclear export of viral NP in H1N1-infected MDCK cells. MDCK cells were infected with A/Font Monmouth/47(H1N1, FM1) at 100TCID
   <sub>50</sub>. 5 curcumin derivatives treatments were performed continuously starting after infection. Eight hours post-infection NP localisation was visualised using specific antibodies by immunfluorescence. NP staining is shown in green. Nuclei are stained by DAPI (shown in blue). Photographs are
