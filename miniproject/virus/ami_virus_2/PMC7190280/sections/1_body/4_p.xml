 <italic>Pandemic! Covid-19 Shakes the World</italic>, Slavoj Žižek (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>) comments on the panic globally facing us in the times of Covid-19 when ‘We live in a moment when the greatest act of love is to stay distant from the object of your affection. When governments renowned for ruthless cuts in public spending can suddenly conjure up trillions. When toilet paper becomes a commodity as precious as diamonds.’ He touches a chord when he writes with customary irony:

  <p id="Par10">An average consumer reason[s] in the following way: I know there is enough toilet paper and the rumor is false, but what if some people take this rumor seriously and, in a panic, start to buy excessive reserves of toilet paper, causing an actual shortage? So I better buy reserves myself. It is not even necessary to believe that some others take the rumor seriously – it is enough to presuppose that some others believe that there are people who take the rumor seriously – the effect is the same, namely the real lack of toilet paper in the stores. Is something similar not going on in the UK and California today? (Žižek
