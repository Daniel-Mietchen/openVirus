<p id="par0010">Data from recent public opinion polls show that 2019-nCoV is having a significant psychological impact. An Angus Reid poll of 1354 Canadian adults conducted in early February 2020 indicated that one-third of respondents were worried about the virus and 7% were “very concerned” about becoming infected (

At the time of the poll, only 4 Canadians were infected, indicating a very low risk for a country of approximately 37 million; yet, 7% of the population—that is, 2.6 million people—were very concerned. There was also an increase in hygienic and avoidance behaviours. Since hearing about the outbreak, 3% of respondents in the Angus Reid poll had purchased a facemask, 41% washed their hands more often, 4% avoided taking public transit, and 12% avoided public places (

Lack of faith in the healthcare system is likely to fuel fears about the consequences of becoming infected.
