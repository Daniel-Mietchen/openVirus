<p id="Par23">We find that the capability to sweep the network depends strongly on the structure of the network (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). If no or few long-range links are present and the genetic mutation rate is weak or moderate, the infection wave quickly dies out and overall infection is rare. However, our simulations reveal that for a rewiring rate
