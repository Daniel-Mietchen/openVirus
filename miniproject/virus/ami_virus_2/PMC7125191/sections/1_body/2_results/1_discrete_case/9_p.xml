<p id="Par29">We will now present a theoretical explanation for the observed scaling behavior. This is made easier by splitting the phenomenology of a sweep into occurrence of a critical mutation and a following epidemic wave. We now only consider the probability that during a run at least one critical mutation occurs. Plots of this probability (i.e., the probability that during a run at least one node reaches 
 <italic>γ</italic> ≥ 0) appear similar to those for the sweep fraction for small 
 <italic>p</italic>, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>. For small 
 <italic>χ</italic> the slopes of the curves apparently approach -2 (see solid black line for comparison).
