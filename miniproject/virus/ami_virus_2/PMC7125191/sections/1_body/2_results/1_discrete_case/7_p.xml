<p id="Par27">The reason for this different behavior in our mutating SIR model is the fact that for sufficiently large mutation rate the sequence variable 
 <italic>γ</italic> can become 1 and settle at the global extremum of the fitness landscape. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> demonstrates this by comparing a case of small 
 <italic>χ</italic> (blue bar), moderate 
 <italic>χ</italic> (green) and large 
 <italic>χ</italic> (red). Only in the last two cases, we obtain escape from the fitness maximum at 
 <italic>γ</italic> = −1.
