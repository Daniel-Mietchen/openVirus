<p id="Par21">Given the initial infected site and its infection probability 
 <italic>λ</italic>, an infection can generally spread through parts of the network. If 
 <italic>λ</italic> stays constant, there is a chance that the pathogen infects small or large spatial domains, which can be mathematically described by the established percolation theory. However, as a consequence of the mutations, the infection probability changes and enables more substantial evolutions of the epidemic. If, in this process, the genetic variable 
 <italic>γ</italic> evolves towards 1, the epidemic may be able to spread throughout the entire network since 
 <italic>λ</italic> is then larger than the critical value of 0.5. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> shows an exemplary evolution of the genetic variable 
 <italic>γ</italic> where most of the network is eventually infected by the mutated pathogen (green and yellow).
