<p id="Par24">Note that this does not mean that there are no infections spreading for small rates or without mutations. In fact, without mutations (i.e., for a constant infection probability 
 <italic>λ</italic> ≈ 0.45) infections can spread. This can happen if, as was mentioned above, shortcuts enable the spreading of infections even if the 
 <italic>λ</italic> value predicts a subcritical behavior for a pure grid. To discuss this in detail we now determine the share of infected nodes per run and average it over all runs. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> shows that the average number of infected nodes is substantially larger than 0 for 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.005 and all mutation rates. It contrast to the fraction of sweeps, it does not vanish with decreasing 
 <italic>χ</italic>.
