<p id="Par4">One important attribute of networks, which appears in many socio-spatial real-world networks, is the small-world property. With it, individual nodes are connected frequently in their local spatial areas

 </sup>, yet they are also connected to distant nodes via a small number of intermediated nodes. Transport networks, which are common substrates for infection spreading, were found to possess the small-world property; particularly those that developed in modern times. For instance, for the spread of human diseases it may be important that individuals fly long distances by plane, which makes the human transport grid to be of small-world type
