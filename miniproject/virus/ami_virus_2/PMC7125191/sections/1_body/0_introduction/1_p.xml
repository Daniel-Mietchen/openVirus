<p id="Par2">In the human history, epidemic diseases such as the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the pandemic influenza have killed millions of people worldwide. Recently, Influenza A (H1N1) spread in 2009, and Ebola spread in the years 2013 to 2016. Not as catastrophic as originally feared, Influenza A, which is genetically close to the Spanish flu of the early 20th century, caused 284,000 deaths

Among animals, diseases including the African swine fever have been rapidly expanding and have required expensive steps by the responsible authorities.
