<p id="Par42">Second, the long-range connections allow the mutated form to emerge and to move freely to uninfected parts of the network, so that the mutation can quickly spread and cover large parts of the network (sweep). The latter, however, only holds if the original type has not covered the entire domain before the mutated type appears. Typically, if 
 <italic>p</italic> is large, the speed of an epidemic wave is increased. In this situation, the non-mutated type indeed covers large parts of the network before the supercritical pathogens can propagate. Oftentimes, in this situation the non-mutated form remains sparse while covering the network so that the probability of full blown epidemics is much reduced, see Figs.Â
