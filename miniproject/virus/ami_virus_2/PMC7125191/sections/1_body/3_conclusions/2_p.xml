<p id="Par40">Our work suggests that risk assessment should be substantially different depending on whether or not mutations are occurring. Under noisy conditions (i.e., allowing mutations) infections are not extensively worse (in a statistical sense) compared to noise-free condition, as the average percentages of infected sites do not change substantially. But mutations are potentially risky, since they are likely to produce a global outbreak in a given population, which is explosive and fast. This makes the latter situation far more difficult and challenging to control epidemiologically.</p>
