<p id="Par39">We have shown that the interaction of epidemic transmissions of a mutating pathogen with the structure of a network can produce a transition to a regime of complete infection of a host species spatiallyÂ distributed on the network. The problem has been framed in terms of stochastic escape from a subcritical transmission probability to a supercritical transmission probability. The escape to the potentially disastrous supercritical regime is facilitated by a small number of long-range links on the spatial grid of hosts. We are thus closing a loop in which transmission enables mutation and mutation enables the spreading of disease on the complete network.</p>
