 </disp-formula>where 
 <italic>λ</italic> and 
 <italic>μ</italic> are the probabilities of infection and recovery per time step, respectively. Consider now a network of locations on which the infection spreads by specified contacts. Every node of the network contains individuals that are collectively in one of the three states. If a node is susceptible and at least one of its connected nodes is infected, it becomes infected as well with probability 
 <italic>λ</italic>, whereas an infected node recovers with probability 
 <italic>μ</italic>. The value of 
 <italic>λ</italic> is determined by the states 
 <italic>γ</italic> of the infected nodes connected to a susceptible node, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. During each time step, for every S-node we calculate the probability 
 <italic>λ</italic>(
 <italic>γ</italic>) for any connected I-node and let the S-node become infected according to this probability. If several connected nodes are infected, we randomly shuffle the order by which the transition is tested. Individuals in state R are immune and cannot be infected again. Note that for simplicity we consider 
 <italic>λ</italic> and 
 <italic>μ</italic> as probabilities for a (relatively large) discrete time step, which means that we do not obtain exponential waiting time distribution for the transitions.
