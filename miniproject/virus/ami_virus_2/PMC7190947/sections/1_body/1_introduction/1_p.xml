<p>The coronavirus is a category of enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. In the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) both caused worldwide epidemics with high morbidity and mortality[

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recently, the SARS-CoV-2 that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 has spread globally with alarming infections and deaths[

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)[
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which is also a highly contagious disease[
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As of April 11, 2020, there have been 83 400 confirmed infections, 3 349 fatalities in China, and 1 623 873 confirmed cases with 99 617 deaths in 209 other countries[
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 is presumed to be transmitted by respiratory droplets, viral aerosols, close contacts, and self-inoculation to nose, mouth, or eyes after touching a contaminated surface[
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, there are still many controversies about the airborne transmission and infectivity of SARS-CoV on inanimate surfaces. We therefore reviewed the persistence and infectivity of viruses on inanimate surfaces to provide clear information for containing the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.
