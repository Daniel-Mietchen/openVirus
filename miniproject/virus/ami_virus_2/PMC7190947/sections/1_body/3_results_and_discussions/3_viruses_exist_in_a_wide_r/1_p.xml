<p>Clinically stable asthma patients have similar detection rates of respiratory viruses in samples from the nasopharynx, sputum, and exhaled air[
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The World Health Organization considers disease transmission with particles ≤ 5 μm as aerosol transmission[
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. When pathogens become airborne, they travel in particles of different sizes and compositions. Particle size determines the distance across which pathogens can be transported, as well as the site of deposition and the survivability of the viruses. The concentration and size distribution of inhalable particles that transport IAV as well as the viral viability for each particle size range were assessed on experimentally infected pigs, including samples from porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus exhaled by acutely infected pigs. An Andersen cascade impactor being able to separate particles by size (0.4-10 μm in diameter) was used to collect aerosols from experimentally infected pigs for 24 d. Infectious status was demonstrated for the three viruses. Quantitative RT-PCR results indicated that airborne porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, IAV, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus can be found in a wide range of particle sizes. The virus viability is particle size-dependent[
