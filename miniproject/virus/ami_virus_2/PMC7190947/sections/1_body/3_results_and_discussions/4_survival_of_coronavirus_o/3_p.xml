<p>Infectivity of HuCoV- 229E was undetectable after drying on aluminum, sterile latex surgical gloves, and sterile cotton gauze sponges at RT for 3 h; HuCoV OC43 survived 1 h or less[
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Contaminated droplets will be absorbed faster on cotton materials than on fluid-repellent materials, and cotton gowns offer protection against droplets bearing viruses. Droplets or fomites that persiston a nonabsorbent disposable gown or gloves may be a risk to contaminate the environment.
