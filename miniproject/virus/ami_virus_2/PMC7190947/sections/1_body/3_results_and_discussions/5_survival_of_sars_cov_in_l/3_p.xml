<p>SARS-CoV HKU 39849 is relatively more stable than HuCoV 229E or OC43 and some other viral respiratory pathogens such as RSV. It is stable for 3 wk at RT in a liquid environment and after being dried on plastic, and its viability can be retained from 5 d to 2 wk at 22-25 °C at a relative humidity (RH) of 40-50%[
