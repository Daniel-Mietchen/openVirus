<p>The survival time of SARS-CoV is impacted by viral stains, the types of solutions it stayed in, temperature, and viral titers. It could survive for 14 d at 4 °C, 2 d at 20 °C in dechlorinated tap water or domestic sewage, and 14 d at 20 °C in BPS. The SARS-CoV strain P9 was isolated from a pharyngeal swab of SARS patients[
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In testing conditions, it could survive in serum, 1:20 diluted sputum, and feces for at least 4 d (96 h), and in urine for at least 3 d (72 h) with a low level of infectivity[
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. SARS-CoV P9 infectivity at RT persisted for 60 h after exposure, started to drop after 72 h, and was almost detectable after 120 h[
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It stayed stable at 4 °C, 20 °C and at 37 °C for at least 2 h with infectivity in cells. A short time exposure can inactivate complement at 56 °C, and antibody at 67 °C, which is not enough to eliminate SARS-CoV infectivity; the conditions for SARS-CoV to become non-infectious should be at 56 °C for 90 min, 67 °C for 60 min, and 75 °C for 30 min, respectively[
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Another study shows that coronaviruses remain infective at 4 °C for several months, and at -60 °C for many years[
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], but are inactivated at 56 °C within 10-15 min, and at 37 °C after several days[
