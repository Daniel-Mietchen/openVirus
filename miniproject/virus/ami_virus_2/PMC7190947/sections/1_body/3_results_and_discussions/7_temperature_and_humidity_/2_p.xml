<p>A high RH of &gt; 95% and temperature of 28 °C or 33 °C did not significantly affect the infectivity of SARS-CoV HKU 39849. Increasing the temperature to 38 °C disfavors the virus, with the virus rapidly losing viability (3 log
 <sub>10</sub>) at 38 °C and RH of &gt; 95% (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>)[
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A high temperature (
 <italic>e.g</italic>., 30 °C or 40 °C) reduced the persistence duration of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, TGEV, and MHV. The persistence of SARS-CoV was longer with higher inocula. HCoV-229E at RT persists longer at RH 50% than at RH 30%.
