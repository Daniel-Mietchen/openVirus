<p>The survival of airborne HuCoV 229E was investigated under different conditions of temperature and RH. At 20 °C, at 50% RH, aerosolized HuCoV-229E was found to survive best with a half-life of 67.33 ± 8.24 h, with nearly 20% infectious virus detectable at 6 d; while at 30% RH the virus half-life was 26.76 ± 6.21 h. At high 80% RH, the half-life was only about 3 h, and no virus in aerosols could be detected after 24 h. At 6 °C, in either 50% or 30% RH conditions, the survival of HuCoV-229E was significantly enhanced, with the decay pattern essentially similar to that seen at 20 ± 1 °C. At 6 °C in 80% RH, however, the HuCoV-229E half-life increased to 86.01 ± 5.28 h, nearly 30 times that found at 20 °C and 80% RH[
