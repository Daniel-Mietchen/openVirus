<p>Persistence of most bacteria, fungi, and viruses (
 <italic>e.g</italic>., SARS-CoV) on surfaces depends on environmental conditions[
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], such as air temperature and RH[
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], inoculums, and the materials that they stayed on. Low temperature, high inoculums, and proper RH are associated with longer persistence time for most viruses. The role of the environment on the survival of viruses in the air may be more complex and significant[
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. RH impacts the survival time of viruses, and the relationship between the inactivation of RH and temperature was not monotony. The temperature impacts the survival of the virus more significantly than that of RH. In all water types tested (reagent-grade water, lake water and settled sewage), the titer of infectious virus declined more rapidly at 25 °C than at 4 °C[
