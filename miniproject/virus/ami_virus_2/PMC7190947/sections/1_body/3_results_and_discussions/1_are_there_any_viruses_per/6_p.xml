<p>Viral nucleic acids, as well as viable seasonal and avian influenza viruses, have been detected in aerosols in the air in healthcare settings or in buses. The viral RNA of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was recovered in the air in pediatric or adult ambulatory care clinics, while only a small percentage of them were in particles ≤ 5 μm[

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Infected with SARS-CoV-2 but unaware of that, patient zero travelled in a fully enclosed air conditioned bus from place A to B. During his two-hour journey on the bus, he had infected eight passengers, one of which was asymptomatic. At place B, patient zero commuted to another bus right away, and infected two of 12 passengers during this one-hour travel. The bus was not disinfected at the bus station at place B, and 30 min later, shuttled more passengers back to place A. Among them, a passenger sat beside the seat where patient zero was previously seated, and was confirmed to be infected 2 d later, suggesting that the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 on inanimate surfaces or in aerosol flows in closed buses may last at least 30 min. The distance from patient zero to his infected persons is 0.5-4.5 m. Patient zero and all of the 11 infected passengers in the bus did not wear masks, of which two infected passengers infected two other persons. Thus, patient zero caused a total of 13 human SARS-CoV-2 infections[

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] studied the air samples emitted by 16 patients infected with influenza virus. The air samples adjacent to these patients (0.5-1.0 m and 2.1-2.5 m away) were collected using bio-aerosol samplers, respectively. 37.5% of the air samples emitted by these patients were tested positive in viral RNA for all tested particle sizes (&lt; 1, 1-4, and &gt; 5 μm), which indicates that the viruses exist in the air inclose proximity to the patients. There was no correlation between the nasal viral load of the patients and viral RNA recovery from the air, and there was no significant association between RNA detection from the air and demographics or clinical presentation[
