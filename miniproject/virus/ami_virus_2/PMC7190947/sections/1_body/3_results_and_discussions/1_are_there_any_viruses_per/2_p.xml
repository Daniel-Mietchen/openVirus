<p>Ong et al[
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in Singapore collected air and surface samples from COVID-19 patients bedrooms before and after routine cleaning. Before routine cleaning, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results were positive with 13 (87%) of 15 room sites (including air outlet fans) and 3 (60%) of 5 toilet sites (toilet bowl, sink, and door handle), suggesting that the ward environment was extensively contaminated and that viral shedding in stool could be a potential route of transmission. Anteroom and corridor samples were negative. One COVID-19 patient had upper respiratory tract infection with no pneumonia or diarrhea, and his two stool samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR. After routine cleaning of the room, samples collected from another two patients were negative. Only one swab from the surface of a shoe front was positive. All air samples were negative[
