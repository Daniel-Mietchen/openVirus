<p>To investigate the possibility of SARS-CoV transmission in the air[
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], air samples were obtained from seven wards and balconies in hospital at a frequency of three times daily for three continuous days. The N protein gene of SARS-CoV was amplified with RT-PCR, and 29.03% of air samples in the wards and 20.0% of samples in balconies were positive for SARS-CoV; sequential analysis of the positive samples showed that the identity of amplified cDNA fragments to the known SARS-CoV strains was 98%. A strain of live pathogen was isolated and could cause typical cytopathic effects, similar to that of SARS-CoV on Vero-E6 cells, and the effects could be stably passed[
