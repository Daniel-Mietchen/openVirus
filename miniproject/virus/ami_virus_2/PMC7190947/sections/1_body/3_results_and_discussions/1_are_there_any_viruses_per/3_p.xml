<p>Jang et al[
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] studied 28 air samples and 130 surface samples from isolated wards, outpatient fever clinics, guiding service Intensive Care Units, and nurse stations. RT-PCR results show that only one air sample from Intensive Care Units (1/28, 3.57%) and one surface sample from nurse stations (1/130, 0.77%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Tracheal intubation was consistently associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV transmission among healthcare workers[
