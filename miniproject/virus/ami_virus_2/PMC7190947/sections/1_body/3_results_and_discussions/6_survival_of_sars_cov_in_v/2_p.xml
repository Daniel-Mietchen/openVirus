<p>The BCoV-88 infectivity in 10% bovine fecal suspension decreased faster than in a minimum essential medium of 2% FBS suspension, yet the reason is unclear. In bovine, there are abundant proteolytic or lipolytic enzymes like proteases or lipases in bovine intestines and bovine fecal suspensions, the virion surface spike glycoproteins are sensitive to protease cleavage, and the envelope is sensitive to lipase. Loss of a functional spike glycoprotein on the virion surface or loss of the virus envelope can confer BCoV-88 infectivity.</p>
