<p>In Finland from 2015-2016[
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], surface and air samples were collected weekly at three different time points during the peak period of seasonal influenza. Swabs from surface samples and air samples were tested by real-time PCR for influenza A and B viruses, RSV, adenovirus, rhinovirus, and coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, and OC43). The nucleic acid of at least one respiratory virus was detected in 10% (9/90) of surface samples from multiple places, such as childrenâ€™s play grounds, security check areas, buttons of payment terminals, passenger side desks and handrails of stairs. The ten respiratory viruses identified from surfaces and air samples at various sites were rhinovirus (4/10, 40%), coronavirus (3/10, 30%,), adenovirus (2/10, 20%, one air sample, one surface sample), and influenza A (1/10, 10%). The detection of viral nucleic acids indicates surface contamination on multiple sites in airports associated with high touch rates, such as plastic security screening trays, which are almost inevitable for all embarking passengers to touch[
