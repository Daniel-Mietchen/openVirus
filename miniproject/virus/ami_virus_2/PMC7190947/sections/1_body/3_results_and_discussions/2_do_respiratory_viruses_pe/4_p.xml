<p>Lei et al[
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] built a model to simulate outbreaks of influenza A H1N1, SARS-CoV, and norovirus in a similar cabin environment. The simulation results suggest that passengers within two rows of the index case had a significantly higher infection risk than others in the outbreak. For SARS-CoV, the airborne, close contact, and fomite routes contributed 21%, 29%, and 50% transmission, respectively. The close contact route was significant in the in-flight transmission of influenza A H1N1. For norovirus, the fomite route played the dominant role in most cases[
