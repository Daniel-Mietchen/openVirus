<p>TGEV and MHV were used as conservative surrogates for modeling exposure to determine the effects of AT and RH on the survival of coronaviruses on stainless steel[
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. At 4 °C, the infectious virus persisted for 28 d, and the lowest level of inactivation occurred at low RH (
 <italic>e.g</italic>., 20%). The results show that high numbers of TGEV and MHV may survive for days on surfaces at ATs and RHs typical of indoor environments. Both viruses were inactivated more rapidly at 40 °C than at 20 °C.
