<p>HuCoV-229E on copper and copper alloy surfaces was inactivated by released copper ion and reactive oxygen species, resulting in irreversible fragmentation of the viral genome, which was visibly confirmed by morphological changes under transmission electron microscopy. The rate of inactivation was directly proportional to the percentage of copper. Coronavirus was inactivated in 40 min on brass and 120 min on copper nickels containing less than 70% copper. Brass containing at least 70% (
