<p>Metal containing copper may demonstrate antiviral activity. Two metal catalysts, Ag/Al

 <sub>3</sub> and Cu/Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, can inhibit the transmission of SARS and other respiratory infectious diseases[
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Two metal catalysts, Ag/Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> and Cu/Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub>, were pressed into wafers. One hundred μL 10
 <sup>6</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL SARS-CoV, 100μL 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/mL recombinant baculovirus expressing hamster's prion protein, and roughly 10
 <sup>6</sup>
 <italic> E. coli</italic> were slowly dropped onto the surfaces of the catalyst wafers and exposed for 5 min and 20 min, respectively. The infectivity of SARS-CoV in Vero cells and baculovirus in Sf9 cells dropped down to a very low and undetectable level, with no colony detected using a bacterial culture method. The expression of hamster's prion protein reduced to 21.8% in the preparation of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus after exposing for 5 min, and was undetectable after exposing for 20 min. Bacterial membranes seemed to be cracked and the cytoplasm seemed to be effluent from cell bodies. Exposures to the surfaces of Ag/Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> and Cu/Al
 <sub>2</sub>O
 <sub>3</sub> for 5-20 min can destroy the replication and propagation abilities of SARS-CoV, baculovirus, and
