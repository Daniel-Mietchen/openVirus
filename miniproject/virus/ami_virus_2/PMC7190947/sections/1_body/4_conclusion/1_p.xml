<p>The most common nosocomial coronaviruses may well survive or persist on inanimate surfaces for up to a month. The risk of transmission

SARS-CoV-2 could exist in the air in poorly ventilated buses for at least 30 min. Absorbent materials like cotton are safer than nonabsorptive materials for protection from viral infection. Proper preventive strategies such as washing hands and wearing masks are critical for containing COVID-19.
