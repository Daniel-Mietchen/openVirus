<p id="Par21">The following shortlist represents key areas where our limited knowledge should merit further scientific research: (1) correlation of previous medication use (especially ACE inhibitors) and disease progression in the groups of patients associated with high-comorbidity risks; (2) characterizing the immunological profile (multiple immunophenotyping, but also assessment of cytokine production profiles especially during early phases of the disease, prior to acute lung injury) of patients at risk for developing 
 <italic>acute respiratory distress syndrome</italic> (ARDS); (3) influence of genomic differences between coronaviruses related to both structural (glyco)proteins and non-structural proteins, on the epidemiology and pathogenicity of these viruses, in particular on the infectivity, the speed of virus production and shedding and the biochemical entry routes with the host cells. Also the immunological reactions to these viral-host interactions by the host immune system are of primary importance. The latter route may also become very instructive for directing vaccine development to this 2019-nCoV.
