<p id="Par20">To summarize the present paper, a few highlights will be listed. However, this paper is not about how to organize a state of medical emergency, and neither about how to organize the production of masks and other protective clothing, nor about providing sufficient beds and electric fans for breathing machines. It is an attempt to summarize the present state-of-knowledge and in particular to understand the missing gaps in our knowledge of this pandemic. It appears that understanding this pandemic requires not only the knowledge of virologists, epidemiologists, intensive care physicians, immunologists and specialists of the interactions between the viral genomes and our human biochemistry, but the knowledge of all of them, together!</p>
