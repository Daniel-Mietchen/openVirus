<p id="Par14">After some initial optimism, suggesting the potential usefulness of ACE-inhibitors and/or AT
 <sub>1</sub>R inhibitors to build protection against severe lung damage (Weiss and Leibowitz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>), recent experimental findings have raised some doubts (Ferrario et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>) or cautioned against its use as prophylactic medication (Sommerstein 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>). Given the increased vulnerability of patients with age and the widespread use of ACE-inhibitors, more research into the epidemiological relation between the use of ACE-inhibitors and 2019-nCoV-related ARDS is needed. To our opinion, this should become prioritized in global public health research related to COVID-19.
