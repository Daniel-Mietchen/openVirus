<p id="Par11">The pharmacology of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its physiological role and relationship with 
 <italic>acute respiratory distress syndrome</italic> (ARDS), already have been studied extensively (Imai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>). ARDS is known as a very severe, life-threatening form of 
 <italic>acute lung injury</italic> (ALI). Many pathogenic conditions have been found to trigger ARDS, not only SARS and COVID-19, but also pathogens like Anthrax, Spanish flu virus and H5N1 avian influenza virus (Rubenfeld et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>). However, the association of binding of the coronavirus spike glycoprotein (S) with ACE2, and subsequent catalytic cleavage in the endosome (at low pH, involving cathepsin L and a second leu-peptin-sensitive-like cleavage in the case of SARS-CoV) (Weiss and Leibowitz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>), so far is characteristic for only a few members of the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus (see also Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>).
