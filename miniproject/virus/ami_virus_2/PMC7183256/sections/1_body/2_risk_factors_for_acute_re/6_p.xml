<p id="Par15">During the SARS pandemic, it appeared that the SARS-CoV spike protein (S) was a primary factor in determining the virulence of the attack, “beyond its role in viral attachment and cell entry”(Weiss and Leibowitz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>). Experiments in vitro using mouse heart cells, moreover, have shown the downregulation of ACE2, following viral inflammation and viral replication in the myocardium cells (Weiss and Leibowitz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>). This suggests that also cardiac infection could contribute to SARS mortality (Oudit et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>). Similarly, ACE-inhibition may influence renal function and interstitial renal damage following SARS infection (Hamming 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>). Also during the COVID-19 epidemic in China, chronic kidney diseases also have constituted a high co-morbidity factor comparable to the comorbidity associated with diabetes, following the highest comorbidity associated with hypertension (Guan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). The combination of lung, cardiac and/or renal failure creates a fatal mixture at intensive care hospitals, when SARS patients often were already in their third week of illness and symptoms of viral infection were declining (Weiss and Leibowitz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>).
