<p id="Par13">Similarly, in a large Chinese study, also other groups with impaired lung functioning, like patients with 
 <italic>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</italic> (COPD), have shown to constitute an important risk with high co-morbidity rate when infected with this new coronavirus (Guan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). To these potential risk groups, also patients with 
 <italic>fibrotic lung</italic> developments following several (auto) immune disorders (like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], scleroderma, etcetera) and other etiologies causing impaired lung functioning, may be added. The importance of resident lung macrophages in keeping a tolerant immune state of the lungs, in order to strongly inhibit local T cell responses, has been noted for a considerable time (Holt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1994</xref>). During inflammation, a ‘protective’ immune reaction is raised, involving T cell reactions directed to the lungs (Holt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1994</xref>). However, obviously, insufficient knowledge is available enabling us to link the activated characteristics of a patient’s immune system and the risk of developing ARDS following infection with 2019 nCoV. Similar to the risk of developing allergic disorders, too little information is yet applicable on the importance of a T-helper-2-type responsiveness (tolerogenic) versus a T-helper-1-type responsiveness (inflammatory reaction) in the immune reactions to these viral infections (Allaerts and Chang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2017</xref>).
