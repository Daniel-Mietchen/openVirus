<p id="Par3">This paper aims at summarizing the information already available concerning the etiology, genomic background and epidemiology of COVID-19. In particular, similarities and differences observed in related species of the Coronaviridae (order Nidovirales), especially of the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, and most predominantly the 
 <italic>SARS</italic>-
 <italic>related Rhinolophus bat coronavirus</italic> (SARSr BaCoV HKU3) and 
 <italic>SARS</italic>-
 <italic>related human coronavirus</italic> (SARS CoV Urbani) (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>) are helpful to understand the pathogenicity of this new coronavirus. The COVID-19 pandemic strongly recalls characteristics of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2002â€“2003, and therefore has been called SARS-CoV-2 in many studies too. However, especially the differences between SARS, Influenza and COVID-19 are crucial to comprehend the divergent epidemiology and pathogenicity of these diseases (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>; Weiss and Leibowitz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>). Moreover, the etiology of pneumonia in these diseases and important correlations between SARS-related and COVID-19-related ARDS are summarized in Sect.
