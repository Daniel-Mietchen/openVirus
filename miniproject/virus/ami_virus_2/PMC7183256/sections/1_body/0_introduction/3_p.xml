<p id="Par4">From the early phases of the outbreak of COVID-19 it has been noted that people above the age of 60 years belong to a high risk group for developing fatal organ failure, especially due to lung damage. In some countries, the age level for high risk patients was set at 70 (e.g. in the United Kingdom). Whereas the overall Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) from a large Chinese study group was determined as 2.3% (The Novel Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>), it was clear that higher CFR’s were found in elder people. An alternative to expressing the fatality of the coronavirus diseases in terms of CFR is to calculate the 
 <italic>standard expected years of life lost</italic> (SEYLL index) (Salamatbakhsh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2019</xref>). Important co-morbidities were ascribed to hypertension (CFR 6.0%), diabetes (CFR 7.3%), cardiovascular disease (CFR 10.5%) and age above 70 (CFR 10.2%) (Novel Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). Due to the association of at least two of these co-morbidities with the widely prescribed use of ACE-inhibitors—for instance used for blocking the angiotensin-receptor (ATR) in order to lower blood pressure (for hypertensive and cardiac patients altogether)-, the risks of developing ARDS in these patient groups should be considered with highest priority. So far, only animal experiments have documented that ACE-inhibitors can significantly increase mRNA expression of cardiac ACE2 (Ferrario et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>), but some already caution for using ACE inhibitors as potential risk factor (Sommerstein 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>). It is concluded that all possible public health protection measures for these category of patients, in addition to the infectivity measures against spreading the COVID-19 virus among all age groups, need our highest priority attention.
