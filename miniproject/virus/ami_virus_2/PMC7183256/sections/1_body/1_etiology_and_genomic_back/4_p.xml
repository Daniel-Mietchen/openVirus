<p id="Par8">Genomic analysis of the 2019-nCoV and closely related coronaviruses already has revealed a number of important differences (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). In order to understand the impact of these differences on pathogenicity and epidemiology, it is important to have access to the genomic structure of the virus RNA (See Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>; International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>). First a distinction is made in genes coding for structural (glyco)proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) forming a common backbone in many groups of the Nidovirales: these include the spike glycoprotein (S), the membrane glycoprotein (M), the envelope protein (E), the nucleocapsid protein (N) and the hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein (HE). However, the latter HE is absent from both SARSr human CoV, and from SARSr bat CoV as well as from 2019-nCoV (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In other members of the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus, like in 
 <italic>Human coronavirus</italic> HKU1 (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>), HE is important for reversible attachment of virions to O-acetylated sialic acids, by acting both as a lectin and as a sialate-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetylesterase. This however is not the case in neither SARS nor 2019-nCoV. Also for the relatively innocuous 
 <italic>Human coronavirus</italic> OC43 (causing only a mild cold), it is suggested that 9-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetylated sialic acid is the primary attachment factor, and not the ACE2 receptor (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>). Sialic acid plays an important role in cellular recognition and ganglioside metabolism, and is found as a common modification at the outside of glycoproteins. For instance, the 9-
 <italic>O</italic>-acetylation of these sialoglycans has been shown to play a role in host–pathogen interactions with functional implications in the immune system (like impaired binding of influenza A and B, but at the same time creating a receptor for influenza C) (Baumann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>).
