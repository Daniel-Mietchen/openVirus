<p id="Par6">In the etiology of late phase severe lung damage, an important role is played by the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as well as by lymphocytic inflammatory responses (Weiss and Leibowitz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>). It has been known for a while that ACE2 is involved in acute lung injury in mice (Imai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>) and that ACE2 is a receptor of the spike (S) glycoprotein of both Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV-2)—also a 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> causing virulent pneumonia—and SARS-related CoV (Weiss and Leibowitz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>). The importance of this ACE2 receptor for cellular infectivity of the virus is strengthened by the finding that no amino acid substitutions have been found in the corresponding genome region of 2019-nCoV, compared with the receptor-binding motifs that directly interact with human ACE2 as recognized in the SARS-CoV genome (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). Meanwhile, it has been demonstrated that 2019-nCoV uses the same ACE2 receptor—similar to the SARS-coronavirus receptor ACE2—and the cellular protease TMPRSS2 for entry into target cells (Hoffmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). Moreover, ACE2 expression is very predominant in both Type 1 and Type 2 alveolar pneumocytes of the human lung, as well as in the intestine and kidney (Turner
