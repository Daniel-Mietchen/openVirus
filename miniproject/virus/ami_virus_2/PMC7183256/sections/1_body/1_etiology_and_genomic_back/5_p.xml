<p id="Par9">Beside the structural (glyco)proteins, an important number of non-structural proteins are generated from the virus genome, with a variety of functions like degradation of host mRNAs, polyprotein processing and association with replicase/transcriptase complexes (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>). In the so-called 
 <italic>open reading frames</italic> (ORF 1ab and ORF 1a), both situated at the 5′-terminus of the genome of 2019-nCoV—as well as in most 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genomes-, a number of 
 <italic>non</italic>-
 <italic>structural proteins</italic> (nsps) are encoded (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2012</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). In 2019-nCoV the first ORF represents 67% of the entire genome, being transcribed into so-called polyproteins that are further processed into 16 nsps (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). Beside a number of differences in the nsps encoding ORF, also in the eight so-called accessory proteins that are encoded in ORF’s near the 3′ end of the genome, important differences have been noted between 2019-nCoV and SARS-like coronaviruses (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). However, a lot of research and time will be needed to understand how these differences may affect the pathogenicity and epidemiology of 2019-nCoV: this precious time, unfortunately, might not be available for a large proportion of our population.
