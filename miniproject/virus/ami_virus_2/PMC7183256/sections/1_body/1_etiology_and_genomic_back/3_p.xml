<p id="Par7">In contrast to the former examples of 
 <italic>Betacoronaviruses</italic> (MHV-2, SARSrCoV and 2019 nCoV), in the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Toosy and O’Sullivan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017</xref>) a different cell entry of the MERS-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was discovered: namely the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) (Raj et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). The epidemiology of MERS is quite different from that seen in SARS (Toosy and O’Sullivan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017</xref>) and also from COVID-19. The receptor for viral entry, DPP4 (CD26) is for instance expressed in cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Moreover, DPP4 is expressed on epithelial and endothelial cells of most human organ tissues (in ex vivo studies using human culture lines), suggesting this may account for the multisystem clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection (Turner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2015</xref>). Although also MERS has been associated with a coronavirus lineage present in Vesper bats (in particular 
 <italic>Pipistrellus hesperidus</italic>, Vespertilionidae) in Uganda, there was a high divergence of the S protein nucleotide sequence compared with a MERS-CoV S protein sequence (Anthony et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>). This suggests that the viruses are different and-although bats are the plausible evolutionary source of MERS CoV—another intermediate mammalian reservoir species is probably responsible for transmission of MERS to humans (Turner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2015</xref>). This appears to be the wild population of Dromedary camels in the Arabian Peninsula, as well as in North and East Africa. It is suggested that the limited geographic distribution of MERS-CoV is related to the distribution of these dromedary camels (DCs). When DCs are infected, MERS-CoV causes only a mild, transient upper respiratory tract disease (Turner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2015</xref>).
