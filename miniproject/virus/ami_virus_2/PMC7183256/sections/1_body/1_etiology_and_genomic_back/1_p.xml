<p id="Par5">Initial genomic analysis has shown a close evolutionary association with the SARS-like bat coronaviruses (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). This relationship is confirmed by 96% genomic similarity of the full-length genome sequence of the COVID-19 virus with a SARS-like coronavirus strain derived from 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bat (BatCoV RaTG13) (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). Only recently it was shown that genomic recombination from the Chinese Greater Horseshoe bat 
 <italic>(R. sinicus)</italic> was at the onset of the SARS outbreak (Lau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>). Similar to the SARS outbreak of 2002â€“2003, the viral tropism towards the respiratory system is striking, but the timing of the highly infective phases of the disease are also very different from SARS. The very high human-to-human infectivity of COVID-19 and resulting pneumonia, has been documented following close surveillance of pneumonia in a family cluster, early during the Wuhan epidemic (Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>).
