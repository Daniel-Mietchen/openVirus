<p id="Par19">Also the idea of acquiring immunity after recovering from the disease is a hopeful prospect, but a dangerously flawed idea for the risk groups with high CFR’s (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). Without detailed knowledge of the etiology of the late immune responses causing vital organ failure and high numbers of fatalities, classical models do not answer these unfamiliar diseases (Allaerts 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>). Technically, models based on incorporating acquired-immunity during the spreading of an epidemic, may become flawed in the case of SARS and COVID-19, because of a misinterpretation of the totality of immune reactions involved (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref>). Whether or not alternative models based on different mathematical distributions (Allaerts 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>) are better suited, is too early to decide at this stage of the pandemic. Also the WHO-report (World Health Organization 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>) cautions, because, so far it is unknown how immunity against 2019-nCoV will become built up by the recovered patients. Besides, the potentially high risk of a frequently mutating virus-pool—changing its antigenic properties in the course of the seasons ahead—may dampen our optimism, despite the worldwide efforts to raise a vaccine against this new COVID-19. For comparison, the MERS epidemic resulted from a mutation in the pool of bat coronaviruses around 2012 (Toosy and O’Sullivan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017</xref>), whereas also the new bat related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 appeared in a time span of only two decades (2002–2019).
