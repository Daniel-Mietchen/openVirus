<p id="Par16">One of the cardinal questions related to this new burden of coronavirus-related diseases is how humanity will deal with it, apart from the questions of how recurrent pandemics would influence the world economy, the demography and migration patterns and finally also the world climate system. But none of these questions may find an answer without acknowledging the moral connotations involved in these questions. I choose not to go in that direction and rather confine what we may learn from the present and past pandemics/epidemics.</p>
