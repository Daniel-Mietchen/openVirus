<p id="Par17">In the case of MERS, yearly recurrent episodes of epidemics were registered since the first outbreak in 2012. Also here the CFR was very high, namely 36% (690 fatalities of a total of 1936 WHO-confirmed cases) (Toosy and O’Sullivan

An outspoken difference between MERS and 2019-nCoV is the limited distribution of the MERS epidemic, predominantly occurring in the Arabic peninsula, with one significant exception: this was the MERS outbreak in the Republic of (South) Korea in May–July 2015 (Toosy and O’Sullivan
