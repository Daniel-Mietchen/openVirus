<p id="Par18">Although the following results are still premature, recent studies at Erasmus MC in Rotterdam suggest that the increased infectivity of the 2019 nCoV, for instance compared with the SARS pandemic, may result from a much higher rate of virus shedding from the upper respiratory organs, especially from the nasal epithelium. Nearly 3Â months after the outbreak of this new pandemic, it is way too early to draw firm conclusions from these observations. Also it is rather early to draw conclusions about a possible seasonal influence of the new virus. A possible seasonality dependence however has been suggested for other coronaviruses, e.g. causing the seasonal cold (like the 
 <italic>Human coronavirus</italic> OC43), and the viruses causing influenza and other viral diseases (Martinez

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). However, suggestions of the ideal humidity conditions in the air and airways, are very speculative and may constitute a dangerously biased surmise of protection. If physical parameters would offer such a degree of protection, by lowering the infectivity rate, this could only become noted after several seasons of the pandemic have passed.
