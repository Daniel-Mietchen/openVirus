  <p>Schematic diagram representing the role of the renin-angiotensin system in acute lung failure and proposed SARS-CoV action during infection (© 2008 The Physiological Society) (adapted from Imai et al. 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>).“In acute lung injury, such as acid aspiration, pneumonia or scepsis, the generation of Ang II from Ang I is enhanced by ACE, and Ang II induces acute lung failure through stimulation of AT
   <sub>1</sub>R while ACE2 and AT2R negatively regulate this pathway and protect from acute lung failure. In contrast, SARS-CoV infection is mediated through binding of the SARS Spike Protein to ACE2 (…) and downregulates the protective molecule ACE2, thus leading to severe lung injury and acute lung failure” (cited from Imai et al. 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>) (A possible, alternative route via L-SIGN, i.e. the liver/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing nonintegrin, may result in a similar clinical outcome)
