<p>Two sections of supplemental material are associated with this manuscript. The first section describes the calculation used to transform data from the two qRT-PCR assays into estimates of numbers of both wild-type EBOV-Ecran and defective virus DG-d1. The second section consists of a single figure that visualized the sources of residual error on the efficacy assay.</p>
