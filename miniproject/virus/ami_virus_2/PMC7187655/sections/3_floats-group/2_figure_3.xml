  <p>The release of defective genomes. 2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> Vero c1008 cells were infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub> infectious units of EBOV strain Ecran (~1 × 10
   <sup>12</sup> genomes) for 2 h then washed. The cells were then transfected with 1 μg of DG-d1 RNA for 4 h. The cells were then incubated. Samples of the cells at time 0 and supernatant at 48 h post infection were taken. The viral genomes (defective and wild-type) were enumerated using qRT-PCR. The graph shows the count of each viral type (wild-type and DG-d1) within the cells at the onset of the experiment and the counts of viral type in the extracellular space after 48 h. Each data point is the geometric mean (± 95% confidence intervals) of 3 independent experiments, where each experiment is the geometric mean of 3 replicates generated from independent wells within the same experiment. Where EBOV Ecran was measured, black lines link the data points and the gray circles indicate non-transfected control infected cells, the red circles indicate infected cells transfected with control RNA and the blue circles indicate the infected cells transfected with DG-d1. Where the DG-d1 was measured, the green lines link the data points and the green circles indicate the infected cells transfected with DG-d1 and the yellow circles indicate uninfected cells transfected with DG-d1.
