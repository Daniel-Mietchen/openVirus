<p>In order to investigate the effect of defective genomes on viral biology two candidates were chosen from a study that identified and characterized DIs in cell culture. Data was used from previously published work (Calain et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) to synthetically recreate two defective genome clones DG-d1 and DG-d2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The cDNA of these molecules was cloned into a plasmid backbone for amplification. The DI sequence was flanked by a T7 promoter for synthesis of RNA and a HDV ribozyme and T7 terminator to ensure near authentic 3′ and 5′ termini.
