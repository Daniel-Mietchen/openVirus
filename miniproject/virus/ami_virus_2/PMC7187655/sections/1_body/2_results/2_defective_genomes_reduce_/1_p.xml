<p>In order to evaluate the potential for defective genomes to reduce viral progeny, Vero C1008 cells were infected with EBOV-Ecran. After infection, the cells were washed and transfected with the defective genome. Some wells of cells were harvested at this stage (6 h post exposure to virus and 4 h post exposure to defective genome RNA) to assess how much of virus and RNA had entered the cells. Later, after 48 h, more samples were taken from the supernatant to evaluate how much virus had been released. Under initial conditions, no evidence was found for differences in EBOV-Ecran wild-type viral uptake between cells exposed to the different RNA molecule (none, control or defective genome; when measured by qRT-PCR). The qRT-PCR assay used here targets a sequence in the L gene that is not encoded by the defective genomes. This makes cross reactivity highly unlikely. Moreover, this assay does not give signal in control groups where cells were transfected with defective genomes and but not infected by virus. A strong correlation was observed between the uptake (measured by qRT-PCR) in the non-transfected and RNA transfected controls (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplemental Figure 3</xref>). A partial correlation analysis was performed comparing uptake data to the output data (48 h later), where the analysis controlled for the treatment group effects. This analysis did not suggest that any variation in uptake influenced viral output (
