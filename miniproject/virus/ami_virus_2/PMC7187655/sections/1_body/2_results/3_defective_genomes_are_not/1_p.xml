<p>One of the potential strengths of using DIPs as a therapeutic is that they might parasitize wild type virus to propagate. In this way their pharmacokinetics may self-regulate (or self-propagate) to the requirement (the level of infection occurring). This is less feasible when considering EBOV due to the remarkable speed by which EBOV blocks “super-infection;” however, this is very much still a point of interest. We hypothesized that there are two mechanisms by which these defective genomes might interfere with viral replication. Firstly, the defective genomes might be replicated, sequestering and using resources for the replication of wild-type genomes. Secondly, the defective genomes might parasitize viral proteins. Additionally, it is possible that both of these assertions are correct. It is important to evaluate which (if either) of these are likely to be true. In order to assess the potential for the deletion defective genomes to propagate alongside the wild-type virus, a qRT-PCR method was developed where one primer recognizes only the unique fusion sequence of defective genome DG-d1. Cross-reactivity of this assay is highly unlikely. This fusion sequence does not exist in wild-type virus. Moreover, this assay does not give signal in control groups where cells were infected with wild-type virus but not transfected with defective genomes. We were not able to develop a similar assay for DG-d2. The assay was used to analyse the samples from three of the experiments shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. Importantly, the transfection efficiency for DG-d1 was similar to the infection efficacy. The transfection reactions had placed similar numbers of defective genomes into the cells as EBOV genomes had managed to infect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). We found that the numbers of defective genomes in the released supernatant were several orders of magnitude lower than that of the released EBOV genomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, the numbers of defective genomes in the supernatant were not different when comparing the cells that were transfected by defective genome only and cells that were co-infected by both EBOV and transfected defective genomes.
