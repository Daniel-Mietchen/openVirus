<p>Twenty-four well plates were seeded with Vero C1008 cells at 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL (1 mL/well). EBOV-Ecran was added to the cells at an MOI = 5 and after 2 h incubation at 37°C/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> the supernatant was removed. Transfection was performed following the manufacturer's instructions with 2.5 μL Lipofectamine 2000® (Invitrogen) and 1 μg RNA (defective genome or control RNA, at 500 ng/μL, produced in this study) in a final volume of 500 μL Optimem Reduced Serum media (Fisher Scientific). After addition of the transfection reagents, cells were incubated for 4 h at 37°C/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and then washed twice with tissue culture media and 1 mL of media was added to each well. Supernatant samples were collected and used for viral enumeration by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay and RNA extractions. Samples were collected 6 h and 48 h after EBOV-Ecran infection.
