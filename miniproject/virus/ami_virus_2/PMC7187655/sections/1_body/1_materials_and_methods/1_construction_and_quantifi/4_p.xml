<p>The DG-d1 genomes were quantified using a bespoke PCR methodology. The reverse transcription (RT) step was done using a SuperScript™ IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher – 18091050) and gene-specific primers (forward = TTGAACCTGAAAACGAAAGGAGTCC, reverse = AGCCCAGACCTATCGTTAAAGC) following the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher; UK). A mixture of 1 μg of RNA from the samples was mixed with 20 μM of DG-d1 or primers, 2 μL of 10 mM dNTP mix and completed with Diethyl pyrocarbonate -treated water up to 13 μL. The mixture was then incubated at 65°C for 5 min, then cooled on ice for 1 min and 8 μl of the cDNA synthesis mix was added (4 μL of 5X Super Script IV buffer, 1 μl of DTT (100 mM), 1 μl of Ribonuclease Inhibitor, and 1 μL of SuperScript

 </sup> IV Reverse Transcriptase). The mixture was incubated at 55°C for 10 min and finally 1 μL of RNaseH was added to the mixture and incubated at 37°C for 20 min. To do the Real-time PCR, an iTaq™ Universal SYBR® Green Supermix (BIO-RAD, 1725120) was used following the instructions of the manufacturer. Several controls were used for this, including RNA from DG-d1 (for the RT step) and a DG-d2 plasmid with Pol1 Promoter (PCR control). The conditions for the Real-time PCR were 1 step at 95°C for 2 min and 30 steps at 95°C for 30 s, then 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s.
