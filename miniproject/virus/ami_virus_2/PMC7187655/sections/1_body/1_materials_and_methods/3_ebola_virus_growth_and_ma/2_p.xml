 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Briefly, virus was 10-fold serially diluted in 96-well plates of Vero C1008 cells. After 1 week of incubation at 37°C/5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, all wells were observed under the microscope and scored for presence or absence of cytopathic effects. The 50% end-point was then calculated using the method of Reed and Muench (
