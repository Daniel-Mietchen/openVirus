<p>Here we have explored the impact that defective genomes of EBOV might offer by considering their therapeutic potential, in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> infection studies as synthetic constructs. It is obviously not conceivable to use the high passage mixed population of virus and DIP observed by Calain et al. (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) because of safety issues associated with an uncharacterised population containing real virus. For this reason nucleic acid synthesis and molecular biology were used to recreate and evaluate the therapeutic potential of two of the defective genomes that Calain et al. (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) characterized.
