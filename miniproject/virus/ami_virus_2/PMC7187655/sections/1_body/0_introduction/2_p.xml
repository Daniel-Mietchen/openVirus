<p>Viral defective interfering particles (DIPs) were first described in the 1950's in influenza virus (Gard et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1952</xref>). DIPs are viral particles capable of translocating between cells but, they contain defective genomes. The defective genomes are unable to reproduce themselves or manufacture all the proteins required for viral assembly. DIPs can, however, replicate when co-infected with wild-type virus, potentially to the detriment of the wild-type virus by sequestering cellular resources and viral proteins. In the mononegavirales (a family of viruses where genomes are encoded by a single negative strand of RNA and of which EBOV is a member), defective genomes spontaneously arise due to incorrect amplification of the genome. The first DIPs in mononegavirales were found in vesicular stomatitis virus Indiana strain (Huang and Baltimore, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>). There are thought to be two main types of defective genome. Deletion defective genomes arise where a fusion event occurs between the 3' and 5' ends of the genome, possibly where a loop has formed. The result is a genome with (normally) large regions of coding sequence being deleted but with the 3' and 5' ends intact (Resende Rde et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). Copy-back defective genomes are believed to form when the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) copies back onto the strand under construction. The result is a genome with the same origin of replication at both ends; one in sense and one in anti-sense. These are usually the wild-type's 5' end (in antisense form) because genomic replication is heavily biased for antisense to sense replication (Schubert and Lazzarini, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>).
