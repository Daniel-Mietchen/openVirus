  <p>Types of habitats that may limit or facilitate interaction between hosts that can potentially establish an emergent infection in a local habitat. In separate habitats, contacts are restricted while in overlapping habitats, contacts are facilitated. In most cases, habitats cannot be reduced to the standard extremes, and are multicomponent habitats with various degrees of complexity. See text for implications for viral emergences.</p>
