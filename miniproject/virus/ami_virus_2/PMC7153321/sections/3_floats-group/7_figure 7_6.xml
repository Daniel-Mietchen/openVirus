  <p>Stability of selected mutant subpopulations when selective pressure is removed. This scheme is the same portrayed in Fig. 3.6 of Chapter 3, but shifted toward the right of the time scale. Five different colors have been chosen to depict fluctuations of four genomic classes. In a real population, thousands of genomes may be involved in each infected cell. In the present diagram, the red line represents genomes selected for their resistance to neutralizing monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Once the antibody pressure is removed, the mutant genomes may remain dominant either because the relevant substitutions do not affect viral fitness or because compensatory mutations have been acquired (top diagram). In contrast, upon removal of the antibody pressure, the proportion of selected genomes may fade with time due to a fitness cost and absence of compensatory mutations (bottom diagram). In the latter case, the antibody-resistant mutant will not contribute to the long-term antigenic diversification of the virus.</p>
