  <p>Inverse correlation between the time between viral isolations for consensus sequence determination, and the calculated rate of evolution. Animals sustain the replication (inside curved arrow) of a virus that will be transmitted to a susceptible animal. The time that the virus spends outside an animal (absence of replication) is depicted by a horizontal arrow. The time of virus isolation is given by 
   <italic>t</italic>1, 
   <italic>t</italic>2, and 
   <italic>t</italic>3. The number of nucleotide differences in the virus isolates relative to the sequence of the initial reference virus (from the animal on the left) is given by 
   <italic>d</italic>1, 
   <italic>d</italic>2, and 
   <italic>d</italic>3 (vertical arrows). Because of the increasing periods of stasis (addition of horizontal arrows), calculated rates of evolution given by the 
   <italic>d</italic>/
   <italic>t</italic> ratio will be higher the shorter the time interval between isolations. See text for additional models of time effects of evolutionary rates, and references.
