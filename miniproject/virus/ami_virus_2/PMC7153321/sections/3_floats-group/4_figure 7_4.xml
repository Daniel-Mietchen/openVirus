  <p>Scheme of a possible mechanism for faster intrahost than interhost virus evolution. Transmission events are represented by long arrows and intrahost evolution by short arrows (middle of the picture). The virus in the person on the left (black outline) has evolved to generate a complex mutant spectrum. However, only a subset of genomes are efficiently transmitted to the recipient person (brown outline). The virus in the recipient person evolves toward a complex mutant spectrum. Again, in this new mutant spectrum, only a minor set of genomes that resemble the ones in the first transmission is efficiently transmitted to the third person (green outline). The net result is that because at each transmission the genomes related to those that first entered the previous host have an advantage, rates of evolution will appear as slower than those within each host. Boxes at the bottom summarize the major event at each step. See text for additional related mechanisms and references.</p>
