  <p>Relevance of virus population size and mutant spectrum composition in the zoonotic transmission of a virus. Only a subset of the genomes that surface an infected pig may be able to establish an infection in humans. The scheme indicates that a single genome that reached a human was not adequate to establish infection (pathway A). When multiple genomes reached the human (pathways B and C), only those that included a subset that displayed a minimum fitness in humans were able to initiate an infection and expand in the new host (pathway B). For pathways A and C, events are as if the contact between donor and recipient host had not taken place (arrows with cross). See text for implications.</p>
