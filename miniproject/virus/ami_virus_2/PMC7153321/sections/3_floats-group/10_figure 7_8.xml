 <caption>
  <p>Visualization of the complexity of mutant spectra (haplotype composition) of five isolates of WNV denoted by c, d, e, f, and g (magenta bars) that have identical consensus sequence. The color lines connect the genomes where the same single nucleotide change occurs. Similarly, color-coded ribbons indicate that the same mutation occurs in two genomes in the same position. Nucleotide positions are numbered next to the outer rim of the circle.</p>
