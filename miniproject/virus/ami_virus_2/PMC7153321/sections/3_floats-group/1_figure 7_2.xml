  <p>Displacement of a virus variant by another in the field by virtue of the latter displaying a higher 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub> value. The competing viruses are depicted as horizontal lines with a distinctive symbol. Differences in 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub> recapitulate part of the determinants of epidemiological fitness (Section 5.9 in Chapter 5). Concepts of competition among clones or populations within infected host organisms or cell cultures, treated in previous chapters, can be extended at the epidemiological level, with the appropriate choice of the key parameters. References are given in the text.
