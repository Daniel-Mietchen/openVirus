  <p>Evolution of a major antigenic site of FMDV over 4 decades. The sequence at the top is that of amino acid residues 129–151 of capsid protein VP1 of FMDV C2 Pando, isolated in Uruguay in 1944. Key amino acid positions did not diverge in a linear fashion and isolates over 4 decades displayed only two types of amino acid residues at each position. See text for possible mechanisms and references.</p>
