<p id="p0500">There is evidence that some viruses that once produced human disease might be now extinct. One example is provided by a putative viral agent of Economo’s disease (also termed lethargic encephalitis or epidemic encephalitis), a degenerative disease of the brain that produced a loss of neurons. The disease had an acute phase of variable duration and intensity, followed by a chronic phase, sometimes with a late onset of symptoms. The disease showed a seasonal character with a maximum incidence in late winter. The first cases were recorded in Eastern Europe in 1915, and the disease was first described by Baron C. Von Economo in Vienna in 1917. During 1920–23 the disease attained pandemic proportions, although the number of cases and mortality were limited. It was estimated that between 1917 and 1929, about 100,000 cases occurred in Germany and Great Britain, and then mysteriously, the number of cases decreased, and the disease disappeared (

At the time it was suspected that a virus similar to IV or some picornavirus might have been the etiological agent of this disease, but no proof could be provided. Occasional cases of lethargic encephalitis are diagnosed, and there is evidence of a possible connection of the once epidemic disease agent with postencephalitic Parkinsonism (
