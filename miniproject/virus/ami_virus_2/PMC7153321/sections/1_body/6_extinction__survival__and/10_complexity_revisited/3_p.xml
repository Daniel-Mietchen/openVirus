<p id="p0595">The second level of complexity that can have an impact on the emergence of viral disease stems from the environmental, sociological, and ecological variables that must converge for a virus from some animal reservoir to come into contact and successfully infect a new host, for example, a human. Despite close surveillance, the emergences of viral diseases are unpredictable. Experts anticipate new influenza pandemics to arise somewhere in Asia from the avian reservoirs of IV; however, in 2009, the new influenza pandemic originated in Central America. Paradoxically, despite a general agreement that surveillance of human and zoonotic virus reservoirs should be intensified using new molecular tools (i.e., mutant spectrum analyses to go beyond the consensus sequences), the reality is that what we have learned are the reasons why viral emergences are unpredictable. The “abundant sources of genetic variation” that was emphasized by J. Lederberg (see 
 <xref rid="s0070" ref-type="sec">Section 7.7.1</xref>) should be extended to refer to “abundant sources of complexity in viral emergences.” For the time being, we have to be ready to react once the emergence has already occurred. Research funding agencies have a lot to do in favoring “reactive” rather than “preventive” antiviral policies.
