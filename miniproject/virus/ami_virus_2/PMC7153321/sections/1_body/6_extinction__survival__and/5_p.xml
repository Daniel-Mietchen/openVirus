<p id="p0505">There are additional examples of disease incidence decline that may be the prelude of virus extinction in some geographical areas. The alphavirus western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) was an important human and animal pathogen in the Americas during the first part of the 20th century. The number of isolations of WEEV both from vertebrate and insect species declined during the second half of the 20th century, and two main mechanisms have been proposed: (i) fitness decrease due to operation of Muller’s ratchet (concept described in Section 6.5 of Chapter 6), with elimination of virulence-associated mutations by genetic drift, or (ii) ecological factors such as decline of population numbers of susceptible host species, combined with increased vaccine coverage in horses (
