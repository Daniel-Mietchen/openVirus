<p id="p0510">FMDV, the agent of the economically most important disease of cattle and other farm animals circulated until recently as seven different serotypes termed A, O, C, Asia 1, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3, and each serotype as multiple subtypes and antigenic variants (review in 
 <xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">Sobrino and Domingo, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, in the 1980s, the incidence of serotype C FMDV decreased to the point that at the beginning of the 21st century this FMDV serotypes was considered nearly extinct and its eradication feasible. It cannot be totally excluded, however, that type C FMDV is replicating in some persistently infected ruminant in some remote part of our planet and that the virus reemerges again. If not, its ecological niche has been occupied by FMDVs of other serotypes. This is one important issue behind virus eradication (smallpox in the late 1970s or rinderpest in 2011): the possibility that the niche left by an eradicated pathogen is occupied by a related pathogen. A.E. Gorbalenya, E. Wimmer, and colleagues examined the possible evolutionary origin of present-day PV, and that other picornaviruses might occupy the PV niche in the event of its eradication (
 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Jiang etÂ al., 2007</xref>). Their phylogenetic analysis suggests that PV could originate from a C-cluster coxsackie A virus through amino acid substitutions in the capsid that led to a change of receptor specificity (other cases are discussed in Chapter 4). They generated chimeras of PV and its putative ancestors, and some of them were viable and pathogenic for transgenic mice expressing the PV receptor. The authors suggest that in a world without antiPV neutralizing antibodies, coxsackieviruses may mutate to generate a new PV-like agent.
