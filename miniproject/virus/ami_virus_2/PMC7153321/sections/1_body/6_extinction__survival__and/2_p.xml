<p id="p0490">The viral groups defined by phylogenetic methods may or may not occupy a defined geographical location. It will depend on whether viral vectors or infected individuals carry the virus over long distances or not. A defined phylogenetic group may include viruses that produce similar or different pathology. This is because the capacity of a virus to cause disease may depend on modest genetic change (i.e., one or a few amino acid substitutions) that does not alter its position in a phylogenetic tree. It is important to emphasize that, independently of the time frame considered, the tips of phylogenetic trees are a cloud of mutants, that genomes within the cloud are the origin of future diversification pathways, and that individual cloud components may differ in pathogenic potential. 
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.7</xref> summarizes the diversification of HIV-1, since it entered the human population. Once HIV-1 originated from multiple introductions of a chimpanzee simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVcpz), the four major HIV-1 groups M, O, N, and P were generated, and group M evolved into the multiple subtypes and recombinant forms that circulate at present. Many factors determine the pathogenic potential of any of the HIV-1 subtypes and the newly arising recombinant forms. HIV-1 is a notorious case of successful emergence of a new viral pathogen from a zoonotic reservoir of a related virus. HIV-1 populations are extremely complex and in continuous evolution (
