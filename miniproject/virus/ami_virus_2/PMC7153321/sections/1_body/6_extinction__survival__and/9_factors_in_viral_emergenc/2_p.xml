<p id="p0525">New human viral pathogens emerge or reemerge at a rate of about one per year, representing an important concern for public health, alerting established and new organizations of the need of preparedness (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Brechot et al., 2018</xref>). Emergence is defined as the appearance of a new pathogen for a host, while reemergence often refers to the reappearance of a viral pathogen, following a period of absence. Being a popular topic, the reader will find numerous books and reviews on the subject. It is worth emphasizing that in the 20th century many authors took the lead in emphasizing the problem of viral emergences and the need to investigate the underlying mechanisms, notably S.S. Morse and J. Lederberg [see several chapters of 
 <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Morse, 1993</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Morse, 1994</xref>]. Given the adaptive capacity of viruses, in particular, the RNA viruses, the reader will certainly suspect that genetic variation of viruses must be one of the factors involved in viral emergences. Indeed, most of the high-impact new viral diseases recorded recently or historically are due to RNA viruses. A statement by J. Lederberg reflects our vulnerability in the face of the nearly unlimited potential of viruses to vary: “Abundant sources of genetic variation exist for viruses to learn new tricks, not necessarily confined to what happens routinely or even frequently” (
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Lederberg, 1993</xref>). The situation is even more complex because a genetic variation of viruses is only one of many ingredients that promote the introduction of new viral pathogens in the human population. A report issued by the U.S. Institute of Medicine in 2003, analyzed and documented 13 factors that, individually or in combination, participate in the emergence of microbial disease. They include a number of sociological, environmental, and ecological influences that act to promote the emergence and reemergence of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa (
