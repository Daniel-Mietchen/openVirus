<p id="p0570">Not only population numbers are important, but the connections between the spatial habitats of a potential donor and recipient hosts are also highly relevant (
 <xref rid="f0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.10</xref> ). As correctly emphasized by S.S. Morse, changes in viral traffic may allow viruses to come near potential new hosts that had never been encountered before. Several sociological and ecological factors that can impact directly or indirectly the accessibility to an infected donor play a role. A typical example that connects several of the points listed in 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 7.2</xref> is provided by the increase of arbovirus vectors during a humid season due to the climate change because insect larvae can proliferate on water reservoirs. Increased travel may put humans infected with arboviruses in contact with the flourishing insect vector population. Climate change may modify the migration routes of some birds, again putting these potential vertebrate hosts in contact with infected animals and insect vectors.
