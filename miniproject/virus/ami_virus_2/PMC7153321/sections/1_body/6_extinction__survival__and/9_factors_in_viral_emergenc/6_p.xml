<p id="p0560">Two population numbers are relevant to the establishment step: the number of infectious viral particles shed by the infected donor host, and the number of potential new hosts that come into contact with the infected donor. We are now aware that even if two viral populations shed by an infected host have an identical number of infectious particles, not all mutant spectra might have the genomes subpopulations to permit the establishment in the human host (
 <xref rid="f0050" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.9</xref> ). There is a natural lottery regarding which quasispecies subpopulations will hit which host. In the words of J.J. Holland and his colleagues: “Although new RNA virus diseases of humans will continue to emerge at indeterminate intervals, the viruses themselves will not really be new, but rather mutated and rearranged to allow infection of new hosts, or to cause new disease patterns. It is important to remember that every quasispecies genome swarm in an infected individual is unique and ‘new’ in the sense that no identical population of RNA genomes has ever existed before and none such will ever exist again” (
