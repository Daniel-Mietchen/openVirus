<p id="p0565">The number of infectious particles shed by an infected host determines the probability of transmission to susceptible hosts (

Viral population numbers and the number of transmissible particles can be largely amplified in immunocompromised individuals, and have been termed super-spreaders; they can contribute large amounts of variant viruses to the transmission lottery (

Concerning the recipient hosts, the higher the number of potentially susceptible hosts that come into contact with an infected donor, the higher the probability of establishment of an emergent infection. It is likely that the advent of agricultural practices some 10,000 years ago, combined with increased contacts between humans and animals, inaugurated a time of new viral emergences. In the new scenario, viruses could shift from a persistent (low interhost transmission) mode into an acute (high interhost transmission) infection mode.
