<p id="p0495">The relevance of the mutant cloud in determining viral fitness and survival was documented by comparing five isolates of West Nile virus (WNV) that had identical consensus sequences and differed in the mutant spectrum, as analyzed by dep sequencing (

 <xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.8</xref> ). The study concerned a WNV lineage 2 that circulated in Europe during the beginning of the 21st century. Environmental changes modified the haplotype composition while maintaining an invariant consensus sequence, an example of “perturbation” manifested only at the level of the mutant spectrum (see
