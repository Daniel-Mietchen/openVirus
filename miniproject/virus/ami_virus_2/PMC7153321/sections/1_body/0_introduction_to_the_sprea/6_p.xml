<p id="p0200">The presence of recognizable viral genomic sequences in present-day cellular DNA (
 <xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">Tomonaga etÂ al., 2019</xref>) suggests a history of long-term interaction between viruses and cells, in support of some models of virus origins that propose long coevolution between precellular and cellular entities with virus-like elements (Chapter 1). Despite the current capacity to amplify tiny amounts of viral nucleic acids for nucleotide sequence determinations, proposals on how long-term viral evolution might proceed have to be based mainly on the comparison of viral genomes and the structure of viral proteins from modern representatives of different virus groups. First, we should understand the basic concepts related to virus transmission, keeping in mind viral population numbers and the complexity of viral populations.
