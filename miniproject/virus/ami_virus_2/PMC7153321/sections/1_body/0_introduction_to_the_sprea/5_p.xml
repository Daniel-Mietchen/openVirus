<p id="p0195">Unfortunately, viruses have not left a fossil record (at least one that we can uncover with the available tools), since according to current paleontology, nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich molecules are unlikely to be protected in fossils older than 1 million years. At most, hundred to thousand years-old skeletal remains or frozen bodies that contain viruses have been analyzed, and sequences retrieved [(

Fortunately, there is a different historical record of ancient viral sequences in the DNA of differentiated organisms, in the form of integrated virus-like genetic elements. The research area that consists in rescuing ancestral viral sequences is termed paleo-virology, and it is providing information on viruses that circulated thousands of years or even millions of years ago in the case of viral sequences integrated into cellular DNA (
