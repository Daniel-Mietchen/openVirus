<p id="p0180">Intrahost virus replication and evolution are the first steps in the process of virus diversification that continue with successive virus transmission events that are a condition for long-term survival in nature. Viruses are perpetuated as a consequence of many rounds of persistent or acute infections, with possible extracellular stages in which genomes remain basically invariant. Despite lacking direct evidence, we presume that multitudes of successive transmissions have allowed viruses to survive at least for thousands of years, probably undergoing continuous genetic change. Picornavirologists are familiar with an Egyptian stela dated 1550â€“1333 BCE. (18th Egyptian dynasty) that portrays the image of a man with an atrophic leg probably a consequence of infection with poliovirus (PV) or a related virus (
