<p id="p0185">Viruses can be transmitted vertically or horizontally. Vertical transmission occurs from parental organisms to their offspring, and it includes infection through the germline in animals and plants, from the mother to the embryo during fetal development, and also postnatal transmission to the newborn via blood, milk, or contact (

We are most familiar with this type of transmission. It frequently gives rise to disease outbreaks (infection episodes localized in space and time that affect a few individuals), epidemics (that affect an ample geographical area and are often extended in time), and pandemics (that affect most areas of our planet), typically the periodic influenza pandemics.
