<p id="p0190">All transmission modes have probably contributed to the maintenance of viruses in our biosphere. Persistent infections are likely to have played a major role when the number of individual humans or animals living in close contact was limited throughout the pre-agricultural era, earlier than 10,000 years ago. A favorable climate change during the Holocene (the geological epoch that began at the end of the Pleistocene, around 12,000 years before the present; compare with Chapter 1) was probably an important driver toward large-scale domestication of plants and animals, 10,000–7000 years BCE. From the behavior of current viruses, there might have always been a dynamics of virus change for adaptability within individual hosts, and transmissions among animals or plants. The probability of transmission increased as host population numbers rose with agricultural practices and urban life in the last several thousand years. Intensive agriculture must have contributed to accelerated sequence space exploration by viruses with consequences for the emergence of viral disease (
 <xref rid="s0065" ref-type="sec">Section 7.7</xref>). Probably, there has been a continuous dynamics of viral emergences, reemergences, and extinctions with patterns that may be parallel to those observed in present-day viruses. Virology has existed as an organized scientific discipline with the possibility to isolate, store, and study viruses only for about one century. The challenge to reconstruct the events that might have led to viruses similar to the ones we isolate today was addressed in Chapter 1, with a critical first question being if viruses originated 4000 million years ago, or “only” 2000 million years ago (diagrams in Figs. 1.3 and 1.4, and Section 1.5 in Chapter 1). In this chapter, we are more modest in our aspirations, and we will analyze, with the tools of genomics, what happens when viruses evolve for months or years in what we call interhost virus evolution.
