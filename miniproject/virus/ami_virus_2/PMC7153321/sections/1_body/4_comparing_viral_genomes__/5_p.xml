<p id="p0435">Relevant information on protein evolution can be derived from alignment of the protein sequence of related viruses (or of isolates from one virus, or for components of the same mutant spectrum) and analyzing the statistical acceptability of the divergent amino acids at each position (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Feng and Doolittle, 1996</xref>) with consideration of amino acid location when a three-dimensional structure is known (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Farheen et al., 2017</xref>). Statistical acceptability derives from the chemical nature and shape of the amino acid side chains, their structural context, and also the limitations that the genetic code imposes on amino acid replacements (
 <xref rid="bib110" ref-type="bibr">Porto et al., 2005</xref>). The basic assumption is that the more conserved the amino acid sequences, and the more similar are the variant amino acids, it is more likely that the proteins are derived from a common ancestor. M. Dayhoff pioneered the early comparison of protein sequences establishing a protein information resource (PIR) in the middle of the 20th century. Tables named PAM (percent accepted mutation) were constructed, and several evolved versions such as BLOSUM matrices, based on the BLOCKS database, are used to compare protein sequences. The BLOSUM62 amino acid substitution matrix groups amino acids according to their chemical structure and provides a probability of occurrence of each amino acid replacement: zero, amino acid replacement expected by chance; positive number, replacement found more often than by chance; and negative number, replacement found less often than by chance.
