No phylogenetic tree that connects the viruses that have been characterized to date can be derived in a reliable way, not even a tree for DNA or for RNA viruses. What we can do is to produce trees for related viruses that probably share a common ancestor. Many data banks are available for viruses to retrieve sequences for comparison with new isolates. Despite the fact that data banks are periodically updated, some are listed in 
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 7.3</xref> , and can serve as the starting point to reach the desired uniform resource locator (URL) to implement a procedure for genome characterization. Prior to any comparative study of nucleotide or amino acid sequences (not only to establish phylogenetic relationships, but also to calculate genetic distances, to identify regulatory regions, functional domains, and structural motifs, to design oligonucleotide primers for amplification, or other applications) it is essential to align sequences accurately, and some programs for sequence alignments are also given in
