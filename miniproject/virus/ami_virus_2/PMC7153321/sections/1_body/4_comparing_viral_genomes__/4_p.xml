<p id="p0430">Databases differ in format and contents, which may include prediction of traits derived from sequence information (RNA secondary structures, antiviral drug sensitivity levels, assignments to homologous protein families, etc.). Some of them offer a link with the 
 <italic>web</italic> page of the ICTV, thus providing background information to assign newly determined sequences to current taxonomic groups. A structure-based amino acid sequence alignment of protein homologs can be carried out based on three-dimensional structures of proteins. Such types of amino acid sequence alignments may help in the identification of relevant structural and functional motifs. Sequence variability among a set of aligned sequences can be quantitated by the number of variable sites, mean pairwise diversity, mutation frequency, and other estimators (i.e., the Wattersonâ€™s estimator) (
