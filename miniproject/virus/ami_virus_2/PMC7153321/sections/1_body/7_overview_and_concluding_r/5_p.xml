<p id="p0615">Procedures for sequence alignments and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among related viruses have been summarized, with some indications to find useful URL sites for sequence alignment and processing of large data sets. The comparison of genomic sequences (and their encoded amino acids) of new viral isolates with those of the viruses characterized to date is important given the increasing number of new viruses discovered in all kinds of natural habitats.</p>
