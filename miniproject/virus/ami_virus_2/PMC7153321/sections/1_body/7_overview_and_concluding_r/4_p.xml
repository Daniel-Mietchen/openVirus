<p id="p0610">A puzzling and pendent issue in viral evolution is the interpretation of the widely different number of viral serotypes, despite viruses sharing comparably large mutation rates and frequencies. Different possibilities have been examined, and a slight preference for variable constraints acting on the amino acid residues that determine the antigenic properties of viruses has been expressed. Again, additional work is necessary to solve this interesting problem.</p>
