<p id="p0600">Viruses have survived because they have undergone multiple rounds of vertical and horizontal transmission in their host organisms and because occasionally they have found new suitable hosts where to replicate. Among the many parameters involved, in this chapter, we have emphasized the relevance of virus and host population numbers for sustained transmissions and the long-term maintenance of viral entities. A point that is often either ignored or not sufficiently emphasized is that the quasispecies nature of viral populations introduces an element of uncertainty regarding which types of mutants are transmitted to new hosts. Despite being a complication that cannot be easily handled, it is a fact that should stimulate new approaches to the surveillance of virus transmission and the identification of the founder viruses in new infections.</p>
