<p id="p0605">A steady accumulation of mutations during the evolution of organisms was a well-accepted proposal that agreed with the neutral theory of molecular evolution developed last century. One suspects that this agreement resulted in a premature preference for a regular clock of steady incorporation of mutations to work in the case of viruses. The evidence is that there are multiple molecular mechanisms that render the operation of a molecular clock for viruses very unlikely, and perhaps fortuitous in some cases. Several possible mechanisms of variable evolutionary rates have been discussed, and further clarification is expected from entire genome sequencing applied to viruses during outbreaks and epidemics. Viruses are probably not the best biological systems to obtain experimental evidence in support of the clock hypothesis.</p>
