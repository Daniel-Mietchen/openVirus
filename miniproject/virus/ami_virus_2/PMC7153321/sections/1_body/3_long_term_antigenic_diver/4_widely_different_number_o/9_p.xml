<p id="p0390">Most viruses include multiple antigenic sites, and antibodies are raised against several surface proteins to produce an array of neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibody molecules. Taking picornaviruses again as an example, the number of antigenic domains (each composed of multiple epitopes) varies between one and four (

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Fry and Stuart, 2010</xref>). There is no evidence that a restriction on the number of sites or epitopes or that the expression of a salient class of antibody molecule may explain a 100-fold difference in the number of serotypes among picornavirus genera. Thus, the second proposal is unlikely to be correct.
