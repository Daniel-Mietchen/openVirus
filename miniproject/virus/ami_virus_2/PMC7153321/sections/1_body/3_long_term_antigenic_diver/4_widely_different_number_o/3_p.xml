<p id="p0335">No correlation between virus structure (or its morphotype) and antigenic diversity has been found. Among structurally closely related viruses, differences in antigenic diversity are apparent. A dramatic case is that of the picornaviruses, since encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) or hepatitis A virus (HAV) have a single serotype, while human rhinoviruses (HRVs) have been divided into more than 100 serotypes. Other picornaviruses have intermediate numbers of serotypes: three in the case of PV and seven in the case of FMDV. Although it may seem that a diverse antigenic structure may predict a broad host range, this is actually not the case. HAV is highly specialized for the human host, while EMCV infects more than 30 species, including mammals, birds, and invertebrates (
