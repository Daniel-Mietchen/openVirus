<p id="p0395">The difference among classification assays argument does not have an easy response. Indeed, there is no universal procedure used to classify viruses serologically, and therefore, strictly speaking, there is the possibility that a different number of serotypes could be obtained using alternative classification procedures. FMDV is a pertinent example. Its seven serotypes are defined on the basis of a very stringent test that cannot be performed with human viruses for obvious reasons: the absence of cross-protection resulting from vaccination or infection with a given FMDV. Infection or vaccination with FMDV of one serotype does not confer protection against FMDV of a different serotype. In contrast, the subtype classification of FMDV was based on serological assays, such as cross-neutralization or complement fixation tests, usually using sera raised in guinea pigs. These assays allowed classification of FMDV in more than 65 serological subtypes. Subtyping was stopped when it was realized that using increasingly discriminatory assays such as reactivity with MAbs, virtually any new isolate could define a new subtype [(

Despite these considerations, it is unlikely that serological assays using in vitro tests would be responsible for a 100-fold difference between two human pathogens such as HRV and HAV. Thus, it does not seem justified to attribute antigenic constancy to an artifact derived from diagnostic procedures.
