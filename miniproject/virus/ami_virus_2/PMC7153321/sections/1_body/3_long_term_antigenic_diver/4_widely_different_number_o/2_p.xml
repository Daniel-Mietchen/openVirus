<p id="p0330">A puzzling question in evolutionary virology is that despite sharing high mutation rates, some viruses display extensive antigenic diversity in nature reflected in multiple serotypes, while other viruses maintain a relatively invariant antigenic structure, with only one serotype recorded. For the latter group of viruses, the same vaccine can maintain its efficacy over many decades; examples are rabies virus (RV) and MV, two RNA viruses that show remarkable genetic diversity in nature, and estimates of mutation rates and frequencies comparable to other RNA viruses. Antigenic constancy is a determinant of long-lasting immunity after infection or vaccination. MV infection produces lifelong immunity (probably as a result of several factors) while patients that have cleared the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be reinfected by the same virus. Cases of patients infected with HCVs of different genotypes and subtypes are increasingly identified, as more refined diagnostic tests are utilized, and the virus diversifies in nature (
