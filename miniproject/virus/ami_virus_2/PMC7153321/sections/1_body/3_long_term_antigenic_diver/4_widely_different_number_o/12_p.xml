<p id="p0405">We come to constraints at antigenic sites that limit the number of accepted amino acid substitutions as a model for antigenic invariance. It is the preferred model of molecular virologists. The initial concept was proposed by M.G. Rossmann, in his canyon hypothesis (
 <xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">Rossmann, 1989</xref>), based on studies with HRV14. A canyon in the virus preserves the receptor-binding site inside while permitting amino acid substitutions that affect antigenicity, without consequences for receptor recognition. A physical and functional separation between receptor and antibody binding allows extensive antigenic variation. Clearly, in many viruses, there is an overlap between antigenic and receptor recognition sites (Section 4.5 in Chapter 4), that could limit antigenic variation. A difference in constraints is also supported by a structural comparison carried out by J.M. Casasnovas and his colleagues of the interaction of PV and HRV16 with their respective cellular receptors that revealed a receptor-binding site more accessible in PV than in HVR16, rendering the latter suited to escape antibody neutralization (
 <xref rid="bib162" ref-type="bibr">Xing etÂ al., 2000</xref>). This would render HRV a picornavirus prone to antigenic variation, as indeed found in nature. Thus, constraints imposed by the requirement to interact with the cellular receptor may explain the limited capacity for antigenic diversification, and perhaps with the contribution of other influences, the puzzle of widely different antigenic types despite similarly high genome mutability. Additional structural and functional studies with viruses of different families are necessary to substantiate this proposal.
