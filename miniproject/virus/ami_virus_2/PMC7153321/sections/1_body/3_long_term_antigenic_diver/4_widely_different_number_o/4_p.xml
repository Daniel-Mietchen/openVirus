<p id="p0340">Several, not mutually exclusive models, have been proposed to account for differences in the antigenic stability (number of serotypes) among viruses:
 <list list-type="simple" id="ulist0020">
  <list-item id="u0095">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0345">Differences in mutation rate, either the average value for the entire genome or the local mutation rate at the genomic sites that encode antigenic determinants.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0100">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0350">The presence of some dominant and invariant antigenic sites that evoke long-lasting antibodies in the infected hosts, and that obscure other antigenic sites that produce different antibodies that have a limited impact on the antigenic profile of the virus.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0105">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0355">Differences among the assays used for serotype classification. If a universal and standard procedure to classify virus isolates in different serotypes were applied, differences among viruses would be largely lost.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0110">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0360">Difference in the history of virus circulation. Ancient viruses that undergo many rounds of genome replication in each infected host have had an opportunity to diversify antigenically in a manner not possible with viruses that have a more limited history of circulation among susceptible hosts. According to this model, antigenic diversification of some viruses currently viewed as antigenically invariant will take place during the next hundreds of years if their circulation continues.</p>

   <p id="p0365">Some viruses have antigenic sites that cannot vary because they are under severe constraints to accept amino acid substitutions. Antigenic variants may exist as low-fitness subpopulations, but their frequency is too low to modify the results of the diagnostic tests used for serological classifications.</p>
