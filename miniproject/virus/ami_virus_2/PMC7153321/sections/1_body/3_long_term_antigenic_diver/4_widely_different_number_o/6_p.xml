<p id="p0375">Antibodies can be obtained from infected natural hosts, or from some laboratory animals which are not a natural host for the virus. An ensemble of amino acid residues forms an antigenic determinant which is usually composed of multiple epitopes [defined here as a unit of interaction with a monoclonal antibody (MAb)]. Epitopes can be either continuous (also termed linear) or discontinuous (also termed structured). Continuous epitopes are those whose primary amino acid sequence has the information to react with the cognate antibody. Discontinuous epitopes are those whose reactive residues come from distant positions of the same protein or residues of different proteins. Many overlapping epitopes can be found within the same antigenic site. Epitopes can include modified amino acid residues such as glycosylated amino acids. Reactivity of discontinuous epitopes with the cognate antibody is generally lost as a consequence of denaturation of the proteins that form the epitope.</p>
