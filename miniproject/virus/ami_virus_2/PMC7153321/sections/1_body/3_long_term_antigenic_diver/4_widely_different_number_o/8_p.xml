<p id="p0385">There is no correlation between limited antigenic diversity and low average mutation rate. Mutation rates and frequencies for RNA viruses fall in the range of 10
 <sup>− 5</sup> to 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> substitutions per nucleotide (Chapter 2). However, mutation rates along a viral genome are not uniform, as evidenced by the occurrence of hot spots for variation. Influences such as nucleotide sequence context or RNA structure may conceivably alter mutation rates. It was proposed that a predicted double-stranded RNA at the region encoding the major antigenic site of FMDV might increase the polymerase error rate locally and give rise to multiple amino acid substitutions (

While at some specific sites polymerases may be more error-prone than average, subsequent evidence for FMDV indicated that antigenic variation is due to amino acid substitutions at different antigenic sites and that even variation at the major site can be mediated by distant amino acids on the viral capsid (

 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Geysen et al., 1984</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Mateu et al., 1990</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Feigelstock et al., 1996</xref>). Later molecular studies have not provided evidence that viruses may have a large number of serotypes because their polymerases are more error-prone when copying regions encoding amino acids that belong to antigenic sites. Therefore, the possibility that differences in mutation rates can determine a different number of circulating serotypes is unlikely.
