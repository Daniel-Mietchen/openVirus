<p id="p0400">More extensive virus circulation will favor genetic and antigenic diversification, and a single serotype may evolve into multiple serotypes. What we describe today as the antigenic profile of virus groups is a snapshot of an evolving process. Genotype differentiation is actually being witnessed during the expansion of HCV pandemics, partly due to a true genetic diversification of the virus as it circulated over the last decades, and partly due to increasing capacity of virus surveillance, and molecular and phylogenetic tools for genome analysis. The reader can find an illustration of this point by comparing the expanded phylogenetic HCV tree from six to seven genotypes and the subtype ramifications, published by P. Simmonds and colleagues in 1993 and 2014 [compare (

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Hedskog et al., 2019</xref>). Although it cannot be excluded that time might tend to equalize the number of serotypes among viruses, current evidence does not justify blaming differences in the extent of virus circulation to settle this issue.
