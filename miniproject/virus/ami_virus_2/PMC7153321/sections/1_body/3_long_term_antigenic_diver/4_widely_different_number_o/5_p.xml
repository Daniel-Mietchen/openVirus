<p id="p0370">Consideration of these possibilities requires examining some experimental data on virus antigenicity. First, as a conceptual precision, we assume that the number of serotypes is essentially determined by amino acid sequences located in the virus particle and that either directly or indirectly can affect the interaction of the virus with antibodies. Neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies may contribute to serological distinctions, depending on the assays performed for serotyping. Serum neutralization tests will identify differences in sensitivity to neutralization, while Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) tests will capture reactivity by all raised antibodies.</p>
