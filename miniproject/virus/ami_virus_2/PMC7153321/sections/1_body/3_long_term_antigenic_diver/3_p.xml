<p id="p0325">The antigenic diversification of one FMDV serotype was examined over a six-decade period by comparing amino acid sequences of the major antigenic sites of the virus isolated in three continents (
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Martínez et al., 1992</xref>). The evolution of the capsid genes was associated with linear accumulation of synonymous mutations, but not of amino acid substitutions. Remarkably, the antigenic variation over 6 decades was due to fluctuations among limited combinations of amino acid residues without net accumulation of amino acid substitutions over time (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.5</xref> ). This result suggests that constraints at the protein level may maintain a long-term virus identity at the antigenic level. In a related observation on the interhost evolution of HIV-1 mentioned in 
 <xref rid="s0030" ref-type="sec">Section 7.3.2</xref>, HIV-1 recovered ancestral features when infecting a new host (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Herbeck et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, multiple constraints in viruses may limit the rate and mode of long-term diversification, resulting in different numbers of circulating serotypes among viruses of the same family.
