<p id="p0415">Unless the escape mutations are selectively neutral, the expectation is that MARM frequencies may be an underestimate of the real rate at which the amino acid substitutions occur. Thus, it is possible that following selection by an antibody, some mutants may decrease in frequency due to a fitness cost, or that their level is maintained due to additional compensatory mutations acquired by the replicating genomes (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 7.6</xref> ). Viruses that are highly constrained for antigenic variation may be diagnosed through fitness decrease of MARM mutants despite their occurring at similar rates as those that affect unconstrained sites. This is a concept similar to the distinction between fitness and function that we made in Section 5.8 of Chapter 5. That is, the occurrence of an antigenic change does not guarantee that the change will be perpetuated in nature and contribute to natural antigenic diversification. Again, fitness should be considered as a relevant parameter, and fitness effects on antigenic stability have been largely unexplored.
