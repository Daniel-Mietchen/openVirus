 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Louie et al., 2018</xref>) but this may be reflected in mutant stability but not in the frequency of MAb-escape mutants [monoclonal antibody-resistant mutant (MARM) frequencies] in laboratory experiments. Comparison of MARM frequencies of different viruses shows comparable values independently of the number of circulating serotypes of the virus (
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 7.2</xref> ). In particular, the cardiovirus Mengo virus (one serotype) displays similar MAR frequencies than HRV (100 serotypes). In fact, none of the RNA and DNA viruses listed in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 7.2</xref> deviate from a broad range of MARM frequencies of 10
 <sup>− 3</sup> to 10
 <sup>− 5</sup>, except for substitutions at some discontinuous epitopes of FMDV (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Lea et al., 1994</xref>). In some studies, the stability of the selected escape mutants was tested after a few passages in cell culture, but in other studies, the lack of reversion of the antigenic change was not ascertained. Two FMDV escape mutants showed a selective disadvantage over the parental wild-type virus (fitness decrease); upon continued replication, the mutants acquired fitness-enhancing mutations without reversion of the antigenic change (
