<p id="p0220">Despite a necessarily approximate and imprecise knowledge of how many and which types of genomes participate in successive horizontal and vertical transmissions, we can obtain an overall estimate of the rate at which viruses evolve in nature. This is commonly done by comparing consensus genomic nucleotide sequences of viruses isolated at different times during an outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic.</p>
