<p id="p0255">For viruses that can remain infectious outside their hosts, and that do not need donor-recipient host contacts to perpetuate transmission chains, the time between isolations will influence the calculated rate of evolution based on genomic nucleotide sequences. The reason is that during the extracellular stages, the virus will not undergo genetic change, at least to the extent of variation during intracellular replication (possible mutations due to chemical damage in viral genomes is indicated in Section 2.2. of Chapter 2). The effect of nonreplicative time intervals in the rate of evolution is illustrated in
