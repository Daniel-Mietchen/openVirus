<p id="p0245">A second early observation was made during an episode of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Spain. Estimates of the rate of evolution of the virus ranged from &lt;4 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 4 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup>  s/nt/y, depending on the genomic region analyzed, and the time period between isolations (
 <xref rid="bib137" ref-type="bibr">Sobrino et al., 1986</xref>). Cocirculation of multiple heterogeneous foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) samples (“evolving quasispecies”) was proposed. The result to be emphasized here is that the calculated rates of evolution were extremely high (higher than 10
 <sup>−2</sup>  s/nt/y) if the two FMDVs compared were isolated at close time points, while lower values were calculated when the viruses were sampled from different animals at distant time points.
