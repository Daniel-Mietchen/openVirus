 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.3</xref>: (i) the consensus sequences determined to characterize the virus shed by each animal represent a simplification of the real genome composition of the virus. (ii) Individual animals vary in physiological and immunological status, and, obviously, they are not in line waiting to be infected; they move, gather around water and food sources, some are isolated, others in close contact with their peer, and so on. (iii) In this case, virus transport is assumed to be mechanical (on dust particles carried by wind, aerosols, insects, etc.) without additional viral replication during transport. However, subpopulations of the most environment-resistant particles, or particles that adhere best to the transporter object, may bias the composition of the virus that will reach an animal to pursue replication. Such events, occurring for 10 to 100 rounds of host infections, render the appalling virus diversity described in Chapter 1 a bit less appalling. Since several additional environmental circumstances are changeable and unpredictable, it is unlikely that rates of viral evolution in nature can remain invariant on the basis of some internal principle of constant mutation occurrence (as if the accumulation of mutations was as monotonous as radioactive decay!).
