<p id="p0240">It has been known for decades that the calculated rates of virus evolution in nature depend on the genomic region analyzed and the time interval between the isolation of the viral samples on which the calculations are based. Noncumulative sequence changes in the hemagglutinin of influenza virus (IV) type C were found in an early study by 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Buonagurio etÂ al. (1985)</xref>. The authors proposed a cocirculation of variants that belonged to different evolutionary lineages. If multiple evolutionary pathways coexist in a given geographical area, and they establish a network of lineages that evolve with time, variations of calculated rates of evolution are expected, and they may distort the actual rate of evolution of individual lineages.
