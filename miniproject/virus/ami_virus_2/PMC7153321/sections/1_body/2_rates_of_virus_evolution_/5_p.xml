<p id="p0235">Different genes of the same virus set may show different rates of evolution (i.e., the polymerase and other nonstructural proteins may evolve more slowly than structural proteins). Thus, a rate of evolution is far from being a universal feature of a virus. A comparison of rates of synonymous substitutions (under the assumption that synonymous substitutions do not affect protein function; see Chapter 2 for limitations of considering synonymous mutations as neutral) for several RNA viruses, yielded a range of evolutionary rates of 6 × 10
 <sup>−2</sup> to 1 × 10
 <sup>−7</sup> synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per year (

 <xref rid="s0060" ref-type="sec">Section 7.6</xref>), under the assumption of the molecular clock, and inference of the ancestral nucleotide sequences at the tree nodes. The five orders of magnitude variation were attributed mainly to the degree of virus replication rather than to differences in error rate. We will deal with the molecular clock hypothesis (constant rate of accumulation of mutations) in 
 <xref rid="s0035" ref-type="sec">Section 7.3.3</xref>, but the major features of virus evolution studied in previous chapters (mainly those typical of mutant swarm-forming RNA and DNA viruses) should make us skeptical of similar evolution rates in different biological contexts. Rate variations were documented with HIV-1 subpopulations in different compartments of the human brain (
 <xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">Salemi et al., 2005</xref>). The data did not fit a “global” molecular clock for the virus in the brain, and “local” clocks showed that meninges and temporal lobe HIV-1 subpopulations evolved 30 and 100 times faster, respectively, than other HIV-1 populations in the brain. It is believed that these differences were due to random drift of viral sequences rather than selection for some genome types. An additional complication is that even restricting virus isolations to the same biological material in a standard epidemiological setting, several measurements indicated discontinuities in evolutionary rates. The discontinuities had at least two origins: the nonlinear effect of time, and some unique features of evolution occurring inside an infected host. These points are examined next.
