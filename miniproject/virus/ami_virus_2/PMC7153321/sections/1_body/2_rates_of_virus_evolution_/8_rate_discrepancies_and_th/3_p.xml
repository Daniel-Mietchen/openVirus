<p id="p0315">There are additional arguments against the operation of a molecular clock in virus evolution. According to the clock hypothesis, the rate of accumulation of mutations coincides with the rate at which mutations arise in infected individuals. This holds for neutral mutations, and as mentioned in several chapters of this book, very few mutations occurring in highly compact viral genomes are truly neutral (with no functional consequences in any environment; see 
 <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">Section 2.3</xref> in Chapter 2). Even for neutral evolution, spatial asymmetries in populations are sufficient to perturb the molecular clock rate, as documented with a theoretical model of broad applicability (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2015</xref>). However, quasispecies and the operation of a clock are not totally irreconcilable. An epidemiological study with FMDV suggested that viral quasispecies could produce a transient molecular clock due to the periodic sampling of components of the mutant spectrum in transmission (
