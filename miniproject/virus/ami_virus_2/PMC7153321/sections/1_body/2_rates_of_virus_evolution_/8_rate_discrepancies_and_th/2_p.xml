<p id="p0310">The molecular clock hypothesis dwindles as a conceptual framework because, from all evidence, virus evolution is far from being dictated by a steady accumulation of mutations in viral genomes. The major event that we have learned by comparing the genomic composition of individual viral populations is that evolution is guided by “replacement of subpopulations” rather than “accumulation of mutations in genomes.” This conceptual change is as important for the understanding of long-term evolution of viruses as it is the consideration of the wild type as a cloud of mutants in the definition of a viral population, a major input from quasispecies theory (Chapter 3).</p>
