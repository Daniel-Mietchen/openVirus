<p id="p0230">Herpes simplex virus constitutes an example of a complex DNA virus for which, despite uncertainties (

 <sup>− 8</sup>  s/nt/y (
 <xref rid="bib120" ref-type="bibr">Sakaoka et al., 1994</xref>), which is actually closer to the rate estimated for cellular genes than for most viruses. However, its mutation frequencies, measured by independent procedures, are in the range of 7 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> to 1 × 10
 <sup>−5</sup> (see also 
 <xref rid="s0050" ref-type="sec">Section 7.4.2</xref>). The latter values may result from the selective agent targeting a replicating herpes simplex virus that has produced multiple variants, while the overall slow rate of evolution may be influenced by periods of latency. Slow evolution is expected for retroviruses such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) whose life cycles are dominated by the integrated provirus stage, with the viruses following the clonal expansion of their host cells (

 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Kulkarni and Bangham, 2018</xref>). Some single-stranded DNA viruses display rates of evolution typical of the rapidly evolving RNA viruses (
