<p id="p0280">Additional mechanisms for the time dependence of evolutionary rates have been suggested for HBV. In a 17 years follow-up of several patients, HBV diversity increased during periods of active host immune response, and viral copy numbers decreased. When the immune response was weak, viral genome diversity decreased, and viral copy numbers increased; these periods are expected to be those of high transmissibility (
