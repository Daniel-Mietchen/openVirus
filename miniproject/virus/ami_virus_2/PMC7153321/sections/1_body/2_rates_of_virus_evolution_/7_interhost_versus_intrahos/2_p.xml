<p id="p0265">Additional observations against constant mutational input with time have been made with HIV-1 and human and avian hepatitis B virus (HBV). The main finding is that interhost rates of evolution are lower than intrahost rates, even under a comparable set of epidemiological parameters. Several proposals have been made to account for this difference. A.J. Leslie and colleagues described cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-escape mutants of HIV-1 from infected patients. Some of the mutants reverted to the wild-type sequence after transmission to individuals negative for the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles associated with long-term HIV-1 control (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Leslie et al., 2004</xref>). Strong intrahost selective pressures and reversion of a part of the selected mutations upon transmission to a susceptible individual is one of the possible mechanisms behind diminished evolutionary rates when viruses from multiple host individuals are compared (
