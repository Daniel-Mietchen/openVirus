<p id="p0285">Endogenous hepadnaviruses are present in the genomes of several organisms. There is evidence that some of the integration events in avian hosts are at least 19 million years old. These integrated hepadnaviruses maintain about 75% nucleotide sequence identity with present-day hepadnaviruses, and the comparisons suggest that the long-term substitution rates are 10
 <sup>3</sup>-fold lower than those for circulating avian HBVs (

 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Gojobori and Yokoyama, 1985</xref>), among other evidence. Considerable evolutionary stasis is also observed by comparing isolates of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, whose replication displays a preference for maintaining its integration in cellular DNA (
 <xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Melamed etÂ al., 2014</xref>). For viruses that have a dual potential of error-prone replication and cellular DNA-like stasis, the permanence in cellular DNA may also contribute to reduced long-term evolutionary rates.
