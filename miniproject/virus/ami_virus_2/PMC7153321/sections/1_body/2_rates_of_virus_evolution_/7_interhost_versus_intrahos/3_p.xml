<p id="p0270">J.T. Herbeck, J.I. Mullins, and colleagues systematically observed lower nucleotide sequence divergence between HIV-1 isolates from different individuals sampled in primary infection than between isolates from individuals with advanced illness. HIV-1 regained some ancestral features when infecting a new host, again explaining a higher intrahost than the interhost evolutionary rate (

Redd and colleagues reported that the viral populations found in the newly infected recipients were more closely related to ancestral sequences from the donor than to the sequences found in the donor near the time of transmission (
