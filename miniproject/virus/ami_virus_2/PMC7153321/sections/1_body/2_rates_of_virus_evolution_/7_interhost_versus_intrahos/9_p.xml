<p id="p0300">The viruses that colonize the human gut are extremely diverse and evolving at different rates. From all the evidence, the gut virome composition is unique to each individual human. It includes single-stranded DNA viruses that evolve at rates &gt;10
 <sup>−5</sup> substitutions per nucleotide and day (an extremely high rate!); other genomes, particularly those of temperate bacteriophages, display lower evolutionary rates, partly due to their being replicated by high fidelity bacterial polymerases when the prophage is integrated into host DNA (
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Minot et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, both the viral populations that infect our tissues and organs and those that infect the microbes that colonize us (1%–3% of the mass of a healthy human is composed of microorganisms) are diverse, unique to each of us, and evolving at different rates.
