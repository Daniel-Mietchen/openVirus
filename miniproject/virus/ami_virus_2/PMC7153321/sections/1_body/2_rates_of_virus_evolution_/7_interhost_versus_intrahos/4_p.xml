<p id="p0275">K.A. Lythgoe and C. Fraser provided evidence that cycling of HIV-1 through long-lived memory CD4
 <sup>+</sup>T cells is probably the main contributing factor to slower HIV-1 evolution at the epidemic level (
 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Lythgoe and Fraser, 2012</xref>). Ancestral sequences of HIV-1 in infected individuals may arise by the activation of proviral sequences kept in the form of quasispecies memory. In this case, we refer to the type of molecular memory defined as a reservoir, anatomical, or cellular memory in Section 5.5 of Chapter 5. A related type of reservoir memory is found in HBV, in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) that persists in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes, and acts as a template for the synthesis of pregenomic RNA and viral mRNAs (
 <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Kay and Zoulim, 2007</xref>). In this case, a record of ancient sequences is registered in the cccDNA. It should be noted that memory levels are dependent on fitness values, as evidenced experimentally with FMDV and expected from the theoretical basis of memory implementation (Chapter 5). In consequence, the most abundant memory genomes established early in an infection might be those displaying the highest fitness early in infection, and they might be better adapted to initiate infections than to sustain them (
