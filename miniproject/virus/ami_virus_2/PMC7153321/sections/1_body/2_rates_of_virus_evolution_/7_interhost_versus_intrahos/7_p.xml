<p id="p0290">HBV quasispecies dynamics was examined in a virus that infected members of the same family that presumably acquired the virus through mother-to-infant transmission (
 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Lin etÂ al., 2015</xref>). Again, the intrahost evolutionary rate was higher than the interhost rate, and the latter decreased with the number of transmissions. The differences were mainly due to nonsynonymous substitutions at limited sites. These observations were interpreted as a rapid switch of HBV between colonization (invasion of new host) and adaptation (quasispecies optimization in the new host). The authors referred to the colonization-adaptation trade-off (CAT) model or alternations of virus facing an environment marked by a limited host immune response followed by a period of active immune response. In the former environment, viruses displaying rapid replication are selected, while in the latter environment, HBV escape mutants with lower productivity are selected. In each transmission, when the virus reaches a new host, the previously adapted subpopulations are overgrown by the rapidly replicating ones. Again, cccDNA can serve as a reservoir of ancient sequences.
