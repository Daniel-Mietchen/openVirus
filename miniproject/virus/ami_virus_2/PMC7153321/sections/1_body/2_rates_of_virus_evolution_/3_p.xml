<p id="p0225">The rate of evolution (also termed as the rate of fixation or rate of accumulation of mutations) is generally expressed as substitutions per nucleotide and year (s/nt/y). The term fixation is not the most adequate when dealing with virus evolution given that the term refers to a consensus that, in addition to being an average of the real sequences, has a fleeting dominance. However, the term is frequently used in the literature of general genetics and virus evolution. The rate of evolution is calculated from genetic distances between consensus viral genomic sequences of successive viral samples from a single persistently or acutely infected host, or from different host individuals infected at different times. Rates of evolution are only indirectly related to mutation rates and mutation frequencies that do not include a time factor in them. There have been several comparisons of rates of evolution for viruses that document the differences between RNA and DNA viruses (
