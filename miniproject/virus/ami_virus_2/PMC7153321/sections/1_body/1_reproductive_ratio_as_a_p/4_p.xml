<p id="p0215">The difference between the number of infectious particles that participate in transmission and the total number of virus in an infected, donor organism provides a first picture of the indeterminacies involved in viral transmissions. The larger the population size and genetic heterogeneity of the virus in an infected individual, the higher will be the likelihood that independent transmission events have different outcomes. Individual susceptible hosts will receive subsets of related but nonidentical genomes. In a bright article that emphasized the molecular evidence and medical implications of quasispecies in viruses, J.J. Holland and colleagues wrote the following statement: “Therefore, the acute effects and subtle chronic effects of infections will differ not only because we all vary genetically, physiologically, and immunologically, but also because we all experience a different array of quasispecies challenges. These facts are easily overlooked by clinicians and scientists because disease syndromes are often grossly similar for each type of virus, and because it would appear to make no difference in a practical sense. However, for the person who develops Guillain-Barré syndrome following a common cold, or for the individual who remains healthy despite many years of HIV-1 infection, for example, it may make all the difference in the world” (

The ever increasing number of identified human genes whose allelic forms influence viral infections provides strong support for the predictions of Holland et al. Indeterminacies in the process of virus spread can be viewed as an extension of the diversification due to bottleneck events in the case of virus transmission, as visualized in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2 in Chapter 6, when dealing with the limitations of the virus samples retrieved from an infected host as the starting material for experimental evolution approaches.
