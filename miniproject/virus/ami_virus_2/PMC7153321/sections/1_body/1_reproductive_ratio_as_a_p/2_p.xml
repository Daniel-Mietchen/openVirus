<p id="p0205">The basic reproductive ratio or basic reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) is the average number of infected contacts per infected individual. At a population level, a value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> larger than one means that a virus will continue its propagation among susceptible hosts if no environmental changes or external influences intervene. An 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> value lower than one means that the virus is doomed to extinction at the epidemiological level under those specific circumstances. The basic models of infection dynamics were developed by R.M. Anderson, R.M. May, and M.A. Nowak, with inclusion of the following key parameters: rate 
 <italic>k</italic> at which uninfected hosts enter the population of susceptible individuals (
 <italic>x</italic>), their normal death rate (
 <italic>u</italic>) (so that the equilibrium abundance of uninfected hosts is 
 <italic>k</italic>/
 <italic>u</italic>), number of infected hosts (
 <italic>y</italic>), mortality due to infection (
 <italic>v</italic>) (so that 1/
 <italic>u</italic>  +  
 <italic>v</italic> is the average lifetime of an infected host), a rate constant (
 <italic>β</italic>) that characterizes parasite infectivity (so that 
 <italic>βx</italic> is the rate of new infections and 
 <italic>βxy</italic> is the rate at which infected hosts transmit the virus to uninfected hosts). These parameters are schematically indicated in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.1</xref> and they provide a theoretical value for
