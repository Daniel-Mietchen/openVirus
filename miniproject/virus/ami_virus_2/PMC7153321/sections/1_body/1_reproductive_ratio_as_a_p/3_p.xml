 <sub>0</sub> values are not a universal constant for viruses because, as discussed in Chapters 3 and 4Chapter 3Chapter 4, virus variation may affect viral fitness and viral load in infected individuals, and the latter, in turn, may influence the amount of virus that surfaces in a host to permit transmission (

 <sub>0</sub> for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus range from two to five; for PV the range is 5–7, and for Ebola virus is 1.5–2.5. For the measles virus (MV), which is one of the most contagious viruses described to date, the

 <sub>0</sub> values, and this is consistent with SARS not having reached the pandemic proportions that were feared immediately following its emergence. In contrast, MV is highly transmissible, thus explaining frequent outbreaks as soon as a sizable population stops vaccinating its infants. This is an important problem, fueled by antivaccination campaigns without scientific basis. Since some of the parameters that enter the basic equations of viral dynamics depend on the nucleotide sequence of the viral genome, mutations may alter

 <sub>0</sub> values, allowing some virus variants to overtake those that were previously circulating in the population (
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7.2</xref> ). Viral replication, fitness, load, transmissibility, and virulence are all interconnected factors that contribute to virus persistence in its broader sense of virus being perpetuated in nature. These parameters can affect both disease progression in an infected individual and transmissibility at the epidemiological level.
