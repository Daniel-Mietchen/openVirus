<p id="p0470">When possible it is advisable to apply different phylogenetic procedures to compare tree topologies. Resampling methods (i.e., bootstrapping, jackknifing, etc.) are used to assess the statistical reliability of the trees (

Different tree topologies can be obtained when analyzing different genes of the same virus set. Discordant phylogenetic positions of two different genes of the same virus are suggestive of recombination that should be evaluated statistically (
