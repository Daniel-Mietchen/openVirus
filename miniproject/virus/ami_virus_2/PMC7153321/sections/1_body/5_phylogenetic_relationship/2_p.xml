Application of phylogenetic methods to virus evolution requires careful consideration of the evolutionary models to be used, including probabilities of the different types of nucleotide and amino acid replacements, and the rates at which they may occur. Statistical methods (i.e., likelihood ratio tests) are available to select an adequate model for a given data set (
 <xref rid="bib121" ref-type="bibr">Salemi and Vandamme, 2004</xref>). At the nucleotide sequence level, it is often assumed that when transitions are more frequent than transversions in a set of related sequences, no saturation of mutation took place. In contrast, when transversions are more frequent than transitions, saturation is presumed (

 <xref rid="bib111" ref-type="bibr">Posada and Crandall, 1998</xref>). Despite their obvious utility, it is unlikely that these statistical procedures which were developed on the assumption of successions of defined sequences (rather than mutant clouds) can capture the complexities underlying long-term evolution of viruses in nature.
