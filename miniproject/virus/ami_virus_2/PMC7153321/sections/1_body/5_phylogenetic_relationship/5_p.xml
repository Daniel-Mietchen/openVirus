<p id="p0455">Distance methods are based on the calculation of genetic distances between any two sequences of a multiple sequence alignment. Large genetic distances require a correction for multiple mutational steps (i.e., Kimura 2-parameter distance). Most distance methods can handle large numbers of sequences, and results are relatively reliable even when a molecular clock does not operate. Commonly applied distance methods include neighbor-joining (NJ) (that does not assume a molecular clock and yields an unrooted tree), several variant versions of NJ, and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA, a clustering method that assumes a molecular clock and produces a rooted tree). The software package TREECON was developed to derive NJ trees.</p>
