<p id="p0475">The more conserved genes (i.e., those encoding the polymerase or other nonstructural proteins) may permit the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among some distant virus groups. Examples are the clustering of a number of animal and plant RNA viruses as supergroups (

In contrast to conserved genes, variable genes (typically, capsid proteins and surface glycoproteins) serve to establish short-term evolutionary relationships within the same virus group, including the survey of virus variation during outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics (
