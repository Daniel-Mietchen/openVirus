<p id="p0450">Maximum parsimony predicts the minimal mutation steps needed to produce the observed sequences from ancestor sequences. It is most suitable for closely related sequences. Often, all possible trees are examined before a consensus tree is produced, and, therefore, the method is time-consuming. Most programs based on maximum parsimony assume the operation of a molecular clock, with the limitations that were discussed in
