<p id="p0460">ML methods use probability calculations to derive a branching pattern from the mutations at different positions of the nucleic acids under study. They can estimate both distances and the most accurate mutational pathway between sequences. Generally, supercomputers are needed when many sequences are compared since all possible trees are examined. ML methods are included in several programs listed in
