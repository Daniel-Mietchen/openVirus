Viruses evolve at different rates depending on the polymerase copying fidelity during genome replication and a number of environmental influences. Calculated rates of evolution in nature vary depending on the time interval between virus isolations. In particular, intrahost evolution is generally more rapid that interhost evolution, and several possible mechanisms for this difference are considered. The mechanisms by which the error-prone viruses evolve are very unlikely to render the operation of a molecular clock (constant rate of incorporation of mutations in the evolving genomes), although a clock is assumed in many calculations. Several computational tools permit the alignment of viral sequences and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among viruses. The evolution of the virus in the form of dynamic mutant clouds in each infected individual, together with multiple environmental parameters renders the emergence and reemergence of viral pathogens an unpredictable event, another facet of biological complexity.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antigenic diversity</kwd><kwd>Complexity</kwd><kwd>Phylogenetic relationships</kwd><kwd>Rate of evolution</kwd><kwd>Viral disease emergence</kwd><kwd>Virus transmission</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0010"><label>7.1</label><title>Introduction to the spread of viruses. Outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics</title><p id="p0180">Intrahost virus replication and evolution are the first steps in the process of virus diversification that continue with successive virus transmission events that are a condition for long-term survival in nature. Viruses are perpetuated as a consequence of many rounds of persistent or acute infections, with possible extracellular stages in which genomes remain basically invariant. Despite lacking direct evidence, we presume that multitudes of successive transmissions have allowed viruses to survive at least for thousands of years, probably undergoing continuous genetic change. Picornavirologists are familiar with an Egyptian stela dated 1550&#x02013;1333 BCE. (18th Egyptian dynasty) that portrays the image of a man with an atrophic leg probably a consequence of infection with poliovirus (PV) or a related virus (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Eggers, 2002</xref>). In this chapter, we deviate from the focus on how viral population numbers affect short-term survival and evolution, and we turn to features of viruses as they infect successive hosts to permit virus perpetuation in nature.
</p><p id="p0185">Viruses can be transmitted vertically or horizontally. Vertical transmission occurs from parental organisms to their offspring, and it includes infection through the germline in animals and plants, from the mother to the embryo during fetal development, and also postnatal transmission to the newborn via blood, milk, or contact (<xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Mims, 1981</xref>, <xref rid="bib100" ref-type="bibr">Nash et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). In horizontal transmission, a virus spreads from infected individuals to susceptible recipients. We are most familiar with this type of transmission. It frequently gives rise to disease outbreaks (infection episodes localized in space and time that affect a few individuals), epidemics (that affect an ample geographical area and are often extended in time), and pandemics (that affect most areas of our planet), typically the periodic influenza pandemics.</p><p id="p0190">All transmission modes have probably contributed to the maintenance of viruses in our biosphere. Persistent infections are likely to have played a major role when the number of individual humans or animals living in close contact was limited throughout the pre-agricultural era, earlier than 10,000&#x000a0;years ago. A favorable climate change during the Holocene (the geological epoch that began at the end of the Pleistocene, around 12,000&#x000a0;years before the present; compare with Chapter 1) was probably an important driver toward large-scale domestication of plants and animals, 10,000&#x02013;7000&#x000a0;years&#x000a0;BCE. From the behavior of current viruses, there might have always been a dynamics of virus change for adaptability within individual hosts, and transmissions among animals or plants. The probability of transmission increased as host population numbers rose with agricultural practices and urban life in the last several thousand years. Intensive agriculture must have contributed to accelerated sequence space exploration by viruses with consequences for the emergence of viral disease (<xref rid="s0065" ref-type="sec">Section 7.7</xref>). Probably, there has been a continuous dynamics of viral emergences, reemergences, and extinctions with patterns that may be parallel to those observed in present-day viruses. Virology has existed as an organized scientific discipline with the possibility to isolate, store, and study viruses only for about one century. The challenge to reconstruct the events that might have led to viruses similar to the ones we isolate today was addressed in Chapter 1, with a critical first question being if viruses originated 4000 million years ago, or &#x0201c;only&#x0201d; 2000&#x000a0;million years ago (diagrams in Figs.&#x000a0;1.3 and 1.4, and Section 1.5 in Chapter 1). In this chapter, we are more modest in our aspirations, and we will analyze, with the tools of genomics, what happens when viruses evolve for months or years in what we call interhost virus evolution.</p><p id="p0195">Unfortunately, viruses have not left a fossil record (at least one that we can uncover with the available tools), since according to current paleontology, nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich molecules are unlikely to be protected in fossils older than 1 million years. At most, hundred to thousand years-old skeletal remains or frozen bodies that contain viruses have been analyzed, and sequences retrieved [(<xref rid="bib98" ref-type="bibr">Muhlemann et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>) and references therein]. Fortunately, there is a different historical record of ancient viral sequences in the DNA of differentiated organisms, in the form of integrated virus-like genetic elements. The research area that consists in rescuing ancestral viral sequences is termed paleo-virology, and it is providing information on viruses that circulated thousands of years or even millions of years ago in the case of viral sequences integrated into cellular DNA (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Aswad and Katzourakis, 2012</xref>).</p><p id="p0200">The presence of recognizable viral genomic sequences in present-day cellular DNA (<xref rid="bib145" ref-type="bibr">Tomonaga et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>) suggests a history of long-term interaction between viruses and cells, in support of some models of virus origins that propose long coevolution between precellular and cellular entities with virus-like elements (Chapter 1). Despite the current capacity to amplify tiny amounts of viral nucleic acids for nucleotide sequence determinations, proposals on how long-term viral evolution might proceed have to be based mainly on the comparison of viral genomes and the structure of viral proteins from modern representatives of different virus groups. First, we should understand the basic concepts related to virus transmission, keeping in mind viral population numbers and the complexity of viral populations.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><label>7.2</label><title>Reproductive ratio as a predictor of epidemic potential.

In contrast, MV is highly transmissible, thus explaining frequent outbreaks as soon as a sizable population stops vaccinating its infants. This is an important problem, fueled by antivaccination campaigns without scientific basis. Since some of the parameters that enter the basic equations of viral dynamics depend on the nucleotide sequence of the viral genome, mutations may alter <italic>R</italic>

). Viral replication, fitness, load, transmissibility, and virulence are all interconnected factors that contribute to virus persistence in its broader sense of virus being perpetuated in nature. These parameters can affect both disease progression in an infected individual and transmissibility at the epidemiological level.<fig id="f0015"><label>Figure&#x000a0;7.2</label><caption><p>Displacement of a virus variant by another in the field by virtue of the latter displaying a higher <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> value.

The larger the population size and genetic heterogeneity of the virus in an infected individual, the higher will be the likelihood that independent transmission events have different outcomes. Individual susceptible hosts will receive subsets of related but nonidentical genomes. In a bright article that emphasized the molecular evidence and medical implications of quasispecies in viruses, J.J. Holland and colleagues wrote the following statement: &#x0201c;Therefore, the acute effects and subtle chronic effects of infections will differ not only because we all vary genetically, physiologically, and immunologically, but also because we all experience a different array of quasispecies challenges. These facts are easily overlooked by clinicians and scientists because disease syndromes are often grossly similar for each type of virus, and because it would appear to make no difference in a practical sense. However, for the person who develops Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome following a common cold, or for the individual who remains healthy despite many years of HIV-1 infection, for example, it may make all the difference in the world&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Holland et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>). The ever increasing number of identified human genes whose allelic forms influence viral infections provides strong support for the predictions of Holland et al. Indeterminacies in the process of virus spread can be viewed as an extension of&#x000a0;the diversification due to bottleneck events in the case of virus transmission, as visualized in Figs.&#x000a0;6.1 and 6.2 in Chapter 6, when dealing with the limitations of the virus samples retrieved from an infected host as the starting material for experimental evolution approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>7.3</label><title>Rates of virus evolution in nature</title><p id="p0220">Despite a necessarily approximate and imprecise knowledge of how many and which types of genomes participate in successive horizontal and vertical transmissions, we can obtain an overall estimate of the rate at which viruses evolve in nature. This is commonly done by comparing consensus genomic nucleotide sequences of viruses isolated at different times during an outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic.</p><p id="p0225">The rate of evolution (also termed as the rate of fixation or rate of accumulation of mutations) is generally expressed as substitutions per nucleotide and year (s/nt/y). The term fixation is not the most adequate when dealing with virus evolution given that the term refers to a consensus that, in addition to being an average of the real sequences, has a fleeting dominance. However, the term is frequently used in the literature of general genetics and virus evolution. The rate of evolution is calculated from genetic distances between consensus viral genomic sequences of successive viral samples from a single persistently or acutely infected host, or from different host individuals infected at different times. Rates of evolution are only indirectly related to mutation rates and mutation frequencies that do not include a time factor in them. There have been several comparisons of rates of evolution for viruses that document the differences between RNA and DNA viruses (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Hanada et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Domingo, 2007</xref>). As was the case for mutant spectra (<xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">Section 3.3</xref> in Chapter 3), some DNA viruses attain rates of evolution in nature that are very similar to those typical of RNA viruses (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Duffy and Holmes, 2008</xref>).

The latter values may result from the selective agent targeting a replicating herpes simplex virus that has produced multiple variants, while the overall slow rate of evolution may be influenced by periods of latency. Slow evolution is expected for retroviruses such as human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) whose life cycles are dominated by the integrated provirus stage, with the viruses following the clonal expansion of their host cells (<xref rid="bib90" ref-type="bibr">Melamed et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Kulkarni and Bangham, 2018</xref>). Some single-stranded DNA viruses display rates of evolution typical of the rapidly evolving RNA viruses (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;7.1</xref>).</p><p id="p0235">Different genes of the same virus set may show different rates of evolution (i.e., the polymerase and other nonstructural proteins may evolve more slowly than structural proteins). Thus, a rate of evolution is far from being a universal feature of a virus. A comparison of rates of synonymous substitutions (under the assumption that synonymous substitutions do not affect protein function; see Chapter 2 for limitations of considering synonymous mutations as neutral) for several RNA viruses, yielded a range of evolutionary rates of 6&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> to 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> synonymous substitutions per synonymous site per year (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Hanada et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>). The values were recalculated from primary phylogenetic data using maximum likelihood (ML) (<xref rid="s0060" ref-type="sec">Section 7.6</xref>), under the assumption of the molecular clock, and inference of the ancestral nucleotide sequences at the tree nodes. The five orders of magnitude variation were attributed mainly to the degree of virus replication rather than to differences in error rate. We will deal with the molecular clock hypothesis (constant rate of accumulation of mutations) in <xref rid="s0035" ref-type="sec">Section 7.3.3</xref>, but the major features of virus evolution studied in previous chapters (mainly those typical of mutant swarm-forming RNA and DNA viruses) should make us skeptical of similar evolution rates in different biological contexts. Rate variations were documented with HIV-1 subpopulations in different compartments of the human brain (<xref rid="bib123" ref-type="bibr">Salemi et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). The data did not fit a &#x0201c;global&#x0201d; molecular clock for the virus in the brain, and &#x0201c;local&#x0201d; clocks showed that meninges and temporal lobe HIV-1 subpopulations evolved 30 and 100 times faster, respectively, than other HIV-1 populations in the brain. It is believed that these differences were due to random drift of viral sequences rather than selection for some genome types. An additional complication is that even restricting virus isolations to the same biological material in a standard epidemiological setting, several measurements indicated discontinuities in evolutionary rates. The discontinuities had at least two origins: the nonlinear effect of time, and some unique features of evolution occurring inside an infected host. These points are examined next.</p><sec id="s0025"><label>7.3.1</label><title>Influence of the time of sampling</title><p id="p0240">It has been known for decades that the calculated rates of virus evolution in nature depend on the genomic region analyzed and the time interval between the isolation of the viral samples on which the calculations are based.

The authors proposed a cocirculation of variants that belonged to different evolutionary lineages. If multiple evolutionary pathways coexist in a given geographical area, and they establish a network of lineages that evolve with time, variations of calculated rates of evolution are expected, and they may distort the actual rate of evolution of individual lineages.</p><p id="p0245">A second early observation was made during an episode of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Spain. Estimates of the rate of evolution of the virus ranged from&#x000a0;&#x0003c;4&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> to 4&#x000a0;&#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>

Cocirculation of multiple heterogeneous foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) samples (&#x0201c;evolving quasispecies&#x0201d;) was proposed. The result to be emphasized here is that the calculated rates of evolution were extremely high (higher than 10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>

Some viruses remain infectious in the environment for prolonged time periods, until they reach a susceptible host in which to initiate replication rounds. This is the case of viruses transmitted by the fecal-oral route, such as enteroviruses. FMDV can adhere and remain infectious on many objects (fomites), including dust particles, food products with neutral pH, or insects that can transport the virus mechanically. Infectious FMDV can traverse long distances (many kilometers) on dust particles, people, trains, and the like. Even if some infectivity is lost, a few infectious particles are sufficient to infect an animal (<xref rid="bib125" ref-type="bibr">Sellers, 1971</xref>, <xref rid="bib126" ref-type="bibr">Sellers, 1981</xref>). There are some classic examples of long-distance transport of FMDV, a virus subjected to close scrutiny due to its economic impact. One is the spread of SAT1 and A22 FMDV during the 1960s in Turkey along the railway line from the cattle-raising region of Lake Van to slaughterhouses in Istanbul [this and other examples are described in (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Brooksby, 1981</xref>)].

However, subpopulations of the most environment-resistant particles, or particles that adhere best to the transporter object, may bias the composition of the virus that will reach an animal to pursue replication. Such events, occurring for 10 to 100 rounds of host infections, render the appalling virus diversity described in Chapter 1 a bit less appalling. Since several additional environmental circumstances are changeable and unpredictable, it is unlikely that rates of viral evolution in nature can remain invariant on the basis of some internal principle of constant mutation occurrence (as if the accumulation of mutations was as monotonous as radioactive decay!).</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>7.3.2</label><title>Interhost versus intrahost rate of evolution</title><p id="p0265">Additional observations against constant mutational input with time have been made with HIV-1 and human and avian hepatitis B virus (HBV). The main finding is that interhost rates of evolution are lower than intrahost rates, even under a comparable set of epidemiological parameters. Several proposals have been made to account for this difference. A.J. Leslie and colleagues described cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-escape mutants of HIV-1 from infected patients.

Strong intrahost selective pressures and reversion of a part of the selected mutations upon transmission to a susceptible individual is one of the possible mechanisms behind diminished evolutionary rates when viruses from multiple host individuals are compared (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7.4</xref>

Ancestral sequences of HIV-1 in infected individuals may arise by the activation of proviral sequences kept in the form of quasispecies memory. In this case, we refer to the type of molecular memory defined as a reservoir, anatomical, or cellular memory in Section 5.5 of Chapter 5. A related type of reservoir memory is found in HBV, in the form of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) that persists in the nuclei of infected hepatocytes, and acts as a template for the synthesis of pregenomic RNA and viral mRNAs (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Kay and Zoulim, 2007</xref>). In this case, a record of ancient sequences is registered in the cccDNA. It should be noted that memory levels are dependent on fitness values, as evidenced experimentally with FMDV and expected from the theoretical basis of memory implementation (Chapter 5). In consequence, the most abundant memory genomes established early in an infection might be those displaying the highest fitness early in infection, and they might be better adapted to initiate infections than to sustain them (<xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7.4</xref>).</p><p id="p0280">Additional mechanisms for the time dependence of evolutionary rates have been suggested for HBV. In a 17 years follow-up of several patients, HBV diversity increased during periods of active host immune response, and viral copy numbers decreased. When the immune response was weak, viral genome diversity decreased, and viral copy numbers increased; these periods are expected to be those of high transmissibility (<xref rid="bib153" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="p0285">Endogenous hepadnaviruses are present in the genomes of several organisms.

Again, the intrahost evolutionary rate was higher than the interhost rate, and the latter decreased with the number of transmissions. The differences were mainly due to nonsynonymous substitutions at limited sites. These observations were interpreted as a rapid switch of HBV between colonization (invasion of new host) and adaptation (quasispecies optimization in the new host). The authors referred to the colonization-adaptation trade-off (CAT) model or alternations of virus facing an environment marked by a limited host immune response followed by a period of active immune response. In the former environment, viruses displaying rapid replication are selected, while in the latter environment, HBV escape mutants with lower productivity are selected. In each transmission, when the virus reaches a new host, the previously adapted subpopulations are overgrown by the rapidly replicating ones. Again, cccDNA can serve as a reservoir of ancient sequences.</p><p id="p0295">In agreement with these proposals, rates of evolution measured in a single infected individual persistently infected with a continuously replicating virus tend to be higher than those observed with the same viruses isolated from different individuals (<xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Morse, 1994</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Domingo et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Domingo, 2006</xref>).

According to the clock hypothesis, the rate of accumulation of mutations coincides with the rate at which mutations arise in infected individuals.

Even for neutral evolution, spatial asymmetries in populations are sufficient to perturb the molecular clock rate, as documented with a theoretical model of broad applicability (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Allen et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). However, quasispecies and the operation of a clock are not totally irreconcilable.

For the latter group of viruses, the same vaccine can maintain its efficacy over many decades; examples are rabies virus (RV) and MV, two RNA viruses that show remarkable genetic diversity in nature, and estimates of mutation rates and frequencies comparable to other RNA viruses. Antigenic constancy is a determinant of long-lasting immunity after infection or vaccination. MV infection produces lifelong immunity (probably as a result of several factors) while patients that have cleared the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be reinfected by the same virus.

Other picornaviruses have intermediate numbers of serotypes: three in the case of PV and seven in the case of FMDV.

First, as a conceptual precision, we assume that the number of serotypes is essentially determined by amino acid sequences located in the virus particle and that either directly or indirectly can affect the interaction of the virus with antibodies. Neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies may contribute to serological distinctions, depending on the assays performed for serotyping. Serum neutralization tests will identify differences in sensitivity to neutralization, while Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) tests will capture reactivity by all raised antibodies.</p><p id="p0375">Antibodies can be obtained from infected natural hosts, or from some laboratory animals which are not a natural host for the virus. An ensemble of amino acid residues forms an antigenic determinant which is usually composed of multiple epitopes [defined here as a unit of interaction with a monoclonal antibody (MAb)]. Epitopes can be either continuous (also termed linear) or discontinuous (also termed structured). Continuous epitopes are those whose primary amino acid sequence has the information to react with the cognate antibody. Discontinuous epitopes are those whose reactive residues come from distant positions of the same protein or residues of different proteins. Many overlapping epitopes can be found within the same antigenic site. Epitopes can include modified amino acid residues such as glycosylated amino acids. Reactivity of discontinuous epitopes with the cognate antibody is generally lost as a consequence of denaturation of the proteins that form the epitope.</p><p id="p0380">With these introductory clarifications, we are now in a position to examine the different possibilities listed above to account for differences in the number of serotypes among genetically variable viruses.</p><p id="p0385">There is no correlation between limited antigenic diversity and low average mutation rate. Mutation rates and frequencies for RNA viruses fall in the range of 10<sup>&#x02212; 5</sup> to 10<sup>&#x02212; 3</sup> substitutions per nucleotide (Chapter 2). However, mutation rates along a viral genome are not uniform, as evidenced by the occurrence of hot spots for variation. Influences such as nucleotide sequence context or RNA structure may conceivably alter mutation rates. It was proposed that a predicted double-stranded RNA at the region encoding the major antigenic site of FMDV might increase the polymerase error rate locally and give rise to multiple amino acid substitutions (<xref rid="bib156" ref-type="bibr">Weddell et&#x000a0;al., 1985</xref>). While at some specific sites polymerases may be more error-prone than average, subsequent evidence for FMDV indicated that antigenic variation is due to amino acid substitutions at different antigenic sites and that even variation at the major site can be mediated by distant amino acids on the viral capsid (<xref rid="bib117" ref-type="bibr">Rowlands et&#x000a0;al., 1983</xref>, <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Geysen et&#x000a0;al., 1984</xref>, <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">Mateu et&#x000a0;al., 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Feigelstock et&#x000a0;al., 1996</xref>). Later molecular studies have not provided evidence that viruses may have a large number of serotypes because their polymerases are more error-prone when copying regions encoding amino acids that belong to antigenic sites. Therefore, the possibility that differences in mutation rates can determine a different number of circulating serotypes is unlikely.</p><p id="p0390">Most viruses include multiple antigenic sites, and antibodies are raised against several surface proteins to produce an array of neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibody molecules. Taking picornaviruses again as an example, the number of antigenic domains (each composed of multiple epitopes) varies between one and four (<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">Mateu, 1995</xref>, <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Mateu, 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Fry and Stuart, 2010</xref>).

Thus, the second proposal is unlikely to be correct.</p><p id="p0395">The difference among classification assays argument does not have an easy response. Indeed, there is no universal procedure used to classify viruses serologically, and therefore, strictly speaking, there is the possibility that a different number of serotypes could be obtained using alternative classification procedures. FMDV is a pertinent example. Its seven serotypes are defined on the basis of a very stringent test that cannot be performed with human viruses for obvious reasons: the absence of cross-protection resulting from vaccination or infection with a given FMDV. Infection or vaccination with FMDV of one serotype does not confer protection against FMDV of a different serotype. In contrast, the subtype classification of FMDV was based on serological assays, such as cross-neutralization or complement fixation tests, usually using sera raised in guinea pigs. These assays allowed classification of FMDV in more than 65 serological subtypes. Subtyping was stopped when it was realized that using increasingly discriminatory assays such as reactivity with MAbs, virtually any new isolate could define a new subtype [(<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Mateu et&#x000a0;al., 1988</xref>); see (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Domingo et&#x000a0;al., 1990</xref>, <xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">Sobrino and Domingo, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Mateu, 2017</xref>) for review of serotype and subtype classification of FMDV]. Despite these considerations, it is unlikely that serological assays using in&#x000a0;vitro tests would be responsible for a 100-fold difference between two human pathogens such as HRV and HAV. Thus, it does not seem justified to attribute antigenic constancy to an artifact derived from diagnostic procedures.</p><p id="p0400">More extensive virus circulation will favor genetic and antigenic diversification, and a single serotype may evolve into multiple serotypes. What we describe today as the antigenic profile of virus groups is a snapshot of an evolving process. Genotype differentiation is actually being witnessed during the expansion of HCV pandemics, partly due to a true genetic diversification of the virus as it circulated over the last decades, and partly due to increasing capacity of virus surveillance, and molecular and phylogenetic tools for genome analysis. The reader can find an illustration of this point by comparing the expanded phylogenetic HCV tree from six to seven genotypes and the subtype ramifications, published by P. Simmonds and colleagues in 1993 and 2014 [compare (<xref rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr">Simmonds et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>) and (<xref rid="bib134" ref-type="bibr">Smith et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>)], and continuing new subtype identification (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Hedskog et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Although it cannot be excluded that time might tend to equalize the number of serotypes among viruses, current evidence does not justify blaming differences in the extent of virus circulation to settle this issue.</p><p id="p0405">We come to constraints at antigenic sites that limit the number of accepted amino acid substitutions as a model for antigenic invariance. It is the preferred model of molecular virologists. The initial concept was proposed by M.G. Rossmann, in his canyon hypothesis (<xref rid="bib116" ref-type="bibr">Rossmann, 1989</xref>), based on studies with HRV14. A canyon in the virus preserves the receptor-binding site inside while permitting amino acid substitutions that affect antigenicity, without consequences for receptor recognition. A physical and functional separation between receptor and antibody binding allows extensive antigenic variation. Clearly, in many viruses, there is an overlap between antigenic and receptor recognition sites (Section 4.5 in Chapter 4), that could limit antigenic variation. A difference in constraints is also supported by a structural comparison carried out by J.M. Casasnovas and his colleagues of the interaction of PV and HRV16 with their respective cellular receptors that revealed a receptor-binding site more accessible in PV than in HVR16, rendering the latter suited to escape antibody neutralization (<xref rid="bib162" ref-type="bibr">Xing et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>). This would render HRV a picornavirus prone to antigenic variation, as indeed found in nature. Thus, constraints imposed by the requirement to interact with the cellular receptor may explain the limited capacity for antigenic diversification, and perhaps with the contribution of other influences, the puzzle of widely different antigenic types despite similarly high genome mutability.

Thus, it is possible that following selection by an antibody, some mutants may decrease in frequency due to a fitness cost, or that their level is maintained due to additional compensatory mutations acquired by the replicating genomes (<xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7.6</xref>
). Viruses that are highly constrained for antigenic variation may be diagnosed through fitness decrease of MARM mutants despite their occurring at similar rates as those that affect unconstrained sites. This is a concept similar to the distinction between fitness and function that we made in Section 5.8 of Chapter 5. That is, the occurrence of an antigenic change does not guarantee that the change will be perpetuated in nature and contribute to natural antigenic diversification. Again, fitness should be considered as a relevant parameter, and fitness effects on antigenic stability have been largely unexplored.<fig id="f0035"><label>Figure&#x000a0;7.6</label><caption><p>Stability of selected mutant subpopulations when selective pressure is removed. This scheme is the same portrayed in Fig.&#x000a0;3.6 of Chapter 3, but shifted toward the right of the time scale. Five different colors have been chosen to depict fluctuations of four genomic classes. In a real population, thousands of genomes may be involved in each infected cell. In the present diagram, the red line represents genomes selected for their resistance to neutralizing monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Once the antibody pressure is removed, the mutant genomes may remain dominant either because the relevant substitutions do not affect viral fitness or because compensatory mutations have been acquired (top diagram). In contrast, upon removal of the antibody pressure, the proportion of selected genomes may fade with time due to a fitness cost and absence of compensatory mutations (bottom diagram). In the latter case, the antibody-resistant mutant will not contribute to the long-term antigenic diversification of the virus.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="f07-06-9780128163313"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s0055"><label>7.5</label><title>Comparing viral genomes.

A defined phylogenetic group may include viruses that produce similar or different pathology. This is because the capacity of a virus to cause disease may depend on modest genetic change (i.e., one or a few amino acid substitutions) that does not alter its position in a phylogenetic tree. It is important to emphasize that, independently of the time frame considered, the tips of phylogenetic trees are a cloud of mutants, that genomes within the cloud are the origin of future diversification pathways, and that individual cloud components may differ in pathogenic potential. <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7.7</xref>

The disease had an acute phase of variable duration and intensity, followed by a chronic phase, sometimes with a late onset of symptoms. The disease showed a seasonal character with a maximum incidence in late winter. The first cases were recorded in Eastern Europe in 1915, and the disease was first described by Baron C. Von Economo in Vienna in 1917. During 1920&#x02013;23 the disease attained pandemic proportions, although the number of cases and mortality were limited.

At the time it was suspected that a virus similar to IV or some picornavirus might have been the etiological agent of this disease, but no proof could be provided.

The alphavirus western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) was an important human and animal pathogen in the Americas during the first part of the 20th century. The number of isolations of WEEV both from vertebrate and insect species declined during the second half of the 20th century, and two main mechanisms have been proposed: (i)&#x000a0;fitness decrease due to operation of Muller&#x02019;s ratchet (concept described in Section 6.5 of Chapter 6), with elimination of virulence-associated mutations by genetic drift, or (ii) ecological factors such as decline of population numbers of susceptible host species, combined with increased vaccine coverage in horses (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bergren et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). It is not clear which is the major mechanism behind the decline, and whether it represents a firm, irreversible trend, or genetic and ecological factors may vary to produce a reemergence of this virus as a pathogen.</p><p id="p0510">FMDV, the agent of the economically most important disease of cattle and other farm animals circulated until recently as seven different serotypes termed A, O, C, Asia 1, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3, and each serotype as multiple subtypes and antigenic variants (review in <xref rid="bib136" ref-type="bibr">Sobrino and Domingo, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, in the 1980s, the incidence of serotype C FMDV decreased to the point that at the beginning of the 21st century this FMDV serotypes was considered nearly extinct and its eradication feasible. It cannot be totally excluded, however, that type C FMDV is replicating in some persistently infected ruminant in some remote part of our planet and that the virus reemerges again. If not, its ecological niche has been occupied by FMDVs of other serotypes. This is one important issue behind virus eradication (smallpox in the late 1970s or rinderpest in 2011): the possibility that the niche left by an eradicated pathogen is occupied by a related pathogen.

Their phylogenetic analysis suggests that PV could originate from a C-cluster coxsackie A virus through amino acid substitutions in the capsid that led to a change of receptor specificity (other cases are discussed in Chapter 4). They generated chimeras of PV and its putative ancestors, and some of them were viable and pathogenic for transgenic mice expressing the PV receptor. The authors suggest that in a world without antiPV neutralizing antibodies, coxsackieviruses may mutate to generate a new PV-like agent.</p><p id="p0515">Thus, despite virology being a very recent scientific discipline, there is ample evidence of the emergence of new viral pathogens, as well as some cases of extinction due to human interventions, and possible extinctions by natural influences.

Emergence is defined as the appearance of a new pathogen for a host, while reemergence often refers to the reappearance of a viral pathogen, following a period of absence. Being a popular topic, the reader will find numerous books and reviews on the subject. It is worth emphasizing that in the 20th century many authors took the lead in emphasizing the problem of viral emergences and the need to investigate the underlying mechanisms, notably S.S. Morse and J. Lederberg [see several chapters of <xref rid="bib95" ref-type="bibr">Morse, 1993</xref>, <xref rid="bib96" ref-type="bibr">Morse, 1994</xref>]. Given the adaptive capacity of viruses, in particular, the RNA viruses, the reader will certainly suspect that genetic variation of viruses must be one of the factors involved in viral emergences. Indeed, most of the high-impact new viral diseases recorded recently or historically are due to RNA viruses. A statement by J. Lederberg reflects our vulnerability in the face of the nearly unlimited potential of viruses to vary: &#x0201c;Abundant sources of genetic variation exist for viruses to learn new tricks, not necessarily confined to what happens routinely or even frequently&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Lederberg, 1993</xref>). The situation is even more complex because a genetic variation of viruses is only one of many ingredients that promote the introduction of new viral pathogens in the human population. A report issued by the U.S. Institute of Medicine in 2003, analyzed and documented 13 factors that, individually or in combination, participate in the emergence of microbial disease.

Viral population numbers and the number of transmissible particles can be largely amplified in immunocompromised individuals, and have been termed super-spreaders; they can contribute large amounts of variant viruses to the transmission lottery (<xref rid="bib114" ref-type="bibr">Rocha et&#x000a0;al., 1991</xref>, <xref rid="bib107" ref-type="bibr">Paunio et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Gavrilin et&#x000a0;al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Khetsuriani et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib132" ref-type="bibr">Small et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">Odoom et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib158" ref-type="bibr">Woolhouse, 2017</xref>). Concerning the recipient hosts, the higher the number of potentially susceptible hosts that come into contact with an infected donor, the higher the probability of establishment of an emergent infection. It is likely that the advent of agricultural practices some 10,000 years ago, combined with increased contacts between humans and animals, inaugurated a time of new viral emergences. In the new scenario, viruses could shift from a persistent (low interhost transmission) mode into an acute (high interhost transmission) infection mode.</p><p id="p0570">Not only population numbers are important, but the connections between the spatial habitats of a potential donor and recipient hosts are also highly relevant (<xref rid="f0055" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;7.10</xref>
). As correctly emphasized by S.S. Morse, changes in viral traffic may allow viruses to come near potential new hosts that had never been encountered before. Several sociological and ecological factors that can impact directly or indirectly the accessibility to an infected donor play a role. A typical example that connects several of the points listed in <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="boxed-text">Box&#x000a0;7.2</xref> is provided by the increase of arbovirus vectors during a humid season due to the climate change because insect larvae can proliferate on water reservoirs. Increased travel may put humans infected with arboviruses in contact with the flourishing insect vector population. Climate change may modify the migration routes of some birds, again putting these potential vertebrate hosts in contact with infected animals and insect vectors.<fig id="f0055"><label>Figure&#x000a0;7.10</label><caption><p>Types of habitats that may limit or facilitate interaction between hosts that can potentially establish an emergent infection in a local habitat.

In 1975, there were five megacities in the world (meaning cities with more than 10 million human population) while in 2018 the number was 33, with a projection of 43 for 2030. Humans in close contact are, in addition, highly mobile. At present, it is possible to go around the world in about 36&#x000a0;h (if you choose the adequate airports) which represents a 1000-fold increase in spatial mobility of humans relative to the mobility in the year 1800. The 2014&#x02013;15 Ebola epidemics in Africa was made worse by the breakdown of public health measures, poverty, and lack of political will of local and international agencies to put efforts in stopping transmission; Ebola outbreaks in Africa continue at the time of this writing. Underdeveloped countries are a reservoir of viral infections that represent a global threat due to several of the points listed in <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="boxed-text">Box&#x000a0;7.2</xref> [(<xref rid="bib135" ref-type="bibr">Smolinski et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>); several chapters of <xref rid="bib131" ref-type="bibr">Singh (2014)</xref>].</p><p id="p0580">Concerning the establishment and dissemination steps, the molecular mechanisms of quasispecies optimization in the new host environment apply. The underlying events are those presided by the extended Darwinian concepts of variation, competition, and selection, with the perturbations derived from stochastic effects (treated in different chapters of this book).</p><p id="p0585">It is worth emphasizing parallelism between the steps involved in viral disease emergence and the steps that mediate entrance and establishment of any organism in a new habitat, which is a process well studied in ecology (<xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">van Driesche and van Driesche, 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><label>7.7.2</label><title>Complexity revisited</title><p id="p0590">The meanings of complexity in virology were discussed in Section 3.9 of Chapter 3, one of them being the inability to explain a whole as the sum of its parts (<xref rid="bib138" ref-type="bibr">Sol&#x000e9; and Goodwin, 2000</xref>). R.V. Sol&#x000e9; and B. Goodwin define the sciences of complexity as &#x0201c;the study of those systems in which there is no simple and predictable relationship between levels, between the properties of parts and of wholes.&#x0201d; Several levels of complexity can be identified in the events that give rise to the emergence of a viral disease (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Domingo, 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib119" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000e1;iz et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). One level of complexity concerns the behavior of viral populations which is often determined by interactions among components of mutant spectra in a way that cannot be predicted by the individual components of the population, even if we knew them!</p><p id="p0595">The second level of complexity that can have an impact on the emergence of viral disease stems from the environmental, sociological, and ecological variables that must converge for a virus from some animal reservoir to come into contact and successfully infect a new host, for example, a human. Despite close surveillance, the emergences of viral diseases are unpredictable. Experts anticipate new influenza pandemics to arise somewhere in Asia from the avian reservoirs of IV; however, in 2009, the new influenza pandemic originated in Central America. Paradoxically, despite a general agreement that surveillance of human and zoonotic virus reservoirs should be intensified using new molecular tools (i.e., mutant spectrum analyses to go beyond the consensus sequences), the reality is that what we have learned are the reasons why viral emergences are unpredictable. The &#x0201c;abundant sources of genetic variation&#x0201d; that was emphasized by J. Lederberg (see <xref rid="s0070" ref-type="sec">Section 7.7.1</xref>) should be extended to refer to &#x0201c;abundant sources of complexity in viral emergences.&#x0201d; For the time being, we have to be ready to react once the emergence has already occurred. Research funding agencies have a lot to do in favoring &#x0201c;reactive&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;preventive&#x0201d; antiviral policies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0080"><label>7.8</label><title>Overview and concluding remarks</title><p id="p0600">Viruses have survived because they have undergone multiple rounds of vertical and horizontal transmission in their host organisms and because occasionally they have found new suitable hosts where to replicate. Among the many parameters involved, in this chapter, we have emphasized the relevance of virus and host population numbers for sustained transmissions and the long-term maintenance of viral entities. A point that is often either ignored or not sufficiently emphasized is that the quasispecies nature of viral populations introduces an element of uncertainty regarding which types of mutants are transmitted to new hosts. Despite being a complication that cannot be easily handled, it is a fact that should stimulate new approaches to the surveillance of virus transmission and the identification of the founder viruses in new infections.</p><p id="p0605">A steady accumulation of mutations during the evolution of organisms was a well-accepted proposal that agreed with the neutral theory of molecular evolution developed last century. One suspects that this agreement resulted in a premature preference for a regular clock of steady incorporation of mutations to work in the case of viruses. The evidence is that there are multiple molecular mechanisms that render the operation of a molecular clock for viruses very unlikely, and perhaps fortuitous in some cases. Several possible mechanisms of variable evolutionary rates have been discussed, and further clarification is expected from entire genome sequencing applied to viruses during outbreaks and epidemics. Viruses are probably not the best biological systems to obtain experimental evidence in support of the clock hypothesis.</p><p id="p0610">A puzzling and pendent issue in viral evolution is the interpretation of the widely different number of viral serotypes, despite viruses sharing comparably large mutation rates and frequencies. Different possibilities have been examined, and a slight preference for variable constraints acting on the amino acid residues that determine the antigenic properties of viruses has been expressed. Again, additional work is necessary to solve this interesting problem.</p><p id="p0615">Procedures for sequence alignments and the establishment of phylogenetic relationships among related viruses have been summarized, with some indications to find useful URL sites for sequence alignment and processing of large data sets. The comparison of genomic sequences (and their encoded amino acids) of new viral isolates with those of the viruses characterized to date is important given the increasing number of new viruses discovered in all kinds of natural habitats.</p><p id="p0620">The important problem of viral emergences and reemergences has been treated with emphasis on the concept of complexity. There are multiple interacting influences that converge to produce the emergence or reemergence of a viral pathogen, one of them being the heterogeneity of viral populations at the genetic and phenotypic level. Despite considerable methodological progress, we are still in the realm of uncertainty regarding the prediction of when and where a new viral pathogen will emerge (see Summary Box).<boxed-text id="b0020"><caption><title>Summary Box</title></caption><p id="bpar0105">
