<p>Human-to-human transmission is occurring, meaning that more COVID-19 cases are expected to be reported in the future, which can potentially cause disruptions of global public health systems and economic losses [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Although sustained human-to-human transmission is expected in China, this transmission cannot be quantified with the current epidemiological data available. Prevention measures are implemented globally, and investigations are ongoing to find the source of the disease and to understand more about the virus's characteristics, illness severity, and transmission routes. Major gaps are presented as the majority of what we know about the virus is based on similar coronaviruses, but the work on treatment is promising. In order to have a better understanding of the new virus, countries should work on providing reliable data through openness and data sharing, as well as conducting further researches on the reported cases. In addition, countries should keep working on improving the preventive measures implemented to reduce the number of infected patients and transmissions at the same time.
