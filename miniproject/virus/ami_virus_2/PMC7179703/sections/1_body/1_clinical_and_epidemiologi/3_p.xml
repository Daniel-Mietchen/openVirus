<p>Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] addressed the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases by collecting and analyzing data from the first 425 laboratory-confirmed cases in Wuhan. The results showed that “most of the infected cases were elderly, males and with reported exposure to Huanan seafood market or to another person with respiratory symptoms. In addition, most of those who died from the virus had underlying medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases or diabetes” [

The study's findings provide an overall useful look at the characteristics of COVID-19 patients; however, they cannot eliminate the fact that some reported cases were females, young individuals and with no previous contact or exposure, which should also be addressed and considered in future studies.
