 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] gave information about the risk of infection from close personal contact and estimated the disease incubation period by tracing the travel history of 5 family members who made a visit to Wuhan city from December 29th until January 4th. The study's clinical, epidemiological, laboratory and radiological findings confirmed COVID-19 infection in the 5 members, in addition to the sixths member who did not visit the city but was found to be infected as well, suggesting a human-to-human transmission.
