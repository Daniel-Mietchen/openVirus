<p>The basic reproduction number (R0) for the disease transmission was calculated. According to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], R0 for COVID-19 is estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI 1.4-3.9), which is more than 1, indicating infection transmission to the population and estimating that each COVID-19 patient is transmitting the virus to 2.2 individuals. Another study by Tang et al. [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] estimated the basic reproduction number using multiple methods and “reported large-scale outbreak with R0 equal to 6.47 (95% CI 5.71-7.23) indicating higher transmission of COVID-19.” This high reproduction number supports the beliefs of disease transmission between 3 and 4 generations. As for the modes of transmission, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explain that COVID-19 can spread by close contact from an infected person to another through respiratory droplets during coughing or sneezing. Transmission by touching contaminated surfaces or objects, and then touching the eyes or nose is still unclear and requires the collection of further data [
