<p id="p0015">Among the various types of PPE, surgical masks, N95 respirators, and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) are currently mostly used. Surgical masks (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ) are usually loose-fitting and disposable; they create a physical barrier between the mouth and nose of the wearer and potential contaminants in the immediate environment and vary by quality and levels of protection. N95 respirators (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ) have the advantage of blocking at least 95% of aerosol (&lt;5 μm) and droplet-size (5-50 μm) particles. Their use requires an initial and periodic fit testing, and they are associated with poor tolerance by users because of breathing resistance and heat. N95 respirators correspond to European filtering face piece 2 standard (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ), which have at least a 94% filter capacity. PAPRs (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ) are battery-powered blowers that provide positive airflow through a filter. The type of filter is dictated by the amount of airborne contaminant exposure; they provide head and neck protection and do not require fit testing, especially if they do not have a tight-fitting face piece. However, PAPRs are usually associated with increased perception of eye dryness and are by far the most expensive PPE against respiratory infections.
