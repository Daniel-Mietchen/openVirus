<p id="p0010">The severe acute respiratory syndromeâ€“coronavirus 2 outbreak abruptly resulted in the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, almost leading to the collapse of many healthcare systems in the world that were overwhelmed with potentially infectious patients seeking testing and care. In the attempt to prevent the spread of a viral infection to and from healthcare workers, the health community generally relies on the efficacy of personal protective equipment (PPE): gloves, masks, respirators, goggles, face shields, and gowns. PPE, once omnipresent and easily available in the hospital environment, is now scarce and precious. This situation, driven not only by the number of COVID-19 cases but also by misinformation, panic buying, and stockpiling during a pandemic, is of tremendous concern especially for the health community that is at greatest risk for exposure. Digestive endoscopists are among those at highest risk to infection because of aerosolization during procedures. Reducing the use of PPE through the postponement of elective and nonurgent outpatient clinical procedures does not sufficiently compensate for the scarcity of these goods. Moreover, an increase in the production of PPE would require a time interval that many health systems cannot afford given the speed of the spread of the infection.</p>
