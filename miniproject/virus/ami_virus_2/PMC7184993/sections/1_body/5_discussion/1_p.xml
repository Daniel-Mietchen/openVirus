<p id="p0085">Most studies on previous respiratory virus epidemics to date suggest similar efficacy of surgical masks to N95 respirators. A strong protective effect of both masks has in fact been demonstrated, especially when used in combination with other protective measures of hand washing, eye protection, gowns, and gloves. International organizations, first and foremost the World Health Organization, do however recommend healthcare workers to use N95 respirators in high-risk situations such as aerosol-generating procedures. In specific emergency situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of N95 respirators should be restricted among the general public and nonâ€“high-risk medical staff in favor of high-risk healthcare workers. The use of PAPRs should be limited to high-risk healthcare personnel dealing with airborne virus outbreaks. To avoid the excessive waste of PPE, the same respirator can be worn while caring for multiple patients who have the same diagnosis without removing it; respirators maintain their protection when used for extended periods. However, using 1 respirator for longer than 4 hours can lead to discomfort and should be avoided.
