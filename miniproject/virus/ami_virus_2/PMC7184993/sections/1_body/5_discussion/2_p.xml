<p id="p0090">As far as respirator reuse is concerned, overall, UVGI is widely known as an effective and useful decontaminative technique. Its virucidal mechanism was proficiently applied to determine N95 respirator decontamination from viral respiratory agents. The highly energetic, short-wave UVGI at 254 nm was demonstrated to be especially effective in reducing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction influenza RNA, but there are some critical points that need attention. First, an insufficient UVGI dose cannot reach all internal surfaces of respirators and, consequently, can leave active infectious material. On the other hand, an excessive UVGI dose can partially affect the structural integrity of respirators and lower their filtration performance. Furthermore, each PPE can tolerate a maximum number of disinfection cycles depending on its design and type of components; valves, for instance, technically cannot be sterilized with UVGI.</p>
