<p id="p0035">What is reported by this review is in accordance with a classic, highly cited, case-control study carried out in Hong Kong during the severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 that evaluated personal protective practices (handwashing, wearing paper masks, surgical masks or N95 respirators, gloves, and gowns). A multivariate logistic regression conducted to analyze the impact of each protective measure demonstrated that N95 respirators and surgical masks have similar protective effect.
