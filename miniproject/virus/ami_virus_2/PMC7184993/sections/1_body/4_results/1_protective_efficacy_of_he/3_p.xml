<p id="p0040">The equivalence in terms of efficacy between the 2 types of PPE considered was similarly demonstrated in the specific case of influenza. A quantitative assessment of the efficacy of surgical masks and N95 respirators to filter influenza virus in patients with acute influenza infection carried out in 2009 demonstrated that N95 respirators and surgical masks were equally able to prevent the spread of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction–detectable virus when worn correctly by 9 patients with laboratory-conﬁrmed acute influenza.

 </xref> In the same way, in 2009 an RCT comparing the efficacy of surgical masks versus N95 respirators among emergency department nurses during an influenza outbreak demonstrated the equal efficacy between the 2 practices (absolute risk difference, −.73%; 95% confidence interval [CI], −8.8% to 7.3%;

 </xref> The latest RCT available focusing on influenza prevention among 2371 randomized healthcare workers published in September 2019 confirms that surgical masks and N95 respirators do not have significant differences in terms of laboratory-confirmed influenza infection prevention (difference, 1.0%; 95% CI, −.5% to 2.5%;
