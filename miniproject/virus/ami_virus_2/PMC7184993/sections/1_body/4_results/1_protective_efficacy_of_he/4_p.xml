<p id="p0045">A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and RCTs published in 2017 confirmed both PPE to be effective in protecting against severe acute respiratory syndrome (odds ratios, .13 [95% CI, .03-.62] for surgical masks and .12 [95% CI, .06-.26] for N95 respirators). Corresponding to previous reports, N95 respirators did not confer superior protection against viral infections or influenza-like illness compared with surgical masks, but they were demonstrated for the first time to be more effective in protecting against general clinical respiratory illness (relative risk [RR], .47; 95% CI, .36-.62) and laboratory-confirmed bacterial illness (RR, .46; 95% CI, .34-.62).
