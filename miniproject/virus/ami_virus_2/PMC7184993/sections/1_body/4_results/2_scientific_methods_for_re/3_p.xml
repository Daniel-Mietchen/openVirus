 <sub>5</sub>N
 <sub>1</sub> influenza virus were similarly compared in another observational study carried out in 2011: UVGI, microwave-generated steam, and moist heat were compared when used to purify N95 respirators from viral contamination. A highly energetic, short-wave UVGI at 254 nm was demonstrated to be the most effective method in quantitatively reducing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction viral RNA on N95 respirator surfaces.
