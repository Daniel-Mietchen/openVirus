<p id="p0060">Disposable filtering face-piece respirators are not approved for routine decontamination and reuse as standard of care, but a possible strategy in a PPE shortage during specific emergency situations is to reuse them after a proper biologic decontamination process to render infectious material inactive. It is very important that the treatment does not deteriorate the respirator material, thus decreasing its filtering power against respiratory infectious species, or release any toxic residues on the respirator surface. PPE reuse can be realized exclusively by the original healthcare worker. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that decontamination methods such as autoclave, 160Â°C dry heat, 70% isopropyl alcohol, and soap and water cause significant respirator filter degradation, which consequently allows excessive particle penetration levels.
