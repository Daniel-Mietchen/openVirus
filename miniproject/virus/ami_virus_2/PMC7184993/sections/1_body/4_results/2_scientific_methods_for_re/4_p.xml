<p id="p0075">An experimental study conducted in 2015 confirmed that 254-nm UVGI was efficient in decontaminating N95 respirators from viral respiratory agents; the authors evaluated the effect of UVGI not only in terms of filtration performance, but also in terms of structural integrity. UVGI was performed in conditions of controlled humidity and temperature in a custom-made chamber (91 cm × 31 cm × 64 cm high) fitted with two 15-W, T-150, 254-nm ultraviolet C lamps and lined with black felt to minimize reflections. UVGI did not substantially affect the filtration performance or the flow resistance at doses up to 950 J/cm
 <sup>2</sup>. Reduction in structural integrity was reported only for higher doses of UVGI.
