<p id="p0065">An observational study conducted in 2009 during an influenza pandemic compared several ways of decontaminating N95 respirators: ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, microwave oven irradiation, and bleach.

 </xref> These decontaminating processes were evaluated for changes in N95 respirator physical appearance, odor, and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance); however, this study did not assess the efficiency of theÂ decontamination methods to inactivate viable microorganisms. The decontamination methods using microwave oven irradiation and bleach were determined to be the least desirable among the 5 methods tested because of excessive degradation of the respirator surface and unpleasant odor, respectively. UVGI, ethylene oxide, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide were found to be the most promising decontamination methods for respiratory viral agent elimination and respirator integrity maintenance; however, concerns were raised about the throughput capabilities for ethylene oxide and vaporized hydrogen peroxide.
