<p id="p0020">In meeting the challenge of the PPE shortage, it is necessary to underline possible differences in terms of efficacy in preventing viral transmission among the currently most-used PPE to facilitate their rational use. The scarcity of PPE could also be mitigated by identifying an effective reuse technique. The primary aims of this review are therefore to summarize the protective efficacy of masks and respirators in preventing the spread of respiratory infections and to propose a proper biologic decontamination process to reuse respirators.</p>
