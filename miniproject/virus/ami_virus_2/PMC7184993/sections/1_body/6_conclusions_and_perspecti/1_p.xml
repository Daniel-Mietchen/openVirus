<p id="p0095">In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is essential to avoid excessive consumption of PPE and to implement their rational use. Surgical masks and N95 respirators have been demonstrated to be equally efficient in protecting healthcare workers from respiratory viral infection; however, N95 respirators should be used in high-risk situations. Another possible strategy to tackle the PPE shortage is to reuse them after a proper biologic decontamination process. The UVGI method proved to be a valid alternative to decontaminate N95 respirators, but it requires careful consideration in the type of respirator and the biologic target. Further studies testing this technique on different models are an unmet need. The definitive answer to these problems could be found in artificial intelligence and deep learning: These groundbreaking modalities are rapidly growing worldwide, and their application in a pandemic could help to identify high-risk patients and situations and suggest appropriate use and types of PPE, thus saving lives. Although we have faced a pandemic almost every 10 years, to date the problem of shortages in PPE and their inappropriate use has not been solved. Victims of this are first and foremost healthcare workers. The time has come for the historical lessons of previous pandemics to be learned.</p>
