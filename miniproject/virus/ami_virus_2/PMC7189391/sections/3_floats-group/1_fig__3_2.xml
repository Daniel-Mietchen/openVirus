  <p>Genomic organization of SARS-CoV-2. The size of coronavirus genome ranges from 26 to 32 kb and comprises 6–11 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 9680 amino acid polyprotein. The first ORF comprises of approximately 67% of the genome that encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), whereas the remaining ORFs encode for accessory and structural proteins. The nsps includes two viral cysteine proteases, including papain-like protease (nsp3), chymotrypsin-like, 3C-like, or main protease (nsp5), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), helicase (nsp13), and others likely to be involved in the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to nsps, the genome encodes for four major structural proteins including spike surface glycoprotein (S), membrane, nucleocapsid protein (N), envelope (E) and accessory proteins like ORFs</p>
