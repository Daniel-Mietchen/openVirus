  <p>Entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host target cells depends on the binding of spike glycoprotein to the cellular receptor ACE2 for internalization. Internalization results in uncoating of viral RNA into cytoplasm that undergoes translation and generates replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b, which is further cleaved by virus-encoded proteinases into small proteins. The replication of SARS-CoV-2 involves ribosomal frame shifting during the translation process and generates both genomic and multiple copies of subgenomic RNA species by discontinuous transcription required for relevant viral proteins. Assembly of virion takes place via interaction of viral RNA and protein at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex. These virions are subsequently released out of the cells via vesicles via exocytosis</p>
