<p id="Par7">Entry of coronaviruses into host target cells depends on the binding of spike glycoprotein to the cellular receptor and priming of S protein by host cell proteases. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for internalization and TMPRSS2 serine proteases for S protein priming (Hoffmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). Similar to SARS-CoV, the extrapulmonary spread of SARS-CoV-2 may be seen due to the widespread tissue expression of the ACE2 receptor. In addition, studies revealed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 exhibits 10â€“20 times higher affinity as compared to that of SARS-CoV (Wrapp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>). Binding of spike protein to the ACE2 receptor results in conformational changes in spike protein that leads to the fusion of viral envelop protein with host cell membrane following entry via endosomal pathway (Coutard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>; Matsuyama and Taguchi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). This event is followed by the release of viral RNA into the host cytoplasm that undergoes translation and generates replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b that further cleaved by virus encoded proteinases into small proteins. The replication of coronavirus involves ribosomal frame shifting during the translation process and generates both genomic and multiple copies of subgenomic RNA species by discontinuous transcription that encodes for relevant viral proteins. Assembly of virion takes place via interaction of viral RNA and protein at endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex. These virions are subsequently released out of the cells via vesicles (Fig.
