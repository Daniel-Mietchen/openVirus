<p id="Par8">The pathological findings of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients highly resemble that of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infected patients. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood samples showed significant reduction of CD4 and CD8 T cell counts, and their status was found to be hyperactivated as higher proportion of dual positive (HLA-DR and CD38) was seen. Rapid progression of pneumonia was seen in chest X-ray images with some differences between the right and left lung. Histopathological investigation of lung, liver, and heart tissue was performed. Lung biopsy showed cellular fibromyxoid exudates with bilateral diffuse alveolar damage. The right lung showed prominent desquamation of pneumocytes and formation of hyaline membrane, indicating signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), whereas the left lung showed pulmonary edema with formation of hyaline membrane (Xu et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>). The intra-alveolar spaces were characterized by multinucleated syncytial cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes showing virus-induced cytopathic effect. Liver biopsy of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed moderate microvesicular steatosis and mild portal and lobular activity, suggesting that injury might have been caused by the virus or drug induced. A few interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates were observed in the heart tissue. These pathological changes may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2 that may help clinicians to effectively deal with COVID-19 patients.
