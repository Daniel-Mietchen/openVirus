<p id="Par9">Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 might have originated from bats or pangolins. Structural investigations of virus-infected cells reveal the coronavirus-specific morphology of SARS-CoV-2 and the size of the virus (70–90 nm). The size of SARS-CoV-2 genome ranges from 26 to 32 kb and comprises 6–11 ORFs which lacks hemagglutinin-esterase gene. However, it comprises of 5′ and 3′ flanking untranslated regions (UTRs). The spike glycoprotein structure of SARS-CoV-2 resembles the spike protein of SARS-CoV with an RMSD of 3.8 Å. Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 uses the ACE2 receptor for internalization and TMPRSS2 serine proteases for S protein priming. Histopathological investigation of tissues from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients showed virus-induced cytopathic effect with signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome in lung cells.</p>
