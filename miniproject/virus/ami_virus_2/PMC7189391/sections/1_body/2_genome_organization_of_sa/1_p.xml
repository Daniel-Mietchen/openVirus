<p id="Par5">The size of coronavirus genome is in the range of 26 to 32 kb and comprise 6–11 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 9680 amino acid polyproteins (Guo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). The first ORF comprises approximately 67% of the genome that encodes 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps), whereas the remaining ORFs encode for accessory and structural proteins. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 lacks the hemagglutinin-esterase gene. However, it comprises two flanking untranslated regions (UTRs) at 5′ end of 265 and 3′ end of 358 nucleotides. Sequence variation among SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV revealed no significant difference in ORFs and nsps. The nsps includes two viral cysteine proteases including papain-like protease (nsp3), chymotrypsin-like, 3C-like, or main protease (nsp5), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), helicase (nsp13), and others likely to be involved in the transcription and replication of SARS-CoV-2 (Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>). In addition to nsps, four major structural proteins are spike surface glycoprotein (S), membrane, nucleocapsid protein (N), envelope (E) and accessory proteins encoded by ORFs. N-terminal glycosylated ectodomain is present at the N-terminal end of M protein that comprises of three transmembrane domains (TM) and a long C-terminal CT domain (Fig.
