<p id="Par6">The M and E proteins are required for virus morphogenesis, assembly, and budding, whereas S glycoprotein is a fusion viral protein comprising two subunits S1 and S2. The S1 subunit, which shares 70% sequence identity with bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV, comprises signal peptide, N-terminal domain (NTD), and receptor-binding domain (RBD) (Walls et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). Most of the differences were found in the external subdomain that is primarily responsible for interaction of spike with the ACE2 receptor. The ectodomain of spike protein (1–1208 amino acid residues) was cloned, expressed and crystallize to solve the spike glycoprotein structure of SARS-CoV-2. The structure of spike glycoprotein structure of SARS-CoV-2 resembles the spike protein of SARS-CoV with an RMSD of 3.8 Å. The study also reveals that the receptor-binding region (RBD) exhibited the highest structural divergence (Wrapp et al.

The S2 subunit that shares 99% sequence identity with bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV comprises two heptad repeat regions known as HR-N and HR-C, which form the coiled-coil structures surrounded by the protein ectodomain. The S protein has been found to exhibit a furin cleavage site (PRRARS’V) at the interface between S1 and S2 subunits that is processed during the biogenesis (Coutard et al.
