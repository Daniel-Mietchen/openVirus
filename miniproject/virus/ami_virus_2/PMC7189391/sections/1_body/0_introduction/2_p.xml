<p id="Par3">SARS-CoV-2 has been declared as a pandemic, with 1,844,683 confirmed cases and 117,021 deaths globally by 14th April 2020 (World Health Organization 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). To characterize the novel coronavirus, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and throat swabs were collected from nine patients who had visited the Wuhan seafood market during the initial outbreak. Special pathogen-free human airway epithelial (HAE) cells were used for virus isolation. The collected samples were inoculated into the HAE cells through the apical surfaces. HAE cells were monitored for cytopathic effects and supernatant was collected to perform RT-PCR assays. Apical samples were collected for next generation sequencing after three passages. The whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were generated by a combination of Sanger, Illumina, and Oxford nanopore sequencing (Lu et al.

To decipher the mechanism of replication and development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies, understanding the structure of SARS-CoV-2, genome organization, and replication is crucial. Therefore this chapter focuses on the morphology and structure, genomic organization, and replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2.
