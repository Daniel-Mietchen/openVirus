<p id="Par2">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses that belong to the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>. On the basis of genomic organization and phylogenetic relationship, coronaviruses have been classified into the subfamily 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> that consists of four genera 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> (αCoV), 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> (βCoV), 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic> (γCoV), and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> (δCoV) (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>). Evolutionary trend analysis of coronaviruses has revealed that αCoV and βCoV originated from bats and rodents, while γCoV and δCoV were found to have originated from avian species (Ge et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>). The ability of CoVs to cross the species barrier has resulted in some of the pathogenic CoVs. HKU1, NL63, OC43, and 229E CoVs are associated with mild symptoms in humans, whereas severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) are known to cause severe disease (Fehr and Perlman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>). In 2002–2003, SARS-CoV emerged in China with 8000 clinical cases and 800 deaths. Since 2012, MERS-CoV has caused persistent epidemics in the Arabian Peninsula. Both the viruses have been found to originate from bats and then transmitted into intermediate mammalian host civets in the case of SARS-CoV and camels in the case of MERS-CoV and eventually infected humans (Song et al.
