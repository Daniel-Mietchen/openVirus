<p id="Par10">SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged and has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Based on the genomic sequences submitted to NCBI database, the scientific community has analyzed the samples and suggested preventive and therapeutic strategies. Therefore, investigation of genomic diversity in the collected specimens from around the globe needs to be conducted in order to design common, effective therapies and vaccines. In addition, genomic characterization helps us accurately identify the origin and evolution of the virus. Deciphering the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 replication in various cell-based models may help us understand the pathogenesis and identify specific targets to develop effective antiviral drugs.</p>
