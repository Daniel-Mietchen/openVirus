<p id="Par4">SARS-CoV-2 isolated from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal samples were inoculated on the vero cells. In order to identify SARS-CoV-2, inoculated cells were prefixed using 2% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde, and transmission electron microscopy was performed. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 observed by examining infected cells after 3 days post infection. Electron microscopy revealed the coronavirus-specific morphology of SARS-CoV-2 with virus particle sizes ranging from 70 to 90Â nm observed under a wide variety of intracellular organelles, most specifically in vesicles (Park et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). Due to high sequence similarity, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 is speculated to be the same as SARS-CoV (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). The surface viral protein spike, membrane, and envelope of coronavirus are embedded in host membrane-derived lipid bilayer encapsulating the helical nucleocapsid comprising viral RNA (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2004</xref>). The structure of spike (Yan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>) and protease of SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>) has been resolved, which provides an opportunity to develop a newer class of drugs for treatment of COVID-19.
