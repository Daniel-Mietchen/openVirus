 <italic>Two final points deserve special attention: immediate endotracheal intubation and use of bacterial/viral filters</italic>. There is no evidence that neonates need to be immediately intubated in case of respiratory deterioration solely because of COVID-19 infection. First, because the pathophysiology of the disease is different, no cases of neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection have been documented. Second, mechanical ventilation-associated lung injury is clearly an issue when dealing with neonatal lungs.

 </xref> Third, data coming from adults suggests that endotracheal intubation is the major aerosol generating procedure and should not be performed prophylactically.

 </xref> Thus, the only recommended modification for contemporary respiratory care is the use of bacterial/viral hydrophobic filters located at the expiratory part of the systems. Any strategy in such neonates should be tailored to the individual patient, rather than to the disease. This has already been clearly outlined by the Brazilian Pediatric Society and the national Neonatal Resuscitation Program.

 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> It is important to highlight that the addition of a filter, although effective in decreasing viral dispersion, adds dead space and increases system resistance, which could be harmful to preterm infants if left in place for long periods. Therefore, when using these filters, health care providers should be mindful of the potential complications and monitor the infants closely. Also, in infants receiving bubble continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), filters may also increase system resistance, and spot checks of the pressure can guarantee safe application.
