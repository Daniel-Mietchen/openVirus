 <italic>What should neonatal health care providers do about COVID-19?</italic> First, all aspects involved in neonatal care (intensive or not) must be re-evaluated in the context of the pandemic. Normal newborn nurseries, neonatal units of intermediate-level care, and neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) must be prepared and adopt practices that follow the best available evidence for the outbreak. This effort involves guidelines for the following: organization of unit space and/or isolation rooms or special areas for suspected or confirmed cases, policies for visitation by parents and family, and adoption of personal protective equipment (PPE) during delivery of a suspected or positive COVID-19 mother or during neonatal care. Moreover, clear guidelines are needed for all types of procedures in the delivery room or during the hospital stay, such as cord clamping, cleaning of secretions, suction of airways and stomach, use of all the different types of respiratory support, breastfeeding, operational protocols for in-hospital transport (to radiology or operating rooms), transport of outborn neonates, and selection/scheduling of cases that should be tested.
