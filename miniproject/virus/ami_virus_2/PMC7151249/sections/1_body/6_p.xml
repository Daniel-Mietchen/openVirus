 <italic>Can we continue to use current respiratory strategies?</italic> Yes, with a few suggested modifications to address the possibility of aerosol generation and exhaled air dispersion during oxygen administration and ventilatory support.

 </xref> Based on engineering data using adult models, the likelihood of significant aerosol generation and air dispersion during bag and mask ventilation, continuous positive airway pressure, nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation, high flow nasal cannula therapy, endotracheal intubation, and invasive mechanical ventilation is quite low, but not negligible.

 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Given the lack of strong and clear scientific evidence during this pandemic, and until more information becomes available, health care providers should use full PPE during respiratory care of infants with suspected or confirmed cases. This should include gloves, a long-sleeved gown, eye protection, and a N95 mask or the equivalent. Also, it is recommended that infants with suspected or positive COVID-19 infection should be treated in negative pressure rooms or isolated using a 2-m distance between incubators in open plan NICUs.
