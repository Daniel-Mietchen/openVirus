 <italic>What should be done for the overall care after birth?</italic> Clinical conditions of mother and newborn will determine the care after birth. If the mother has suspected or confirmed COVID-19, both are stable, and the infant is not preterm, neonatal health care providers must offer orientations regarding precautions to avoid spreading the virus, including washing of the mother's hands before touching the infant, using a face mask while breastfeeding, and staying in isolated rooming-in. However, if the mother or the newborn are sick they should stay separated, while considering the mother's intention to breastfeed by expressing breast milk, limiting visits, and maintaining adequate isolation measures during the hospital stay.

 </xref> Neonates positive for COVID-19 must be isolated and clinically monitored, in order to prevent outbreaks in the NICU. Owing to the absence of evidence for vertical transmission, as well as for transmission through breast milk, most scientific organizations are recommending not to separate mothers and neonates, with the aim of promoting breastfeeding and neonatal bonding, with the exception of cases with severely symptomatic mothers â€“ in such cases, barrier measures are suggested, as well as administration of expressed maternal milk.
