<p id="Par24"> Pinworm infection is caused by a small, thin, white roundworm called 
 <italic>Enterobius vermicularis</italic>. Although pinworm infection can affect anyone, it most commonly occurs among children, institutionalized persons, and household members of persons with pinworm infection. Pinworm is the most common worm infection in the United States. Humans are the only species that can transfer this parasite. Pinworm eggs can survive in the indoor environment for 2â€“3 weeks. People who are infected with pinworm can transfer the parasite to others for as long as there is a female pinworm depositing eggs on the perianal skin. A person can also re-infect themselves [
