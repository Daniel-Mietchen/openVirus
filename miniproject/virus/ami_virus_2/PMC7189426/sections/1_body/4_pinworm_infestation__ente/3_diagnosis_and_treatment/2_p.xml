<p id="Par27">Any one of three antiparasitic medications ( mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, and albendazole) can be used for treatment. A single dose of any of these medications is given followed by another single dose 2 weeks later. The medications do not reliably kill pinworm eggs. Therefore, the second dose is to prevent re-infection by adult worms that hatch from any eggs that are not killed by the first treatment. Repeated infections should be treated by the same method as the first infection. In households where more than one member is infected or where repeated, symptomatic infections occur; it is recommended that all household members be treated at the same time. In institutions, mass and simultaneous treatment, repeated in 2 weeks, can be effective. Handwashing after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food is the most successful way to prevent pinworm infection. In order to help prevent the spread of pinworm and possible re-infection, people who are infected should bathe every morning to help remove many of the eggs on the skin. Showering is a better method than taking a bath, because showering avoids potentially contaminating the bath water with pinworm eggs. Infected people should not co-bathe with others. Infected patients also must cut their fingernails regularly and avoid biting the nails and scratching around the anus. Frequent changing of underclothes and bed linens first thing in the morning is a great way to prevent possible transmission of eggs in the environment and risk of reinfection. These items should not be shaken and carefully placed into a washer and laundered in hot water followed by a hot dryer to kill any eggs that may be present [
