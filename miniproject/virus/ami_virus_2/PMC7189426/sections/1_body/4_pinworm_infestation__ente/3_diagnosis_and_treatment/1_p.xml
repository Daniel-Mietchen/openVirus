<p id="Par26">Because of the life cycle of the pinworm, eggs and worms are often scarce in the stool; therefore, examining stool samples is not recommended. Identifying pinworm can be done by finding the female worm, which is about 10 mm long, in the perianal region 1 or 2 h after a child goes to bed at night, or by using a low-power microscope to identify ova on cellophane tape. The ova are obtained in the early morning before the child arises by patting the perianal skinfolds with a strip of cellophane tape, which is then placed sticky side down on a glass slide and viewed microscopically. This procedure should be repeated on five successive mornings; if necessary, eggs may also be identified by examining scrapings from underneath the patientâ€™s nails.</p>
