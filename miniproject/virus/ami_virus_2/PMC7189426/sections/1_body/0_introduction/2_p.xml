<p id="Par3">In developed countries, morbidity and mortality from infections have declined dramatically, and deaths from infectious diseases are uncommon. However, serious infections still occur, e.g., meningococcal septicemia, meningitis, and multidrug-resistant pathogens, and some have reemerged, for example, tuberculosis and PVL-toxin-secreting 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, which requires early recognition and treatment. With an increase of global air travel, tropical diseases are encountered in all countries. In addition, epidemics may spread widely, e.g., SARS and H1N1 influenza, with children (and the elderly) being the most vulnerable.
