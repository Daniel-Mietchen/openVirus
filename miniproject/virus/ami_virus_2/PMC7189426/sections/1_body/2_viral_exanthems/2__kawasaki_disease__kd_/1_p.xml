<p id="Par17">KD is an acute vasculitis of childhood that predominantly affects the coronary arteries. An infectious etiology is suspected based on epidemiological and clinical data; however as of today, the cause of KD remains unknown. In the United States, KD is more common during the winter and early spring months, in boys more than girls, in children younger than 5 years old, and in children of Asian ethnicity [

The classic clinical presentation of KD includes at least 5 days of fever plus four or more of the five major clinical features (conjunctival injection, erythema of the lips and oral mucosa, polymorphous skin rash, cervical lymphadenopathy (with one of the nodes being at least 1.5 cm in diameter),and swelling or redness of the extremities). The classic peeling of the fingers and toes (starting in the periungual region) usually does not occur until 2–3 weeks after onset of symptoms. In addition, classic KD can be diagnosed with three of the above clinical features if coronary artery abnormalities are observed on echocardiography. “Incomplete KD” refers to patients who do not fulfill the classic criteria and is more common in children younger than 1 year. In this group, the rate of coronary artery aneurysms is paradoxically higher if not treated. Some children with KD develop coronary artery aneurysms or ectasia, ischemic heart disease, and sudden death. Therefore early clinical suspicion and diagnosis are important [

Nonspecific lab tests such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may suggest the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease because they are often unusually highly elevated. In patients with compatible features, and elevated CRP levels or ESR, supplemental laboratory test results are often seen (these include leukocytosis with shift to the left, mild anemia, thrombocytosis, proteinuria and sterile pyuria on urine analysis, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated serum transaminases). Cardiac manifestations for any suspected case of KD might be detected earlier by performing echocardiography. Initial treatment with a single dose (2 g per kg) of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) and high-dose aspirin (80–100 mg per kg per day, divided into four doses) is recommended. Treatment is preferably started as soon as possible, optimally within the first 10 days of fever; however, treatment is still recommended if patients present after 10 days and still have fever and manifestations of inflammation. Low-dose aspirin (3–5 mg per kg per day, given as a single dose) has an antiplatelet effect and should be continued for 6–8 weeks after disease onset if there are no coronary artery abnormalities or indefinitely if abnormalities are present. Children on long-term aspirin therapy should receive an annual influenza vaccination. Also, parents should be told to contact their physician if symptoms of influenza or varicella arise, because alternative agents to aspirin might be considered. Children who have Kawasaki disease without evidence of abnormalities on echocardiography appear to return to their usual state of health without any cardiac sequelae. The current American Heart Association guidelines provide a stratification system to categorize patients by their risk of myocardial infarction and provide guidelines for management [
