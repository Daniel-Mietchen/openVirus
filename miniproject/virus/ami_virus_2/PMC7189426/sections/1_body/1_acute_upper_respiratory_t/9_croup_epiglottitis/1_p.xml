<p id="Par14"> Croup is a syndrome that includes spasmodic croup ( recurrent croup), laryngotracheitis ( viral croup), laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis, with recurrent and viral croup being the most commonly encountered. The incidence of croup often peaks during the fall season, although sporadic cases may occur throughout the year. Croup is usually caused by viruses, with parainfluenza virus (type 1) being the most common. Other viruses that cause croup are enterovirus, human bocavirus, influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus.</p>
