<p id="Par15">Both recurrent croup and viral croup have the same clinical presentation, with the exception that recurrent croup tends to recur and typically lacks associated symptoms of respiratory tract infection. Although croup tends to have a benign course, a differential diagnosis of more serious but less common conditions must be entertained. Bacterial tracheitis may result from a secondary infection, most often due to 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, and usually leads to a more toxic appearance, with higher fever and severe respiratory symptoms. Bacterial tracheitis does not respond to usual croup treatment. Intravenous antibiotics are needed, and intubation may become necessary. Epiglottitis ( supraglottitis) is a life-threatening bacterial infection of the upper airway almost always caused by 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b (Hib). The incidence has declined dramatically as a result of the use of Hib vaccine. Other diagnoses to consider include foreign body aspiration, peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, and angioedema [
