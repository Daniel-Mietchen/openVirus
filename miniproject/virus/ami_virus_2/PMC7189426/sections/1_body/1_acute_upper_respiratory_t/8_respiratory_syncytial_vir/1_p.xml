<p id="Par12"> Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes respiratory tract infections in children. Lower respiratory tract infections (e.g., bronchiolitis, pneumonia) are more common in children younger than 2 years, whereas upper respiratory tract infections tend to affect older children. Since previous infection does not protect children against reinfection, it is common for the family doctor to see patients with repeated RSV infections. Adherence to the American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis can decrease unnecessary diagnostic testing and intervention. In most previously healthy children, an RSV infection is self-limited and responds to supportive care. Children with unrepaired cardiac disease or chronic lung disease are at increased risk of severe RSV infection. Premature children and the very young (less than 3 months old) tend to be more at risk of having severe symptoms and therefore may require hospitalization.</p>
