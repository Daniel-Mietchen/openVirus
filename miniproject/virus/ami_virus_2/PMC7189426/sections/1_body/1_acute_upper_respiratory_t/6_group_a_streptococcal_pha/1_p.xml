<p id="Par10"> GAS is the most common bacterial cause of acute pharyngitis, responsible for 20â€“30 % of pharyngitis in children. Accurate diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis followed by appropriate antimicrobial therapy is important for the prevention of acute rheumatic fever and for the prevention of suppurative complications (e.g., peritonsillar abscess, cervical lymphadenitis, mastoiditis, and, possibly, other invasive infections). The signs and symptoms of GAS and nonstreptococcal pharyngitis overlap so broadly that accurate diagnosis on the basis of clinical grounds alone is unreliable. Therefore, it is advisable for family physicians to follow the ISDA clinical practice guidelines for proper diagnostic test use and antibiotic prescription for all children with GAS where possible (Table

In addition to viral pharyngitis, other less common or rare causes of pharyngitis must also be considered when the tests for GAS are negative, or the clinical picture is suggestive. Infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus and diphtheria caused by
