<p id="Par20">Viral infections, primarily from rotavirus, cause 75–90 % of infectious diarrhea cases in the industrialized world. Bacterial pathogens cause another 10–20 % of cases, with as many as 10 % of these occurring secondary to enterotoxigenic

With the continued decline of rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis, noroviruses (Norwalk-like viruses) have become the leading cause of medically attended acute gastroenteritis in children younger than 5 years in that country [
