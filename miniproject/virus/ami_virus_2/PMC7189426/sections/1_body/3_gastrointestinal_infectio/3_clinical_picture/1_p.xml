<p id="Par21">The clinical presentation is the mainstay of diagnosis, and therefore careful history and physical examination will serve to differentiate gastroenteritis from other causes of vomiting and diarrhea in children. These will also help in estimating the degree of dehydration. Diarrhea is the main presenting symptom and is usually defined as three or more watery or loose stools in 24 h. The duration of diarrhea, the frequency and amount of stool, the time since the last episode of diarrhea, and the quality of stools must also be determined. Frequent, watery stools are more consistent with viral gastroenteritis, while stools with blood or mucous are indicative of a likely bacterial pathogen. Similarly, a long duration of diarrhea (&gt;14 days) is more consistent with a parasitic or noninfectious cause of diarrhea. Vomiting is another important symptom, the duration of vomiting, the amount and quality of vomitus (e.g., food contents, blood, bile), and the time since the last episode of vomiting must be determined. Signs of systemic infection must be noted (fever, chills, myalgias, rash, rhinorrhea, sore throat, cough). Abdominal pain is another important symptom that the child or parent can report; in general, pain that precedes vomiting and diarrhea is more likely to be due to an abdominal pathology other than gastroenteritis. Urinary symptoms including frequency (measured by the number of wet diapers), time since last urination, color and concentration of urine, and presence of dysuria should be sought. Some important points in the general appearance and behavior are important to determine the degree of dehydration and subsequent management (weight loss, level of thirst, level of alertness, increased malaise, lethargy or irritability, quality of crying, and presence or absence of tears with crying). Travel history and recent antibiotic use are other important points in the history that may suggest the possibility of travelerâ€™s diarrhea or
