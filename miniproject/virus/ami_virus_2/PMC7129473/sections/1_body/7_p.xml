<p id="para0009">In summary, laparoscopy remains the preferred surgical approach for gynecologic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic for most surgical indications. The theoretic risk of airborne SARS-CoV-2 from an abdominal source at the time of surgery has not been substantiated. There is no current evidence that infection of OR personnel occurs by means of laparoscopy any more so than by laparotomy surgery. However, given the paucity of data, it is prudent to take precautions in the OR given that viral particles can be aerosolized during intubation and extubation. We believe laparoscopy offers the opportunity for better containment and filtration of the surgical gas and plume compared with laparotomy and continues to offer vastly more health benefits, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic and when precious PPE and hospital resources and minimization of viral exposure risks are so critical to mitigating this public health crisis. Let us not lose sight of the “scope” of the problem: it is imprudent and even dangerous to blindly abandon tried-and-true, safe surgical practices during a viral pandemic. Laparoscopy, when clinically appropriate, achieves the goal of optimizing patient care and outcomes, while minimizing risk to the surgical and perioperative teams.</p>
