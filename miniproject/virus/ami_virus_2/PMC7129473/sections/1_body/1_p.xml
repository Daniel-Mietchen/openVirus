<p id="para0003">Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, is a respiratory pathogen. Both the RNA and the infectious virus are detected primarily from human upper and lower respiratory tract specimens. The COVID-19 virions are approximately 0.125 μm in size and are most commonly transmitted as larger (&gt;20 μm) respiratory water droplets. The virus may also be aerosolized and transmitted in smaller droplets (&lt;10 μm) in gas suspension. Particle size has implications for suspension time and filtration requirements. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in blood and stool specimens, but it is unknown if infectious virus is present in these extrapulmonary specimens 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. To date, no studies have identified SARS-CoV-2 in surgical smoke, and even if found, it is not known whether these viral particles are infectious. In addition, whereas viral RNA may be detected in the blood, no transmission of COVID-19 has been documented through this route
