<p id="para0006">One must also consider the adverse impact of adopting overarching policy changes (such as “laparotomy is better during the COVID-19 pandemic because of theoretic aerosolization risks”) on the basis of erroneous assumptions. What is not theoretic is that converting more cases to laparotomy during the COVID-19 pandemic will have dire downstream consequences, including prolonged hospital stays and bed use, an increased likelihood of intensive care unit stay, greater risk of patient harm from surgical complications (including undesirable pulmonary issues during a respiratory viral crisis), and greater risks of COVID-19 exposure for both the patient and healthcare providers. Given the lack of data to support the claim that COVID-19 virus spreads through the laparoscopic smoke plume or pneumoperitoneum, one cannot justify the increased use of precious resources, greater number of surgical complications, and infectious exposure risks to the patient and the caregivers that would result if laparoscopic approaches were abandoned during this period.</p>
