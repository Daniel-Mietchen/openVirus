<p id="para0002">The novel nature of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents many challenges to gynecologists working to optimize the care of their patients. No part of our practice has been more disrupted than the ability to offer timely procedures to our patients with gynecologic surgical indications. Despite efforts to limit elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic, urgent and emergent procedures must still be performed. For many of these urgent procedures, such as ruptured ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, or ovarian torsion, laparoscopy may offer the best surgical approach and outcomes for the patient. However, some have suggested that laparoscopic procedures should be avoided and laparotomy procedures be universally employed when a patient is COVID-19 positive or status is unknown owing to concerns about aerosolization of viral particles through the pneumoperitoneum. We strongly disagree with this premise. On the basis of the best available evidence, we concur with both the recent US joint professional society statement on minimally invasive gynecology during the COVID-19 pandemic

 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> endorsing laparoscopy as a safe surgical approach in this setting.
