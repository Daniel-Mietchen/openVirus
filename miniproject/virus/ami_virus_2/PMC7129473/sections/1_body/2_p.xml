<p id="para0004">What have we learned from other viral epidemics and surgical risks? That the risk of viral disease transmission with laparoscopy is virtually zero. Although the viral DNA of blood-borne viral pathogens, such as hepatitis B and HIV, have been detected in surgical plume after the use of surgical energy (e.g., electrosurgery, laser and harmonic scalpel), there is no evidence to indicate that the use of electrosurgery during laparoscopy increases the risk of disease transmission through the surgical plume or pneumoperitoneum [

Furthermore, surgery in patients with HIV and hepatitis B and C has been ongoing for decades, without documented increased risk of transmission from the surgical plume or laparoscopic pneumoperitoneum to surgeons, anesthesiologists, or operating room (OR) personnel. When possible, laparoscopic techniques that significantly minimize exposure of surgeons to blood-borne pathogens are far preferred to laparotomy.
