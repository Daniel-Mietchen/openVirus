<p id="Par24">At national level, many governments developed a digital surveillance system to keep track of international travelers, isolated people, COVID-19 positive contacted people, and those with quarantine status. This close monitoring will help achieve a decline in COVID-19 cases as well as in containment of the virus. Additionally, several governments have developed online live digital tools to continuously monitor and update the current numbers of COVID-19 cases. The WHO live situation reports provide live status of emerging cases across the globe and pattern of disease spread. Besides this, some other independent agencies are also keeping close watch on COVID-19 development such as John Hopkins University, Centre for Disease Control,

Many scientific publication houses are providing open access to COVID-19-related research works, which enables researchers worldwide to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. The effective surveillance from local community level to regional level to national level to world level is the key to find effective solutions for containment of the virus. Worldwide surveillance also provides on-time alerts as to potential locations where the infection may be emerging. Additionally surveillance enables enhanced cooperation among affected countries for formulation of collective measures to fight pandemic like COVID19.
