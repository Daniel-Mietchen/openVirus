<p id="Par12">In the past 100 years, the human race has encountered several epidemic diseases mostly associated with viruses. The twentieth century started with the outbreak of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in 1918, infecting one-third of the world’s population and accounting for 50 million lives worldwide. It is known as the most deadly pandemic in the history of mankind. The influenza virus struck again in 1957–1958 in the form of the H2N2 influenza A virus, triggering a pandemic that claimed 1.1 million lives worldwide. Pandemic outbreaks are not new and occur from time to time. The major problem is controlling and developing effective solutions for these outbreaks as well as monitoring the viruses and other microbes closely for their mutations and cross-genetic translation.
