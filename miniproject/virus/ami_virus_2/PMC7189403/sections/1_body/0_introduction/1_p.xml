<p id="Par11">Infectious diseases have emerged as major threats to human existence since centuries and can devastate entire populations. Epidemiological studies have shown that millions of lives vanished due to these pandemic outbreaks. Epidemiology is defined by WHO as follows: “Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events (including disease), and the application of this study to the control of diseases and other health problems. Various methods can be used to carry out epidemiological investigations: surveillance and descriptive studies can be used to study distribution; analytical studies are used to study determinants.”</p>
