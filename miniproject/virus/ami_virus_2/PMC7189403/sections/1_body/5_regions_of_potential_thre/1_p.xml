<p id="Par25">The disease emerged from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, as an unknown viral pneumonia diagnosed in 54 individual and by March 25, 2020, it had infected 81,848 people in China alone. Wuhan became the epicenter of COVID-19 just after emergence of the disease. Government and local bodies worked tirelessly to control the spread of COVID-19. Initially COVID-19 was not identified as a humanâ€“to-human transmission disease, but with exponential increase in cases research on COVID-19 established the fact that disease is transmitted from human to human via aerosol. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a novel coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae and very little is known about its characteristics (Tekes and Thiel

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>). As we gain more knowledge about CoV2, its spread is also increasing exponentially. The initial epicenter of the disease shifted from Wuhan to Europe to the USA. Italy appears worst affected having 69,176 reported cases till March 25, 2020, with the maximum number of deaths of 6820 infected people. USA with 51,914 positive cases is emerging as another epicenter. Since there is no vaccine or medication available for the novel coronavirus, social distancing and proper maintenance of self as well as surrounding sanitation is the only treatment. The long and strict lockdown in China shows excellent decline in viral infection and social distancing found very helpful in containment of the virus. The initial lighter attitude of European countries and the USA is one of the major reasons for their emergence as an epicenter of the disease. Highly populated countries like India must learn from the mistakes of these nations and implement strict measures for containment of the virus, as uncontrolled outbreak of the disease could lead to a devastating situation for developing countries like India. Another region of potential threat is Iran where the number of deaths has increased exponentially, with 2077 deaths recorded till March 25, 2020. Underdeveloped countries with lack of basic facilities, public awareness, and poverty like Pakistan and African countries may emerge as another epicenter for COVID-19. Special attention and extended help need to be given to such nations for fighting the pandemic.
