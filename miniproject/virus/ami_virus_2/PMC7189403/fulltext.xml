The virus responsible for these pneumonia infections was identified as novel coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae. The novel coronavirus was renamed as COVID-19 by WHO. Infection from the virus has since increased exponentially and has spread all over the world in more than 196 countries. The WHO has declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern due to the outbreak of COVID-19. The virus is highly infectious and can cause human-to-human transmission. Every 24&#x000a0;h, cases of COVID-19 increase severalfolds. The WHO is monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 spread very closely via a global surveillance system. The current situation demands the enforcement of strict laws which would help in inhibiting the further spread of COVID-19. Social distancing, international travel restrictions to affected countries, and hygiene are three important ways to nullify SARS-CoV-2.Government and private organizations need to come forward and work together during this pandemic. Public awareness, social distancing, and sterilization must be maintained to neutralize the viral infection, especially in major hot spots.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Epidemiology</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>Global trends</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par11">Infectious diseases have emerged as major threats to human existence since centuries and can devastate entire populations. Epidemiological studies have shown that millions of lives vanished due to these pandemic outbreaks. Epidemiology is defined by WHO as follows: &#x0201c;Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events (including disease), and the application of this study to the control of diseases and other health problems. Various methods can be used to carry out epidemiological investigations: surveillance and descriptive studies can be used to study distribution; analytical studies are used to study determinants.&#x0201d;</p><p id="Par12">In the past 100&#x000a0;years, the human race has encountered several epidemic diseases mostly associated with viruses. The twentieth century started with the outbreak of the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in 1918, infecting one-third of the world&#x02019;s population and accounting for 50 million lives worldwide. It is known as the most deadly pandemic in the history of mankind. The influenza virus struck again in 1957&#x02013;1958 in the form of the H2N2 influenza A virus, triggering a pandemic that claimed 1.1 million lives worldwide. Pandemic outbreaks are not new and occur from time to time. The major problem is controlling and developing effective solutions for these outbreaks as well as monitoring the viruses and other microbes closely for their mutations and cross-genetic translation.

Initially the infection emerged as viral pneumonia from unknown microbial agents (Lu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified the virus as novel coronavirus from the throat swab sample of an infected patient on January 7, 2020 (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). Further, the WHO declared the disease as Public Health Emergency of International Concern in January 2020 and officially named the disease caused by the novel CoV2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on February 12, 2020 (Adhikari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>; Zu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>). As per data available on various websites regarding COVID-19 infections worldwide, the cases are increasing exponentially.

The severity of the infection increases due to its human-to-human transmission ability majorly by means of contact and large droplets. Additionally, it can also be transmitted through aerosols and fomite on various surfaces and cause infection (Perlman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020</xref>).

It emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which has a population of 11 million (Adhikari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>; Callaway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>; Fisher and Wilder-Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Jingchun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). China reported this pneumonia of unidentified cause first to the WHO country office on December 31, 2019 (WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). Since then, it has reported several thousand new cases of COVID-19. The peak of the epidemic in China was in late January and early February (Callaway et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). Up to January 31, 2020, COVID-19 had spread to 19 other countries, infecting 11,791 and causing 213 reported deaths. The COVID-19 epidemic was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World Health Organization on January 30, 2020 (WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>; Adhikari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>).

Currently, the virus is referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). According to reports, a number of people infected with pneumonia of unidentified cause were associated to a local seafood market in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) immediately conducted epidemiological and etiological investigation. The WHO confirmed the association of the coronavirus outbreak with the seafood market of Wuhan (Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). Immediately, scientists started to conduct research to find out the origin of the new coronavirus. The research group, led by Prof. Yong Zhang, were the first to publish the genome of COVID-19 on January 10, 2020 (Adhikari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Pandemic SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19</title><p id="Par18">Within a month of the outbreak at Wuhan, the SARS-CoV-2 virus extended rapidly all over China at the time of the Chinese New Year (Adhikari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>).

Positive coronavirus cases outside China increased radically by March 16, 2020, and the number of affected countries, states, or territories reached 143 according to the WHO. Considering the alarming levels of infections and severity, the Director-General of WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic (Trevor Bedford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>). On March 13, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that Europe had become the epicenter of the pandemic (Trevor Bedford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Figures <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2.2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">2.3</xref> present the week-wise data of reported cases and deaths, respectively, in some of the majorly affected countries from January 21, 2020, to March 24, 2020,.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Worldwide Surveillance Systems</title><p id="Par22">As per the report published by WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 published on February 28, 2020, &#x0201c;The most of the global community is not ready for COVID 19.&#x0201d; The disease emerged in China, and after several strict major decisions including lockdown to maintain social distancing, China successfully contained the virus. The number of new cases declined drastically (Fisher and Wilder-Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). The epicenter of the disease has now shifted to Europe, mainly to Italy and USA. The WHO is monitoring and tracking all the developments very closely around the world. The emergence of new cases as well as its spread to new countries and locations is being continuously tracked by the global monitoring system of the WHO. Apart from WHO surveillance, governments of various countries as well as their health ministries, home ministries, aviation, and non-government organizations are working together to keep a tab on the latest developments in COVID 19 cases. All the major airports of world were made fully equipped to scan and isolate passengers arriving from other countries or any other infected region.</p><p id="Par23">Public health emergencies like COVID-19 require effective response in accurate time. Due to the insufficient information and suppress reporting on COVID19 outbreak from China many of the countries across the world were not able to understand the severity neither preprepared themselves to tackle this health emergency (Pisa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">At national level, many governments developed a digital surveillance system to keep track of international travelers, isolated people, COVID-19 positive contacted people, and those with quarantine status. This close monitoring will help achieve a decline in COVID-19 cases as well as in containment of the virus. Additionally, several governments have developed online live digital tools to continuously monitor and update the current numbers of COVID-19 cases. The WHO live situation reports provide live status of emerging cases across the globe and pattern of disease spread. Besides this, some other independent agencies are also keeping close watch on COVID-19 development such as John Hopkins University, Centre for Disease Control, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://worldometer.info">worldometer.info</ext-link>, NIH, etc. The Pandemicity project, a multilingual medical research database for nCoV-19 started by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pandemicity.org">pandemicity.org</ext-link>, includes several tools for screening and calculating risk factors of COVID-19 online. Many scientific publication houses are providing open access to COVID-19-related research works, which enables researchers worldwide to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. The effective surveillance from local community level to regional level to national level to world level is the key to find effective solutions for containment of the virus. Worldwide surveillance also provides on-time alerts as to potential locations where the infection may be emerging. Additionally surveillance enables enhanced cooperation among affected countries for formulation of collective measures to fight pandemic like COVID19.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Regions of Potential Threat</title><p id="Par25">The disease emerged from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, as an unknown viral pneumonia diagnosed in 54 individual and by March 25, 2020, it had infected 81,848 people in China alone. Wuhan became the epicenter of COVID-19 just after emergence of the disease. Government and local bodies worked tirelessly to control the spread of COVID-19. Initially COVID-19 was not identified as a human&#x02013;to-human transmission disease, but with exponential increase in cases research on COVID-19 established the fact that disease is transmitted from human to human via aerosol. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a novel coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae and very little is known about its characteristics (Tekes and Thiel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2016</xref>; Ashour et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>). As we gain more knowledge about CoV2, its spread is also increasing exponentially. The initial epicenter of the disease shifted from Wuhan to Europe to the USA. Italy appears worst affected having 69,176 reported cases till March 25, 2020, with the maximum number of deaths of 6820 infected people. USA with 51,914 positive cases is emerging as another epicenter. Since there is no vaccine or medication available for the novel coronavirus, social distancing and proper maintenance of self as well as surrounding sanitation is the only treatment. The long and strict lockdown in China shows excellent decline in viral infection and social distancing found very helpful in containment of the virus. The initial lighter attitude of European countries and the USA is one of the major reasons for their emergence as an epicenter of the disease. Highly populated countries like India must learn from the mistakes of these nations and implement strict measures for containment of the virus, as uncontrolled outbreak of the disease could lead to a devastating situation for developing countries like India. Another region of potential threat is Iran where the number of deaths has increased exponentially, with 2077 deaths recorded till March 25, 2020. Underdeveloped countries with lack of basic facilities, public awareness, and poverty like Pakistan and African countries may emerge as another epicenter for COVID-19. Special attention and extended help need to be given to such nations for fighting the pandemic.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Executive Summary</title><p id="Par26">

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">SARS-CoV-2 is a highly infectious virus with the ability of human-to-human transmission. The virus is of zoonotic origin and was first transmitted into humans from animal (Menachery et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 has now spread to 196 countries, raising infection exponentially worldwide. Active worldwide surveillance is continuously being done by the WHO to monitor new cases, deaths, and recoveries. The mortality rate is quite low, ranging between 1.2 and 14%, depending upon several parameters such as age, health condition, immunity, diabetes, and past disease records. International travel needs to be avoided to potential regions like Italy, USA, and China. Safety measures such as social distancing and maintenance of hygiene is top priority to secure self from COVID-19 infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Future Perspectives</title><p id="Par37">The epidemiology of COVID-19 provides a better understanding about the pattern of disease growth and spread. The high potential of COVID-19 causing infection from human to human may be neutralized by following social distancing and sanitization. Governments may impose lockdown and curfew for strict implementation of social distancing to reduce the spread of the infection. Worldwide surveillance system needs to be improved by use of artificial intelligence and information technology.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p id="Par2">Central Drug Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CoV</term><def><p id="Par3">Coronavirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COVID</term><def><p id="Par4">Coronavirus disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p id="Par5">Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MERS</term><def><p id="Par6">Middle East respiratory syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NIH</term><def><p id="Par7">National Institutes of Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SARS</term><def><p id="Par8">Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USA</term><def><p id="Par9">United States of America</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p id="Par10">World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adhikari</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Y-J</given-names></name><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Y-P</given-names></name><name><surname>Ye</surname><given-names>R-X</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Q-Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Sylvia</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Rozelle</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Raat</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemiology, causes, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, prevention and control of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the early outbreak period: a scoping review</article-title><source>Infect Dis Poverty</source><year>2020</year><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>29</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1186/s40249-020-00646-x</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">32183901</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Ashour MH, Elkhatib FW, Rahman MM, Elshabrawy AH (2020) Insights into the recent 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in light of past human coronavirus outbreaks.
