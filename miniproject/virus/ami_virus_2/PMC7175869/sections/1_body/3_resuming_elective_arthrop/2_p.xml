<p id="p0030">Although any discussion regarding a SARS-CoV-2 “reinfection” remains theoretical, a few recent articles have raised this possibility [

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. If such a phenomenon is indeed possible, three distinct explanations exist. First, patients who contract the disease do not develop lasting immunity against the virus and are just as vulnerable as those without a prior infection in contracting the disease. Second, there are issues with the accuracy of the test, with false positives and false negatives existing. So, it is possible that some of these presumed reinfections are a result of the retest being a false-negative result which was incorrectly interpreted as the individual being declared as “cured”. Finally, it is plausible, and indeed scientifically proven [

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>], that viruses undergo marked genetic mutations, even during an active pandemic. Hence, those infected with the virus develop partial immunity and are still vulnerable for infection with the ‘new’ mutated version of the virus [

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>]. We are familiar with the concept of partial immunity as it relates to the flu-vaccine, as it affords only 60-70% immunity against the disease in any given year [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Based on scientific data, the genetic footprint of the initial SARS-CoV-2 affecting individuals in Wuhan is different than the RNA sequence of the virus affecting people in other countries [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The virus has certainly undergone mutation. In fact, these mutations likely explain why some epidemics come to an abrupt end as the continued viral alterations may revoke the virulence of the pathogen.
