<p id="p0045">To determine the risk of a patient being infected with SARS-COV-2, all patients scheduled for elective surgery should be screened for symptoms and exposure. Symptoms of infection including fever, sore throat, cough, and anosmia are common with a COVID-19 infection. Patients should also be asked if they have been exposed to anyone with known COVID-19 infection or anyone with symptoms of COVID-19 to determine the risk. Furthermore, the rate of infection in the community will be important as well as a patientâ€™s history of travel from a region with known high rates of COVID-19 infection.</p>
