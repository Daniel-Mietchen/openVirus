<p id="p0050">Routine screening of nasopharyngeal swabs or throat swabs by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to detect viral genetic material is subject to false-positive and false-negative results, and is therefore not indicated in low-risk patients. Serological tests for IgG and IgM are not currently widely available but may become useful tools to determine the patientâ€™s status. There are limited data on their accuracy and they are not regulated in the same manner as more standard antibody tests at this time, so enthusiasm for these tests needs to be tempered. All of these tests will undergo further refinements as we continue to expand our knowledge regarding immunity to COVID-19. We believe that questions regarding who should be screened and what screening should be in place are a pertinent one. Most, if not all, institutions will need to have access to a rapid turnaround test for COVID-19. A point of care test is currently available and should be utilized for emergency cases. Industry has also been able to develop special swabs that can be used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the oral cavity, eliminating the need for more invasive nasopharyngeal swabs for testing.</p>
