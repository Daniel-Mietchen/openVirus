<p id="p0070">In cases of known SARS-CoV-2–positive patients, surgeons and other health care workers should also have ventilation systems that are able to filter and capture SARS-CoV-2, as well as other bacteria and fungi. These systems can be used outside of the operating area but should be present in every operating room. Given that coronaviruses are approximately 0.125 mm (125 μm) in diameter [

Thus, filtration of the operating room with devices that intake the air and remove the micro-organisms may be preferable to the positive pressure laminar flow settings. Negative-pressure operating rooms will reduce the risk of virus particles being forced out of the room into the corridors.
