<p id="p0065">It is fortunate that most arthroplasties are performed under regional anesthesia. Intubation of a patient can cause aerosolization of a large number of particles in the upper airways and particular caution should be taken with this procedure when there is a risk that the patient may be carrying SARS-COV-2. Anesthesia teams dealing with patients who require general anesthesia and airway management should be fitted with secure personal protection equipment. As orthopedic surgeons, we use power tools (drills, saws, etc.) that releases aerosolized material [

The amount of virus particles in these tissues is not known but these instruments could potentially aerosolize virus particles in the operating room. In patients who are positive for the virus, when surgery cannot be delayed, the power settings should be as low as possible, and suction devices should be carefully handled to remove any aerosol formation [
