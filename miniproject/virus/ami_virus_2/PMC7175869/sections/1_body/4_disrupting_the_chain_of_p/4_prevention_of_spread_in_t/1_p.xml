<p id="p0060">Aerosolized particles have proven to be a mechanism of spread of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Aerosolization of virus particles usually does not occur with breathing or talking but some procedures in the operating room may cause aerosolization of virus particles. Droplets are expelled during talking and breathing but these usually do not become aerosolized and land on surfaces within a few minutes. Patients undergoing elective arthroplasty should be supplied with a simple surgical mask that will prevent the spread of droplets carrying the virus. Personal protection equipment should be available to all the health care workers and should focus on masks that are able to filter any pathogen, while allowing for enough comfort to be worn for a substantial length of time. We, as surgeons, and health care workers in general, should also be fitted with such masks.
