<p id="p0015">While the outbreak of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, does not appear to be on the same scale as the pandemic of 1918, it does share some of the same signatures of the “Spanish flu” and, for that matter, some more recent pandemics. All of these pandemics were caused by a virus originating from an animal source and spreading among humans by droplets and/or contact with bodily fluids [

The major difference between the current pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, and those before it is that the current virus appears to be highly contagious. In fact, COVID-19 has already caused ten times as many cases as SARS in a quarter of the time [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The SARS-CoV-2 virus can also infect some people without causing many, or any, symptoms and is capable of surviving on surfaces for a relatively long period. The aforementioned qualities of SARS-CoV-2 make the current COVID-19 pandemic a truly challenging one to manage, especially when considering that we live in an increasingly connected world that appears ideally suited for the rapid spread of diseases across countries and continents.
