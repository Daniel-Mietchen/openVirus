<p id="p0085">The current pandemic has taken us into uncharted territories. The economic and health impact of this pandemic may be irreversible and will be felt for years to come. While we mourn the loss of lives to this pandemic, society needs to prepare for the eventual lift of social isolation and attempt to return to normalcy. As our knowledge of this pathogen expands and we continue to work toward an effective vaccine and potential treatments for SARS-CoV-2, further strategies for the disruption of the chain of pathogen transfer needs to implemented. We have attempted to highlight some of the changes that arthroplasty surgeons will need to instigate now and when elective arthroplasties are resumed (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref> ). Although SARS-CoV-2 may be a novel pathogen, the actions needed to protect ourselves and our patients against the pathogen are not. The medical community and, more specifically, orthopedic surgeons have been acutely aware of the devastating impact of infections for centuries. We, as a medical community, have always been in the forefront of developing infection prevention protocols and implementing evidence-based strategies to combat these pathogens. Our fight against the COVID-19 will be no different. The ultimate changes that we implement as a result of this pandemic stand to serve our patients and the society well for years to come and help us all safely return to caring for our patients.
