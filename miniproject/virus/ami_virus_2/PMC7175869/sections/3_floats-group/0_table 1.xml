   </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
    <td>Waiting room</td>
    <td>These should not be used. Family members can be called when the surgery is complete and should not enter or wait within the hospital unnecessarily.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Check-in</td>
    <td>A form of ‘mobile’ check-in would be preferable where the patient can call the desk and, when the staff is ready, be escorted directly to their pre-operative holding area room and provided a mask. Patients would ideally not stop at a ‘front desk.’</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Preoperative holding area</td>
    <td>Registration would ideally take place here before each patient prepared for surgery. All beds should be adequately spaced. If curtains separate beds, they should be cleaned after each patient.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Operating rooms</td>
    <td>Each operating room would ideally have its own air-handling system to minimize air-based contamination and consider using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. Minimize the number of people in the room. Minimize non-sterile equipment such as X-ray machines, navigation consoles and robots as virus may last up to 72 h on these surfaces.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Anesthesia</td>
    <td>Spinal anesthesia should be used preferentially over general anesthesia to decrease aerosolized particles from each patient within the operating room.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Surgical Hoods/Helmets</td>
    <td>Surgical helmets/hoods should be modified for increased protection against viruses for those wearing these systems. Alternatively, operating room personnel can eschew the helmets/hoods and use a N-95 mask and face shield in their place.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Forced-air warming system</td>
    <td>These devices should be used with caution as they may increase the distribution of aerosolized particles during the case. Blankets may be more effective at decreasing particulate generation and distribution.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Scrubs</td>
    <td>Scrubs should be changed frequently, potentially after each patient.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Room Turnover</td>
    <td>Each room should be cleaned between cases with solutions such as dilute povidone-iodine and alcohol that are effective against viruses and other pathogens.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Postanesthesia care unit</td>
    <td>All beds should be adequately spaced. If curtains separate beds, they should be cleaned after each patient. Patients who are not going home on the same day should be brought to their hospital room expeditiously.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Hospital stay</td>
    <td>If patients can be safely discharged on the same day as their surgery, they should be sent home. Protocols should be in place to facilitate this process and patients and their families should be educated of this policy before undergoing their total joint arthroplasty.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>‘Rounds’</td>
    <td>Telemedicine should be used to ‘round’ on the patients postoperatively to limit direct contact.</td>
