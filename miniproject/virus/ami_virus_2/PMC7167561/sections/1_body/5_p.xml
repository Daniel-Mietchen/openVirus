<p id="p0030">MHCII is responsible for presenting antigen to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, which, along with co-stimulatory factors, promotes their activation [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are then essential for the promotion of high-quality antibody responses by providing B cells with the signals required to induce somatic hypermutation/affinity maturation. Ciminski 
 <italic>et al.</italic> reported seroconversion in bats after experimental infection with WT H18N11, demonstrating that antibody responses are generated in response to infection [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to determine whether H18N11 infection impairs T cell activation and, as a result, the breadth and quality of the antibody response (
