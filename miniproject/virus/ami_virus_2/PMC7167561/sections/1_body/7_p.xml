<p id="p0040">The observed inability of bat influenza viruses to efficiently transmit within mice and ferrets, alongside their limited reassortment potential with conventional IAVs (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]) reduces the probability that these viruses pose an imminent zoonotic threat. However, that does not rule out the potential for epizootic transmission, and gene segments of bat H17N10 and H18N11 viruses are compatible for reassortment [
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Important questions therefore remain regarding the true diversity of bat influenza viruses and their evolutionary relationship to conventional IAVs. Frugivorous and insectivorous bats diverged over 50 million years ago and there are over 1400 known species of bats. Although H17N10 and H18N11 viruses have only been detected in New World fruit bats (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies with pseudotyped viruses demonstrated that ectopically expressed MHCII from the insectivorous bats 
 <italic>Eptesicus fuscus</italic> and 
 <italic>Myotis lucifugus</italic> was sufficient to serve as a cellular receptor for entry of these viruses [
