<p id="p0045">The growing frequency of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses reinforces the critical need to adopt a ‘One Health’ approach to effectively control infectious diseases. Bats have proved to be an especially important reservoir for many pathogens with zoonotic potential, including SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and Ebola virus. The discovery and ongoing characterization of bat influenza viruses highlights the unpredictable nature of IAVs and the need for more intense study of their evolutionary diversity and pathobiology, especially in non-human hosts.</p>
