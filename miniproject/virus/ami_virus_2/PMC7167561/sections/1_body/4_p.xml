<p id="p0025">The rP11 virus also contained K170R and N250S mutations in HA, which were shown to enhance infectivity in mammalian cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. These mutations were maintained in rP11 after passage in ferrets when the mutation restoring NA expression emerged. NA expression was also required for efficient transmission in bats. Infection of 
 <italic>Artibeus jamaicensis</italic> bats (a close relative of 
 <italic>Artibeus planirostris</italic>, the species from which H18N11 was initially characterized) with rP11 also resulted in restoration of the full-length N11 coding sequence collected from both index and contact animals. Therefore, while full-length N11 does not appear to be required for replication and shedding, it is likely to be necessary to facilitate efficient transmission in bats. Ciminski 
 <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that ectopically expressed N11 reduced surface expression of MHCII. They speculated that this might facilitate progeny virus egress, just as cleavage of sialic acid facilitates the egress of other IAVs [
