<p id="p0015">The use of MHCII as a receptor is unique to bat H17N10 and H18N11 influenza viruses, which might suggest altered cellular tropism relative to other known IAVs. In bats, H17N10 RNA was detected in liver, kidney, lung, and intestinal tissues, whereas H18N11 RNA was found exclusively in the intestine [

 <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that, in bats experimentally infected with H18N11, virus could be detected in the feces and transmitted to co-housed naïve bats, presumably via the fecal–oral route [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This is akin to the behavior of avian influenza viruses in waterfowl. Going forward, it will be important to determine with greater resolution the specific cell types that are permissive for replication of H17N10 and H18N11 viruses in bats. This will be essential for understanding the coevolutionary relationship of the virus with these hosts. The discovery of MHCII as a receptor for bat influenza viruses also raises several important questions about the consequences of immune cell susceptibility in terms of both viral pathogenicity and host range.
