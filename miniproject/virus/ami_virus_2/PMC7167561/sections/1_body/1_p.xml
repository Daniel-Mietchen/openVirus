 <italic>et al.</italic> used transcriptomic profiling and genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening of susceptible and nonsusceptible cells to identify and characterize MHCII as an entry determinant for bat H17N10 and H18N11 viruses [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The authors also observed that bat H17N10 and H18N11 viruses could initiate virus entry via MHCII homologs encoded by multiple bat species, pigs, humans, and chickens [

 <italic>et al.</italic> confirmed human HLA-DR as the receptor for H17 using pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis viruses expressing H17 as the surface glycoprotein [
