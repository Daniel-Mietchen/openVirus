<p id="p0020">The fact that viruses pseudotyped with bat influenza virus HAs could infect avian and human cells raised concerns regarding the potential for epizootic and zoonotic transmissions. The studies of Giotis 
 <italic>et al.</italic> and Karakus 
 <italic>et al.</italic> using viruses pseudotyped with bat H17 and H18 demonstrated that bat IAVs have broad tropism. In humans, certain cells of the immune system, as well as epithelial cells in human lung and intestine, constitutively express MHCII. However, it remained unclear whether wild-type (WT) bat IAVs were able to replicate and transmit in species other than bats. A recent study by Ciminski 
 <italic>et al.</italic> has provided important insight into this critical question. Using WT and cell-culture-adapted H18N11, the authors performed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> replication and transmission studies in mice, ferrets, and bats. These viruses were produced from infectious clones since, as yet, there are no natural isolates. Serial passage of WT H18N11 in canine RIE1495 cells selected for adaptive mutations in the viral HA (S235Y or V254F) and deletions of the neuraminidase (NA) ectodomain [

Virus replication was limited to the upper respiratory tract and infected mice were unable to transmit the virus to naïve contact mice. Ferrets are considered the ‘gold-standard’ model for studies of influenza virus pathogenesis and transmission. In these animals, a recombinant cell-culture-adapted bat virus (rP11), which contains adaptive mutations in HA and a stop codon in the stalk of NA that results in deletion of the ectodomain, replicated in multiple organs, including trachea, nasal conchae, lung, cerebrum, and cerebellum. However, the virus was not shed or transmitted to naïve contact ferrets. Interestingly, on passaging of rP11 in ferrets, a single point mutation restored the N11 open reading frame, suggesting that it may have functional relevance. However, viral transcripts could not be detected in nasal lavage of ferrets infected with WT H18N11 [
