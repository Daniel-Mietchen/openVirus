<p id="p0035">Emerging data have suggested that broadly neutralizing antibodies are capable of neutralizing H17N10 viruses [
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the titers and prevalence of antibodies capable of neutralizing bat H17 and H18 viruses in humans have not yet been studied. It will be interesting to determine whether humans and other species in areas where bat influenza viruses are endemic (i.e., South America) have already been exposed to these viruses and have mounted specific adaptive immune responses. Sero-epidemiological studies could shed important light on this question.
