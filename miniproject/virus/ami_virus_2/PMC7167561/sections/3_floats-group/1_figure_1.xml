  <p>The Ability of Bat Influenza Viruses to Downregulate MHC Class II (MHCII) Expression May Have Immunological Consequences for the Host.</p>
  <p>(A) MHCII-mediated antigen presentation in infected cells, along with other co-stimulatory signals, plays a critical role in CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cell activation. Activated CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells produce cytokines that prime a strong humoral response against invading viruses. (B) Bat influenza viruses use MHCII as a cellular receptor. These viruses are known to infect epithelial cells. However, it is unclear whether they infect MHCII-expressing antigen-presenting cells. (C) Ciminski 
   <italic>et al.</italic> [
   <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] demonstrated that N11 reduced surface expression of MHCII. (D) While this is likely to facilitate virus egress from infected cells, it might in turn reduce CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cell activation â€“ especially if it occurs in antigen-presenting cells. This could have deleterious effects on the host adaptive immune response (E), including the priming of humoral antiviral response. Further studies are required to fully understand the role of N11 in downregulating host MHCII and to discern the potential implications for the adaptive immune response, viral pathogenesis, and disease manifestation. Abbreviations: TCR, T cell receptor.
