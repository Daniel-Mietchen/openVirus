<p id="Par31">Various therapeutic efforts were adopted for the CoV vaccine globally; however, no solution in form of promising treatment or vaccination is identified till date. Progressive efforts on developed animal models and under clinical trials are ongoing to find an effective vaccine that is underway. As discussed in the above sections, targeting S glycoproteins of the virus and its subunits responsible for host interaction may be effective target for CoV vaccine for humans. As per research conducted on various CoV genetic structure, the S protein genetic make-up is found to be similar in SARS-CoV, bat SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. Previously conducted studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccine development based on S glycoproteins of virus can provide insight into effective and efficient vaccine development against deadly strains of corona.</p>
