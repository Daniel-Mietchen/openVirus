<p id="Par30">The efficacy of different types of coronavirus vaccines is studied for their potential application in the prevention of the disease. Various types of coronavirus vaccines are under research like inactivated coronavirus, live attenuated coronavirus, S-protein-based, vectored vaccines, DNA vaccines, and combination vaccines. Vaccines for combating several animal-based CoVs have been developed and demonstrated to be efficient in averting viral contagion. Vaccines for human CoVs, especially deadly SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and the present pandemic COVID-19, are under development in various levels of preclinical, subclinical, and clinical trials. The study of virus-like particle vaccine in mice and whole virus vaccine in non-human primates and ferrets exhibits immune response against CoV infection, but later on vaccinated animals unveiled immunopathological lung disease (Tseng et al.

Another study in canine CoV vaccine exhibited that the vaccination with inactivated CoV can expressively reduce the viral replication followed with the reduction in occurrence of clinical symptoms and disease due to virulent CoV infection (Fulker et al.

In a study carried out on rhesus monkey with SARS-CoV, inactivated vaccine exhibited effective concomitant humoral and mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV infection. The rhesus monkey was inoculated with a varied dose (0.5, 5, 50, and 5000 μg) of vaccine and provided with booster dose after a week. Afterwards the animals were exposed to NS-1 strain of SARS-CoV, the vaccinated monkeys had not shown any systematic side effects neither any clinical symptoms. The vaccine in study shows promising results on monkeys and may be further tested under clinical trials on humans (Zhou et al.
