<p id="Par28">The research reported by various individual groups shows that CoV S subunit protein provides complete protection than SARS-CoV live attenuated vaccines, full-length S protein, and DNA-based S protein vaccines (Buchholz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>). The S protein gene of coronavirus is a highly preferable target of antigenicity as exhibited by the reactivity with convalescent SARS patient sera. It shows precise binding to soluble ACE-2 receptor. Additionally, it promotes antibody-dependent viral access in Raji B cells of human refractory B Cells and provokes defense against a impute infection in an animal model (Liu et al.
