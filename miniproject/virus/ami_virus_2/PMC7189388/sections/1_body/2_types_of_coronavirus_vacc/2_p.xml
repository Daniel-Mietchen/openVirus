<p id="Par27">Live attenuated vaccines contain weakened or dead virus to induce immune response in individual recipient. The live virus vaccine sometimes develops complications in the receiver, but it provides a long-term immune response for the specific virus. Antibody-based vaccines contain monoclonal antibodies which are strain specific and provide limited range of protection. As per the studies carried out on coronavirus, it mutated many times and in the last 15–18 years, some species emerged as deadly virus. The protein subunit-based vaccines are one of the safest vaccines, providing protection to a wide range of virus strains by targeting viral S and N proteins which facilitate attachment and interaction of virus to host cells. Nucleic acid-based vaccines also known as DNA or RNA vaccine are also safe for the recipients and provide long-term immunity. The mRNA-based vaccine for COVID-19 already sent for phase 1 clinical trial. Some of the coronavirus vaccines are listed in Table
