<p id="Par21">Since the inception of deadly coronavirus such as SARS-CoV in 2003â€“2004, the human coronaviruses drew very much attention of the researchers worldwide to find a solution. The emergence and transfer of zoonotic pathogens in humans become a great threat for human population. After a decade of SARS outbreak, MERS is emerged as another severe threat and continued infecting after its discovery in 2012 (Stockman et al.

In 2020 coronavirus emerged in a new form and is standing in front of the whole humanity as a severe threat in the form of pandemic accountable for many lives across the globe. The timely containment and slow rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS helped to control its larger impact (Menachery et al.
