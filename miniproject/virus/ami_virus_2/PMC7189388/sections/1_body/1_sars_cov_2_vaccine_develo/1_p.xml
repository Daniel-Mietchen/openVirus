<p id="Par18">COVID-19 contains the largest RNA genome and has spike proteins which play very important role in host–virus interaction and infection. After entering into host cells, the viral genome translates into two large precursors, poly-proteins known as PP1a and PP1ab. These precursors further processed by ORF1a-encoded viral proteinases, PL pro (papain-like proteinases) and 3CL pro (3C-like proteinases) into 16 mature non-structural proteins, namely nsp1 to nsp16. These nsps perform several important functions in viral RNA replication and transcription, RNA polymerase, RNA-processing enzymes such as poly (U)-specific endoribonuclease, protease, helicase, 3′–5′ exoribonuclease, ribose 2′-O methyltransferase, adenosine diphosphate-ribose-1″-phosphatase, and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (Narayanan et al.

Due to the absence of proofreading mechanism during RNA recombination process in pre-existed coronaviruses strains, it may account to be responsible for the evolution of SARS-CoV-2. The S gene-encoding spike glycoproteins have the maximum recombination frequency (Ji et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). Out of the three major proteins forming viral envelope, S and M are glycol proteins and the E is non-glycosylated protein. M and E proteins are essential for virus assembly, morphogenesis, and budding. The M protein comprises short N terminal glycosylated ectodomain with a long C terminal domain and three membrane domains. On the other hand, S glycoprotein is a type 1 fusion viral protein which includes two heptad repeat regions HR-N and HR-C and forms protein ectodomain-surrounded coiled structure. Additionally, the S protein cleaves into two subunits S1 and S2 and facilitates receptor binding (at domain 270–510) and membrane fusion, respectively (Tripet et al.

Considering the importance of S protein in attachment with host cell and variation in sequence of S protein from SARS-CoV-1, S protein may be considered potential candidate for vaccine development. Systematic assessment identified that 380 amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV-1, SARS like bat CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 may be responsible for functional and pathogenic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al.
