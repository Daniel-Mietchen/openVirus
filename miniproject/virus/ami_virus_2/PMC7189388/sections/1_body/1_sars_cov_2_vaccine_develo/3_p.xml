<p id="Par20">The above given set of data is few of ongoing search for potential vaccine. Vaccine development is one of the typical processes and requires lot of efforts and time. There are several vaccines under development for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, and researches are still going on at various stages of clinical trials. The available advanced technology for virus genome sequencing and global emergency of pandemic expedite the process to develop vaccine at earliest. The potential vaccine may take more than a year to come on the market after getting all approvals. As once the researchers develop a vaccine, it must get approved from various agencies like FDA after which the vaccine is sent to three phases of clinical trial. In phase 1, a small group of people are selected to evaluate the safety and immune response for vaccine. After successful trial in phase 1, the vaccine is tested for phase 2 clinical trial on approximately few hundred people to analyse the dosage. In phase 3, the effectiveness and safety evaluation of the vaccine will be evaluated on a large population. Once the vaccine passes all the three phases, it successfully gets approval from the FDA and is released for use to combat against the pathogen.</p>
