<p id="Par19">The COVID-19 virus is traced till death in non-survivors, and the longest virus shedding of 37 days has been observed in survivors (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2020</xref>). It shows the severity of COVID-19 and its high infection rate especially in elderly and immunocompromised or weak immunity individuals. Several pharmaceutical R&amp;D units and researchers are working to develop vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Researchers are putting all efforts to find a solution for combating this novel coronavirus. Researchers across the globe are trying to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccine by using approaches like whole virus vaccine, antibody vaccine, DNA vaccine, recombinant protein subunit vaccine, and mRNA vaccine (Dresden 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). Currently, there is no approved vaccine available for SARS-CoV-2. Recently, mRNA 1273 investigational vaccine has been developed by NIAID scientists in collaboration with the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, MA. The clinical trial began at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (KPWHRI) in Seattle, and part of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health, is funding the trial on mRNA platform approved for human trial after its promising response in animal models (NIH). A team of researchers from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, reported high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV (outbreak in 2003) and SARS-CoV-2. This genetic similarity leads researchers to determine experimental data for SARS-CoV-1 B-cell and T-cell epitopes derived from S and N proteins which map identically to SARS-CoV-2. In comparison to the non-structural proteins, the T-cell response against the structural proteins has been reported to be the most immunogenic in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of recovering SARS-CoV patients. Additionally, T-cell responses against the S and N proteins have been reported to be the most dominant and long-lasting (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008</xref>; Channappanavar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>; Ahmed et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). As no mutation was observed in the SARS-CoV-2 proteins and long-lasting T-cell response against S protein, immune targeting of these epitopes may provide protection against COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 (Ahmed et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). Similar study was also reported by researchers from CFAR, King George’s Medical University, Lucknow, India, in which researchers found glycosylated S protein site as potential target for vaccine development due to the genetic similarity with SARS-CoV and Bat CoV (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). Table
