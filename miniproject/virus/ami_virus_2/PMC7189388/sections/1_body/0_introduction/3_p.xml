<p id="Par15">The emergence of COVID-19 has drawn very much attention of researchers and health professionals because of its high infection potential and novel structure. Researchers found the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on various surfaces and compared the same with SARS-CoV-1. The experimental data under varied circumstances on different surfaces are found to be similar for both the strains (van Doremalen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). The experimental observation shows that alterations in the epidemiologic characteristics of both the viruses may arise due to other reasons. The high viral concentration in the upper respiratory tract in the patient and the potential of COVID-19-infected individual to carry and spread the virus while being in asymptomatic condition are some probable reasons for high infection rate, making its control challenging (Bai et al.
