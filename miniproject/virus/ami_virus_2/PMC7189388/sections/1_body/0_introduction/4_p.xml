<p id="Par16">COVID-19 is a single-stranded (ss) RNA virus consisting of 26–36 kb positive sense RNA genome. The complete virus particle is made up of four major structural proteins, namely spikes (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) encoded by virus genome (Forni et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>). The size of SARS-CoV-2-encoded proteins shows similarity to bat SARS-CoV. The important difference is longer length and structure of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to SARS-CoV and bat SARS-CoV observed by researchers. These S proteins are very crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion, internalization of the SARS-CoV-2, tissue tropism, and host array. This S protein may be utilized as vital target for vaccine development (Menachery et al.
