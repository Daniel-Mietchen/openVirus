<p id="p0155">In 1970 in Oaxaca (Mexico) a vampire bat Desmodus 
 <italic>rotundus</italic> was found infected with an epidemic strain of VEEV (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Correa et al., 1972</xref>). In Guatemala a serological study on 939 neotropical bats of 22 species of an enzootic focus of Venezuelan equine encephalitis was carried out during 1971â€“75, in which VEEV antibodies were found in seven bat species, three belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Artibeus</italic>, and the virus was isolated from a 
 <italic>Uroderma bilobatum</italic>. This study suggested that the genus 
 <italic>Artibeus</italic> is regularly infected with the virus and possibly serves as an alternative host for virus maintenance (
