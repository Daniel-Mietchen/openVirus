<p id="p0190">Historically, biological control uses predatory species and pathogenic microorganisms to reduce the population of mosquito species that act as disease vectors. This control strategy for mosquito-borne arboviruses, which do not normally have specific antiviral therapies available, is important because the resources used are typically biodegradable and ecological. During the last decade the advance of molecular biology has allowed the optimization of genetic materials associated with biological control agents. A significant advance has been the discovery of the cytoplasmic incompatibility induced by the
