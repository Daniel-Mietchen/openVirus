<p id="p0110">It is known that 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> is currently present in Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Portugal (Madeira Island), Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland. In some of the aforementioned countries, imported cases have been reported. Given the amplitude of arboviruses, high viremias in humans, and the global distribution of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic>, it can be stated that there is a high risk for the import of the virus into new areas by infected travelers (
