<p id="p0010"> The 
 <italic>arboviruses</italic> (arthropod-borne virus) are viruses that require the hematophagous action of an arthropod vector for transmission to hosts (vertebrates). 
 <italic>Arboviruses</italic> infect humans directly via enzootic or spillover cycles. However, dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and yellow fever viruses (YFV) in their cycles of urban transmission require competent vectors to cause major epidemics. 
 <italic>Culicidae</italic> mosquitoes (Díptera: Culicidae) occupy a preferential position due to their obligate hematophagy, maximum adaptability to multiple environments at different latitudes and altitudes, and a great variability of preferred hosts from which they can feed and in which they can spread the virus. Infectious diseases caused by viruses are one of the greatest concerns for public health worldwide (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Bueno and Jiménez, 2010</xref>). The arboviruses comprise viruses of the families Togaviridae (genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>), Flaviviridae (genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>), and Bunyaviridae (genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>). The natural cycle of transmission of these viruses mainly involves mosquitoes of the genera 
 <italic>Culex</italic>, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, 
 <italic>Psorophora</italic>, and 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic>. Birds and rodents are among the main reservoirs of these viruses (
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Parra-Henao and Suárez, 2012</xref>). The major arboviruses that affect humans are DENV, YFV, West Nile virus (WNV), Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV), Mayaro virus (MAYV), St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and La Crosse encephalitis virus (Bunyaviridae family), and Oropouche virus (OROV, Bunyaviridae family).
