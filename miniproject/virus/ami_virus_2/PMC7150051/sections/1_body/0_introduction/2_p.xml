 <italic>arboviruses</italic> occur when populations of infected female mosquitoes bite to feed (hematophagy). While people of all ages can suffer from the disease, children being the most susceptible to illness and death and people over 50 years of age are the ones with the most severe cases of illness. As all mosquitoes do not carry viruses, people will not always get sick out of their bites, only an annoyance similar to influenza can occur, which can be resolved in a few days. In serious cases, the symptoms occur between 4 and 10 days after being bitten by mosquitoes. The disease can start with fever, skin rash, headache, muscle pain, nausea, or vomiting, then it can progress to paralysis, coma, and possibility of death. People who survive can suffer permanent effects on health such as memory loss, paralysis, and changes in personality (
