<p id="p0050">Most arboviruses with the exception of DENV are kept within a jungle cycle, where bloodsucking insects act as vectors and wild vertebrates are involved as hosts. Although in the Americas, the jungle cycle for DENV has not been verified, in a tropical forest in northeastern Brazil, an amplicon of DENV-1 was detected in a 
 <italic>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</italic> and DENV-3 infecting larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> with transovarian transmission. This suggests that this virus could be involved in a sylvatic cycle (

 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> have food and flight adaptability; in certain scenarios, they can fly at ground level by stinging humans and wild animals when they enter their ecological niche (

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Muñoz-Rodríguez et al., 2010</xref>), they can not only fly in open areas, distances between 250 and 350 m, but also distances close to 11 km, and in extreme conditions they can even fly 50 km or more in search of food (
