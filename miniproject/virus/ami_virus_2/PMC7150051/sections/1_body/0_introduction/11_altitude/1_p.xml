<p id="p0085">Climate changes are causing alterations in the behavior of hosts and vectors that favor the spread of zoonoses including arboviruses (
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Monsalve et al., 2009</xref>), for example, the adaptation of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> that has been observed in Colombia since 1981 where it was thought that the species did not live above 1585 masl but was captured at 1600 masl and later at 2200 masl in Malaga–Santander (
 <xref rid="bib91" ref-type="bibr">Suárez and Nelson, 1981</xref>). Cases of dengue associated with the presence of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> at 1746 masl were reported in Caqueza, Colombia (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez and De la Hoz, 2005</xref>), and the National System of Surveillance in Public Health (SIVIGILA) between 1999 and 2010 recorded 628,016 cases of dengue, of which 2801 cases were presented in 53 municipalities located above 1800 masl (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Padilla et al., 2013</xref>). In 2016 the presence of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> was confirmed at 2302 masl and infection with the DENV at 1984 masl; this being the highest recorded altitude for this vector and infection reported in Colombia (
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Ruiz-López et al., 2016</xref>). The same situation has been recognized in Cochabamba (Bolivia), where colonies of 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> are completing their biological cycle at 2450 masl but the DENV transmission at these altitudes is unknown (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Aquino et al., 2016</xref>). Thanks to the adaptation of the vector, arboviruses constitute a risk and threat of epidemics in populations that live at higher altitudes.
