 </sup> have reached clinical trials within ~22 months and ~25 months, respectively after their outbreaks (NCT02670187, NCT00099463). Both first clinical trials were based on DNA vaccines encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein and even though the results of the SARS-CoV vaccine have not been published yet, MERS-CoV DNA vaccine preliminary results showed good tolerability and immunogenicity in humans, with immune responses similar to the ones elicited after natural infection, which supports further development.
