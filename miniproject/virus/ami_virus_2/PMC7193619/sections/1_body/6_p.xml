<p id="Par8">The great majority of licensed vaccines are based in inactivation/attenuation pathogens which lengthen the development, cost and production of the vaccine. Recombinant viral vectored, DNA/RNA and protein technologies are setting the fastest records in vaccine development but just a selected few have been licensed so far for veterinary use only, since, for humans some vaccines have not met some regulatory requirements for approval and commercialization yet but international emergencies like the current COVID-19 could provide a final push towards obtaining licensure. This highlights the potential of vaccinology to make fast progress when appropriate international support exists, proving that when there is a will, there is a way.</p>
