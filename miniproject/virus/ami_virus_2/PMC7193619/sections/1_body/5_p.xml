However, the rVSV-Ebola vaccine candidate based on a live, attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector produced by Merck has progressed beyond I/II/III clinical trials

 </sup> in December 2019; whereas a viral-vectored Ebola vaccine candidate consisting of Ad26/MVA has now completed phase III trial (NCT02543567). Initial vaccine clinical trials may not always lead to a successful license but can pave the way to the success of future vaccines in acquiring the license.
