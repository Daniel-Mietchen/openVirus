 </sup>, which reached trials in 52, ~19 and ~9 years after declaration of major outbreaks, respectively ((13), (17), NCT02840487). Dengue Virus has been in circulation for more than a century and a tetravalent live attenuated vaccine produced by Sanofi Pasteur has only been authorized by the European Medicine Agency in 2018. However, the very first clinical trial was done during the World War II by Albert Sabin, who used a Dengue virus originally attenuated in mice

The first Zika DNA vaccine reached trials in August 2016, 9 years after ZIKV outbreak in part of the Federated States of Micronesia, 3 years after the major epidemic in French Polynesia in October 2013 but just 6 months after WHO declaration as the Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on February 2016, highlighting the advances in the modern vaccine development in urgent need. A Zika DNA vaccine delivered in a split-dose needle freeway, was able to induce six times higher immune responses compared to a single-dose delivery via needle and syringe and therefore moved into an international placebo-controlled phase 2 efficacy trial
