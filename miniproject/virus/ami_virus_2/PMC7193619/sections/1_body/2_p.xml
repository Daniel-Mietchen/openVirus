<p id="Par4">The mRNA1273-COVID-19 vaccine has set a record time by reaching trials (NCT04283461) in only 69 days after the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 as the causative agent of the current outbreak

 </sup>. This is a nanoparticle encapsulated (LNP) mRNA vaccine that encodes a full length, prefusion stabilised spike (S) glycoprotein, which progressed directly to clinical assessment without pre-clinical studies due to its potentially safe nature, thus accounting for its speed in reaching phase I trials. A recombinant novel COVID-19 vaccine based on an adenovirus vector 5 (Ad5-nCoV) encoding the full-length S protein has progressed fastest and has now entered phase II trials from 12th April 2020. The INO-4800, DNA plasmid-based vaccine encodes the S protein and is delivered by two intradermal injections followed by electroporation of the DNA vaccine in healthy volunteers. The COVID-19 specific aAPC vaccine has been prepared by transfection of aAPCs with a genetically-modified lentivirus encoding the SARS-CoV-2 structural and protease protein domains to aAPCs, which are delivered by three subcutaneous injections to healthy and COVID-19 positive volunteers between age of 6 months to 80 years. The lentiviral-based COVID-19 (LV-DC) vaccine and antigen-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) vaccine encoding COVID-19 antigens were given via subcutaneous injection and intravenous (IV) infusion respectively to the volunteers including the laboratory (RT-PCR) confirmed COVID-19 infections as part of Phase I/II trial. In addition, a COVID-19 vaccine based on Chimpanzee Adenovirus Vector (ChAdOx1) developed by University of Oxford has entered phase I/II clinical trial in April 2020 to test its safety, tolerability and reactogenicity profile, as well as its immunogenicity in 510 volunteers. This vaccine also aims to be assessed for efficacy to prevent infection measured by PCR as well as symptomatic infection (NCT04324606). Chimpanzee adenoviral vectors are replication-deficient vaccines that carry one or a few encoded antigens and efficiently stimulate both arms of the adaptive immune responses: humoral and cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs). They have been very well-studied as a vaccine platform in over 10 different pathogens with safe profile in thousands of volunteers from 1 week of age to 90 year-old volunteers
