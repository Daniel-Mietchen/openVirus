<p>SARS generated a lot of very influential nursing research, particularly in the field of infection control nursing. The 
 <italic>Journal of Clinical Nursing</italic> published several significant papers that highlighted the emotional impact of caring at the time of SARS and dealt with some of the other lessons that could be learnt from the outbreak, in terms of evaluating systems of care delivery and use of nursing care models (Watson,

It was hoped that research generated during this period would help the international nursing community be in a better position to deal more effectively with any subsequent viral outbreaks. With the emergence of COVID‚Äê19, that was about to be tested. Would healthcare managers and hospital administrators understand what is really needed to support nursing practice and ensure the provision of high quality of care? Would they deliver this time?
