<p>COVID‐19 presents a vast public health challenge, not only to China, but also around the world. As outlined in this editorial, it has already posed many challenges to our profession and international research community. It was only through high‐quality nursing research that some of the questions raised by the SARS outbreak were answered and lessons were learned. In some ways, COVID‐19 may act as a wake‐up call to the world to revisit those lessons and to re‐examine public health priorities. We live in a very different world from that of 2003, it is a constantly changing and very unpredictable world. Hopefully, this outbreak will provide scope and impetus for nurse researchers to address some of the key questions that have been thrown up by the current epidemic and we need to do this in a collaborative way and from an international perspective. We, as nurse researchers, should be mindful of the benefits of conducting this research with healthcare colleagues in related professions to further develop the knowledge base of the international scientific community. Despite extensive efforts, there also needs to be more international collaboration amongst government, health agencies and key stakeholders to ensure the response to the outbreak is optimised and to ensure timely dissemination of accurate information. There should not be a disconnection between those communicating the information and those requiring it, importantly the internet and social media should not become the clearing house for vital health‐related information for the general public.</p>
