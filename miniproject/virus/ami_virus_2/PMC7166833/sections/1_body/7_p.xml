<p>One third of all fatalities during the 2003 SARS outbreak in China were healthcare professionals (Hung,

 <xref rid="jocn15231-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Healthcare‐associated amplification of transmission of emerging viral infections is always a concern; surely, lessons should have been learnt about the importance of occupational protection during previous epidemics, including the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2012. Clearly, some lessons have not been learnt, as clinical nurses in China who are battling the virus are working around the clock and some are not eating food so as to avoid the need for toilet breaks (Thiagarajan, 
 <xref rid="jocn15231-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Nursing staff need to change their protective gear if they take a toilet break; therefore, some have resorted to wearing diapers and there are even stories of nurses shaving their heads to reduce spread of infection and to allow them to be able to change their protective gear more quickly (Farber, 
 <xref rid="jocn15231-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Stories of nursing courage and compassion are bounteous; however, the narrative of 
 <italic>Nurse Yao</italic>, captured by the BBC, is one which is particularly touching. Her day‐to‐day job was in a fever clinic, she decided not to celebrate Chinese Lunar New Year with her family and chose to volunteer to work in a hospital in the epicentre of the virus. In a moving narrative, she expressed her strong devotion to care for those with the virus, reporting long working shifts “at the end of the shift, when we take off our suits, we find our clothes are completely wet with sweat” and exhaustion “nursing staff would collapse at the end of their shift and they were too tired to walk home.” Despite working in such adversity, 
 <italic>Nurse Yao</italic> chose to highlight the positive aspects of her work with her nursing colleagues “the virus brings us all together, it unites us.” (BBC,
