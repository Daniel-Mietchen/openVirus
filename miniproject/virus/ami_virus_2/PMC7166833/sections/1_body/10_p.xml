<p>Perhaps, this is the first major disease outbreak that poses a global threat in the age of social media. Accounts vary, but it is clear that social media and sensationalist reporting of the outbreak have generated panic and mistrust in the general public, not only diverting attention away from the response to outbreak but also impeding the activities of already stretched healthcare professionals. Hopefully, we and the general public can gain some reassurance because the WHO are using their Information Network for Epidemics platform to track for false information in numerous languages and are working with social media providers, including Facebook, Twitter and Weibo (a Chinese blog platform) to help filter out such misinformation. Conceivably, COVID‐19 will provide an opportunity to put into practice some of the lessons we learn from studies of social media during this outbreak, specifically in relation to the dynamics of online heroisation and blame. However, it does remain difficult to know what to believe with the current media coverage of COVID‐19.</p>
