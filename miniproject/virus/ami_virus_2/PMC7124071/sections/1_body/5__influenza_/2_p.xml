<p id="Par39">Influenza is often associated with mild elevations in liver enzymes, which typically resolve after clearance of the virus. This is somewhat intriguing as the virus typically infects the respiratory endothelial lining and the hepatocytes are not exposed to the viral antigen. It has been proposed that the process of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration of the liver in influenza infection can lead to clinically significant hepatitis [

The pattern of injury is typically hepatocellular with alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) usually two to three times above the normal limit. Alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) are often normal. Another observation was significantly higher serum levels of AST, ALT, and GGT in patients with pandemic influenza in 2009 caused by the H1N1 strain compared to seasonal influenza [
