<p id="para50">Qiu and colleagues have done a very important preliminary study defining the clinical picture for children infected with SARS-CoV-2, which will be valued globally. Although this work will assist with case identification, management, and social policy guidance, much more information is needed to establish the optimum management regimen. Specifically, the data showed that paediatric patients with COVID-19 had mild or asymptomatic disease accompanied by pneumonia in about half the cases.

 </xref> It is unclear which children should be targeted for antiviral and immunomodulatory treatment, particularly in view of the high proportion of asymptomatic infected contacts. Together, these results could suggest that children have specific mechanisms regulating the interaction between the immune system and respiratory machinery, which could be contributing to milder disease. Possibly, lung infiltrates have a protective role during paediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection, similar to lymphocytes participating in inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid structure development after respiratory insult.

 </xref> Correlation between chest radiography and CT findings might give additional insight into the clinical importance, if any, of the CT findings. In view of the substantial radiation exposure associated with CT, if children are only experiencing mild disease, routine use of CT might not be warranted and needs further assessment for the management of paediatric cases.
