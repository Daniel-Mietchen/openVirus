Patients were stratified by disease severity and were assessed in hospital (mean duration of hospitalisation, 14 [SD 3] days) for secondary bacterial and fungal infection, sepsis, immune responses, and organ dysfunction (lung, liver, heart, and kidney). All children underwent CT examination for diagnosis of pneumonia.
