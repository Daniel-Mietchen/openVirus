<p>The presence of the Asian II genotype of DENV-2 in the state of Mato Grosso in humans and mosquitoes is of paramount epidemiological importance. Our data not only confirm the circulation of this genotype in another state of Brazil other than Minas Gerais but also indicate the possibility of its spread to other regions of the country. Unlike the results reported in other studies, we also detected the Asian II genotype of DENV-2 in mosquitoes collected in the forest, which may be related to a spillback event of human dengue virus. Thus, continuous molecular surveillance of dengue virus in humans, vectors, and mammals in other regions of Brazil is required to further investigate the epidemiological status of this genotype.</p>
