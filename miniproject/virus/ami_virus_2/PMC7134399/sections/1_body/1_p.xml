<p id="p0010">In December 2019, a new form of pneumonia was observed in Hubei Province, China [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was subsequently found to be responsible for this condition, defined as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The virus has now spread outside Chinese borders with 82,297 cases and 2804 deaths worldwide as of 26
 <sup>th</sup> February 2020 [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. After infection, symptoms appear after an incubation time of 3â€“5 days, with 80% of those infected developing mild disease, 15% developing severe disease, and 5% requiring support in an intensive care unit (ICU) [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Overall, the estimated case-fatality rate is between 0.4% and 2.9% and the basic reproduction number is approximately 3.28 [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen for humans and no immune protection exists; as such, everybody can be potentially infected. Moreover, no primary prophylaxis measures (vaccination) or effective treatments are available. If the above percentages are applied to the worldwide population, it appears clear why all measures should be considered to avoid further spread of the virus and prevention of the saturation and collapse of health systems and the most catastrophic pandemic since 1919 Spanish flu.
