<p id="p0020">These rules are effective for controlling infections in the community, but several doubts arise when it is necessary to transpose them into the hospital setting. Hospitals are a delicate place in epidemics; they collect fragile persons who can be exposed to the virus and are subsequently re-admitted to the community, thus spreading the infection. Indeed, the ongoing outbreak in Northern Italy has been linked to a single infected patient who accessed a community hospital where he transmitted the virus to several other patients and healthcare workers [

Moreover, the isolation of patients in the hospital setting imposes a significant burden in terms of PPE used by healthcare workers, space dedicated to these patients, and time spent in their management. Even more complex is the situation of patients in ICUs, where viral spread is facilitated by endotracheal tubes and manoeuvres performed on the respiratory tract. Therefore, a clear definition of the timing of infectiousness and the intensity of viral spread is mandatory to alleviate the burden on the healthcare system.
