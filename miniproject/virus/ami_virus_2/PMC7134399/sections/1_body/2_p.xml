<p id="p0015">Isolation of those affected and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) are the mainstay to block transmission of this pathogen, which is presumed to occur through respiratory droplets. A 14-day quarantine period is applied to subjects coming from endemic areas or who have had contact with confirmed cases. It is assumed that if the subject does not develop any signs or symptoms compatible with COVID-19 during the 14-day quarantine period, he/she is not infected and thus the quarantine can be removed and the subject can return to the community. Domiciliary quarantine of 14 days after a positive test is also applied for patients diagnosed with mild disease who do not need medical support.</p>
