<p id="p0025">Unfortunately, the data available on this topic are scarce, and consist of measurements of viral shedding without assessment of infectivity. Kim 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] assessed the viral load kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory tract materials in the first two confirmed patients in Korea. They employed real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2, and converted cycle threshold (CT) values of rRT-PCR into RNA copy number. The detection limit of rRT-PCR was 2690 copies/mL. Overall, viral load above the detection limit was detected until 14 and 25 days after symptom onset and for 13 and 11 days after first detection in the two patients, respectively [

 <italic>et al.</italic> analysed viral load in repeated nasal and throat swabs obtained from 17 symptomatic patients [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They also employed rRT-PCR and considered a CT of 40 as the detection limit. Higher viral loads were observed in nasal swabs and in samples collected soon after symptom onset. Only two patients presented positive samples, and only in nasal swabs, 14 days after symptom onset and with low viral load.
