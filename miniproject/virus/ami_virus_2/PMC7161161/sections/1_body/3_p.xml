<p>As the numbers of new COVID-19 cases appear to be flattening in China at the time of the writing of this introduction, a wave of new COVID-19 infections is striking Europe, South America, and North America at an alarming rate. While COVID-19 has limited neurovirulence, its reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) is high, indicating that its transmissibility gives it the potential to infect large proportions of the world population, with enough patients with severe symptoms to overwhelm our healthcare systems, as has been demonstrated in jurisdictions such as northern Italy. The many COVID-19 patients requiring admission to critical care and intensive care units have already led to the prioritization of neurosurgical cases throughout North America.
