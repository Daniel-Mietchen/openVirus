<p>Despite what we learned from prior epidemics, such as SARS, Ebola, and MERS, the words of Gates and others now appear to have been prophetic. While it is important to recognize the impact of COVID-19 on the practice of neurosurgery through this series of rapid communications in the Journal, it will be equally important to “debrief” on where we will be 6 to 12 months from now. It is our strong hope that we will be able to codify systems of containment so that we can immediately prevent or minimize the spread of diseases such as COVID-19; that we develop standardized systems of care so that a necessary and required stock of personal protective equipment (PPE) is always available; and that we work together to ensure that the prioritization of the care of acutely ill neurosurgical patients is forever seamless, even at times of limited inpatient hospital resources. Through arduous training processes and previous experiences, neurosurgeons are by nature a resilient group of surgical specialists. Accordingly, we hope to demonstrate that our responses to the COVID-19 pandemic will make our specialty stronger, and better prepared for the future.</p>
