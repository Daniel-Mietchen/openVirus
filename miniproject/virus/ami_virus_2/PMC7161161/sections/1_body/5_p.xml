<p>Accordingly, a series of rapid-communication editorials has been commissioned by the Journal of Neurosurgery Publishing Group (JNSPG) from neurosurgeons in regions severely affected by COVID-19, such as China, South Korea, Singapore, and Italy. We provide communications on the impact of COVID-19 on the practice of particular aspects of neurosurgery (

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on annual neurosurgical meetings, such as the American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS), are discussed by Kathleen Craig, Chief Executive Officer, and Chris Shaffrey, President of the AANS. The downstream effects of a reduction in operative experience and formal in-person conferencing on resident education are described in an editorial prepared by neurosurgery residency program directors. In this regard, the importance of web-based conferencing systems has emerged and reached primacy. The effects of COVID-19 on large academic neurosurgical units versus small private neurosurgical practices are compared and contrasted. Members of the Editorial Board of the JNSPG for all three print journals were asked to collate and prepare their experiences in the form of an editorial from across the United States and beyond. And finally, as issues arise when allocating scarce medical resources during pandemics, we present an editorial on the ethics of prioritizing and rationing neurosurgical care during the COVID-19 pandemic.
