<p>In 2003, SARS-CoV gripped the world. More than 8000 total cases of SARS-CoV were reported following the initial outbreak of cases in the Guangdong province of China in 2002. In 2003, the city of Toronto was the site of a large cluster of infected individuals, with over 400 cases documented. Large international meetings planned in Toronto, such as the American Association of Cancer Research annual meeting, the largest cancer research meeting of its kind in the world, were cancelled due to the SARS epidemic. Now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, virtually all the conferences of organized neurosurgical associations and societies around the world have been either cancelled or postponed. International airplane travel is forbidden in most countries. National travel is being discouraged. Practices of self-isolation and social distancing have become the norm.</p>
