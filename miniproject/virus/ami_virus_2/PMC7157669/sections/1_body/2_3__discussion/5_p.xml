<p>Usually viruses adopt different strategies including recombination, mutation and reassortment which facilitate the viruses in getting to equilibrium in the final host. Due to low fidelity of reverse transcriptase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RNA viruses are more vulnerable to point mutations even though the point mutation rates in RNA viruses are approximately 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 10
 <sup>−5</sup> [
 <xref rid="B42-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. During the 2002 SARS-CoV epidemics, three mutations per RNA in each replication round were estimated (8.26 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> per nucleotide per day) [

Often, large population size and high rate of mutations in RNA viruses rapidly adjust genotypes allowing for quick adaptations in a rapidly changing environment. Respectively, mutations have a specific influence on virus reproductive fitness as positive selection drives to fix the positive fitness effects of beneficial alleles, while negative selection removes lethal and deleterious alleles from a population. Together with these selective approaches, the evolutionary routes of virus populations can be figured out across a sequence space [
