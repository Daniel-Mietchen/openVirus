<p>Generally, emerging and re-emerging viral infections belong to the RNA family of viruses since these viruses have high mutation rates that lead to eminent environmental adaptation with rapid evolution [

To understand the genetic diversity relationship and potential origin of SARS-CoV-2, our molecular phylogenetic analysis predicted that SARS and SARS-like CoVs were the ancestors of SARS-CoV-2. Two bat SARS-like CoVs (ZXC21 and ZC45) were the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00240-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Consequently, we found that the bat would be the convenient native host of SARS-CoV-2. Previously, it was found that several bat CoVs were able to cause infection in humans without any intermediate host [
