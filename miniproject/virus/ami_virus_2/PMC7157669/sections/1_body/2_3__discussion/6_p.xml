<p>Recombination and reassortment became a powerful tool of emerging viruses to get innovative antigenic combinations that might aid the course of cross-species diffusion. The recombination strategy facilitates this mechanism to find a better fraction of sequence space than the mutation, raising the probability of finding a genetic configuration which supports host adaptations [
 <xref rid="B46-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. It is important to note that numerous recently emerged RNA viruses which were involved in human diseases exhibited active recombination or reassortment events. Mostly RNA viruses get entry into the new host through the cross-species transmission [
 <xref rid="B47-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The recombination events in viruses are in fact related to discontinuous utilization of RNA polymerase involved in the transcriptional mechanism to make mRNAs. RNA polymerase of viruses must use different RNA prototypes while making negative or positive RNA strands that eventually result in RNA recombination that is either homologous or non-homologous [
 <xref rid="B12-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In RNA viruses, this model of recombination is called the copy-choice model of recombination [

 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In CoVs, a high recombination rate has been reported [
 <xref rid="B48-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It might be due to having large genome size, discontinuous transcription, and sub- or fully transcriptionally active genomic length of RNA. The co-infection of two CoVs in same animal or cells can potentially facilitate crossing over. In the recent past, the emergence of new infectious bronchitis virus recombinant (IBV), a new type of CoV in turkeys, was reported. The genome sequence revealed that the S protein gene of this virus was the recombinant of another CoVs [
 <xref rid="B49-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the S protein, the recombination event is certainly significant as it permits the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to get from the immune reconnaissance into the animals, and then adapt to a human host. We identified nine putative recombination patterns, which encompass, in terms of genes involved, the spike glycoprotein, RdRp, helicase and ORF3a. Six of the nine recombination regions were spotted in the S gene (

 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00240-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) according to the method of Posada. He recommended that one should not be dependent on a single method [
 <xref rid="B50-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These results were in agreement with previous reports where the recombinant event was reported between parent viruses in the avian-like and mammalian-like SARS-CoV evolution [
