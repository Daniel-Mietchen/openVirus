<p>Moreover, a recent study revealed that a polybasic cleavage site was present at the S1 and S2 junction of SARS-CoV-2 that effectively allowed cleavage by furin and the other protease and took part in viral host range and infectivity [

On the other hand, in avian influenza viruses, quick replication and diffusion effectively acquired polybasic cleavage sites in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which served a similar function to that of the coronavirus spike protein. In CoVs, insertion or recombination facilitates acquisition of transforming low-pathogenicity into highly pathogenic forms for polybasic cleavage sites [

CoVs could have adopted a natural evolutionary mechanism to mutate and to attain the polybasic cleavage site because the virus must have both the mutations and polybasic cleavage site for appropriate human ACE2 receptor binding. For this purpose, it required a large population density for natural selection to attain an ACE2-encoding gene that is akin to the human ortholog [

The recent study of Peng et al. revealed that might it be possible that SARS-CoV-2 ancestors jumped into humans, getting the genetic features through adaptation and remaining undetected during human-to-human transmission. Once it adapted, these variations became pandemic and sufficiently produced a large number of cases to activate the immune system that identified it [
