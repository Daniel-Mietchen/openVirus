<p>When segments of multiple viral genomes infect the same animal or tissue simultaneously, it ultimately results in new viral progeny with a multiple parent genome set. This process is termed as gene reassortment used by viruses for evolution [

The literature suggests that a typical RNA influenza A virus has eight ssRNA segments and the assortment occurred among multiple influenza viruses termed as genetic “shift’’ or ‘‘antigenic shift’’ resulted in the change of influenza viral surface glycoprotein’s/neuraminidase. Thus, the sequence of these virus strains diverges widely when host animal cell gets infected by confection and the progeny is developed by reassortment or recombination [
