<p>Taking this together, we found that SARS-CoV-2 was the descendent of SARS/SARS-like coronaviruses, being a close relative of Bat SARS-like CoVs (ZXC21 and ZC45). We confirmed that mutations in different genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 have a specific influence on virus reproductive adaptability, allowing genotypes to adjust and quickly adapt in a rapidly changing environment. Moreover, for the first time we identified nine putative recombination patterns in SARS-CoV-2 which were undoubtedly important for evolutionary survival, meanwhile permitting the virus to modify superficial antigenicity to get from immune reconnaissance into animals and then adapting to a human host. With these combined natural selected strategies, SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a novel virus in human society.</p>
