<p>Rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 provided an opportunity for the research community to look into its genetic diversity, developing diagnostic tests and ultimately helping with vaccine production. The whole-genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 retained ~80% nucleotide homology with SARS epidemic viruses. All the structural proteins were well conserved except for spike glycoprotein that showed a high rate of mutation in SARS-CoV-2 [

 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that compared with SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 shares ~81% amino acid similarity in spike (S) protein (

This conservation pattern of RBD placed the SARS-CoV-2 between HKU3-4 (62.7% conserved), a bat virus that was not capable of using the human ACE2 receptor, and the divergent bat CoV rSHC014 (80.8%), a spike known to use the human ACE2 receptor for entrance [
