<p>For molecular phylogenetic analysis, the whole-genome sequences of 53 viruses including 10 SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from NCBI through BLASTn search, with Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV being used as reference (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-09-00240">Table S1</xref>). All the sequences were aligned by using MAFFT (V 7.452) online server [
 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. To determine the nucleotides substitution model, the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) value for aligned sequences was determined using jModel Test 2 and the substitution model with minimum BIC values was considered for phylogenetic inference (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-09-00240">Table S2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B54-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The whole-genome sequence was considered as a single partition, and three chains of Bayesian analysis were performed by applying the GTR+I+G model of substitution. Reaching the maximum allowed number of generations after discarding burin (270030000), the optimal analyses trees were pooled into a single tree file. Posterior probability values with majority consensus rule were visualized. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00240-f003">Figure 3</xref> was used to visualize the best tree and the likelihood phylogram was exported as a picture [
 <xref rid="B55-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Multalin software was used to align and visualized the envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, and spike glycoprotein regions of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="B56-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The amino acid conservation motifs of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 genome were traced by performing MUSCLE alignment using MEGAX software. The three-dimensional structures of spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV2 and SARS-CoV were generated by using an online server Protein Homology/analogY Recognition Engine V 2.0 (Phyre2) [
 <xref rid="B57-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and the structure was visualized and marked by using PyMol [
 <xref rid="B58-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. To detect the recombination events, whole-genome nucleotide sequences of seven viral strains (Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV; Bat SARS-like including W1V1, ZXC21, ZC45; Bat SARS GZ02, RF1 and MERS) were aligned using ClustalW. Preliminarily, MaxChi and Chimaera algorithms were used to detect the recombination events in the dataset by a recombination detection program (RDP5) [
 <xref rid="B59-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Additionally, bootscan analyses and similarity plots were performed using Simplot 3.5.1 [
 <xref rid="B60-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] to confirm the RDP-suggested potential recombination events and were analyzed on the whole-genome sequence of Wuhan as a query and Bat SARS-like, SARS and MERS as potential parental sequences (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-09-00240">Table S1</xref>). A PHI statistical test was applied to evaluate the significance of recombination evidence between closely and distantly related genomes. Furthermore, the point of recombination along with major and minor parents of the recombinant was accessed through RDP, Bootscan, MaxChi, Chimaera and 3Seq methods [
