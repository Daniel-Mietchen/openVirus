<p>It is the utmost priority of the scientific community to minimize the public health risk through tracing the origin and natural inhabitants of SARS-CoV-2 to restrict human-to-human and cross-species transmission. To understand the genetic diversity relationship and potential origin of SARS-CoV-2 with the other members of coronavirinae, we have performed molecular phylogenetic analysis with a number of CoVs whole-genome sequences obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-09-00240">Table S1</xref>). The phylogenetic tree results demonstrate that all the CoVs responsible for the outbreak of concentrated pneumonia belong to the genera 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00240-f002">Figure 2</xref>). All the SARS-CoV-2 clade grouped with the cluster of SARS/SARS-like CoVs, with bat CoVs HKU9-1, HKU9-2 HKU9-3 and HKU9-4 as an immediate ancestor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00240-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The interior shared neighbors include SARS-CoV NS-1, SARS-CoV Sino1-11, SARS-CoV GZ02 and SARS-CoV GD01, and they were the human-infecting CoVs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00240-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The whole genome-based phylogenetic analysis presented that two Bat SARS-like CoVs (ZXC21 and ZC45) were the closest relatives of SARS-CoV-2. Most of the inner and outer joint neighbors of SARS-CoV-2 were found to have bats as their natural reservoir including Bat SARS-CoV WIV1 in 
 <italic>Rhinolophus sinicus</italic>, Bat SARS-CoV HKU3-1, and Bat CoV HKU9-3 in Rousettus bats. Consequently, the bat would be the convenient native host of SARS-CoV-2, thus the probable intermediate host for the transmission cascade used by SARS-CoV-2 from bats to humans would be the same as that used by other SARS-CoV.
