<p>Nine regions in complete genome nucleotide sequences of Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV were detected as putative recombinant regions and our recombination detection program (RDP) analysis suggested that Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV could be a recombinant of SARS (GZ02, Rf1), SARS-like (ZXC21, ZC45, W1V1) and MERS-CoVs (

 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.00001). Moreover, the similarity plot showed that the 5-genomic region of Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV shared substantially higher similarity with SARS-like CoVs, while the 3-genomic region shared a mixture of SARS and SARS-like CoVs nucleotide sequence (

Taken together, our study found that most of the recombination events occurred in the spike glycoprotein motif of Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV, mostly towards the 5Â´end of the S gene. Only a single recombination event was identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and ORF3a (
