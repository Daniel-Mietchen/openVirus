<p>CoVs genome is comprised of single-stranded positive-sense RNA with 5’-cap and 3´-poly-A tail (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00240-f003">Figure 3</xref>). At the 5´ end, non-structure protein including poly-proteins pp1a and pp1b are directly translated from the genomic RNA strand. Other structure proteins are envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and spike (S) proteins. In addition, CoVs encoded some special accessory proteins like 3a/b, 4a/b, 5, 6, 7a/b etc. proteins (
