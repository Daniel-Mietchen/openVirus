<p>SARS-CoV used a receptor-binding domain that stretched between 306–527 amino acid sequences. We compared the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV and Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV and we found that 73% of conserved amino acid regions were observed in Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV (

It was suggested that a significant affinity of Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV with ACE2 imposed high public health risk for humans by transmission through the S protein-ACE2 binding channel. Subsequently, homology protein modeling was used to predict the S protein structure of Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV via the structure of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (PDB: c5xlrC) (
