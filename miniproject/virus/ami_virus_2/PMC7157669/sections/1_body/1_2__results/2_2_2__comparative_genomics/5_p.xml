<p>Further, we analyzed the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which is a more abundant protein in CoVs. With no exception, about 93% of the amino acid sequence identity of the N protein for Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV with SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="pathogens-09-00240-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) with 7% genetic variations was found, while a less conserved sequence percentage was found with MERS-CoV (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-09-00240">Figure S3</xref>). The conserved nature of SARS-CoV-2 along with other CoVs was an important factor to trace the evolutionary pathway of the CoV and would be important to limit the outbreak of pneumonia-related viruses. In CoVs, the N protein was crucial for RNA transcription and viral assembly disrupting the host cell and is also important to evaluate the virus-host adaptation and drug design.
