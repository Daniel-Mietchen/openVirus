<p>Further, we compared spike glycoprotein (S) protein of Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-pathogens-09-00240">Figure S4</xref>). It was observed that during the viral infection, S protein underwent several drastic changes. The S protein of Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV was more prone to mutations; particularly, the amino acid sequence represented ~19% alteration with four major insertions and ~81% homology in contrast to SARS (
