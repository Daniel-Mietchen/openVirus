<p>Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV in the phylogenetic tree was uniquely positioned with SARS/SARS-like CoVs that share a common ancestor which resembled bat coronavirus HKU9-1, HKU9-2 HKU9-3 and HKU9-4. During the course of evolution, various recombinant events possibly obscure the path substantially by the patterns of genomic homologous diversity. Thus, we compared the E, M, N and S genomic regions of Wuhan-Hu-1-CoV as representative of SARS-CoV-2, SARS, and MERS-CoV (
