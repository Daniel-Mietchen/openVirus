<p>In natural populations, mutations, recombination, and reassortment are the strategic evolutionary process considered for genetic diversity. The high incidence of homologous RNA recombination is one of the most fascinating features of CoVs replication [

 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-09-00240" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This encouraged exploration of the probable role of recombination in the SARS-CoV emergence. The current condition might appear as a vulnerable factor for severe disease and may impose serious health threats to the human. Due to wide distribution with the increasing prevalence of CoVs, frequent genomes recombination, large genetic diversity and high human-animal interface behavior, CoVs might be emerged from time-to-time in humans due to occasional spillover and recurrent cross-species infectious events [
