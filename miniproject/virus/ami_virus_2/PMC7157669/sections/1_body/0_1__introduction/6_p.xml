<p>As an emerging virus, very limited information is available to describe the genetic diversity, evolutionary ancestors and possible routes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from the natural reservoir to humans. This study aimed to track the evolutionary ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 and different evolutionary strategies (mutations, recombination or reassortment) that were genetically adapted by the novel coronavirus.</p>
