  <p>Evolutionary phylogenetic tree analysis of Coronaviruses: whole-genome sequences based on the phylogenetic tree of CoVs was constructed with the maximum-likelihood method using BEAST with GTR+I+G as the nucleotide substitution model with an applied posterior probability value of 0.5. Branches with different colors represent different genera of Coronaviruses; black, alpha coronavirus, blue, beta coronavirus; red, SARS-CoV-2; green, delta coronavirus; purple, gamma coronavirus.</p>
