<p>Based on the results, high statistical significance was observed for the correlations between Google and COVID-19 data for all countries and all applicable categories, apart from Italy, where Google data and COVID-19 total deaths were not correlated. In Italy, total cases and daily deaths were statistically significant but with lower significance, which is not in line with the results for the rest of the countries. The latter could be due to Italyâ€™s current special circumstances; it is the first European country to experience such severe consequences from COVID-19 and is further along the line compared with the rest of the countries.
