<p>As is evident, the strength of the correlation decreases as the time frame includes days when the disease was already widespread, both for cumulative and daily cases and deaths. This is due to the critical point during the spreading of the disease, after which the online interest in the virus starts declining. This is apparent especially for the cumulative cases and deaths, where one function is monotonous (increasing), while the other starts exhibiting a decrease after reaching a peak. Thus, said critical point should be identified in countries and regions with fewer cases to examine the possibility of using Google Trends data to nowcast the spread of COVID-19.</p>
