<p>In Europe, the countries experiencing the highest case and death counts (after Italy) are Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, with Spain being in an extremely difficult position with plane traffic being restricted and the army regulating local and regional movement. Thus, for the same time frames as for the Italian regions, the correlations between COVID-19 cases and deaths (where applicable) and the online interest in COVID-19 were calculated.
