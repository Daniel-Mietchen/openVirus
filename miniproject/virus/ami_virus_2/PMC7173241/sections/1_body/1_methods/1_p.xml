<p>Data from Google Trends [
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] are normalized and retrieved online in .csv format. Note that data may slightly vary based on the time of retrieval. Time series from Google Trends for various time intervals from January to March 2020 on the Topic (Virus) of “Coronavirus” are used, combined with official data on COVID-19 cases and deaths retrieved from Worldometer [
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The aim is to track the spread of the disease in the European countries that have been affected the most (ie, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom). Regional analysis is performed in Italy (data from the Ministry of Health [
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]), and the Pearson correlation coefficients between COVID-19 cases and deaths and Google Trends time series are calculated. The Topic of “Coronavirus” was selected instead of the “COVID-19” search term, as the latter was not widely used up to the point of the analysis.
