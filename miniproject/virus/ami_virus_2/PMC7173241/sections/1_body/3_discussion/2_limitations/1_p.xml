<p>This study has limitations. First, since the pandemic not only is ongoing but has not reached its peak yet, the data are limited; thus, the correlations are based on fewer observations, and the results are only preliminary and subject to change as we move forward. Second, only a few countries provided, at the time of writing, sufficient data for analysis or a regional break down of the cases and deaths. Third, only the interest in the ”Coronavirus (Virus)” Topic was explored, but future reports should also elaborate on more complicated search patterns, especially using the official name of the disease (ie, COVID-19) once it is used by a significant part of the population. Fourth, there are significant changes in cases, deaths, and rates even between 2 consecutive days in many regions and countries; even at the time of writing, the data can significantly vary from those at the time of retrieval.</p>
