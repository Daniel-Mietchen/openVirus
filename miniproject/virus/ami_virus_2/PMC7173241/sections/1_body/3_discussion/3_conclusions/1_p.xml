<p>In line with previous studies that have indicated that Google Trends data can assist with the tracking and nowcasting of epidemics and outbreaks, the results of this paper show that online search traffic data are highly correlated with COVID-19 cases and deaths in the examined countries and regions. Furthermore, a critical point, up to which regions not severely affected exhibit the strongest relationship between Google and COVID-19 data, was identified. This suggests that focus should shift towards these regions to make full use of what real time data assessment can offer. The latter is essential for increasing the preparedness and responsiveness of local health institutions, which is the most important aspect in handling the current pandemic.</p>
