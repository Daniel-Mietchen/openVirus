<p>Coronaviruses are divided into three genera: 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic>. SARS, MERS and 2019_nCoV are members of 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, which is divided into the subgenera 
 <italic>Embecovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Hibecovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Merbecovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Nobecovirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>. All coronaviruses have a genome consisting of a positive‐sense single‐strand RNA molecule. A long polycystronic messenger is produced from this that codes for a number of proteins, some of which are posttranslationally cleaved to produce smaller proteins (Cui 
 <italic>et al. </italic>
 <xref rid="lam13285-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">2019</xref>). Approximately two‐thirds of the genome codes for a large open reading frame, often called ‘orf 1ab’ that undergoes a frame shift during translation, and whose product is processed into a number of smaller proteins, while a variable number of smaller open reading frames are located downstream of orf 1ab.
