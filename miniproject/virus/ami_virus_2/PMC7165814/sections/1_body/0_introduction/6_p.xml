<p>In order to be better prepared during a future zoonotic coronavirus outbreak, we attempted to identify a DNA target that would be able to detect all known members of 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, and further to identify commonality between members of the subgenera. The analysis identified that a relatively short fragment of the noncoding upstream flank of the genome is sufficient for phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, the types of bats that have commercial value in China were considered as potential sources for zoonotic coronaviruses.
