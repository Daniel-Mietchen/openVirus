<p>A number of highly similar genome sequences of 2019_nCoV have now been released in the public domain, and these are currently being analysed by multiple groups in an attempt to understand the biology of the virus, although it is still a challenge to predict virulence from viral genome sequences. The fact that Coronaviruses are extremely diverse complicates such analyses.</p>
