<p>Although any section of the viral genome that is conserved within but not between subspecies would result in correct classification, the conservation of such regions within coding sequences of 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> members was generally weaker than we observed for the noncoding flanks. Using coding sequences of this same small selection of seven 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> members, the maximum conservation at nucleotide level for gene 1a/b was 85% within a sliding window of 60 bases, compared to 93% for the downstream and 90% for the upstream flank. The longest stretch of conserved nucleotides was 22 in the upstream flank, 33 in the downstream flank and only 20 nucleotides in orf 1ab (results not shown). Only the gene coding for envelope protein E was as strongly conserved as the noncoding flanks (maximum conservation 95% over a window of 60 bases, with a longest conserved stretch of 32 nucleotides) for the seven genomes analysed here. As conservation of coding sequences decreases with third‚Äêbase variation, it is likely that this degree of conservation in gene E would decrease as more genomes would be included in the comparison. Thus, restricting analyses to only comparing coding regions may reduce the chance a proposed detection target might be able to detect a novel 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> species. Instead, we recommend inclusion of the noncoding genome regions in such attempts. Although it was not our aim to develop improved detection methods (for which we would have to experimentally test any proposed target region), our findings can be a starting point for such studies.
