<p>The bat CoV to which 2019_nCoV has the highest similarity was isolated from 
 <italic>Rhinolophus sinicus</italic> (MG772933, described in Hu 
 <italic>et al. </italic>
 <xref rid="lam13285-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>), which might indicate that this species may also have been the original source of 2019_nCoV. However, the database is highly biased towards particular bat species that were specifically sampled in search of the source of SARS. Highly similar coronaviruses can be detected in different bat species (as identified by asterisks in Fig. 
 <xref rid="lam13285-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), so that even a high similarity match to a bat isolate may not always identify the correct bat species that was the cause of a given zoonotic outbreak. This caution can be extended to other possible animal hosts that have been or will be claimed as sources of the 2019_nCoV without a proven epidemiological link.
