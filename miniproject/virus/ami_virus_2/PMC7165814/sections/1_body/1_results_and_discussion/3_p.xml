<p>Assigning a betacoronavirus to a subgenus does not implicate information about its virulence, host specificity or geographical origin. However, the two analysed fragments were relatively strongly conserved within a subgenus, as illustrated by multiple alignments shown in Supporting Information. Since only two, highly similar, genome sequences of 
 <italic>Hibecovirus</italic> members were available for analysis, their comparison was not included. The identified conserved regions could provide potential targets for PCR or rt‚ÄêPCR, allowing for rapid classification of novel coronaviruses, in particular for the 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> group.
