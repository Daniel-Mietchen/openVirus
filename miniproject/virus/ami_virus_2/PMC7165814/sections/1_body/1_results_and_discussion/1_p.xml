<p>In a pilot experiment, all coding regions of four virus species representing three subgenera (MERS‐CoV for 
 <italic>Merbecovirus</italic>, human coronavirus OC43 for 
 <italic>Embecovirus</italic> and SARS‐CoV and 2019_nCoV for 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic>) were compared by multiple alignment of nucleotide sequences. This did not identify any region that was sufficiently conserved to potentially design an RNA‐two‐primer amplification detection target for all betacoronavirus genera, which we had set as our initial goal to identify. It is clear that addition of the genomes of more virus species would only decrease conservation further.
