<p>Of an extensive list of bat species that historically have been used in TCM (Riccucci 
 <xref rid="lam13285-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>), five were found to carry coronaviruses, as reported in a surveillance study (Tang 
 <italic>et al. </italic>
 <xref rid="lam13285-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>): 
 <italic>Pipistrellus abramus</italic>, 
 <italic>Murina leucogaster</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</italic>,
 <italic> Scotophilus kuhlii</italic> and 
 <italic>Scotomanes ornatus</italic>. Of these bat species, the first three can be found in the province of Hubei (source:

 <italic>S. ornatus</italic> reaches to the south of the province but does not cover the Wuhan area, while 
 <italic>S. kuhlii</italic> is not endemic in this region. A number of whole genome 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> sequences isolated from these bats and other bat species were selected and their 5’‐flank was compared to that of 2019_nCoV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="lam13285-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This produced the highest identity to the same isolate that Lu and coworkers had identified (Lu 
 <italic>et al. </italic>
 <xref rid="lam13285-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), demonstrating that an analysis of 253 nucleotides directly upstream of the start codon of the polycystronic messenger suffices to identify genetic relationships between 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> species.
