  <bold>Significance and Impact of the Study: </bold>The noncoding upstream and downstream flanks of coronavirus genomes allow for rapid classification of novel 
  <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> species and correct identification of genetic relationships. Although bats are the likely natural host of 2019_nCoV, the exact bat species that serves as the natural host of the virus remains as yet unknown. Chinese bat species with commercial value were identified as natural reservoirs of coronaviruses and are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Since their trading provides a potential risk for spreading zoonoses, a change in these practices is highly recommended.
