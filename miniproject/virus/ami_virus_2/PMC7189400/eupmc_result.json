    "SARS-CoV-2/novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a new strain that has recently been confirmed in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, and spreads to more than 165 countries of the world including India. The virus infection leads to 245,922 confirmed cases and 10,048 deaths worldwide as of March 20, 2020. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are lethal zoonotic viruses, highly pathogenic in nature, and responsible for diseases ranging from common cold to severe illness such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans for the past 15 years. Considering the severity of the current and previous outbreaks, no approved antiviral agent or effective vaccines are present for the prevention and treatment of infection during the epidemics. Although, various molecules have been shown to be effective against coronaviruses both in vitro and in vivo, but the antiviral activities of these molecules are not well established in humans. Therefore, this chapter is planned to provide information about available treatment and preventive measures for the coronavirus infections during outbreaks. This chapter also discusses the possible role of supportive therapy, repurposing drugs, and complementary and alternative medicines for the management of coronaviruses including COVID-19."
