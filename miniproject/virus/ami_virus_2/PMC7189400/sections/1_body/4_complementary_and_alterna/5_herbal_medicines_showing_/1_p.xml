<p id="Par16">It is reported that a number of herbal extract of 
 <italic>Anthemis hyaline</italic>, 
 <italic>Acanthopanacis cortex</italic>, 
 <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Sophorae radix</italic>, 
 <italic>Sanguisorbae radix</italic>, 
 <italic>Nigella sativa</italic>, and 
 <italic>Torilis fructus</italic> inhibit coronavirus replication in vitro (Ulasli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2014</xref>; Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>). Similarly, studies have demonstrated that traditionally used medicinal herbal extracts such as 
 <italic>Cimicifuga rhizoma</italic>, 
 <italic>Coptidis rhizoma</italic>, 
 <italic>Phellodendron cortex</italic>, and 
 <italic>Meliae cortex</italic> are also shown to inhibit CoV replication in cell culture model (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2008</xref>). Emodin, a chemical constituent of genus Rheum, and Polygonum are also shown to block the binding of SARS-CoV S-protein to ACE2 in a dose-dependent manner (Ho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>). In the same manner, 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>, 
 <italic>Lycoris radiate</italic>, 
 <italic>Lindera aggregata</italic>, 
 <italic>lycorine</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pyrrosia lingua</italic> also showed antiviral activity against SARS-CoV (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2005</xref>). In addition, saikosaponins are natural triterpene glycosides (A, B
 <sub>2</sub>, C, and D) and were tested against HCoV-22E9, and it is found that saikosaponin B
 <sub>2</sub> inhibits virus attachment and penetration stage to the host cells (Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>). In the same way, myricetin and scutellarein act as inhibitor of SARS-CoV helicase. Similarly, theaflavin-3,3-digallate (TF3) is a natural polyphenolic compound and demonstrates antiviral activity via targeting 3C-like proteases of SARS-CoV (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2005</xref>). Eupatorium fortune is a herbal medicinal plant belonging to Korea, China, and Asian countries with antibacterial and antioxidant activities and anticancer activity. Recent studies have reported that eupatorium fortune can inhibit a number of RNA viruses including human coronaviruses (Choi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>). As these herbal drugs demonstrated potential antiviral activity against CoVs, there is an urgent need to establish their effectiveness in humans and approve in a dose-dependent manner from various organizations like Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the absence of specific antiviral agent or vaccine, the use of complementary and alternative drugs may found to be beneficial during humanitarian emergencies.
