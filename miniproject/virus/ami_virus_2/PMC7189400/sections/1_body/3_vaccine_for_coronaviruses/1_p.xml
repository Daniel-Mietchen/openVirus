<p id="Par11">Currently, vaccines that can protect against CoV infection are not available. Recently, many groups are involved in vaccine designing using a variety of platforms against CoVs. Some of these approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in animal models. The spike (S) protein present in CoVs acts as a viral antigen and responsible for hostâ€“receptor binding and virus internalization and induces robust humoral and cell-mediated responses in humans during infection. The S glycoprotein has been shown to involve in the internalization of other CoVs like SARS by binding to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The S-protein functions in the receptor binding and membrane fusion make it the ideal target for the production of vaccines against CoVs (Wang et al.

Recent experiments have shown that the S-protein vaccine can trigger antibodies to resist virus binding, fusion, and neutralization of SARS-CoV infection. Recently, S-protein-based vaccines such as DNA vaccines, modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)-based chimeric virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, and virus-like replicon particle (VRP)-based chimeric virus vaccines have been developed, and they demonstrate protective effect against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections in animal models (Schindewolf and Menachery
