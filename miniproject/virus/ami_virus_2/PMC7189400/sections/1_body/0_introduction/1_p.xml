<p id="Par2">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the subfamily 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> and order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). CoVs have a common genome organization and are commonly categorized as alpha CoVs, beta CoVs, gamma CoVs, and delta CoVs on the basis of genomic structures and phylogenetic relationships. In these CoVs, transmission of alpha CoVs and beta CoVs is restricted to mammals and induces respiratory illness in humans, while gamma CoVs and delta CoVs are known to affect birds and mammals (Song et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>). Even though, most CoV infections are mild, but the outbreaks of the two beta CoVs, i.e., Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), have caused more than 10,000 combined cases and 1600 deaths in last 20 years (Skariyachan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2019</xref>). The incubation period of MERS and SARS is given as 2–13 and 2–14 days, respectively, the progression of infection is rapid with MERS-CoV as compared to SARS-CoV, and the reported mortality rates were 34% and 10%, respectively (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>; Rasmussen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>). CoVs are zoonotic in nature, which means these viruses are transmitted between animals and humans. In the same way, SARS and MARS were reported to transmit in humans from civet cats and camel, respectively (Shehata et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2016</xref>). Human-to-human transmission of SARS and MARS is also reported via close personal contact with infected patients. In 2012, MERS emerged as global heath challenge in countries near the Arabian Peninsula. As of July 31, 2019, 2458 laboratory-confirmed MERS cases and 848 deaths were reported where around 80% of these cases have been reported only in Saudi Arabia (Zheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2019</xref>). In 2003, SARS-CoV was originated in southern China and transmitted to Hong Kong and 29 other countries with high human morbidity, leading to 8098 confirmed cases and 774 deaths (Hui and Zumla 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>).
