<p id="Par3">SARS-CoV-2 has recently been confirmed in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China, and spreads to more than 165 countries of the world including India (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). The virus infection leads to 245,922 confirmed cases and 10,048 deaths worldwide as of March 20, 2020 (ProMED-mail 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 and SARS are clinically similar, and recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>). The cause and spread of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are still unclear. Preliminary research has found positive samples for WN-CoV in the wholesale market of Huanan seafood in Wuhan City, but some patients confirmed by the laboratory have not reported visiting this area (Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). Evidence is still emerging; however, information to date shows that transmission from human to human occurs. SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients leads to pneumonia-like symptoms such as fever and difficulty in breathing with radiographs showing invasive pneumonic infiltrates in few cases. The evolution of novel CoVs has been shown to be associated with RNA recombination with the existing CoVs (Andersen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and SARS) infection initially spreads in adults, and the reported symptoms are fever, headache, vomiting, chills, dyspnea, nausea, sore throat, coughing up blood, shortness of breath, myalgia, diarrhea, and malaise (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">10.1</xref>). Severe infection leads to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and sometimes multi-organ failure (Paules et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). Coronavirus infection leads to thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and leukopenia with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase and liver enzymes (Arabi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>).
