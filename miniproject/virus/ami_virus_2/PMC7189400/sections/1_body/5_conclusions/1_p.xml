<p id="Par17">The recent outbreak brought SARS-CoV-2 as global concern and emphasizes the significance of restricting infectious agents at international borders. The risk of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks depends on the characteristics of the virus, including the ability of the virus to transmit among humans, the seriousness of the disease, and the medical or other interventions available to prevent the transmission of virus, such as vaccines or drugs. Although, ribavirin along with corticosteroids and interferons has been tested in patients with SARS and MARS-CoV infections, but the effectiveness and associated severe adverse effects of this regimen is still not yet confirmed. In addition, a large number of drugs from different classes have been used for the management of symptoms associated with the infection and reported to have antiviral activity against both SARS and MARS-CoV infections in animal and cell culture model. However, the antiviral potential of these repurposing drugs are need to be validated in clinical trials in order to developed broad-spectrum therapy for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MARS-CoV infections.</p>
