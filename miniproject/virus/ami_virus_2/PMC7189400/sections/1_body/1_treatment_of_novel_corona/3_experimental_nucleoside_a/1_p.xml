<p id="Par6">Unlike the approved nucleoside analogs, two experimental nucleoside analogs remdesivir (GS-5734) and galidesivir (BCX4430) were also investigated against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Remdesivir and Galidesivir are adenine derivatives which demonstrate broad-spectrum antiviral activity in cell cultures and animal models against RNA viruses such as MERS and SARS (Agostini et al.
