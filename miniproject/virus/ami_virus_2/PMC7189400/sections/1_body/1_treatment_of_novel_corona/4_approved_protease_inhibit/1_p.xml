<p id="Par7">Drugs such as disulfiram, lopinavir, and ritonavir have antiviral activity against human coronaviruses. Disulfiram was primarily used for the management of alcohol dependence, and it is reported that the drug also inhibits the papain-like protease of MERS and SARS in cell line models (Agostini et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>; Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2015</xref>). However, the mechanism of action of these protease inhibitors is still controversial. At present, lopinavir and ritonavir are in clinical trial in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results demonstrate that lopinavir–ritonavir treatment fails to reduce mortality or throat viral RNA load in patients with Covid-19 (Cao et al.
