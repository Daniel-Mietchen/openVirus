<p id="Par5">At present, two approved nucleoside analogs (ribavirin and favipiravir) demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>). Nucleoside analogs have efficacy to target RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and inhibit the replication process in a broad range of RNA viruses including beta coronaviruses. Ribavirin was originally licensed for the treatment of HCV (hepatitis C virus) and RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). Ribavirin was also clinically evaluated against MERS and SARS coronaviruses, but the efficacy of the drug is uncertain and associated with severe side effects such as anemia and hypoxia at high doses (Arabi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). Similarly, ribavirin was also evaluated against SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the antiviral property of drugs is still not well established against the SARS-CoV-2. In addition, after oral administration, the drug was rapidly absorbed via sodium-dependent nucleoside transporters into the gastrointestinal tract. The drug has oral bioavailability around 64% with large volume of distribution. Drugs such as acetaminophen, acetazolamide, aspirin, acrivastine, and acyclovir are known to decrease the excretion rate that leads to the higher serum level of ribavirin. Similarly, coadministration of abacavir may increase the hepatotoxicity of ribavirin. Favipiravir (T-705) was initially authorized for the treatment of influenza. In addition, it is reported that favipiravir is also effective against a number of RNA viruses such as Ebola, Nipah, and enterovirus. Similarly, favipiravir demonstrates efficacy against SARS-CoV-2, and currently the drug is in randomized trials with interferon-Î± and baloxavir marboxil for SARS-CoV-2 infection (Li and De Clercq 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020</xref>). The drug is well absorbed after oral administration in the gastrointestinal tract (98% bioavailability) and metabolized in liver, and the metabolites are excreted in urine. Favipiravir is contraindicated in pregnancy due to its teratogenic effect. Favipiravir also decreases the excretion of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors such as captopril.
