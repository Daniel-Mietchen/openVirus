<p id="Par10">In view of the high mortality rate of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections, there are no licensed antiviral agents or vaccines available to date for successful disease control during outbreaks (Shahani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2017</xref>). Although, various therapeutic alternatives have been given for the management of infection such as antiviral drugs (ribavirin, lopinavir, and ritonavir), convalescent plasma, corticosteroids, monoclonal antibodies, intravenous immunoglobulin, and repurposing of existing clinically FDA-approved drugs (Totura and Bavari 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2019</xref>). The effectiveness of these drugs is not well established and given as symptomatic treatment to control the severity of infection. However, a retrospective analysis reported that ribavirin alone or in combination with interferon-alpha (IFN-á¼€) or lopinavir or ritonavir showed increase in survival compared to patients taking supportive care and corticosteroids against MERS-CoV infection (Falzarano et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>; Chu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2004</xref>; Chiou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>; Loutfy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>). In the same way, several studies have reported that ribavirin in conjugation with fluoroquinolones and corticosteroids did not demonstrate efficacy in patients with SARS-CoV infection (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">10.3</xref>) (Al-Tawfiq et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>; Omrani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014</xref>; Spanakis et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2005</xref>; Zhao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2003</xref>). Nevertheless, it is concluded that ribavirin alone or in combination with other drugs fails to improve patient outcome against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections and is associated with adverse effects such as decreased hemoglobin levels, hemolytic anemia, hypoxemia, and metabolic abnormalities. In addition to ribavirin, interferons are also associated with psychiatric disturbances, neutropenia, and systemic adverse effects (Al-Dorzi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). Drug repurposing is an eye-catching alternative approach for discovering newer drugs during the virus epidemics for a number of viral infections because various measures are typically skipped during the initial phase of drug design. Recently, researchers have investigated the antiviral potential of various approved drugs as first-line of defense against the newly emerging infectious agents. Repurposing of pharmaceutical agents could be an effective arm to develop potential therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV infection (Dyall et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>). The drugs from various classes such as antidiarrheal agents, antimalarial agents, cyclophilin inhibitors, interferons, kinase inhibitors, neurotransmitter inhibitors, anticholinergics, nucleic acid synthesis inhibitors, protease inhibitors, protein synthesis inhibitors, selective estrogen receptor modulators, and sterol metabolism inhibitors have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo antiviral efficacy against MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection (Table
