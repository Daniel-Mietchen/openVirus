<p id="Par34">A high degree of recombination and/or reassortment of genetic material allows for modular evolution, where genes, protein motifs, or separate RNA molecules will evolve independently from each other. Within the luteoviruses, recombination is often seen near the gene borders of the RdRp and the coat protein (CP) genes but rarely within genes. This suggests that the genetic histories of these genes are independent of each other (Pag√°n and Holmes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2010</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of CMV genes implies that each of the viruses three RNA segments have unique histories (Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2002</xref>). The extent of movement of genetic material across viruses can be seen with the recently named 
 <italic>Amalgaviridae</italic>, a double-stranded RNA monopartite virus with 2 open reading frames, an RdRp and another gene. The RdRp most closely resembles that of another double-stranded RNA virus family, the 
 <italic>Partitiviridae</italic>, while the other gene resembles that of the nucleoprotein of negative-stranded RNA viruses of the 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> family (Krupovic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). The iconic movement protein common and unique to plant viruses, may have been originally derived from the structural proteins used in the formation of the plasmodesmata (Lucas and Wolf
