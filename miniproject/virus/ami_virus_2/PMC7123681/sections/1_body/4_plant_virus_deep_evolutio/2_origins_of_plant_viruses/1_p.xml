<p id="Par33">The majority of known plant viruses are RNA viruses. The origins of RNA viruses are thought come directly from the ancient RNA world, a time before cellular life, where RNA replicated itself without a DNA phase (Bernhardt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>). It was proposed three decades ago that animal and plant viruses have a common ancestor, likely an insect virus (Goldbach 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1986</xref>). Specific motifs in virus hallmark genes (genes which are unique to viruses and are found across many families of viruses) such as the RdRp were analyzed for similarity across a wide range of animal and plant RNA viruses, with positive, negative, and double-stranded genomes. Motifs in both the positive and double-stranded RNA viruses suggests that these groups are monophyletic, with the negative strand RNA viruses less likely to be monophyletic (Koonin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2015</xref>). Virus hallmark genes are shared with other selfish genetic elements, such as plasmids and transposons, suggesting that viruses have a deep lineage, which some suggest dates to a pre-cellular time (Koonin and Dolja 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2014</xref>). One can think of viruses as both an organism and a mobile genetic element, much as light can be thought of as both a particle and a wave. These entities evolve within their environment, and then move as genetic elements through higher organisms (Forterre and Prangishvili 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>). Indeed examples of viral elements being incorporated into their hostâ€™s genome can be found across all of the tree of life (Katzourakis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>).
