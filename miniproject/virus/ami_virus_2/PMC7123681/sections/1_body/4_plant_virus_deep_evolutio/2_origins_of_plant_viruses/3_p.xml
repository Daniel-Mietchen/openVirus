<p id="Par35">While there is a lot of movement of genetic material between viruses and their eukaryotic hosts, this movement is vastly biased towards viral genes being moved to their hosts; hence viruses have a major role in the evolutionary history of higher organisms (Forterre and Prangishvili 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>). It is extremely difficult to extract preserved viral nucleic acid from more than a few decades ago, though it is possible (Roossinck, unpublished results). Because of this difficulty, these rare integration events can be used to elucidate the life histories of the virus. Long before so many virus sequences were found in genomes, geminivirus sequences were found within the 
 <italic>Nicotiana</italic> genome (Bejarano et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1996</xref>). Begomoviruses have been described as being Old world or New world, with several distinct qualities associated with each group. Most notably, the New world begomoviruses are monopartite while the Old world are bipartite. Using the intergration events within 
 <italic>Nicotiana</italic>, an estimate of 20–30 MYA was found for the Old/New world split, suggesting that this virus crossed the Beringian land bridge (Lefeuvre et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2011</xref>). Cooperation of viruses in mixed infections may be the initial step towards multipartiate viruses. Two different monopartite viruses are known to cooperate, using each other’s proteins for their own function. If the relationship of the two viruses becomes too dependent, essential gene loss can occur in one or both viruses that may remain viable due to the complementary gene of the other virus. This will eventually lead to merging the two species into a single species (Shirogane et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2013</xref>).
