<p id="Par36">A recent phylogenetic analysis of the potyvirus genus suggests that the genus diverged approximately 7250 years ago, in monocots from the Southern Eurasia or Northern African regions (Gibbs et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2010</xref>). Some ZYMV lineages have been shown to be no older than 800 years old, suggesting that humans had a role to play in there movement and diversification (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2008</xref>). Lueteoviridae diversification happened in three stages; The luteo/polerovirus split estimated at 2000 years ago, diversification of each genus estimated at 1000–5000 years ago, and the diversification of the species within the past 300 years (Pagán and Holmes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2010</xref>). The knowledge gained from extensive sampling including wild samples give us more insight into the life histories of viruses (Wylie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2008</xref>). Potyviruses have a large amount of diversity within and between their species. 
 <italic>Yam mosaic virus</italic> (YMV) is thought to have been originated in Africa. High levels of recombination are found within natural populations of YMV (Bousalem et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2000</xref>). The endogenization of Caulimoviruses distantly related to 
 <italic>Rice tungro bacciliform virus</italic> into the rice genome have given us insight into the family’s evolutionary history. The edongenization events occured before the divergence of the domestic rice progenitor 
 <italic>Oryza rufipogon</italic>, placing this event at about 160,000 years ago (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>).
