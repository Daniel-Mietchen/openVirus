<p id="Par32">The deep evolutionary history of viruses is a matter for considerable speculation. Since no virus fossils are available, studies have relied on comparisons of extant sequences; however, the recent explosion of complete genome information for plants and many other hosts has led to the development of a new field of virology known as paleovirology, which considers the viral sequences integrated into genomes as molecular fossils (Katzourakis
