<p id="Par18">The extended phenotype of viruses can change based on many contexts, including the genotype of the host (vanMölken and Stuefer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2011</xref>), and biotic and abiotic conditions. These phenotypes vary from the classic disease symptoms to host benefitting-qualities such as drought or cold tolerance (Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2015b</xref>). The context of the plant hosts can effect the spread and diversity of plant viruses more than the composition of the plant host species. Competition between BYDV and CYDV was altered by changing the nutrition resources in the form of nitrogen and phosphorous for their hosts (Lacroix et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>). In a B/CYDV survey in North American Pacific coast grasslands targeting three different host species (
 <italic>Avena fatua</italic>, 
 <italic>Elymus glaucus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bromus hordeaceus</italic>) virus prevalence was determined not only by host species identity, with 
 <italic>A. fatua</italic> having the highest prevalence and 
 <italic>B. hordeaceus</italic> having the lowest, but also by biotic and abiotic factors, including an increase of virus prevalence with a decrease in precipitation and increase in soil nitrogen (Seabloom et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2010</xref>).
