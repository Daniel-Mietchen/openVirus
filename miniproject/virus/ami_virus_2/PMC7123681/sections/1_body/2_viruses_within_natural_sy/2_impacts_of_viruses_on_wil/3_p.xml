<p id="Par19">Many viruses that are found in wild plants have either mild symptoms or are completely asymptomatic (Prendeville et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2012</xref>; Jones 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>; Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>). Many wild plants host multiple viruses, in some cases up to seven different viruses were found co-existing in a single plant (Roossinck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2010</xref>). In two studies in the United States and Costa Rica, over 50â€‰% of the virus sequences found in wild plants belonged to three virus families: 
 <italic>Partitiviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Chrysoviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Totiviridae</italic> (Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2012b</xref>). These virus families, along with the 
 <italic>Endornavirdae</italic>, have been described as persistent plant viruses (Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2015a</xref>). Most of the persistent plant viruses are double stranded RNA viruses, although the 
 <italic>Endornaviridae</italic> are likely single-stranded RNA viruses that are isolated as replicative intermediates (Roossinck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2011</xref>). Most interestingly, the persistent viruses are wholly transmitted vertically, with no known form of horizontal transmission. In fact, there is no cell-to-cell movement of persistent viruses, spreading throughout the host via cell division (Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2010</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2012a</xref>). The 
 <italic>Partitiviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Endornaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Chrysoviridae</italic> infect both plants and fungi, while the 
 <italic>Totiviridae</italic> also infect fungi and protozoa. While there is no observable effect of these viruses on their hosts, there have been multiple instances of integration of some persistent viral genomes into plant and fungal genomes (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2010</xref>; Chiba et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>). This should not be surprising given the intimate symbiotic nature of the relationship. Currently the persistent viruses are understudied and many aspects of their nature are unknown (Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2015a</xref>).
