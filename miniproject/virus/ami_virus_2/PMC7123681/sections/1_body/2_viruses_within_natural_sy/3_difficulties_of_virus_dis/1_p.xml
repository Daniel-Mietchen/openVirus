<p id="Par21">It is not surprising that with an in depth look into the viral biodiversity of plants one would find novel viruses related to known viruses, nor is it surprising that sequences with little or no similarity to anything in a curated database would be found. Often, even when there are related viruses within a database, the curation is not in a state to be useful. There are few centralized databanks to store metadata collected during large biodiversity surveys, though attempts have been made. Metavir, a website service offering basic analysis of viromes, allows for viromes to be made public, and at the time of writing houses 368 different viromes from 67 different projects (Roux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2014</xref>). It is unclear how these potential viruses should be treated. In a recent virus survey in Costa Rica, 60 % of the sequence reads received no hit when searched against the GenBank database (Roossinck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2010</xref>). For viruses with no known relative, a cluster analysis can give structure to a population of unknown microbes, including viruses (Labonté and Suttle 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2013</xref>). While having a sequence identity for these viruses can offer some answers, the viruses ultimately need to be characterized experimentally.
