<p id="Par16">Early attempts to explore virus prevalence within wild plants was hampered by a lack of sensitive detection methods (Cooper and Jones 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2006</xref>). In recent years, there have been a number of plant virus diversity surveys, in which plant tissue was sampled without targeting symptomatic plants (Wren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2006</xref>; Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2013</xref>). These tissue samples were then enriched for viral nucleic acid, and sequenced using NGS. The prevalence and distribution of viruses in these studies varies, but inevitably evidence for many novel virus is found, and the variation of viruses in wild systems is much greater than what is seen in crops (Roossinck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2015</xref>).
