<p id="Par6">Agriculture has been an important aspect of virology from the beginning of the field (Beijerinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1898</xref>), and has been the focus of most work in plant virology throughout its 120 year history. Much of the early work characterizing and describing viruses was done with viruses of crop plants. While it is understandable that so much work has been put into a few specific plant species, this has left out a lot of information about viruses in natural settings. In modern agriculture the use of vast areas of monoculture, extended growing seasons, irrigation, and artificial soil amendments have each impacted plant pathogen prevalence, including viruses.
