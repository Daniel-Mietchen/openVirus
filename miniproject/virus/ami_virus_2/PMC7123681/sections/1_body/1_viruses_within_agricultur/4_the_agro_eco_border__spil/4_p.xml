<p id="Par15">The level of biodiversity on the wild side of the agro-eco border effects the emergence of viral movement across the border. A lowered incidence of two begomoviruses was seen in wild peppers with decreasing levels of cultivation or management, suggesting a dilution effect with higher levels of biodiversity (Pagán et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2012</xref>). This correlation with biodiversity appears to hold true with CMV in wild plants, but not with CMV in crops (Sacristán et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2004</xref>). The loss of biodiversity appears to increase the movement of a virus across the agro-eco border, but a high degree of biodiversity can lead to a large number of viral species, which may serve as a reservoir for new infections (Keesing et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2010</xref>). Opportunistic viruses quickly move into susceptible crops, decrease, then recover in the susceptible population, causing a rapid cycles of epidemics and decline (Harrison

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">1981</xref>). In France, where ZYMV and WMV are both present, only WMV has significant natural reserviours, which explains the fragmented nature of ZYMV incidence across France (Lecoq et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>). In Spain, two strains of the potexvirus 
 <italic>Pepino mosaic virus</italic> (PepMV-EU and PepMV-CH2) co-circulate among tomato crops, with the CH2 strain being the dominate strain. PepMV-EU primarily exists in coinfections with PepMV-CH2, and these coinfections allow for an extended host range of PepMV, thus extending the potential number of reservoirs. This has implications for coinfection effecting the emergence of PepMV in tomato plants (Gómez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2009</xref>).
