<p id="Par14">Viruses that infect crop plants often find reservoirs within nearby wild plants or in volunteer plants from the previous crop. These viruses, that cause disease in crops, may be asymptomatic in other hosts. For example, 
 <italic>Peanut stunt virus</italic> causes disease in peanuts, but is asymptomatic in clover (Sherwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">1997</xref>). The presence of highly susceptible hosts in a plant community can increase the incidence of the virus across all susceptible species in the community (Power 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2008</xref>). Several scenarios can be seen where the spread of virus moves between an asymptomatic native host to cultivated plants (Jones 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>). Emergent viral diseases may come from “silent” infections within a nearby wild population, and are driven by anthropogenic factors, such as food production or the introduction of vectors (Anderson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>). In Africa, there have been several emergent viruses in agricultural systems. While many changes in the pathogens themselves have promoted the emergence of disease, changes in agricultural practices have also promoted the introductions. 
 <italic>Rice yellow mottle virus</italic> (RYMV, in the genus 
 <italic>Sobemovirus</italic>) infects 
 <italic>Oryza sp.</italic> in both wild and agricultural systems. RYMV was first described in 1966 in Kenya and is currently an economically important plant virus. The rise of rice production in Kenya is thought to be the main driver of RYMV spread, as epidemics of the virus were not seen until after the intensification of rice production in the 1960s (Fargette et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>). Despite many examples of host jumps leading to disease, there have been examples of viruses that have switched hosts several times with no apparent increase in pathology (Thresh
