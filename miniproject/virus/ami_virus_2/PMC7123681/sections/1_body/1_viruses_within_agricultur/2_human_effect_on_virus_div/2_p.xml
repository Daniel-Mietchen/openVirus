<p id="Par8">With the globalization of todayâ€™s society, it is not surprising to find that humans are playing a role in the movement of plant viruses. Human movement of both the plants and vectors associated with pathogens has facilitated the spread of viruses. The effects of climate change in the form of CO
 <sub>2</sub> and ozone may change the impacts of viruses on their plant hosts (Trebicki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2015</xref>). While many pathogens move closer to the poles as climate change occurs, there is some evidence that viruses and nematodes are moving closer to the equator (Bebber et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>). This may be an analytical artifact as viral symptoms are often misdiagnosed. Increases in the range of insect vectors of viruses due to numerous factors, including climate change, predicts increased virus spread (Fereres
