<p id="Par7">Agriculture is a human invention, and the cultivation of crops has propelled the human race to increasing cultural and technological advances, but with this advancement we have disturbed many natural systems throughout our history. Domestication of the earliest crops probably began about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago (Balter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>), presumably with their viruses experiencing a shift in selective pressure as well (Stukenbrock and McDonald 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2008</xref>). Densely spaced, monoculture crops have been increasingly favored due to the ease of production, but these conditions also are excellent for the spread and infection of viruses and other deleterious microbes within the crop (Thresh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">1982</xref>; Power and Mitchell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2004</xref>). To combat the yield loss associated with virus–induced disease, breeders have focused efforts on engineering disease resistant cultivars of crops. However, several forms of virus variation, such as the high mutation rates of RNA and some DNA viruses, recombination, and reassortment lead to resistance breaking (Duffy and Holmes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>; McDonald and Linde 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2002</xref>; Harrison 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2002</xref>). Although breeding of resistant cultivars has had some success, other methods such as increasing the plant species diversity in a given area, breaking the spatial and temporal components of the disease cycle, have been suggested (Ratnadass et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2012</xref>). For example, genetic diversity (heterosis) induced tolerance to

 <italic>Lepidium</italic> sp.) hybrids, while plants that were selfed were more susceptable to disease, suggesting that small populations with low genetic diversity could lead to increased disease symptoms, and infection rates (Houliston et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2015</xref>). Intercropping cowpea with cassava or plantains has reduced the incidence of viruses in Central America (Valverde et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">1982</xref>). These practices suggest that increases in plant diversity, either within a species or with diverse species, could lower the incidence or pathology of viruses (see Sect.
