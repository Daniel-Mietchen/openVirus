<p id="Par9">A majority of crop viruses are insect vectored, and relationships between plants, viruses and insects are complex (Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2015b</xref>). Using insect vectors as targets for virus discovery is an attractive opportunity. Vector-enabled metagenomics is a recent method for virus discovery that allows one to discover and characterize viruses that are in the area that the vector occupies, including both cultivated and wild plants. In a recent study using vector-enabled metagenomics 79 % of the sequences obtained were related to known viruses, suggesting that many vector transmitted viruses are known (Ng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2011</xref>). This number was much higher than the number of identifiable virus sequences found in wild plants, where as many as 60 % of sequences from virus-enriched pools have no similarity to sequences in GenBank (Roossinck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2015</xref>).
