<p id="Par29">Previously it was thought that the high levels of variation within the begomoviruses (circular ssDNA) was due to high levels of recombination (Lima et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>), but begomovirues have substitution rates much higher than other DNA viruses, on the order of 10
 <sup>âˆ’4</sup> substitutions/site/year, in line with rates seen in RNA viruses (Duffy and Holmes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>). 
 <italic>Macroptilium yellow spot virus</italic> (MaYSV) and 
 <italic>Tomato severe rugose virus</italic> (ToSRV), both begomoviruses, were analyzed for their variability. Interestingly, MaYSV, which primarily infects wild weeds, but does occasionally infect 
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> (the common bean), had a greater diversity than ToSRV, which primarily infects tomato, and has a low incidence in wild plants. Several recombination events were detected for MaYSV, which drove the majority of the variability in the species.
