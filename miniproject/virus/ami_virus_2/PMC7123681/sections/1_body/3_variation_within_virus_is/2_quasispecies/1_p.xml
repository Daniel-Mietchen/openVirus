<p id="Par23">The high levels of mutation generated by viral polymerases leads to high levels of variation within a single infection, known as a quasispecies. The term quasispecies refers to a single replicating population, and is an “individual” that selection acts upon (Holland and Domingo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1998</xref>). Do to the many different selective pressures an RNA virus experiences (different hosts, cell tropisms, vectors, etc.), a population that is more genetically robust, having a high degree of evolvability may have a selective advantage. This means in a fitness landscape, quasispecies that have a narrow fitness peak (less robust) experience a sharp decrease in fitness due to a single mutation, and are less likely to adapt rapidly to a new environment. Conversely, those with a wide fitness peak (more robust) will experience a small change in fitness, allowing for multiple mutations to accumulate for selection to act upon. This is known as the survival of the flattest (Wilke
