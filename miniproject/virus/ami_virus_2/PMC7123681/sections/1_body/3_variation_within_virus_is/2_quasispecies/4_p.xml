<p id="Par26">NGS is being used to identify minor variants within quasispecies. With a level of coverage of 2500x, the full range of variation can be uncovered (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2012</xref>). This type of analysis can lead to answers to previously difficult questions of quasispecies dynamics in nature. Mutations within the ZYMV quasispecies were maintained through the aphid vector transmission, as well as seen throughout the plant, suggesting that the bottleneck of vector transmission and movement throughout the plant may be lower than previously thought (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2015</xref>). There is evidence that some variants within a quasispecies are necessary for specific functions. Several ZYMV variants were found in different seed transmitted lines, suggesting that these variants have a role to play in seed transmission (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2015</xref>).
