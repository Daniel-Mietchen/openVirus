<p id="Par27">Randomly generated point mutations in 
 <italic>Tobacco etch virus</italic> (TEV) were used to determine the effect the mutations had on the virulence and fitness of TEV. The majority of the mutations were lethal, with the majority of non-lethal mutations leading to a significant reduction of fitness. (Carrasco et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>). The lab strain of TEV is adapted to tobacco, but when TEV was adapted to pepper, virulence increased, but was found to decrease in the tobacco host, suggesting a tradeoff in becoming more specialized. No tradeoff was found for becoming more of a generalist (Bedhomme et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>; Elena et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>). Furthermore, pepper-adapted TEV acquires mutations that have a wide range of effects both positive and negative, implying pleiotropic effects. Interestingly, the fitness of mutants in the tobacco host does not predict the fitness in other non-native hosts (Lalic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2011</xref>).
