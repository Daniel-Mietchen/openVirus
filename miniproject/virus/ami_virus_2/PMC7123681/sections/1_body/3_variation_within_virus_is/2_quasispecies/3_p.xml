<p id="Par25">The size of the quasispecies, or level of variation of a virus within a host, is dependent on factors in both the virus and the host. When comparing three related Sindbis-like viruses, CMV, 
 <italic>Tobacco mosaic virus</italic> (TMV), and 
 <italic>Cowpea chlorotic mottle virus</italic> each had significantly different levels of variation within the same host background (Schneider and Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2000</xref>). In both TMV and CMV, the level of variation changed based on the host background (Schneider and Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2001</xref>). Different strains of CMV, Fny and LS, display different levels of diversity in tobacco and pepper plants, which maps to both the 1a and 2a proteins (Pita and Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2013b</xref>). By using a non-coding satellite RNA the indel fidelity of the CMV RdRp was analyzed 
 <italic>in planta</italic>. While insertion mutations were rare, deletion mutations were more abundant and their rates differed based on the host background and the sequence context (Pita et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2007</xref>).
