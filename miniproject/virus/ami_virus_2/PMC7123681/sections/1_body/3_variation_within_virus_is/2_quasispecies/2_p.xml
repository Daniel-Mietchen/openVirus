<p id="Par24">It was been thought for some time that the lack of error correction within the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of RNA viruses is responsible for the size of the quasispecies (Steinhauer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">1992</xref>). However, in coronaviruses it is clear that error correction can occur (Denison et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>). The quasispecies is effected by not only the mutation rate of the RdRp, but also by the mode of replication, logrithmic or stamping machine (Safari and Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2014</xref>). While double-stranded RNA viruses replicate predominantly by the stamping machine method, the mode of replication of other RNA viruses is not clear. Although the mutation rate of RNA viruses are high, the level of variation within the quasispecies may be lower than expected (Garc√≠a-Arenal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2003</xref>). This is due to both positive and negative selection; however, defective genomes are often carried in the population and can provide extended function in some cases. While there are significant genetic bottleneck during systemic infection (Li and Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2004</xref>), as well as vector transmission (Ali and Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2010</xref>), viruses probably recover their diversity rapidly.
