<p id="Par28">By passaging 
 <italic>Plum pox virus</italic> (PPV; M strain) though several different host species for six years and analyzing the fixed mutations after host adaptation, it was found that peach yielded the lowest number of fixed mutations (two fold lower than other hosts). This suggests that PPV-M is highly adapted to peach (Vozárová et al.

 <italic>Pepino mosaic virus</italic> (
 <italic>Alphaflexiviridae</italic>) through several tomato cultivars with varying degrees of tolerance, convergently leads to isolates with higher pathogenicity. These passages also have an increase in the genetic diversity, with genetic diversity being a good indicator of pathogenicity (Minicka et al.
