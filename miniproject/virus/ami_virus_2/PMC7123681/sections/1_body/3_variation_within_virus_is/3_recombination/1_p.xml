<p id="Par30">Recombination is not only an important part of population variation, but also can be used as a repair mechanism, balancing the high mutation rate of RNA viruses (Nagy and Simon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1997</xref>). Recombination is a frequent occurrence in CaMV, with over 50 % of isolates being recombinants after only 21 days of infection (Froissart et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2005</xref>). RNA 3 of bromoviruses may contain recombination hotspots (Bruyere et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>). While recombination is an important part of increasing the variation of a species, recombination events that lead to hybrid proteins are most likely less fit than recombinants between whole genes or protein domains (Bonnet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2005</xref>). Recombination offers a path for the adaptation of viruses to a new environment as seen with the introduction of TYLCV into Spain (García-Andrés et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2007</xref>). Interestingly, it appears the eukaryotic hosts may have adapted a method for modulating or regulating the degree of recombination of their infecting viruses. In a yeast model system modified to allow infection by 
 <italic>Tomato bushy stunt virus</italic>, XRN1, a host exoribonuclease, was found to degrade 5′ truncated viral RNA. These truncated RNAs are substrates for recombination (Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2006</xref>). Recombination is commonly found in the ssDNA geminiviruses, both within and between different species (Padidam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1999</xref>; Pagán and Holmes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2010</xref>). 
 <italic>Citrus tristeza virus</italic> (CTV, 
 <italic>Closteroviridae</italic>) is interesting in that many strains of the virus are commonly found within a single host plant. These strains have been phylogenetically analyzed to elucidate their evolutionary history, and it can be inferred that the current diversity of CTV was influenced by the original ancestral diversification, selection pressure of genes between and within strains, and significant recombination among strains (Harper 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2013</xref>).
