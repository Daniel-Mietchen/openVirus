<p id="Par31">A number of studies have looked at recombination frequencies in experimental systems (Bujarski

In general, recombination frequencies are high in RNA viruses, and hot spots for recombination have been identified that result in exchanges between related RNA molecules, or in deletions leading to defective RNAs. In the cucumoviruses experimental infections with interspecific reassortants have frequently led to recombinants in RNA 3, where the 3â€² end is exchanged with that of RNA 2, presumably to establish a minus strand promoter that is cognizant with the replicase (Aaziz and Tepfer

Interestingly, the high recombination strain was the same strain that had low mutation frequency, and the 2a protein that encodes the RdRp was responsible for both phenotypes (Pita et al.
