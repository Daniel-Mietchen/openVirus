<p id="Par22">Evidence for genetic variation of plant viruses was reported as early as 1926 (Kunkel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1947</xref>). Numerous studies have looked at variation both within individual virus isolates and among isolates of the same virus species. Variation provides the basis for evolution of traits through natural selection, and has resulted in adaptation of plant viruses to new hosts, to new vectors, and to overcoming host resistance, including natural resistance, resistance introgressed through breeding, or genetically engineered resistance.
