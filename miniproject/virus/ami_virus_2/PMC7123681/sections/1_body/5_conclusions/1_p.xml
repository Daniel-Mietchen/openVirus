<p id="Par37">The diversity of plant viruses is still largely unknown, but what we have learned is that the virus diversity of agriculture systems is vastly different than that of natural ecosystems. While the majority of viruses infecting crops cause disease, it appears that viruses in natural areas are neutral or may provide some small benefit to their hosts. This paradigm shift opens the door to many future applications, as well as exciting implications to the field of virology as a whole. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of movement across the agro-eco boundary, as well as an increased understanding of the mechanisms underlying virus evolution, may provide us with methods of predicting future epidemics, or attenuating the outbreak of new crop pathogens. The modern era of genomics is revealing new and exciting areas of research into virus evolution, and studies on the origins of viruses will likely lead to an understanding of the very origins of life on earth.</p>
