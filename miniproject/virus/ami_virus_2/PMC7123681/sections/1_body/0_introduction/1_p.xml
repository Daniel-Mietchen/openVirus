<p id="Par2">Until recent years, our knowledge of the breadth of plant virus diversity was limited. The field of plant virology traditionally has focused on agricultural systems, with little study of viruses found in wild plants. In the past decade, several efforts have begun to fill these gaps in the form of biodiversity surveys. These surveys have given us a new view into the true diversity of plant viruses, as well as their distribution.</p>
