<p id="Par5">In this chapter we look into the recent work looking into the diversity of plant viruses, not only in species diversity but also diversity within the species or quasispecies. This variation comes from many sources, including high mutation rates of RNA viruses, recombination and reassortment. The variation we see within a single plant host has profound effects on the how the virus responds to selective pressures associated with new hosts, and factors such as the bottleneck events associated with cell-to-cell movement or vectoring. Additionally, with our ever increasing knowledge of the breadth of virus diversity, as well as advances in technology, questions of the deep evolutionary history of viruses and their relationship to their hosts are beginning to be answered. While there has been a large body of work on algae-infecting viruses (VanEtten and Dunigan
