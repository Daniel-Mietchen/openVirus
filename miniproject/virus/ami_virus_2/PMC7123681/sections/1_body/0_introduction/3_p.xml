<p id="Par4">NGS has become the gold standard for metagenomics. Metagenomics can be used to identify novel virus species, using various techniques to enrich viral nucleic acids such as isolating specific forms of RNA (dsRNA, siRNA, ssRNA) or virus particle isolation. Each method has positive and negative aspects (Stobbe and Roossinck

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2015</xref>). While NGS can be used for virus discovery, it also has been applied to plant virus diagnostics (Stobbe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2013</xref>; Massart et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>). NGS also has been used to look further into the population diversity of individual virus strains. Using this deep sequencing, one is able to determine all of the minor variants found in a given infection (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2012</xref>). NGS has applications in many evolutionary questions regarding systemic movement, vectoring and epidemiology.
