<p id="Par3">One of the most powerful advances in microbe discovery has been massively parallel sequencing, or Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Previously the most common methods for virus detection were protein based immunological tests such as ELISA, or nucleotide specific PCR assays. Neither of these are sensitive enough to detect low titers of virus in wild plants or general enough to detect novel viruses, or even related strains or species. NGS technology has boosted our ability to fully sequence whole genomes, and advanced the field of metagenomics, the study of all the genetic information from a given environment. When the requirement for culture is removed, the ability to sequence and identify fastidious or unculturable microbes becomes possible.</p>
