  <p>Spillover of viruses from wild plants. Viruses are abundant and often inapparent in wild plants. At the agro-eco boundary viruses may move into crop plants from nearby wild plants. In most cases these infections will be dead-end: either the virus is not competent for further transmission in the new host, it may not establish sufficient virus titer to allow transmission, or it may rapidly kill the host. Rarely, a spillover virus may develop the ability to be further transmitted to more similar hosts, resulting in an emerging virus infection</p>
