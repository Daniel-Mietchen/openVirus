<p id="par0030">The long anticipated and inevitable and detection of the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into Africa was announced on 14 February 2020, by the Minister of Health and Population of Egypt, Dr Hala Zayed, who confirmed the first case of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 in Egypt. The patient was a 33 year old male of foreign origin whose 17 contacts tested negative but were under home quarantine for 14 days. This has ignited a reflection on the readiness of the continent to take on the challenge and showcase its new potential. Following detection of this first case in Africa, the Africa CDC, Nigeria CDC and other national public health institutes in liaison with the WHO are scaling up preparedness efforts in the African region, supporting countries to implement recommendations outlined by the WHO International Health Regulations Emergency Committee. The Emergency Committee recommended that all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of SARS-CoV-2. Thirteen nations with close links with China, including Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have been identified as especially high-risk priority zones for proactive surveillance, detection and containing the spread of COVID-19. The WHO has sent diagnostic kits to 29 laboratories in Africa, and reagents and positive controls are being shipped worldwide by PANDORA-ID-NET partner in Germany, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin Institute of Virology, to ensure the capacity to screen and test. Some countries in Africa, including DRC, are also leveraging the capacity they have built up to test for Ebola, to test for COVID-19. Thus, early detection of cases with implementation of infection control procedures will remain a priority to control the spread of COVID-19 in Africa.</p>
