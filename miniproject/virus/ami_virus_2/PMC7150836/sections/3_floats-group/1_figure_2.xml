  <p>Maximum clade credibility tree for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (
   <italic>RdRp</italic>) fragment (440 bp) of deformed wing virus (DWV). Grey insert with orange frame shows the collapsed part of the tree that among others includes the 19 samples from New Zealand from this study. Species name, country of origin, and, if applicable, GenBank accession number are given in the branch label. The branches are coloured according to the lineagesâ€™ inferred geographic origin as shown on the world map and end notes are coloured according to the host group as shown in the host species insert. Posterior support &gt; 0.6 is given and the x-axis shows time in years.
