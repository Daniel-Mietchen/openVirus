<p>Many emerging viruses infect and actively replicate within a wide range of pollinators and associated Arthropod species. Our results and others indicate that the host species can affect the association with shared ancestry, which indicates virus transmission, but that these effects are weaker than the geographic location [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Overall, geographic locations played a major role in shaping patterns of viral genetic diversity. As viruses may be frequently transmitted between species, it is important to incorporate the host abundance and diversity, spatial structure of communities, and multi-host systems into studies of pathogen dynamics and epidemics [
