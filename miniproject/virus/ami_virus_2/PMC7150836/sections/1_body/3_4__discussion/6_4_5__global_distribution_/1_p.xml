<p>To understand the current epidemic of bee viruses, it is key to determine the role of the host species and geographic distribution [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. By placing the sequences generated in this study within a global phylogeny, we found that both KBV and DWV showed strong grouping by geographic regions. Closely related viral strains in geographic locations support the hypothesis that viral infections can be acquired from the environment and other host species in the same location [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although DWV was present in New Zealand before the introduction of 
 <italic>Varroa</italic> in 2001 [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], all New Zealand DWV strains grouped within the clade that emerged in the early 2000s. The DWV phylogeny showed some broad separations into geographic regions, and only European samples were scattered across groups. Whether European strains are found across the phylogeny because introduced honey bees or other virus-carrying arthropods from Europe initiated the spread remains to be tested further. Research indicates that the global DWV epidemic has been mediated by European 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> populations but that the virus shows little host specificity [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Although the KBV phylogeny only represents a limited number of the true KBV diversity, sequences from Argentine ants showed weak association with the phylogeny, suggesting that ants acquired local KBV strains. Moreover, the high prevalence of KBV in this species could indicate a disease reservoir, and ants facilitating further spread of KBV.
