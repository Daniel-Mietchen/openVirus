<p>We confirmed DWV, KBV, and MKV replication in a number of species, indicating that these species possibly act as biological vectors that facilitate disease emergence. However, with pollinators and associates collected in the field, we cannot exclude the possibility of detecting viruses and negative strand intermediates in the gut contents that come from other infected insects. KBV and MKV replication was confirmed in species not typically known to eat bees, such as 
 <italic>Polistes</italic> wasps and bumble bees. Some cockroaches, crickets, wasps, and ants that tested positive for virus replication were found in close proximity to beehives and are species known to scavenge or prey on honey bees [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Recently consumed viral particles from infected honey bees can cause false positives in replication assays. For instance, 
 <italic>Varroa</italic> mites that exclusively feed on honey bee tissue [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and vector DWV are assumed to act as a biological vector that propagates DWV [

 <xref rid="B77-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Yet, new research suggests that DWV may not replicate in mite cells but in honey bee cells recently consumed by mites [
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Nevertheless, feeding experiments have shown that scavenger species like the ant 
 <italic>Myrmica rubra</italic> are found positive for the negative strand of DWV for up to 13 weeks after consuming infected honey bees [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which indicates that DWV actively infects ants. Whether honey bee scavengers are able to spread viruses without becoming infected themselves [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>] or aid in reducing virus transmission by removing infectious carcasses [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>] remains to be tested. The detection of negative strand intermediates is an essential step in identifying host species, but only controlled infection experiments allow determination of the virus dynamics in these hosts and the potential for disease emergence.
