<p>Pathogen transmission may potentially alter competition among multiple host species so that spatial interactions are important when regarding transmission networks [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. RNA viruses initially identified in honey bees can be widespread in the environment [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but only some novel hosts acquire infections. High densities of apiaries or introduced ants, such as the Argentine ant, could allow accumulation of high viral levels and possible spill over into pollinators and associates that would account for the virus-positive species found in this study. Frequently, the main drivers for disease emergence in wildlife populations are spill overs from domesticated hosts and human-mediated pathogen invasion, also termed ‘pathogen pollution’ [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Introduced pathogens can provide a competitive benefit to introduced hosts if native hosts are more susceptible to the pathogen than the invader [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, domestic animals often outnumber wild species and can act as reservoir hosts that may drive population decline of the wild host [
 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. For instance, the introduction of rabies virus into the Serengeti ecosystem through domestic dogs caused spill overs into wild carnivore communities and ongoing efforts to vaccinate dogs are required to stop the disease spread [

 <italic>Varroa</italic>-mediated high DWV titres in bees may cause spill overs and promote virus spread to associates and other pollinators [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The presence of apiaries has shown to cause a high prevalence of DWV and BQCV in wild pollinators [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and species associated with beehives [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. We found BQCV in honey bees but no other pollinator, which may be due to the higher BQCV prevalence in honey bees compared to other bees [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and the low number of wild bee pollinators in our sample set. We only detected DWV in Argentine ants from apiaries, which could indicate that ants acquire the virus from bees, potentially by scavenging in apiaries. In addition to species introduction, anthropogenic actions reducing biodiversity in landscapes and species may facilitate disease transmission and outbreaks [
