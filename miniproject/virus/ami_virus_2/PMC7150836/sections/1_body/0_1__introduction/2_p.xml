<p>Viral infections have been extensively studied in the European honey bee (
 <italic>Apis mellifera</italic>) because a number of RNA viruses that are circulating within bee populations have been associated with reduced health and reports of colony collapses [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Increasing evidence suggests that many of these pathogens are not specific to honey bees and instead are shared between many pollinator species and associated arthropods, including bumble bees and other wild bees [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many of these host species have been found cohabiting in bee hives [
