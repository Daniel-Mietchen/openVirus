<p>In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a range of pollinators and associated arthropods, including honey bees and Argentine ants, are infected by the same viral pathogens. Furthermore, we hypothesised that frequent inter-species viral transmission results in viral phylogenies that are predominantly associated with geographic origin instead of being associated with host species. Firstly, we screened pollinators and associated arthropods for five RNA viruses and tested for virus replication. Most bee-affecting viruses are positive sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses [

 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], including deformed wing virus (DWV), Kashmir bee virus (KBV), black queen cell virus (BQCV), and Moku virus (MKV). However, we also tested for a negative sense ssRNA (-ssRNA) virus that was recently discovered in Argentine ants, the

Limited knowledge about the host range of these viruses, particularly hosts of ‘bee viruses’ outside bees, makes identifying hosts and potential reservoirs an important step in understanding virus emergence. Secondly, we quantified to what degree the host species and geographic origin of DWV and KBV strains correlate with shared ancestry. We used phylogenetic analysis and phylogeny–trait correlation of our sequences supplemented with viral sequences retrieved from GenBank from various hosts all over the world. Phylogenies separated by geographic regions with hosts interspersed within these can provide evidence for inter-specific transmission. Alternatively, clustering within hosts species could indicate a high degree of host specificity.
