<p>Between-host virus transmission plays a key role in virus epidemics [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Emerging infectious disease are commonly caused by pathogens that infect and interact through multiple host species [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Emerging RNA viruses are suspected to spill from honey bees into associates and vice versa [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Due to high mutation rates and short generation times, this class of viruses is likely to infect and adapt to new host species and spread through large populations [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Thus far, transmission routes between species are poorly understood; flowers have been suggested to represent “disease transmission hubs” [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], allowing for transmission without direct interactions among species. Closely related viral strains in several pollinators [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and clustering of virus strains within geographic regions [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] indicate that ongoing inter-species virus transmission occurs. In order to improve pollinator conservation, multi-host viruses need to be studied further and outside the 
 <italic>Apis</italic> genus [
