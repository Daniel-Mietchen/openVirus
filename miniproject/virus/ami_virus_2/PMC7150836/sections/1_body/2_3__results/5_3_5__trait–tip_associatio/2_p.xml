<p>For KBV, significant clustering within geographic regions and within host species was found (AI and PS,

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00358">Table S4</xref>, traitâ€“tip association in non-dated phylogeny). Again, a stronger association with geographic origin was observed than with host species (observed to expected ratio, 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00358-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Due to the limited number of available KBV sequences covering the 
 <italic>vp3</italic> region (
 <italic>n</italic> = 24), samples from a geographic location were often sourced from the same host, and vice versa. KBV sequences significantly clustered within New Zealand, Europe, and Australia (all MC: 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) but also within bumble bees (MC: 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00358">Table S4</xref>). The 10 
 <italic>L. humile</italic> samples that were positive for KBV did not cluster together (MC: 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.16, 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00358-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) and instead sequences appeared to be divided by geographic region.
