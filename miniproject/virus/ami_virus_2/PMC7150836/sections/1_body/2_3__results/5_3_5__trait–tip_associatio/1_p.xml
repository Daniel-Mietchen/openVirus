<p>The trait–tip association analysis for DWV showed significant clustering within geographic locations and within host species in both dated and non-dated phylogenies (association index (AI) and parsimony score (PS),

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00358">Table S3</xref>, trait–tip association in non-dated phylogeny). The PS, which indicates the number of state changes on a tree, was smaller for geographic locations than host species (

The maximum monophyletic clade (MC) index tests which traits are associated with phylogeny, and showed that the maximum observed clade size for Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania was larger than expected by chance (all MC scores

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for a number of host states that included 
 <italic>Apis, Varroa</italic>, bee associates, non-

 <italic>L. humile</italic> (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00358-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, bee associates 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1 in non-dated analysis, 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00358">Table S3</xref>), which indicates that these groups carry strains that are more closely related than expected due to chance. Yet, it is difficult to determine whether a geographic state or host state causes the association as geographic origin and host species were often linked. For example, all North American samples in the analysis were from 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> hosts and all bee associates were collected in New Zealand. Therefore, host and geographic origin can both contribute to an observed association.
