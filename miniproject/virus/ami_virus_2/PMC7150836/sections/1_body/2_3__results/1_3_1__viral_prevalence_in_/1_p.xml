<p>We collected arthropods from eight different orders. Virus-positive species were found in all except the Odonata (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00358-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), but we note that only two samples were taken from this order. Overall, viral infections were common in pollinators and associates, with 83% (95% CI: 76%–88%) of samples testing positive for at least one virus and 44% (95% CI: 36%–53%) having multiple infections. The majority of samples were hymenopterans (
 <italic>n</italic> = 105), out of which 97% (95% CI: 92%–99%) were infected with at least one and many with multiple (62%, 95% CI: 52%–73%) viruses. One individual had as many as four viruses. Outside the order Hymenoptera (
 <italic>n</italic> = 46), 51% (95% CI: 37%–65%) of samples were found positive for at least one virus but only 6% (95% CI: 2%–17%) for multiple (two) viruses.
