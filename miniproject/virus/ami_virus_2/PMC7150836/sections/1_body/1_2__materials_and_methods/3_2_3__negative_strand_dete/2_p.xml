<p>Reverse transcription (RT) reactions were carried out in the presence of a tagged primer that contains a non-viral sequence (tag) at the 5′ end of the virus-specific primer [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The non-viral sequence is then used in the PCR step in combination with a downstream virus-specific primer, so that only cDNA derived from the strand-specific tagged primer is amplified. Super-Script™ IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used to reverse transcribe 500 ng of RNA into cDNA following the recommended COLOSS bee book protocol for strand-specific RT-PCR [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. To avoid the detection of false positives, the remaining RNA and tagged cDNA primers were digested using RNase H (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 10 U Exonuclease-I (Thermo Scientific™, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by inactivation at 70 °C for 15 min prior to PCR reactions, as described in the COLOSS bee book [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. PCR was carried out using tag and reverse primer in a 15-µL reaction using myTaq™ Red Mix (Bioline, Meridian Bioscience Inc., London, UK). Cycling was 1 min at 95 °C, 30 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 10 s at 55 °C, 10 to 30 s 72 °C (depending on product length), and a final 5 min of 72 °C. The low cycling number was used to reduce the occurrence of unspecific bands. PCR products were visualised on an agarose gel and sequenced to confirm products as described above.
