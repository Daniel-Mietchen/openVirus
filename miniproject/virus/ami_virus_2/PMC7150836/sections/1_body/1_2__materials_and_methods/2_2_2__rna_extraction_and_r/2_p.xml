<p>RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop™ spectrophotometer and approximately 500 ng of RNA were treated with perfecta DNase (Quanta BioSciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) before reverse transcription to cDNA using qScript (Quanta BioSciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR was carried out with MyTaq™ Mix and MyTaq™ Red Mix (Bioline, Meridian Bioscience Inc., London, UK). Here, 15-µL reaction mixes consisted of 1 µL of template (1:20 diluted cDNA) and 0.4 µM of each primer. PCR cycling conditions were 1 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles (38 for KBV) of 15 s of 95 °C, 15 s 55 °C, 30 s 72 °C, and a final 7 min of 72 °C. Positive and negative controls were run alongside every PCR. Primer sequences used in this study can be found in the
