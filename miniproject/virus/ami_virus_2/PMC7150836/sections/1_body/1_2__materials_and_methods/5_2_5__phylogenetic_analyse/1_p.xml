<p>To conduct an analysis of globally occurring viral variants in different host species, we supplemented DWV and KBV sequences generated in this study with sequences obtained from GenBank (
 <uri xlink:href="www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/</uri>). We used the same genomic regions that were used in the virus detection assay to conduct the phylogenetic analyses, which were a fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (
 <italic>RdRp)</italic> for DWV and the major capsid protein 
 <italic>vp3</italic> for KBV. Through a BLASTn search, we retrieved 160 sequences that matched the DWV 
 <italic>RdRp</italic> fragment. Only DWV-A was included in the analysis because all DWV sequences from our sample in New Zealand matched the DWV-A group. For KBV, 11 sequences matching the 
 <italic>vp3</italic> fragment were found and added to the sequences from this study. Most DWV and KBV sequences available on GenBank are from 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> hosts; therefore, we tested an additional 34 Argentine ant samples obtained by Felden et al. (2019) from Argentina, California, and France (details in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00358">Table S2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] for DWV and KBV. Briefly, RNA was extracted from single ants using the Direct-zol RNA Microprep extraction kit (Zymo Research) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 50 ng of RNA were reverse transcribed using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems™), tested for DWV and KBV, and sequenced using the methods described above. From these samples, two DWV and nine KBV sequences were obtained and included in the analysis.
