<p>Dated Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed in BEAST 2.2.6 [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Divergence times were calculated based on a tip-dated coalescent model. Clade probabilities were obtained from the posterior distribution incorporation sampling year information (retrieved from GenBank or original publications) for terminal nodes. Data were run under an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model with gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity and coalescent tree prior with exponential population growth. Bayesian analyses were replicated three times and combined, each with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) of 150 million generations. Trees were sampled every 10,000 generations, of which the first 10% were discarded as burn-in. Using TreeAnnotator v1.7.5, we constructed maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees and used FigTree v1.4.4 to visualise trees, including high posterior probabilities over 0.6. Tip-dated phylogenies are commonly used to reconstruct RNA viral evolution [

 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]; however, there was a chance that the sampling date and sampling region in our dataset would be connected. Therefore, we repeated the analysis without using the tip-date calibration and compared dated and non-dated phylogenies.
