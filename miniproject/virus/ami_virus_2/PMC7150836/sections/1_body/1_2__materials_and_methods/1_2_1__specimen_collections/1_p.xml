<p>We used honey bees (
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic>) and Argentine ants (
 <italic>L. humile</italic>) as two focal species for this study and sampled these species more frequently than other arthropod species. Adult workers were directly collected from ant nests (
 <italic>n =</italic> 32) and beehives (
 <italic>n =</italic> 51) using mouth aspirators or collections jars, respectively. Samples of pollinators and associated arthropods (
 <italic>n =</italic> 66) were collected using sweep nets or jars when directly collected from abandoned beehives. Collection sites consisted of a mix of agricultural fields, beach edge vegetation strips, and urban areas in the Northland region of New Zealand (

 <italic>n</italic> = 135) and January 2019 (
 <italic>n =</italic> 14), some in apiaries, some near Argentine ant nests, and others without an apiary or ant nest nearby (details in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00358">Figure S1</xref>). Specimens were immediately snap frozen in the field at approximately −150 °C in a liquid nitrogen dry shipper, before being stored at −80 °C in the laboratory until processing. Once in the laboratory, samples were removed from the freezer and placed on ice for identification. When possible, samples were identified to the species level and then again moved to −80 °C until RNA extraction.
