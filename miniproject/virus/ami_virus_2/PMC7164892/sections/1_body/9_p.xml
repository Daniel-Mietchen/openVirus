The health ministry predicts that by the peak of epidemic, Brazil will have to process 30 000–50 000 tests per day. Its current capacity is 6700 tests per day. Diagnostics are mostly centralised in Latin America. “Tests are run by the national institutes of health; very few countries run regional, local, or university laboratories”, explains Rodríguez-Morales. “But they are going to have to find ways to increase capacity, and in some places that will be a difficult and complicated task”.
