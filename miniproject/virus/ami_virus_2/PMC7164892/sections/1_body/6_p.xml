<p id="para70">Bolsonaro is not the only leader whose behaviour has caused concern. In February 2020, Mexico's president Andrés Manuel López Obrado described COVID-19 as “not even as bad as the flu”. He subsequently urged Mexicans to visit restaurants and diners. Daniel Ortega, president of Nicaragua since 2007, has not been seen in public since March 12. In his absence, his wife and vice-president Rosario Murillo has co-ordinated the response to the pandemic. She has declined to close schools and shops. Nicaragua is the only nation in Central America to have kept its borders open. Even the local football league has not been suspended. Nicaragua has only registered nine cases of COVID-19, a number experts find implausible and might reflect lack of testing. “We have concerns for the lack of social distancing, the convening of mass gatherings. We have concerns about the testing, contact tracing, the reporting of cases. We also have concerns about what we see as inadequate infection prevention and control”, commented Carissa Etienne, director of PAHO, in a virtual press conference.</p>
