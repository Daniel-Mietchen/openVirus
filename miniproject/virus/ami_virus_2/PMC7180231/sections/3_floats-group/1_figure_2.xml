  <p>The specific expression of NcHig in the CNS of 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> RT-qPCR assay of NcHig expression in total insect (total) and the indicated tissues of 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>. The detected transcript levels were normalized to the transcript levels of internal control actin gene and estimated using the 2
   <sup>–ΔΔ
    <italic>Ct</italic>
   </sup> (cycle threshold) method. ACS, alimentary canal. Values are the means (±SE) of three biological replicates. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Quantification of NcHig protein levels in the indicated tissues as determined by an immunoblot assay using NcHig-specific antibody. α-tubulin was used as the loading control. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Transcript levels of NcHig were normalized to the transcript levels of internal control actin gene in the virus-infected or uninfected heads of 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>, as detected by an RT-qPCR assay. Values are the means (±SE) of three biological replicates. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Accumulation of NcHig protein in the virus-infected or uninfected heads of 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>, as detected by an immunoblot assay. Insect β-actin was used as the internal control.
