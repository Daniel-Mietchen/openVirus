  <p>The dsNcHig-mediated knockdown of NcHig expression specifically impedes RYSV infection in the CNS of the 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> vector. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The transcript levels of RYSV N, RYSV M, and NcHig were normalized to the transcript levels of internal control actin gene in the whole body 
   <bold>(A-I)</bold>, head 
   <bold>(A-II)</bold>, and alimentary canal (ACS) 
   <bold>(A-III)</bold> of viruliferous 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> at 6 days post-microinjection of dsNcHig and dsGFP, as detected by RT-qPCR assay. 
   <italic>P</italic>-values were estimated using a Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The accumulation levels of NcHig and RYSV N and M in the heads of viruliferous 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> at 6 days post-microinjection of dsNcHig and dsGFP, as detected by an immunoblot assay. Insect β-actin was used as an internal control. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> RYSV infection of the CNS of viruliferous 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> at 6 days post dsRNAs microinjection was analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. Virus-infected heads were immunolabeled with RYSV-M-rhodamine (red) and α-tubulin-FITC (green). ag, abdominal ganglion; br, brain; sg, salivary gland. Bars, 50 μm. RT-qPCR assay was used to detect the viral genome copies of RYSV in the heads of 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> at 3 days 
   <bold>(D)</bold>, 6 days 
   <bold>(E)</bold>, or 8 days 
   <bold>(F)</bold> post-microinjection of dsRNAs. The RYSV genome copies in the individual heads (
   <italic>n</italic> = 27) from viruliferous 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> were calculated as the log of the copies number/μg RNA in head based on the standard curve for the RYSV N gene. The results were analyzed from three biological repeats. 
   <italic>P</italic>-values were estimated using a Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. 
   <bold>(G)</bold> RT-qPCR assay was used to detect the viral genome copies of RYSV in the alimentary canals of 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> at 6 days post-microinjection of dsRNAs. RYSV genome copies in the individual alimentary canal (
   <italic>n</italic> = 27) from viruliferous leafhoppers were calculated as the log of the copies number/μg RNA in alimentary canal based on the standard curve for the RYSV N gene. The results were analyzed from three biological repeats. 
   <bold>(H)</bold> The infection of RYSV in the intestines of viruliferous leafhoppers at 6 days post dsRNAs microinjection was analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. Virus-infected alimentary canals were immunolabeled with RYSV-M-rhodamine and the actin dye phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 488 (green). fc, filter chamber; mt, midgut; amg, anterior midgut; mmg, middle midgut; pmg, posterior midgut. Bars, 50 μm.
