  <p>Immuno-blockade of NcHig enhanced the infection of RYSV in the CNS of 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>. RT-qPCR assay of viral genome copies of RYSV in the head 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and alimentary canal 
   <bold>(B)</bold> of 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> at 6 days post-microinjection of NcHig antibody or pre-immune antibody as the control. The RYSV genome copies in the individual samples (
   <italic>n</italic> = 27) from viruliferous 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> were calculated as the log of the copies number/μg tissue RNA based on the standard curve for the RYSV N gene. The analysis was based on three biological repeats. 
   <italic>P</italic>-values were estimated using a Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> RYSV infection of the CNS of viruliferous 
   <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> at 6 days post-microinjection of NcHig antibody or pre-immune antibody, as analyzed by an immunofluorescence assay. Virus-infected heads were immunolabeled with RYSV-M-rhodamine (red) and α-tubulin-FITC (green). ag, abdominal ganglion; br, brain; sg, salivary gland. Bars, 50 μm.
