  <p>RdHig has antiviral activity during RSMV infection of the CNS of 
   <italic>R. dorsalis</italic>. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Yeast two-hybrid assay to detect the interaction of RSMV M protein with the CCP2 domains of RdHig. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> GST pull-down assay to verify the interaction of RdHig CCP2 domains with RSMV M protein. GST protein was used as the control. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> RT-qPCR assay to detect RdHig transcript levels in different tissues of 
   <italic>R. dorsalis</italic>. ACS, alimentary canal. Values are the means (±SE) of three biological replicates. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> The transcript levels of RdHig expression in RSMV-infected or uninfected heads of 
   <italic>R. dorsalis</italic>, as detected by an RT-qPCR assay. Values are the means (±SE) of three biological replicates. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> RT-qPCR assay of viral genome copies of RSMV in the heads of 
   <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> at 6 days post-microinjection of dsRNAs. RSMV genome copies in the individual heads (
   <italic>n</italic> = 27) of viruliferous 
   <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> were calculated as the log of the copies number/μg RNA in head based on the standard curve for the RSMV N gene. 
   <italic>P</italic>-values were estimated using a Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> The accumulation of RdHig, RSMV N, and RSMV M in the heads of viruliferous 
   <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> at 6 days post-microinjection of dsRdHig and dsGFP, as detected by an immunoblot assay. Insect β-actin was used as the internal control. 
   <bold>(G)</bold> RSMV infection of the CNS of viruliferous 
   <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> at 6 days post dsRNA microinjection, as analyzed by an immunofluorescence assay. Virus-infected heads were immunolabeled with RSMV-M-rhodamine (red) and α-tubulin-FITC (green). ag, abdominal ganglion; br, brain; sg, salivary gland. Bars, 50 μm.
