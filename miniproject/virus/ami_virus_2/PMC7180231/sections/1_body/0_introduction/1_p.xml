<p>Many plant viruses that cause substantial agricultural losses, such as reoviruses, tospoviruses, tenuiviruses, and rhabdoviruses, are transmitted by insect vectors in a persistent-propagative manner (

From the hemolymph, persistent viruses eventually invade the salivary glands to be horizontally transmitted to healthy plants, or only few are vertically transmitted to the offspring (
