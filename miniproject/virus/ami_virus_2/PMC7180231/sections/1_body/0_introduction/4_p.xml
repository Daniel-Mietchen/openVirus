<p>In this study, we used rice rhabdoviruses (RYSV and RSMV) and their main leafhopper vectors, 
 <italic>Nephotettix cincticeps</italic> and 
 <italic>Recilia dorsalis</italic> (Hemiptera, Delphacidae), to explore how insect factors regulate the persistent infection of rhabdoviruses in the CNS of insect vectors. We report that the neuron-specific factors, the 
 <italic>Hikaru genki</italic> (Hig) homologs of rice leafhoppers, directly interact with M proteins of rice rhabdoviruses and play a conserved antiviral role in controlling viral infection in the CNS of leafhopper vectors.
