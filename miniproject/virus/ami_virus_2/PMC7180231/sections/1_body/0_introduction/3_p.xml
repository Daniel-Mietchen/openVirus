<p>The neurotropic nature of plant rhabdoviruses suggests that there might be an alternative non-hemolymph pathway that allows the rapid spread of viruses from the initial infection site in the intestinal epithelium to the salivary glands via nerve networks (

We recently observed that RYSV M protein interacted with axonal microtubules to mediate the rapid movement of the virions along axons in the insect central nervous system (CNS), thereby facilitating the persistent virus transmission by leafhopper vectors (

The persistent infection of plant rhabdoviruses generally does not cause cytopathologic changes in insect CNS; however, the neuro-invasive viruses of vertebrates generally cause degeneration of axons, cellular pathogenesis, and even neurologic disease or similar neuroinflammatory disorders (
