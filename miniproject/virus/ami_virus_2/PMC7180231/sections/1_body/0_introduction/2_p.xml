<p>Rhabdoviruses form a large family whose collective host ranges include vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants, and are of considerable socioeconomic and agricultural importance (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dietzgen and Kuzmin, 2012</xref>). For example, leafhopper-transmitted RYSV, a nucleorhabdovirus, and RSMV, a cytorhabdovirus, pose serious agricultural threats in Asian rice-growing countries (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2018</xref>). During viral assembly, nucleoprotein (N), polymerase (L), phosphoprotein (P), and the RNA genome form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dietzgen et al., 2017</xref>). The rhabdovirus matrix (M) protein, a small (20â€“25 kDa) self-association protein, condenses RNP cores to form non-enveloped viral particles (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Walker et al., 2018</xref>). Generally, RNP cores are constructed inside the viroplasms, whereas M proteins are added to the RNP cores at the periphery of the viroplasms to produce non-enveloped virions (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ammar et al., 2009</xref>). The enveloped virions are assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or the inner nuclear membranes in plant cells, or at the plasma membrane in animal cells (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Jayakar et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>). How these viral proteins are involved in the persistent viral propagation of the nervous system in insect vectors is still poorly understood.
