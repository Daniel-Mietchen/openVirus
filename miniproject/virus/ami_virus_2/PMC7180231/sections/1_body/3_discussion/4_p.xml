<p>Previously, we have shown that the RYSV M protein directly interacted with α-tubulin, and thus, the non-enveloped RYSV particles can move along axon microtubules to facilitate long-distance viral spread in the CNS of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we further determine that the direct interaction of RYSV M protein with the CCP domains of Hig inhibits the extensive infection of the CNS by the virus, preventing the lethal viral infection of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>. Taken together, it is possible that Hig may compete with α-tubulin for binding to the surface of non-enveloped RYSV particles, thereby preventing the excessive spread of RYSV in CNS and limiting viral burden to a safe level in the CNS. Thus, the M protein-binding ability of Hig may be essential for its antiviral activity and for its ability to modulate the persistent infection of RYSV in the CNS of 
 <italic>N. cincticep</italic>. However, RYSV infection of the leafhopper CNS does not change Hig expression level, suggesting that the ability for Hig to bind and restrict the spread of non-enveloped RYSV particles is not strongly activated during viral persistent infection of insect CNS. Interestingly, the neuron-specific factor Hig homolog of leafhopper 
 <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> also demonstrates a prominent antiviral role during the persistent infection of the RSMV in the CNS. Our results reveal an evolutionarily conserved antiviral mechanism for Hig to mediate the persistent infection of rice rhabdoviruses in the CNS of leafhopper vectors, and thus may facilitate rhabdovirus transmission in nature.
