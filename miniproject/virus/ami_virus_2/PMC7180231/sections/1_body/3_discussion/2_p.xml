<p>The CCP domains of Hig proteins are evolutionarily conserved, play important roles in neuron development, and interact with the surface of several pathogenic viruses (

Here, we show that two rice rhabdoviruses RYSV and RSMV have also evolved a similar strategy by interaction of viral M proteins with the conserved CCP domains of Hig homologs of leafhoppers, efficiently controlling viral infection in the CNS of insect vectors. Many vector-borne viruses of agricultural or healthy importance such as reovirus, rhabdovirus, and flaviviruses are neurotropic and can persistently infect CNS of their insect vectors without causing significant cytopathology (
