<p>The matrix molecules of distantly related rhabdoviruses M proteins have very similar coiled helical structures that condense the RNP core to assemble non-enveloped virions (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al., 2008</xref>). We have shown that the expression of RYSV M protein in 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> (Sf9) cells resulted in the formation of such coiled helical tubule-like structures (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Hig CCP domains of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> may directly interact with the rigid helical structures of RYSV M protein on the surface of non-enveloped virons in the CNS of insect vectors, but not with specific domains of RYSV M protein.
