<p>Interestingly, the antiviral activity of Hig is limited to the CNS and has no effect in the intestines of leafhopper vectors. Usually, the propagation of plant viruses in the intestines of insect vectors triggers a conserved small interfering RNA (siRNA) antiviral pathway. For example, a virus-induced siRNA antiviral pathway effectively restricts the replication of southern rice black streaked dwarf virus, a plant reovirus, in the midgut epithelium of the small brown planthopper, which ultimately affects the capacity for viral transmission (

For example, autophagy and apoptosis can be activated by rice gall dwarf virus, a plant reovirus, to promote viral replication in the midgut of leafhopper vectors (

How these insect innate immune responses cooperate with Hig-mediated antiviral response to modulate the persistent viral infection in vector CNS would be investigated in the future. Exploring the role of insect antiviral factors in CNS infections will broaden our understanding of the sophisticated interactions between plant viruses and their vectors and may provide insights into novel approaches to attenuate viral epidemics.
