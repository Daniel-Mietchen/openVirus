<p>Many plant rhabdoviruses can invade, systemically infect, and propagate within the CNS of their insect vectors (

However, such infections do not affect leafhopper cytopathology, implying that leafhopper brains have antiviral mechanisms that limit the viral burden to safe levels. Little is known about potential neuron-specific antiviral mechanisms in leafhoppers. In this study, we reveal a previous unreported antiviral mechanism that the leafhopper homologs of the neural factor Hig modulate the persistent infection of rice rhabdoviruses in the CNS of leafhopper vectors.
