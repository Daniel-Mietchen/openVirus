<p>We then assessed whether the silencing of NcHig influences insect survival upon RYSV infection. The silencing of NcHig did not directly cause phenotypic abnormalities or death of non-viruliferous 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS3">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). However, after viral infection, a higher mortality rate was observed in dsNcHig-treated group than in dsGFP-treated group (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS3">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). It seemed that an increase of viral accumulation in the CNS of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> was associated with the increased mortality rate of dsNcHig-treated 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>. These results indicate that the NcHig effectively modulates the persistent infection of RYSV in the CNS of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps.</italic>
