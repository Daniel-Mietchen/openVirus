<p>We next investigated the functional role of NcHig during the persistent infection of RYSV in the CNS of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> using RNA interference (RNAi) strategy. Specifically, we microinjected the leafhopper bodies with purified RYSV along with dsNcHig or dsGFP. At 6 days after microinjection, RT-qPCR and immunoblot assays showed that dsNcHig treatment significantly decreased NcHig expression in whole leafhopper bodies and heads at both the mRNA and protein levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of NcHig expression by the dsNcHig treatment significantly increased the transcript levels of RYSV N and M in the whole leafhopper bodies and heads, but not in the alimentary canal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Immunoblot assay confirmed the significant increase in RYSV N and M protein levels in dsNcHig-treated heads (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that RYSV M was extensively distributed throughout the CNS in dsNcHig-treated leafhoppers, but was restricted to limited areas of the CNS in dsGFP-treated leafhoppers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). To quantitate the effect of NcHig on viral load, we measured the viral genome copies number in the heads of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> at 3, 6, and 8 days after dsRNAs microinjection using RT-qPCR assay. The mean viral genome copy number was always higher in dsNcHig-treated groups than in dsGFP-treated groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3Dâ€“F</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that NcHig plays an antiviral role during RYSV infection of the CNS of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>.
