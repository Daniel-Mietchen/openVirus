<p>We have shown that the knockdown of NcHig specifically enhanced viral infection in the head, but not in the alimentary canal of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, the mean viral genome copies number in the alimentary canal of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> was not significantly different between the dsNcHig- and dsGFP-treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3G</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that RYSV infection of the leafhopper alimentary canals did not change significantly after dsNcHig treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3H</xref>). Thus, NcHig is a neuron-specific factor that controls viral propagation in the CNS but not in the peripheral intestinal tissues.
