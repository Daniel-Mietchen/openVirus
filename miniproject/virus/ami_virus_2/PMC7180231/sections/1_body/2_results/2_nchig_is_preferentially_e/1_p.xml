 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mosquito Hig proteins are specifically expressed in the CNS (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). To establish whether this is also true of leafhopper Hig proteins, we assessed the abundance of NcHig transcript in different tissues of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> using RT-qPCR assay. NcHig transcripts were highly abundant in the leafhopper head, where the CNS is located (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further understand the distribution of NcHig protein, we expressed and purified a fragment including IG and CCP2 domains at the C-terminal of NcHig in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> and generated a polyclonal antibody in mice. This antibody could detect the Hig proteins from the heads of leafhoppers 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> or 
 <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). Consistent with its mRNA expression pattern, the NcHig protein was predominantly expressed in the leafhopper heads, as detected by an immumoblot assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, NcHig is preferentially expressed in the CNS of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>.
