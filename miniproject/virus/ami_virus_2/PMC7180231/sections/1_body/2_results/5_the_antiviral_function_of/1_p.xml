 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). Yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that RSMV M protein directly interacted with the CCP2 domains of a Hig homolog in 
 <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> (RdHig) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). GST pull-down assay confirmed such interaction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). RT-qPCR assay also showed that RdHig is specifically expressed in the head of 
 <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>), and that its expression is not activated during RSMV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, RT-qPCR, immunoblots, and immunofluorescence microscopy all showed that the microinjection of dsRdHig significantly enhanced the propagation of RSMV in the CNS of 
 <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5Eâ€“G</xref>). These results suggest that the Hig proteins have conserved antiviral roles in rice leafhoppers.
