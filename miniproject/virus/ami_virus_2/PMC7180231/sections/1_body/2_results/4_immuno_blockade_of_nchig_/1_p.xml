<p>To further validate the antiviral role of NcHig during RYSV infection of vector CNS, we performed an immuno-blockade of NcHig function 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> with NcHig antibody. We microinjected the NcHig antibody along with RYSV into the thorax of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>, and subsequently measured RYSV genome copies number in the head and alimentary canal. At 6 days post-microinjection, RT-qPCR assay showed that NcHig antibody treatment significantly increased the mean viral genome copies number in 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> heads (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, NcHig antibody treatment did not affect viral load in the alimentary canal of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that RYSV propagation in the CNS was strongly increased after NcHig antibody treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>). Together, these results confirm that the neuron-specific factor NcHig controls RYSV propagation in the CNS of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>.
