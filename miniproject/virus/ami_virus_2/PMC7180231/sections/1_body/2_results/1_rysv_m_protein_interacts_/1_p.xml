<p>To identify insect factors that interact with RYSV M, we screened a cDNA library of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> using a yeast two-hybrid assay. This screen yielded 178 positive colonies, of which 62 were randomly sequenced. Of the resulting sequences, 27 candidate interactors were annotated using the BLASTX program in GenBank (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS2">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). These candidates included the neurons protein, the key regulators in vesicle formation or trafficking such as the transitional ER ATPase and Ras- or Rab-related proteins, and the tubulin (

 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> homolog of the neural factor Hig (NcHig) caught our attention. Hig is predominantly expressed in the pupal and adult nervous system of 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mosquitoes, and is involved in the resistance to pathogenic virus infection (
