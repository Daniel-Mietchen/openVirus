<p>Rice leafhoppers (
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> and 
 <italic>R. dorsalis</italic>) were collected from Yunnan Province in southern China and reared on rice seedlings in cages in a controlled environment at 28°C with 75 ± 5% humidity and a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle. The rice leafhoppers were reared on rice seedlings in a controlled environment as described previously (

 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> (

 <italic>R. dorsalis</italic>. RYSV and RSMV were crudely purified from infected rice plants, as described by 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. (2006)</xref>. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against N and M proteins encoded by RYSV and RSMV were prepared as previously described (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). The α-tubulin antibody (Sigma), a general marker of neural structures, was used to label the leafhopper CNS. Polyclonal antibody was conjugated directly to fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or rhodamine according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
