The recombinant vectors pGBKT7-M/pGADT7-Nc-CCP1, pGBKT7-M/pGADT7-Nc-IG, pGBKT7-M/pGADT7-Nc-CCP2, and pGBKT7-M/pGADT7-NcHig-full length as well as the positive control pGBKT7-53/pGADT7-T and the negative control pGBKT7-Lam/pGADT7-T were each co-transformed into the AH109 yeast strain, respectively. The segment containing the complement control protein (CCP) domain at the C-terminus (396-631 aa, CCP2) of
