<p>To explore the interaction region of RYSV M protein with NcHig, full-length of RYSV M gene were divided into N-terminal (1-131 aa) and C-terminal (132-262 aa) fragments and cloned into the bait vector pGBKT7, respectively. The recombinant vectors pGBKT7-M-N-terminal/pGADT7-NcHig-CCP2, pGBKT7-M-C-terminal/pGADT7-NcHig-CCP2, as well as the positive control and the negative control were each co-transformed into the AH109 yeast strain, respectively. The plasmids were also transformed into the yeast cells to verify the interaction of RSMV with RdHig. β-galactosidase activity was assessed on SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade/X-α-gal agar culture medium plates.</p>
