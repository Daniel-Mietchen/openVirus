<p>Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to examine viral distribution in the CNSs of leafhoppers that had been microinjected with antibody or dsRNAs. The third instar rice leafhoppers were microinjected with antibody or dsRNAs and then transferred to healthy rice seedlings. At 6 days after microinjection, the alimentary canals and heads from 30 rice leafhoppers were dissected, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for at least 8 h, and permeabilized in 4% Triton X-100 for 24 h. The treated heads were also immunolabeled with M antibody conjugated to rhodamine (M-rhodamine) and α-tubulin antibody conjugated to FITC (α-tubulin-FITC, Sigma). The alimentary canals were immunolabeled with M-rhodamine and the actin dye phalloidin-Alexa 488 (Invitrogen). The samples were then examined using a Leica TCS SP5II confocal microscope.</p>
