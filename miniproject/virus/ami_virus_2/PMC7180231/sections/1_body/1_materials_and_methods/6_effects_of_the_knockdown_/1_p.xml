<p>Double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) of Hig (dsHig) and GFP (dsGFP) (primers in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) were synthesized 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> as previously described (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). The mixtures of synthesized dsRNAs and virus solutions were microinjected into the third instar rice leafhoppers. The microinjected third instar insects were reared on healthy rice seedlings in containers under controlled conditions. Based on RYSV infection process within the body of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), at 3, 6, or 8 days post-microinjection, the alimentary canals and heads of rice leafhoppers were dissected for immunofluorescence microscopy, and the total RNAs were isolated to assess the transcript levels of Hig or viral genes using RT-qPCR assay. Three biological repeats were used for the RT-qPCR assay and analyzed using a Student’s 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. The RYSV or RSMV genome copies (viral titers) in the individual head or alimentary canal of viruliferous leafhopper were calculated as the log of the copies number/μg head or alimentary canal RNAs based on the standard curve for the N genes of RYSV or RSMV (primer in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="TS1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Additionally, Hig and viral accumulations were analyzed by an immunoblot assay using Hig-, N-, or M-specific antibody, respectively.
