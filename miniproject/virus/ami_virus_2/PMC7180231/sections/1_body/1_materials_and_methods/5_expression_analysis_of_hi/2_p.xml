<p>To verify the expression patterns of Hig in different tissues of rice leafhoppers, the segment containing NcHig CCP2 domain was cloned into the pDONR221 vector and then recombined into the pDEST17 expression vector. The recombinant plasmid was expressed in the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21. The lysates of cells containing the recombinant NcHig were purified using His-tag purification resin. The polyclonal antibody was produced by immunization of NcHig in mice prepared by the Beijing Protein Innovation Company, which was approved by the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission. The specificity of antibody was detected by an immunoblot assay. Total proteins were extracted from leafhopper tissues and then analyzed by immunoblot assay.
