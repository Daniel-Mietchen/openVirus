<p>To analyze the expression levels of NcHig in different tissues of 
 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic>, the head, alimentary canal, ovary, and testis of adult instar leafhoppers were dissected for extraction of the total RNAs and proteins of different tissues. The relative expression of Hig (primers in

 <italic>N. cincticeps</italic> or 
 <italic>R. dorsalis</italic> was detected with an RT-qPCR assay by using a QuantStudio
 <sup>TM</sup> 5 Real-Time PCR machine. The detected transcript levels were normalized to the transcript levels of the internal control genes, i.e., actin or elongation factor 1 (EF1) alpha, and estimated using the 2
