<p>Immuno-blockade of the interaction of viruses with insect factors in various tissues such as brain, alimentary canal, and ovary by microinjection of specific antibody against insect factors has been extensively used (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). In the immuno-blockade assay, the third instar rice leafhoppers were microinjected with the mixtures of NcHig antibody and virus solutions. The mixtures of pre-immune antibody and virus solutions were used as the control treatment. The microinjected third instar insects were then reared on healthy rice seedlings. At 3 or 6 days post-microinjection, rice leafhoppers were dissected for immunofluorescence microscopy. Total RNAs were isolated from the head or alimentary canal to quantify viral titers using RT-qPCR assay.
