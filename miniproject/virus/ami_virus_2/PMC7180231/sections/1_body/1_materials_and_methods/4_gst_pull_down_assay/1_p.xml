<p>A GST pull-down assay was performed to detect the interaction of RYSV M protein with NcHig. The RYSV M gene was amplified and cloned into the pGEX-3X vector, which included a GST-tag (M-GST). The NcHig CCP2 domains were cloned and inserted into a His-fusion vector, pDEST17 (His-NcHig-CCP2). The constructed plasmids pDEST17-NcHig-CCP2, pGEX-3X-M, and pGEX-3X (GST) were separately expressed in the 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 DE3 strain. The lysates of cells containing the pGEX-3X-M (M-GST) and pGEX-3X (GST) vectors were incubated with Glutathione Sepharose beads (Amersham) for 4 h at 4°C. The beads were rinsed with 0.01 M PBS to remove the redundant proteins, and were then incubated with lysates of cells containing pDEST17 (His-NcHig-CCP2) for a further 4 h at 4°C. The mixtures were then washed with elution buffer and visualized using an immunoblot assay with GST-tag and His-tag antibody (Abcam), respectively. The interaction of RSMV and RdHig was also detected by a GST pull-down assay.
