<p id="Par11">From the images presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, it is evident that the pandemic evolution is rather similar for all three countries; in particular, they are conjoint when the recorded numbers are reaching their maximum. Similarly for all three counties, the percentage of new cases starts to get stabilised after 5 containment days. Summarising, the countries of comparison have applied similar containment rules and share similar evolution. However, compared to France and Italy, Tunisia started the containment almost 2 weeks earlier considering the level of pandemic spread. This preventive measure allowed Tunisia so far to reduce the absolute number of infected people. Consequently, Tunisia currently counts less than 400 identified infection cases, while France and Italy count more than 45,000 and 101,000 cases, respectively. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents the identified infection numbers in all three countries, as well as their respective containment dates.
