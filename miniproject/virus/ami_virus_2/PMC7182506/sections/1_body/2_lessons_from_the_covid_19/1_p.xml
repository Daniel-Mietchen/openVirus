<p id="Par18">Covid-19 is neither the first nor the last viral epidemic which societies around the world are, were and will be affected by. Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation?

   <p id="Par20">Retrospective analysis of data is needed to create a valid scenario of current and coming epidemics. Thereby, evidence-based monitoring, providing reliable data and international data exchange, is crucial.</p>

   <p id="Par21">Creation of prototype algorithms as the basic predictive tool to be prepared for the next epidemics is highly desirable.</p>

   <p id="Par22">Laboratory medicine is central in combating pandemics. An excellent example has been provided by Iceland with randomised tests to the population in order to estimate the real number of infected persons. To this end, the “real-time” monitoring is essential utilising both the anti-gene and anti-body tests.</p>

   <p id="Par23">Multi-professional expertise is an obligation to create effective strategies including laboratory medicine, epidemiology, virology, immunology, microbiology, pulmonology, psychology, psychiatry, disease-modelling and bioinformatics, amongst others.</p>

   <p id="Par24">Resolute targeted prevention instead of “salami” tactic should be considered by policymakers. Delayed and unconsolidated region-dependent measures as well as highly heterogeneous attitude ranging from “doing nothing”, “observing what other are doing” up to within few days changing mind from “no matter” to “facing a severe problem” is misleading for populations which under the epidemic condition need particularly clear statements and well justified strategies.</p>

   <p id="Par25">Personalisation of protective measures and treatments are essential by evidence-based identifying groups at risk and stratifying patients based on the individualised profiling.</p>

   <p id="Par26">Ethical aspects: under pandemic conditions, the triage presents a “Titanic”-unlike dilemma, namely which groups of individuals should be prioritised for which kind of medical services. In case of Titanic, the decision was relatively simple: children and women have been prioritised for placing into the limited number of boats. More complicated is the “triage” for infected individuals under epidemic conditions, due to highly complex situations. Under the optimal scenario, a “bottle-neck” should be minimised and targeted protection should be provided to any group in the population. Under the current Covid-19 pandemic, these include timely epidemiologic data collection, sufficient laboratory tests, well in time organised isolation of elderly, protective measures to employees at points with high density of contacts (shops, schools, transport, etc.), financial support to low-income groups and economically weak enterprises. From the ethical point of view, again, predictive algorithms are needed to create the most effective targeted preventive measures and personalised care to citizens by implementing 3PM concepts.</p>

   <p id="Par27">Relevance of economic aspects for individual health outcomes: The current pandemic caused unemployment and economic depression at individual and population levels frequently leading to a cascade of comorbidities including depression, suppressed immune defence, suicide, psychotic attitude and violence, amongst others, resulting in related mortality. Therefore, a well-justified balance between ordered limitations to the population (home isolation, temporary unemployment etc.) aiming at decreasing the number of new Covid-19 infected cases on the one hand and well-controlled timely normalisation of the societal functioning on the other hand is essential based on reliable predictive algorithms.</p>
