<p>This conceptual analysis presents arguments for combatting BRD at the population level through improved external biosecurity in cattle herds. The rationale for such a program will be given by describing the current impact of BRD, the effect of the current preventive measures and the likely effect of additional biosecurity improvements. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are two important causative agents in BRD. The Norwegian control program for BRSV and BCoV is presented as an example of a novel and alternative strategy to prevent and reduce BRD. Challenges of such a program and relevant differences between Norway and other areas are also discussed.</p>
