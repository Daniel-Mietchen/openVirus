<p>Improvement of the environment can favor healthy development of animals with a robust immune system. Management factors including excessive handling, commingling, and movement of animals increase the risk of BRD due to stress and immunosuppression (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). An important management factor is a good routine for adequate intake of colostrum (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Annual and seasonal variation in mortality rates due to BRD have been documented, with increased rates during winter (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). This has been partially explained by higher animal density during confined housing, poor ventilation and inclement weather (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Studies from Scandinavia have found that reduction of the animal density and age span in group-pens along with 1 week of isolation of new-borns from adult cows may prevent BRD (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Nevertheless, maintenance of good health alone does not result in sufficient reduction of BRD (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and despite education and consulting of producers on optimal management strategies, it may be difficult to achieve the desired results.
