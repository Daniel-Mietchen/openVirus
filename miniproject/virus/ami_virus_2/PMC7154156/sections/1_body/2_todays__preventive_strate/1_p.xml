<p>The multifactorial nature of BRD and the global differences in production systems of beef and dairy cattle have led to a variety of prevention strategies. Common for all strategies are attempts to either improve the animal environment, strengthen the general health and host immunity and/or minimize animal exposure to the relevant pathogens. Vaccination and preventive antimicrobial medication are the most common preventive measures, with the aim to keep a low infection pressure and/or helping the host to combat infection. All preventive measures focus on the single animal or herd as the unit of interest.</p>
