<p>Mass medication involves administering antimicrobials to groups of animals, either as preventive/prophylactic treatment or as metaphylaxis. Murray et al. (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) concluded in a review that mass medication provides inconsistent control of BRD and poses a serious concern regarding the effect on emergence of antimicrobial resistance. A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled clinical trials concluded that antimicrobial prophylaxis and metaphylaxis demonstrated moderate, yet highly variable reductions in the relative risk of BRD morbidity (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The most substantial reductions of relative risk were from critically important broad-spectrum antimicrobials. However, metaphylactic treatment with macrolides were found to have no effect on incidence of BRD in a controlled trial (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In addition, a high prevalence of multidrug resistant 
 <italic>Mannheimia haemolytica</italic> has been found in cattle after metaphylaxis and treatment for BRD (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Baptiste and Kyvsgaard (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) also concluded that BRD prophylaxis/metaphylaxis represents a major driver of antimicrobial consumption for highly variable short-term gains in terms of absolute risk reduction of morbidity and mortality. The use of mass medication can hardly be seen as in accordance with the current strategy to prevent antimicrobial resistance through prudent use of antibiotics recommended by the World Health Organization, United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization and World Organization for Animal Health (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). It is therefore necessary to promote control of BRD without the use of antimicrobial mass-medication.
