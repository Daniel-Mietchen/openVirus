<p>BRD is a multifactorial disease, and can be caused by a specter of pathogens, often in combination. Viral pathogens such as BRSV, bovine herpesvirus 1, bovine parainfluenza virus 3, bovine viral diarrhea virus and BCoV can cause disease directly, and/or predispose animals to bacterial infections (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Most of these primary BRD pathogens are highly contagious viruses that can easily spread between herds (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>), either directly through live animal contact/movement, or indirectly through contaminated environment or fomites brought between herds. The most common bacterial agents are

 <italic>Histophilus somni</italic> (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>–
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). These bacteria appear to have lower transmissibility, and bacterial disease in several animals is therefore most likely a result of exposure of animals to the same risk factors, such as virus infection and/or suboptimal environment, at the same time (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). 
 <italic>Mycoplasma bovis</italic> can also contribute to BRD, either as primary or secondary pathogen. Live animal movement seems to be the primary means by which 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> is transmitted between herds (
