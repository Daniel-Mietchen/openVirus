<p>Several important BRD pathogens are absent or eradicated in Norway, such as BVDV, bovine herpesvirus 1 and 
 <italic>M. bovis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). This highlights the impact of two other viruses in the BRD complex; BRSV and BCoV. Both are highly prevalent in the Norwegian cattle population (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) as they are in most parts of the world, both in intensive and extensive husbandry systems (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). BRSV has been reported responsible for 60% of the BRD epidemics observed in dairy herds (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>) and up to 70% in the beef herds (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In Norway, BRSV has been reported as the main etiological agent causing BRD outbreaks (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). BCoV causes BRD (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>) in addition to winter dysentery (contagious acute diarrhea in adult cattle) and diarrhea in calves (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), which further increases the negative consequences of BCoV (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>).
