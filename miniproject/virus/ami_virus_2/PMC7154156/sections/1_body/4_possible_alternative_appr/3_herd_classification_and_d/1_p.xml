<p>In order to monitor the disease situation at the population level, a suitable classification system for herds is needed. Different sample material can be used, and a diagnosis can be made on individual animal level or at the group/herd level. Generally, infection with BRSV and BCoV can be diagnosed by detection of virus, viral antigen, or viral RNA in tissues, secretions, or excretions of infected animals (

 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Antiviral antibodies are usually detected by commercial ELISA tests and there is a good agreement between titers in serum and milk for both viruses (
