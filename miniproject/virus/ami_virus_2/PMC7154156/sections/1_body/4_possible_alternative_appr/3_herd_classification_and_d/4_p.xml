<p>The interpretation of testing will depend on the age and number of animals sampled. Bulk tank milk serology can provide an estimate of herd-level seroprevalence of BRSV and BCoV (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). The method is cheap, but the result only reflect that there has been virus present in the herd during the last years. Sampling of a group of younger animals has also been used, with the assumption that the selected animals are representative for their age group in the herd e.g., pooled milk samples from primiparous cows. As they usually are 2–3 years old, the sample will reflect a herd's infection-history 2–3 years prior (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Serum from a group of calves under 1 year of age will indicate virus circulation within the last year, if calves young enough to have maternal antibodies are excluded. Classification of herds based on serological analysis of a group of animals is therefore possible, and the different options have pros and cons with regard to cost and value. We reiterate that the gap between seropositivity and virus presence is considerable. A seronegative herd is, on the other hand, a good indicator of a virus-free herd, and in the context of a control program, finding the free herds might be most important.
