<p>During viral shedding, nasal swabs (BRSV/BCoV) and feces (BCoV) can be used for antigen detection or for genome detection by RT-PCR (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Antibody detection can also be used during outbreaks but requires paired acute and convalescent samples. Serological investigations are used for retrospective diagnostics and screening studies (prevalence), often at the herd level. Because animals are seropositive for many years after infection (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>), seropositivity is a slow-changing indicator which indicates previous exposure to virus, but not necessarily presence of virus.
