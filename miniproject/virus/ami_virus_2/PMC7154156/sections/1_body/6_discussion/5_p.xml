<p>The second element, elimination of virus from infected herds, receives little attention in the program as self-clearance is regarded likely. This is probably more effective in small herds, and the small average herd size in Norway is therefore an advantage. In larger herds, na√Øve cattle in sufficient numbers might be available all the time, and both acute, subclinical infections and possible persistent infections are more likely. Altogether, control might be more challenging in areas where herds are larger, and more intense monitoring might be necessary. Nevertheless, biosecurity-based control might still succeed if new introduction of virus is avoided, as it will most likely be a question of time before virus cease to circulate also in larger herds.</p>
