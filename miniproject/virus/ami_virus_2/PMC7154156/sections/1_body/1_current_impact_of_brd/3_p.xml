<p>Antimicrobial usage in animals may affect both public health and the environment (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). BRD and mastitis are the two main causes of antimicrobial usage in cattle worldwide, and accounts for the main quantity of antimicrobials used. Respiratory disease is the most common reason for metaphylactic antibiotic therapy in the US. 71% of feedlot cattle receive antimicrobials in feed, and 13.4% are treated with injectable antimicrobials to prevent or treat BRD (

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Reduction of BRD would significantly reduce the total use of antimicrobials in the cattle industry and by that reduce the risk of antimicrobial resistance development.
