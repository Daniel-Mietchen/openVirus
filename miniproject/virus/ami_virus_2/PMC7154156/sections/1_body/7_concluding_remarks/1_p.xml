<p>Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health threat. Growing concerns regarding the environmental impacts of livestock calls for new and innovative measures to prevent endemic diseases, and thereby improve the sustainability of the cattle industry. An alternative strategy to combat BRD is urgently needed. We believe it is both desirable and possible to control BRSV and BCoV, and subsequently reduce BRD, through biosecurity measures. The Norwegian initiative represents a new way of thinking that will likely have wider implications. The ultimate goal is improved animal health, welfare and a reduction in antimicrobial usage in the cattle sector as well as a more effective production.</p>
