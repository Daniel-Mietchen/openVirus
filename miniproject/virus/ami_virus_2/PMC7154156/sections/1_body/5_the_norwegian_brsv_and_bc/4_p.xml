<p>The control program for BRSV and BCoV was initiated by a joint cattle industry and launched in Norway in 2016. The goal of the program is to reduce the occurrence of BRSV and BCoV in the national cattle herd. A key feature is to classify all herds according to BRSV/BCoV antibody status (sero-positive or -negative) and protect animals in both positive and negative herds from infection through herd biosecurity measures. Vaccination or antimicrobial treatment is not included in the implementation plan, and vaccination against BRD is usually not practiced. Knowledge of herd status is assumed to motivate producers to implement the recommended measures for prevention of virus introduction. Furthermore, sero-negative herds who can document specific additional biosecurity measures are eligible for financial incentives.</p>
