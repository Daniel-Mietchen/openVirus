<p>Milk production in Norway is extensive and based on small, mostly family run-farms. The number of dairy herds is around 8,300, with an average herd size of 27 cows in 2018. For members of the Norwegian dairy herd recording system, production data is available to advisors and veterinarians. Many producers rear their own heifers and keep bull-calves for slaughter, which means that young stock and adult cows are often kept in the same or nearby facilities. The number of beef herds is 3,600. These are predominantly suckler-cow herds with an average number of 23 cows, which rear their calves until slaughter (
