<p>In a nationwide study of 134 randomly selected Norwegian dairy herds, Gulliksen et al. (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) found 31.2% of the calves in 71.1% of the herds to be positive for antibodies to BRSV, while the same numbers for BCoV were 39.3% and 80.7%, respectively (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Toftaker et al. (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) found the prevalence of seropositive herds in bulk tank milk to be 46.2% for BRSV and 72.2% for BCoV in two counties in the western part of Norway. Large variations were found in prevalence across the study region, with high risk clusters as well as overall geographic trends. Negative herds were found in close proximity to positive herds (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). About 40% of the herds were positive for antibodies to both viruses, while 22% were negative for both.
