<p>To encourage compliance with the control program, herds can acquire a “Healthy herd status” by fulfilling a set of specific criteria. These criteria include having a sero-negative status for both BRSV and BCoV. In addition, the herd needs a veterinary certificate confirming high external biosecurity through the implementation of a physical barrier sluice. A loading-area for shipment of live animals to and from the herd is also required, to enable the truck driver to access the animals without entering the barn. A “Healthy herd” status is rewarded with an increase of approximately 10% in price when selling young-stock and breeding animals.</p>
