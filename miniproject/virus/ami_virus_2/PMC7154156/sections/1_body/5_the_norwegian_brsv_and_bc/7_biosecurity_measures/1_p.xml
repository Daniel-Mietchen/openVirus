<p>The recommended biosecurity measures aim at protecting herds from introduction of virus via direct (live animals) and indirect (people and fomites) routes. All producers are encouraged to avoid live animal contact between negative and positive herds by purchasing animals or sharing pastures with animals only from sero-negative herds. Live-animal trade is organized by the producer organizations, both for replacement animals and for animals shipped to slaughter. Since the launch of the control-program, separate transport vehicles have been used for animals from negative and positive herds. Farmers are encouraged to build suitable loading areas for shipment of live animals. Furthermore, improved external biosecurity is encouraged by implementing restricted human access into herds. There is a legal requirement to provide sluices where veterinarians, AI technicians, advisors, claw trimmers, service people and others can change to protective clothing and footwear provided by each herd. Advisory support from the program is provided to ensure a feasible design of these sluices. In general, the advice is for the herd to provide clothing and footwear for visitors, washing facilities with cold and hot water and suitable storage areas for equipment.</p>
