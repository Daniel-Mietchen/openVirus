<p>The principle of herd classification in the control program is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Specifically, dairy herd classification is based on serological examination of (1) bulk tank milk, (2) pooled milk samples from first-parity cows, or 3) pooled serum from young stock. If testing of bulk tank milk indicates sero-positivity, producers are encouraged to test pooled milk samples from four first-parity cows. If this yields a positive result, testing of pooled serum from young stock is recommended. Only homebred, unvaccinated animals above 180 days of age (to avoid maternal antibodies) are tested in (2) and (3). If four animals are not available, three and two may be used. Beef herds are tested using young stock only. The system is the same regardless of housing conditions or size.
