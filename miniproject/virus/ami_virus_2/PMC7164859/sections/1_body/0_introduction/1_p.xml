<p id="par0005">Contamination of healthcare professionals (HCPs) during surgery has been known for many years and is well described. Before the laparoscopy era, the source was essentially surgical fumes produced by heat-producing techniques such as electrosurgery (mono- or bipolar), lasers or ultrasound 
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These peroperative risks have been abundantly addressed in the literature, which we need not detail here. Depending on the case, surgical smoke can contain water vapour (95%), inorganic pollutants (CO, CO
 <sub>2</sub>), organic pollutants (hydrocarbons, hydrocyanic acid, aldehydes), and biological pollutants such as cells (some cancerous), bacteria and fragments of viral DNA. Laparoscopy has added a further source of airborne pollution, namely aerosols generated by pneumoperitoneum gas flow. This article specifically concerns the risk of viral contamination during laparoscopy in the setting of the current Covid-9 epidemic. Our purpose here is to analyse the literature data on the viral contamination risk for HCPs by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the Covid-19 epidemic and discuss means of protection and prevention.
