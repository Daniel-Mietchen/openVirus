<p id="par0030">Laparoscopic surgery requires the creation and maintenance of an efficient pneumoperitoneum. There is thus a permanent risk of an aerosol effect through gas leaks or at exsufflation. Moreover, the ultrasonic systems often used do not produce enough heat to deactivate the virus. These concerns are confirmed by a recent experimental study showing that after 10 minutes of laparoscopic dissection by electrosurgery or ultrasound, the concentration of particles measuring 0.3–0.5 μm was higher with laparoscopy than with laparotomy 
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Owing to the low rate of replacement of the pneumoperitoneum gas, leaked aerosol may thus contain high concentrations of suspended viruses 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This suggests that the risk of contamination of HCPs may be greater in laparoscopy than in laparotomy, particularly if accidental gas leakage occurs or exsufflation is poorly controlled. Other authors 
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> have claimed the opposite, arguing that the closed surgical site (relative to laparotomy) lowers the risk of contamination, and that there is no hard evidence yet that the viruses are viable or that they are actually transmitted during laparoscopy.
