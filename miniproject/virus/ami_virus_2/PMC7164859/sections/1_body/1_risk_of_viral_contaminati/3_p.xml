<p id="par0020">There is to our knowledge no large-scale epidemiological study that proves a direct link between a patient's viral load and the contamination of HCPs by emitted surgical smoke. It should also be noted that the published studies have mainly been on surgical smoke from operations on skin or genital lesions. Few studies have evaluated the risk of contamination of HCPs during laparoscopy.</p>
