<p id="par0010">Several viruses have been implicated to different degrees in the contamination of HCPs during surgery: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), bovine papilloma virus and human papilloma virus (HPV). Most of the studies published on the risk of transmission have used in vitro analyses. Several studies have focused on HPV (during the treatment of warts or condylomas) with cases of laryngeal papillomatosis, recognised as an occupational illness in one nurse
