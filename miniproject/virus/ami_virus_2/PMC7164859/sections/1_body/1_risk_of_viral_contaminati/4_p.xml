<p id="par0025">One small-sample study (
 <italic>n</italic>  = 11) analysed the presence of HBV in surgical smoke during conventional and robot-assisted laparoscopies 
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The aerosol from the pneumoperitoneum was trapped in a filter, where the authors found HBV in 10 instances out of 11. This study thus showed the presence of HBV in pneumoperitoneum gas during surgical laparoscopy. The subject matter of this study comes closest to the issue addressed in this article.
