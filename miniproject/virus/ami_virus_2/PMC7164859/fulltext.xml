This article analyses the risks of contamination among healthcare professionals (HCPs) during laparoscopic surgery on patients with Covid-19. Harmful effects of aerosols from a pneumoperitoneum, with the virus present, have not yet been quantified. Measures for the protection of HCPs are an extrapolation of those taken during other epidemics. They must still be mandatory to minimise the risk of viral contamination. Protection measures include personal protection equipment for HCPs, adaptation of surgical technique (method for obtaining pneumoperitoneum, filters, preferred intracorporeal anastomosis, precautions during the exsufflation of the pneumoperitoneum), and organisation of the operating room.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Virus</kwd><kwd>Viral contamination</kwd><kwd>Laparoscopy</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><title>Introduction</title><p id="par0005">Contamination of healthcare professionals (HCPs) during surgery has been known for many years and is well described. Before the laparoscopy era, the source was essentially surgical fumes produced by heat-producing techniques such as electrosurgery (mono- or bipolar), lasers or ultrasound <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These peroperative risks have been abundantly addressed in the literature, which we need not detail here. Depending on the case, surgical smoke can contain water vapour (95%), inorganic pollutants (CO, CO<sub>2</sub>), organic pollutants (hydrocarbons, hydrocyanic acid, aldehydes), and biological pollutants such as cells (some cancerous), bacteria and fragments of viral DNA. Laparoscopy has added a further source of airborne pollution, namely aerosols generated by pneumoperitoneum gas flow. This article specifically concerns the risk of viral contamination during laparoscopy in the setting of the current Covid-9 epidemic. Our purpose here is to analyse the literature data on the viral contamination risk for HCPs by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the Covid-19 epidemic and discuss means of protection and prevention.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><title>Risk of viral contamination during surgical care</title><p id="par0010">Several viruses have been implicated to different degrees in the contamination of HCPs during surgery: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), bovine papilloma virus and human papilloma virus (HPV). Most of the studies published on the risk of transmission have used in vitro analyses. Several studies have focused on HPV (during the treatment of warts or condylomas) with cases of laryngeal papillomatosis, recognised as an occupational illness in one nurse <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In the 2000s, it was difficult for researchers to measure the biological activity of viral DNA in order to assess its infectiousness <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, viable HIVs have been found in cell cultures, especially when aerosol-generating devices are used, although the viability of HIVs is still being debated, and the potential risk of contamination by smoke has not been quantifiable. <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p id="par0015">For both HPV and HIV, most authors conclude, however, that it is preferable to take all necessary precautions against surgical smoke when operating on infected patients.</p><p id="par0020">There is to our knowledge no large-scale epidemiological study that proves a direct link between a patient's viral load and the contamination of HCPs by emitted surgical smoke. It should also be noted that the published studies have mainly been on surgical smoke from operations on skin or genital lesions. Few studies have evaluated the risk of contamination of HCPs during laparoscopy.</p><p id="par0025">One small-sample study (<italic>n</italic>
&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11) analysed the presence of HBV in surgical smoke during conventional and robot-assisted laparoscopies <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The aerosol from the pneumoperitoneum was trapped in a filter, where the authors found HBV in 10 instances out of 11. This study thus showed the presence of HBV in pneumoperitoneum gas during surgical laparoscopy. The subject matter of this study comes closest to the issue addressed in this article.</p></sec><sec id="sec0015"><title>Special features of laparoscopy</title><p id="par0030">Laparoscopic surgery requires the creation and maintenance of an efficient pneumoperitoneum. There is thus a permanent risk of an aerosol effect through gas leaks or at exsufflation. Moreover, the ultrasonic systems often used do not produce enough heat to deactivate the virus. These concerns are confirmed by a recent experimental study showing that after 10&#x000a0;minutes of laparoscopic dissection by electrosurgery or ultrasound, the concentration of particles measuring 0.3&#x02013;0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m was higher with laparoscopy than with laparotomy <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Owing to the low rate of replacement of the pneumoperitoneum gas, leaked aerosol may thus contain high concentrations of suspended viruses <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This suggests that the risk of contamination of HCPs may be greater in laparoscopy than in laparotomy, particularly if accidental gas leakage occurs or exsufflation is poorly controlled. Other authors <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> have claimed the opposite, arguing that the closed surgical site (relative to laparotomy) lowers the risk of contamination, and that there is no hard evidence yet that the viruses are viable or that they are actually transmitted during laparoscopy.</p><p id="par0035">All these studies have focused on HIV and HBV and have shown rather low peritoneal contamination. No study to date has considered SARS-CoV-2. Studies have evaluated contamination risk for similar earlier viruses (Middle East coronavirus MERS CoV) but their results cannot be extrapolated to laparoscopy <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. There is no expert consensus on the actual or extrapolated presence of ambient SARS-CoV-2 in the pneumoperitoneum as factual evidence is lacking <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><title>Properties of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus</title><sec id="sec0025"><title>General</title><p id="par0040">The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the Covid-19 pandemic is an RNA virus 0.06&#x02013;0.14&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m in size. In comparison, the HIV measures 0.12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, the HBV measures 0.04&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, and bacteria about 0.30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m. The RNA of SARS-CoV-2 is very long (30&#x000a0;kb), making it the largest RNA virus known so far, larger than flu and previous SARS viruses <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In infected patients it is found in the oropharynx, the respiratory tract and the whole of the digestive tract. It is not found in urine or cerebrospinal fluid.</p></sec><sec id="sec0030"><title>Ultrastructure</title><p id="par0045">Like other coronaviruses, SRAS-CoV-2 is made up of four proteins <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p id="par0050">Spike (S) protein forms the namesake crown-like protuberances that are essential to attach the virus to the host cell and determine which cells it targets.

Proteins S, E and M together enclose the virus.</p><p id="par0055">Once the virus has penetrated the host cell, its RNA is released, and copies are produced.

PPE is only one component of the protection measures. It must be used by every member of the HCP team according to the World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.
