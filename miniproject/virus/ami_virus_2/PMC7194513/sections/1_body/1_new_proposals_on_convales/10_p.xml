   <p id="par0060">The collection and retention of blood specimens from both donors and recipients (pre- and post- treatment) to permit retrospective determination of the characteristics of an effective product and dosage regimen, as well as the characteristics of patients most likely to benefit from this intervention.</p>

   <label>2)</label>
   <p id="par0065">The collection of convalescent plasma only by apheresis in order to avoid unnecessary loss of red cells in the donor and to optimize the volume of plasma that can be generated for investigational use. Double plasmapheresis technologies and even triple procedures can be applied under continual supervision, if required and donor conditions permit.</p>

   <label>3)</label>
   <p id="par0070">The suitability criteria of COVID19 convalescent plasma prepared from whole blood by component separation and considered for investigational use, if not clinically needed for general patient care. Transfusion of whole blood to provide convalescent plasma as a general rule should be avoided unless use of whole blood is clinically indicated.</p>
