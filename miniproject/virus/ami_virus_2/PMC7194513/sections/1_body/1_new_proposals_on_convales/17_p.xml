<p id="par0125">COVID 19-related pneumonia is mediated by hyper activation of effector T cells and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-1, interferon-gamma, and TNF. This inflammatory process may cause a pathological process that leads to plasma leakage, vascular permeability, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; this reaction, called “cytokine storm” is a life-threatening complication of COVID 19 infection. The immunocompromised status associated with hematological malignancies may enhance the risk of bacterial sepsis and COVID-19 and other viral infections.</p>
