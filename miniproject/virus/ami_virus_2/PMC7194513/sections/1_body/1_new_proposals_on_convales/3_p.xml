An additional bonus to donors is that, in these authorâ€™s experiences, many laboratory hemostatic abnormalities are often seen in critically ill COVID-infected patients, this is considered to be a very important clinical issue, in view of the high incidence of thrombotic events observed in this population, some with a fatal outcome. Repeated targeted plasmapheresis or plasma exchange of selectedCOVID-19 positive individuals would undoubtedly lower their state of hypercoagulability and normalize their hypercoagulability. The recipients of such a derived FFP-product would benefit from the antibodies which could neutralize the viral antigens even at very low concentration if present in the early stage. So, this practice would be a double-edged sword with benefits for both donors and recipients.</p>
