<p id="par0035">In this context, it should be noted that the safety and efficacy of convalescent COVID-19 plasma as a treatment for COVID-19 is yet to be validated. However, even as an experimental therapy, in line with the first principal of all newer bioproducts for transfusion, one needs to be consistent with ethical and legal safeguards (informed consent of donors and patients, institutional approval, special labeling as an investigational product, and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements). Moreover, COVID-19 plasma should be used in the context of an organized research study designed to determine its safety and efficacy in comparison with standard of care or other therapeutic interventions. Even if used empirically it is vital to ensure monitoring of patient outcomes including clinical and laboratory indicators of safety and efficacy to optimized/ maximize the knowledge that might be gained.</p>
