<p id="par0155">In fact, a capture ELISA, with a plate coated with recombinant ACE-2, or its complexes with S-Protein or its S1 subunit, as a specific receptor, could be designed for capturing possible allo- or autoantibodies present in COVID 19 patients, especially those with delayed severe complications. This would allow measurement of the kinetics of these antibodies during the pathological evolution. If present, these antibodies are expected to be alloantibodies, induced by the association of the viral protein. A similar design could be constructed on an affinity column matrix to capture antibodies or antigen as required either in the circulation or from FFP-derived from COVID 19 plasma. Nevertheless, in practice, what we need urgently is not easily matched with what we want.</p>
