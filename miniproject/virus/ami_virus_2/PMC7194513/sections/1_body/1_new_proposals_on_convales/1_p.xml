<p id="par0010">This paper aims to make suggestions for a small step forward in both preventative and therapeutic measures against the Coronavirus disease 2019(COVID 19) pandemic. This targeted strategy consists of using fully recovered COVID 19 Heroes, that is, brave volunteers, as the source of antibodies in plasma collected by plasmapheresis, plasma exchange or substitution therapy for use in those populations in need of antibody. This would include use in critically ill COVID 19 patients and, as a preventative measure, in those at potential risk of infection as no vaccine is yet available. This would be a small step forward, while we are waiting to produce an effective, validated vaccine and witnessing increasing testing and self-isolation which are the two most effective current strategies.</p>
