<p id="par0025">Both the plasmapheresis collection process and plasma exchange are very well accepted clinical procedures in transfusion practice in countries that are equipped with modern mobile apheresis technologies. Such mobile and fully automated tools, using digital technology, will allow this well-established practice to be available for use, by either a nurse or trained phlebotomy technologist who might be able to run 6 donors under the supervision of a trained skilled clinician even in home care sites. Therefore, transfusion of plasma or its derived products containing immunoglobulin from patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19 will be an additional intervention to be used for those who are not able to defend themselves against this pandemic virus, in the absence of the relevant vaccine. While early infection is identified by modern and sensitive RNA based PCR testing, extensive community testing for antibody will be required to find recovered patients who will volunteer to help others by donating plasma. e Meanwhile, the current concept of mass testing by sensitive and reliable PCR methodology, mass tracking and the recently proposed strategy of segregating and isolating the older populations, who are more at risk of getting fatal infections will be perused with rigour, to reduce the current rise in deaths. There is also an increase in fatalities in younger population as this virus does not recognize age or race and individual variability appears to matter as to how an individual responds to viral infection.</p>
