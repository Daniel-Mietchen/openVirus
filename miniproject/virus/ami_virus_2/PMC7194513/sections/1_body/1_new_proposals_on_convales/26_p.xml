<p id="par0170">This project is only one small step forward in an overall, difficult task but it is achievable with due perseverance and hope. The single message to convey to all scientific communities from this note is to “isolate, isolate, isolate” the population at risk or with potential risks of thrombosis and to collect the precious FFP to be used for the population in most need during this pandemic outbreak of coronavirus disease. This approach to both the patients and donors involved could be considered as a double edged sword with benefits to both patients and donors in this pandemic. Specific recommendations for a standardized preparation, and an optimal use of convalescent plasma at a global level are needed for COVID 19 patients. They will be helpful in designing future clinical trials in this area of investigation.</p>
