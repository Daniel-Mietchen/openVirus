<p id="par0030">Conceptually, this therapeutic approach is based on well-established passive immunotherapy and will use u neutralizing anti-COV-2 immunoglobulins, thought to be present in COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Moreover, such a therapeutic intervention can be considered as a true reflection of the precision transfusion concept, consisting of the use of the right product for the right patient in the right time and the right condition, with no risk but added health benefits to donors and recipients alike. We would like to emphasize that these individuals will often be at an elevated risk for thrombosis and VTE, hence an appropriate risk assessment at the same time will be warranted and plasmapheresis donations, with citrated anticoagulant, would enormously help in lowering their existing and or induced-hypercoagulability by COVID -19. Evidence is accumulating that this might occur. In fact, as mentioned above, we believe that hemostatic abnormalities in COVID-19 infected patients are considered to be a very important issue, as these patients experience not only some laboratory abnormalities as well as a high clinical incidence of thrombotic events some of which are fatal.</p>
