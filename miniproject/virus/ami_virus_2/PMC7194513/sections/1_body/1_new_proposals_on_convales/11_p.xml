<p id="par0075">Moreover, from both laboratory and clinical stand points, several other key items should be taken into consideration as critical preparative and therapeutic modalities, embodying: a.] The eligibility of convalescent COVID-19 individuals to donate whole blood or plasma with the following essential requirements; b.] Confirmation of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2 by a record of a validated diagnostic test at the time of illness; c.] An interval of at least 14 days after full recovery; d.] A standard selection criterion for whole blood or plasma donation according to local requirements and standard operational procedures; e.] To avoid the risk of Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) preference should be given to the use of plasma from male donors or from female donors who have never been pregnant including having abortions. This measure is now well-established to dramatically lower the possibility of the presence in plasma of antibodies to HLA or granulocyte antigens that cause TRALI and appear to occur within 6 h after transfusion of the implicated plasma; f.]The assessment of hypercoagulability which is of particular relevance to patients with COVID-19, should be fully assessed.

   <p id="par0080">It is essential that pre-screening and pre-donation testing of convalescent COVID-19 donors’ recovery from COVID-19 infection should be confirmed; a.] Physical examination of the donor to establish good health including the absence of fever and respiratory symptoms; b.] If plasma is collected prior to 28 days after full recovery from illness, then confirmation of the resolution of the infection should be obtained through demonstration of two non-reactive Nucleic Acid Tests (NAT) for SARS-CoV-2 performed at an interval of at least 24 h on nasopharyngeal swabs; c] Viral inactivation of convalescent plasma is encouraged to address residual risks of known transfusion transmissible viruses in an experimental product; d.] The approximate date of COVID-19 infection, history of symptoms, treatments received and date of resolution of all symptoms should be documented and traceable; e.] The total and neutralizing titers of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies determined as part of product characterization before use. Furthermore, donor blood/serum/plasma samples should be saved and frozen at −80 °C for retrospective testing and further scientific investigations.</p>

   <p id="par0085">It is also essential that the main criteria for collection of COVID-19 plasma should be fully documented: a.] Performed in certified blood establishments (or under exceptional circumstances, hospitals and other health care facilities routinely engaged in performing whole blood collection with plasma separation and/or apheresis procedures) by appropriately trained staff; b.] Use only of legally approved blood collection or plasmapheresis equipment under standard operating procedures; c.] Supervision of the collection process by trained staff; d.] Volume of plasma to be collected: at least 200–600 mL (without anticoagulant) based on the procedure and regulatory limits; e.]Plasma units intended for use as convalescent plasma should be clearly labeled. The first plasma donation can be followed by further donations at a frequency compliant with local regulations and taking into account the health status of the donor (in many jurisdictions the interval between apheresis plasma donations of 600 mL or more should not be less than 7 days and that between whole blood donations should be at least eight weeks)</p>

   <p id="par0090">Post-donation treatment of plasma record keeping: a.] Where feasible, pathogen inactivation of plasma using a licensed technology is highly desirable to ensure the current strategies are strictly in place to effectively optimize the current practices that are in use in some European establishments. This is an essential regulatory requirement to control the residual risks of transfusion transmitted infectious diseases and to allay concern about possible superinfections with SARS COV-2. This is a controversial point since pathogen inactivation cannot be performed in all transfusion services, therefore limiting the widespread use of this treatment modality, despite being available in many modern establishments and existing even in some hospitals.</p>
