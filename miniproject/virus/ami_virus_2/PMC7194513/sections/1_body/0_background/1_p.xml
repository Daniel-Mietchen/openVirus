<p id="par0005">In this concise manuscript we are pleased to offer readers some new proposals on the usefulness of of COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP), in both preventative and therapeutics measures, against this pandemic virus. We have brought together in one document some relevant methodological studies, which have been used as support for implementation of CCP in the pandemic. Readers should be aware that in the absence of any randomized controlled data is to be expected that the hidden COVID- related illnesses in millions of patients would continue. In fact, the sheer numbers of individuals afflicted with and dying from COVID-19 present a clear ethical, racial as well as scientific requirement that the health care system seek truth regarding treatments. We can only hope that our new proposal on CCP will be a beneficial treatment, as a preliminary report and might encourage the others to apply these methodologies as the proof of principals. Although bypassing randomized controlled investigation of CCP may be tempting given the sense of urgency a mistake repeated is a decision taken to study first before wide scale implementation risks doing more harm to both patients and the health care system considering the possible harms that untreated CCP might bring about as a long term therapy and it is important the informed consent is in place and serves to remind us in the implementation of the ultimate importance of good scientific methodologies.</p>
