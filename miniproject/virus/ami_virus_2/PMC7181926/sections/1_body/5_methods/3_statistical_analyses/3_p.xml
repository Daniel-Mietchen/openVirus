<p>We considered different statistical models; in the constant model, we assumed that the force of infection λ is constant with age and time. In that case, the seroprevalence of an individual is expected to increase with their age 
 <italic>a</italic>: 
 <italic>Pa</italic> = 1 − exp(−λ.
 <italic>a</italic>). In the epidemic model, we assume that infections occurred during an epidemic. The force of infection was equal to during the epidemic year and 0 at other times. Persons born after the epidemic were therefore all seronegative and older ones had a probability p = 1 − exp(−λ) of being seropositive.
