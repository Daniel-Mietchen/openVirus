<p>In this perspective, we highlight the hidden capability of saliva for the early detection of any viral, bacterial, or systemic disease [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-02225" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the past, saliva was proven to be an ideal role for the isolation of proteins, peptides, and sheds of viruses via many molecular assays [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-02225" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The composition of saliva is very informative for analysis or to compare the physiology or pathology of the human body. Currently, salivary biomarkers are helping in the detection of oral cancer, dental caries, periodontal diseases, diabetes, breast cancer, and lung cancer [

 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-02225" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In this study, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to investigate the load of SARS-CoV in the saliva samples. Samples of saliva from 17 patients were confirmed to have lymphopenia, elevated levels of creatine kinase, and thrombocytopenia. On 9 January 2020, WHO published guidelines for the detection of 2019-nCoV using respiratory materials (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab in ambulatory patients and sputum (if produced) and endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage in patients with more severe respiratory disease) and serum for serological testing (

Testing at these sites is painful, uncomfortable, and invasive for the patients, but there is strong evidence for its use in detecting the virusâ€™s presence. A recent paper reported only one case as part of a diagnostic evaluation of sputum from a 2019-nCoV patient, and it was a lower respiratory tract sample [
