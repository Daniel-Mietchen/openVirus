<p>Further investigation should investigate the diagnostic capability of human saliva for identifying COVID-2019, SARS-COV, MERS, ZIKV, and other viruses in the home, city, airport immigration counter or check-in, hospitals, and busy clinics in a few seconds with the cost-effective point-of-care (POC) technology. Saliva collection is quite comfortable for patients as well as being easy, cheap, and non-invasive with minimal equipment required. It should also minimize the nosocomial transmission of 2019-nCoV to healthcare workers. Right now, in this controllable pandemic situation, all research centers, health agencies, and health care providers must explore the diagnostics opportunity and rapidly develop automated molecular point-of-care assays. This write-up will help epidemiologists, virologists, and clinicians to understand the importance of saliva in diagnostic testing as well as the transmission of the disease. </p>
