<p>Extrapulmonary pathologic manifestations of measles particularly those in the skin and lymph nodes are well known. Here we turn attention to the pneumonitis caused by the measles virus. Changes in the lung include peribronchial and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrates, squamous metaplasia of bronchial epithelium, proliferation of Type II pneumocytes, and formation of hyaline membranes, the latter changes indicative of diffuse alveolar damage. Complicated cases may evolve into abscess formation and empyema. The prototypical pulmonary change however is the development of multinucleated giant cells with characteristic nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">8.3</xref>). These cells, which have also been reported in various lymphoreticular tissues throughout the body, are typically large and contain from a few nuclei to too numerous to count. Absence of such multinucleated giant cells in the lung may occur and should not be regarded as exclusionary evidence of measles pneumonia. Conversely, the presence of such multinucleated giant cells is not diagnostic of measles pneumonia. A giant cell pneumonia-like picture may be seen in a variety of granulomatous disorders, but more importantly giant cell pneumonia can be a manifestation of other viral pneumonias. These include cases of giant cell pneumonia secondary to respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, and the Nipah viruses, the latter less likely since it is not known to occur in Europe or the United States. Viral inclusions are also found in pneumonia due to herpes simplex, herpes zoster and adenovirus, and other viral infections but are morphologically different and generally do not represent a diagnostic problem (Zaki and Paddock
