<p>Measles virus most closely resembles the rinderpest virus – a recently eradicated pathogen of cattle – and probably evolved from an ancestral virus as a zoonotic infection in communities in which cattle and humans lived in close proximity (Moss and Griffin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>). Measles virus is a spherical, enveloped, with a non-segmented, negative-strand RNA genome (Moss and Griffin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">8.1</xref>). The genome contains six genes that encode eight proteins that can be divided in two main types: envelope-associated and ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-associated proteins.
