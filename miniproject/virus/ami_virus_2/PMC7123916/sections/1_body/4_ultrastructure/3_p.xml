<p>The envelope is made up of a matrix protein, a hemagglutinin protein, and a fusion protein. The attachment of the virions to the host cell is mediated by the hemagglutinin protein; following this process, the fusion and hemagglutinin proteins mediate entry into the host cell. The known measles virus receptors on human cells are the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) CD1506 and the membrane cofactor protein CD46, a regulator of complement activation that plays an important part in protecting host cells from spontaneous complement attack (Yanagi et al.
