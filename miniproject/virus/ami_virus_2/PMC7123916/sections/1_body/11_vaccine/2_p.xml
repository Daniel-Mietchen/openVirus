<p>To prevent measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends a 2-dose vaccine schedule in childhood, with the first dose administered at age 12–15 months and the second dose at age 4–6 years (Am Acad of Ped

If simultaneous administration is not possible, MMRV vaccine may be administered at any time before or after an inactivated vaccine but at least 28 days before or after another live, attenuated vaccine, except varicella vaccine, for which a minimum interval of 3 months is recommended. Live attenuated virus vaccines are contraindicated in patients with altered immunity (i.e., blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system); primary or acquired immunodeficiency including HIV infections/AIDS, cellular immune deficiencies, hypogammaglobulinemia, and dysgammaglobulinemia; family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiencies, unless the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient has been demonstrated; systemic immunosuppressive therapy, including oral steroids ≥2 mg/kg of body weight or ≥20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent for persons who weigh &gt;10 kg, when administered for ≥2 weeks; and pregnancy (MMWR
