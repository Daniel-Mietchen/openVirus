<p>Measles, like polio and smallpox, has no host except man; therefore, eradication of measles is possible if all those who are susceptible to measles are immunized (Zaki and Paddock 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>). Measles virus was first isolated in tissue culture in 1954 (Edmonston strain). Since 1963 a killed virus vaccine (Edmonston A) and a live attenuated vaccine (Edmonston B) were introduced for use globally (Markowitz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1990</xref>). The killed vaccine was not used after 1967 because of its incomplete protection (MMWR 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>). Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963, there were approximately three to four million US cases annually, and an estimated 90 % of the population had the disease by age 15. Measles vaccination is one of the most cost-effective health interventions ever developed (Perry and Halsey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>). Thanks to the use of measles vaccine, measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, although sporadic cases continue to occur owing to importation (Enders et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1959</xref>). The current live, further attenuated vaccines in use in the United States have shown protection for properly immunized children between 91 % and 99 %.
