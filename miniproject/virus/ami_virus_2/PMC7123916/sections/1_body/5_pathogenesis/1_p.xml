<p>Infected persons transmit MV via respiratory droplets delivering infectious virus to epithelial cells of the respiratory tract of susceptible hosts. During the incubation period MV replicates and spreads in the infected host. Type 1 pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages, and respiratory epithelial cells become infected but is yet unknown which is the initial site of viral replication. The virus then spreads to local lymphatic tissue, and this replication is followed by viremia and dissemination to many organs, including the lymph nodes, skin, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and liver, in which the virus replicates in the epithelial and endothelial cells and in lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages (Griffin
