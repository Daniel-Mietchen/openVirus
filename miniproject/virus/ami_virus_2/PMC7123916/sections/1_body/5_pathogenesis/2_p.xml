<p>MV infection results in immunosuppression with depressed responses to non-MV antigens. This effect lasts for several weeks to months after resolution of the acute illness. Patients with measles showed suppressed delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to recall antigens, such as tuberculin, and impaired cellular and humoral responses to new antigens. This MV-induced immune suppression renders individuals more susceptible to secondary bacterial and viral infections that can cause pneumonia and diarrhea and is responsible for much of the measles-related morbidity and mortality (Moss and Griffin

The production of IL-12 is reduced while the production of IL-10, which inhibits DTH responses and downregulates the synthesis of cytokines and suppresses macrophage activation and T-cell proliferation, is elevated for several weeks in the plasma of children with measles (Yanagi et al.
