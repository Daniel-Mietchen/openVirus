<p>Detection of measles-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) in serum is the standard test for the rapid laboratory diagnosis of measles. IgM testing is most commonly performed using commercial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) kits (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007</xref>). A number of commercially available IgM assays for measles use the indirect format. This format requires the blockage of IgG antibodies and rheumatoid factor through a pretreatment step to ensure optimal performance. IgM assays based on the capture format have been developed for measles (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2007</xref>; Moss and Griffin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2012</xref>). These assays do not require the removal of IgG antibodies and are considered to be slightly more specific and technically easier to perform than the indirect EIAs for detection of IgM antibodies.
