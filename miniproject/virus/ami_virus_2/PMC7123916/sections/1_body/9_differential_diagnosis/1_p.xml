<p>Most often, the diagnosis of measles can be made without difficulty on clinical grounds. Viral infections and other conditions causing cutaneous rash (rubella, dengue fever, drug reactions) should be considered in cases with atypical symptomatology. Histologically, giant cells with multinucleation in the setting of an interstitial pneumonitis are a helpful indicator, but other viral pathogens (respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, and the henipah viruses) may also be associated with multinucleated giant cells. Immunohistochemical studies in these cases are useful in highlighting viral antigens and pointing to specific etiologies. Laboratory tests as outlined above (see diagnosis) are helpful diagnostic tools.</p>
