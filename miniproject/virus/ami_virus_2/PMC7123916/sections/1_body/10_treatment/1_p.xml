<p>There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles. Treatment with vitamin A has resulted in a reduction in morbidity and mortality in children with measles. The WHO recommends administration of once daily doses of 200,000 IU of vitamin A for 2 consecutive days to all children aged 12 months or older who have measles. Lower doses are recommended for younger children: 100,000 IU per day for children aged 6–12 months and 50,000 IU per day for children younger than 6 months. In children with clinical evidence of vitamin A deficiency, a third dose is recommended 2–4 weeks later (Moss and Griffin
