<p>Measles infection is known to suppress skin test responsiveness to purified tuberculin antigen. There may be a higher rate of activation of pulmonary tuberculosis in populations of individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis who are then exposed to measles (Griffin

These are acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE), and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE); the last two are invariably fatal. ADEM develops a week after the appearance of the rash and is seen in 1:100 infected children. Approximately 15 % of patients with ADEM die, and 20â€“40 % suffer long-term sequelae, including mental retardation, motor disabilities, and deafness. MIBE is seen in immunocompromised patients between 2 and 6 months after acute infection or vaccination. SSPE is caused by a persistent measles virus infection and develops years after the initial infection (Rima and Duprex
