<p>Complications of measles are largely attributable to the pathogenic effects of the virus on the respiratory tract and immune system (Axton

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>; Perry and Halsey 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2004</xref>). Pneumonia is a severe complication of measles and as noted accounts for most measles-associated deaths. In studies of unselected hospitalized children with measles, 55 % had radiographic changes of bronchopneumonia, consolidation, or other infiltrates; 77 % of children with severe disease and 41 % of children with mild disease had radiographic changes. In recent years, pneumonia was present in 9 % of children &lt;5 years old with measles in the United States, in 0–8 % of cases during outbreaks, and in 49–57 % of adults.
