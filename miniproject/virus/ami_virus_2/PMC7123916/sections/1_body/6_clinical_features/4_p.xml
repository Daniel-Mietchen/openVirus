<p>Pneumonia may be caused by the measles virus alone, secondary viral infection with adenovirus or HSV, or secondary bacterial infection. Measles is one cause of Hecht’s giant cell pneumonia, which usually occurs in immunocompromised persons but can occur in otherwise normal adults and children. Studies that included culture of blood, lung punctures, or tracheal aspirations revealed bacteria as the cause of 25–35 % of measles-associated pneumonia. 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> were the most commonly isolated organisms. Other bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas species, 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>) are less common causes of severe pneumonia associated with measles. In studies of young adult military recruits with pneumonia associated with measles, 
 <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> was a probable cause in some cases (Perry and Halsey
