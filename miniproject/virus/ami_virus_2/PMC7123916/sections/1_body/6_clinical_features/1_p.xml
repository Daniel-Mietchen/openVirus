<p>After an incubation period of 10–14 days, prodromal measles begins with fever of 39–40 C, cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">8.2</xref>). The initial presentation resembles a cold except that fever is an early sign. These symptoms worsen over a 2- to 4-day period; sneezing, rhinitis, and congestion are common. The cough is frequently troublesome and often has a brassy quality, suggesting laryngeal and tracheal involvement. If the mucous membranes lining the cheeks opposite the molar teeth are examined, there will be found in the majority of patients a few white to bluish-gray spots the size of a pinhead with red margins. These are known as Koplik’s spots and are a pathognomonic exanthem of measles.
