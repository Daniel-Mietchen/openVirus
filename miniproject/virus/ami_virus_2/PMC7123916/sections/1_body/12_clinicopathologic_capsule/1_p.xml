<p>A highly contagious disease, measles is typically a disease of children. Despite the availability of effective live vaccines, the disease is still responsible for 4 % of diseases in children younger than 5 years of age worldwide. The virus is transmitted via respiratory droplets delivering infectious particles to epithelial cells of the respiratory tract of susceptible nests. Pneumonia is a major complication, characterized in part by the presence of multinucleated giant cells. The differential diagnosis includes giant cell pneumonia due to parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus among others. An effective vaccine is available and was helpful to declare measles elimination in the United States in 2000. However, sporadic cases continue to occur owing to failure to seek vaccination in selected population groups.</p>
