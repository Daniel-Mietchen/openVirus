<p id="p0055">Fomites are recognised to be key vehicles for the spread of other infectious human viruses (e.g. noroviruses) during outbreaks [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Data from SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses suggest that they remain viable in the environment on a range of surfaces for several hours and up to several days (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). The survival time of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and plastic is in the order of days, which suggests that waste materials originating from households and quarantine facilities with positive or suspected COVID-19 patients may contain viable SARS-CoV-2 and could be a source of infection. In the initial stages of this outbreak, waste collection procedures had not been revised to address the potential threat of COVID-19 in the broader community. Effectively, waste from infectee households and quarantine facilities would meet the definition of clinical waste. For instance, the Australian Standard AS 3816:2018 defines clinical waste as 
 <italic>“any waste that has the potential to cause injury, infection, or offence, arising but not limited to medical, dental, podiatry, health care services and so forth</italic>”. In other words, strict infection control and hygiene standards are required when collecting waste materials from affected households and quarantine facilities.
