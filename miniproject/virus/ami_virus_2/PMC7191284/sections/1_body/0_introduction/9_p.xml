<p id="p0050">A preliminary report from the WHO indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via droplets and contaminated objects during close unprotected contact between an infector and infectee [
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Data to date suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious, with early reports from China indicating that the virus spread rapidly and sustainably throughout some affected communities [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Alarming infection incidents among health care workers, cruise-ship and airplane passengers also point to the likelihood of additional transmission mechanisms in confined spaces with dense populations. Several alternative transmission routes are possible but their validity in this context is yet to be determined [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Possibilities include transmission via inanimate/environmental surfaces (fomites), aerosols and the faecal-oral route [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. All three are likely to be important in specific circumstances [
