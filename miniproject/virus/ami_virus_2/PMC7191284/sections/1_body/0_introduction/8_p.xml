<p id="p0045">The transmission behaviour of SARS-CoV-2 also has important implications for waste and wastewater services. SARS-CoV-2 specifically targets host cells containing ACE2 proteins. ACE2 is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines. After infecting and exhausting all resources in the host cell to multiply, the viruses leave the cell in a process known as shedding. Data from clinical and virological studies provide evidence that shedding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is most significant early in the course of the disease, immediately before and within a few days since onset of symptoms [
