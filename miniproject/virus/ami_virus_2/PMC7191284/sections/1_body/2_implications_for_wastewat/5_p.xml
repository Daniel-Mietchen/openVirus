<p id="p0090">With careful selection of sampling points along a sewer network, wastewater ‘analysis’ can be used to obtain information pertaining to select populations of varying size, e.g. from a particular quarantine facility, hospital, or local government area, or up to hundreds of thousands of people from a larger catchment area. In the case of SAR-CoV-2 the monitoring technique is based on analytical genomic approaches similar to those used clinically to diagnose suspected COVID-19 patients. This may also be augmented with additional analytical steps to provide a quantitative measure of the targeted viral RNA concentration [

With further development and using well-designed sampling campaigns with suitable spatio-temporal resolution, wastewater monitoring could well become a useful tool to monitor and assess the incidence of COVID-19 disease within populations to inform related public health policy.
