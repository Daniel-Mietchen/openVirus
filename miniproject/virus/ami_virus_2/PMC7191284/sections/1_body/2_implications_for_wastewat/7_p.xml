Although current waste and wastewater management practices such as hospital waste separation and incineration, multi-barrier wastewater treatment and disinfection, and PPE protocols have already been designed to mitigate infectious disease exposure risks for workers and the public, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented and rapid change. Most businesses and services were under-prepared for this pandemic. Widespread community infection and quarantining can have major impacts on essential services such as waste and wastewater management, and the potential vulnerabilities in the provision of these services are now more apparent than ever before.
