<p id="p0095">True quantitative assessment of community SARS-CoV-2 infection would be extremely challenging due to the large number of factors involved and the unknown variability in these factors (e.g. large variability in SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding rates between people and also within people at different stages of infection, unknown persistence of viral RNA in wastewater, variable flow conditions in sewer systems) [

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. These difficulties, however, do not preclude the usefulness of wastewater monitoring as a semi-quantitative early detection system for SARS-CoV-2 re-emergence (or at worst presence/absence) and potentially also as an ongoing tool for informing jurisdictional policy responses to COVID-19 management. For example, routine wastewater testing could be used to inform when to relax restrictions on population movement or re-open commerce. Having such information available in real-time to inform policy setting would have substantial economic value given the daily cost of COVID-19-related lockdowns. For example, the daily cost of strict economy-wide lockdown in the United States has been estimated at some US$11.5 billion [

The challenge thus becomes to design a widely-accepted surveillance system to detect the potential community presence of COVID-19 and for various end users – from public health officials to facility operators – to be able to use these insights in their decision-making. This would include an ability to evaluate the effectiveness of different control measures to suppress COVID-19 such as social distancing and city-wide lock down.
