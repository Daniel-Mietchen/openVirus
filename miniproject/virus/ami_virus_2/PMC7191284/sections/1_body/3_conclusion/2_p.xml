<p id="p0105">In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this article shows that significant research is needed to assess the 
 <italic>status quo</italic> for pandemic preparedness and response in the waste and wastewater sectors. We need to open up the discussion around potential changes to practice, such as for the collection and handling of waste materials from households and quarantine facilities with positive or suspected COVID-19 patients. Current mitigation practices such as the use of withholding times may do much to reduce the risks to workers handling solid wastes, but additional revisions to procedures may be required and should be considered. There is also a pressing need for data on SARS-CoV-2 prevalence and persistence in wastewater in order to better understand related transmission pathways and to inform appropriate risk management actions for the wastewater sector. Further research into possible aerosol transmission of COVID-19 is also warranted, as lessons from previous outbreaks including SARS-CoV indicated that this pathway was a factor in disease spread. Finally, the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater provides an ideal opportunity to revisit its merits as a data source. Although individual privacy considerations and a need to ensure data security can be a challenge, given the scale, human toll, and financial impact of COVID-19, this research should proceed with urgency.
