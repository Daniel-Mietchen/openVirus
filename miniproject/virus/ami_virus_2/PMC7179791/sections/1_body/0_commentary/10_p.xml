<p id="Par23">SRH and rights is a significant public health issue during outbreaks and it should be a priority. As this pandemic is still evolving, it is urgent for the scientific community to generate solid clinical, epidemiological, and psycho-social behavioral links between COVID-19 and SRH and rights outcomes. In particular, there is a strong need for timely planning and actions for epidemiological research and surveillance of the key vulnerable groups of women and adolescents, and to assess the immediate, medium and long-term effects on their SRH. Perhaps more importantly, we need to solidify operational strategies and actions to protect SRH and rights of women, young people, and vulnerable populations during the epidemic. This requires not only the scientists and physicians, but also policy-makers, community organizations, and international agencies, to work in coordination, trust, and solidarity.</p>
