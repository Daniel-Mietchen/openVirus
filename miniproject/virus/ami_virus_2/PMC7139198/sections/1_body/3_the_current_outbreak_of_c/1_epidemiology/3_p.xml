<p id="Par21">New evidence shows the relation between SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs that are circulating in bats, specifically in 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bats [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These subspecies are abundant in southern China and Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. The mode of transmission to humans is still unclear. Bats are rare in Chinese markets; however, they are captured and sold directly to restaurants as food. The most recent hypothesis is that there is an intermediate animal host that has played a role in the new SARS-CoV-2 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Several animals have been considered as possible hosts, including pangolins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Identifying the animal source of this new virus would help to prevent other new infections and to understand the initial dynamics of spreading in the Wuhan market. In this regard, strengthening the control of food and hygiene within live animal markets is essential to prevent future new zoonosis [
