<p id="Par22">The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet known. The key to human transmission is the ability of the virus to bind to human cells: CoVs use the spike protein to bind to cells, and it seems that SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-Co virus, uses the same receptor for the conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) [

A recent study showed that the binding affinity between the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the host receptor ACE2, in the initial viral attachment step, determines the host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The greater transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV is partly explained by the fact that, due to a higher affinity, the binding capacity of viral RBD increases and the number of viruses required to infect a cell is reduced [
