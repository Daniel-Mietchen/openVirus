Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">In December 2019, some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically related to a new coronavirus in the province of Hubei, China. Subsequently, there has been an increase in infections attributable to this virus throughout China and worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially named the infection coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus has been classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2Â (SARS-CoV-2). This appears to be a virus from <i>Rhinolophus</i> bats, but the intermediate host has not yet been identified. The mechanism of infection of SARS-CoV-2 is not yet known; it appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates. The interhuman transmission of coronaviruses mainly occurs through saliva droplets and direct and indirect contact via surfaces. As of March 10, 2020, the number of cases worldwide was 113,702. Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities. To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19. Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection implies strategies that limit the spread of the virus. WHO and other international and national bodies have developed continuously updated strategic objectives and provisions to contain the spread of the virus and infection.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Background</div> <p id="Par3">Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a large family of respiratory viruses that can cause mild to moderate diseases, ranging from the common cold to severe respiratory syndromes [<a href="#CR1">1</a>].</p> <p id="Par4">These viruses are common in many animal species, and, in some cases, albeit rarely, they can evolve and infect humans and then spread to the population [<a href="#CR2">2</a>].</p> <p id="Par5">Most of the numerous human pathogenic coronaviruses are associated with mild clinical symptoms, with two notable exceptions: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). SARS is caused by a virus that emerged in southern China in November 2002 and led to &amp;gt; 8000 human infections and 774 deaths in 37 countries in the 2002â€"2003 period [<a href="#CR3">3</a>]; MERS is related to a virus detected for the first time in Saudi Arabia in 2012, responsible for 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection and 858 deaths since September 2012 [<a href="#CR4">4</a>].</p> <p id="Par6">In December 2019, some cases of viral pneumonia were epidemiologically linked to a new coronavirus in the province of Hubei in China. In the following days a possible association with the Huanan fish market in Wuhan was identified. In fact, most of the initially identified patients had visited, worked at or lived near this market in the month preceding the infection. In early January, a new coronavirus, tentatively called 2019-nCoV, was isolated, and interhuman transmission was confirmed [<a href="#CR5">5</a>].</p> <p id="Par7">On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the new coronavirus 2019 infection Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) [<a href="#CR6">6</a>]. Subsequently the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Taxonomy Committee of Viruses (ICTV) officially classified the virus as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2Â (SARS-CoV-2) [<a href="#CR7">7</a>].

SARS and MERS: Epidemiology and Clinical Characteristics</div> <p id="Par14">In the past 20 years, two major human CoV epidemics have occurred: SARS and MERS. Both viruses infect the lower airways and cause severe respiratory syndromes in humans. Other CoVs have a global distribution with a seasonality characterized by a peak in winter and in spring and few cases in summer [<a href="#CR10">10</a>].</p> <p id="Par15">The SARS epidemic began in 2002, starting from the town of Foshan in the Chinese province of Guangdong, and then spread globally, involving 33 countries in 5 different continents. More than 8000 cases were recognized (21% in health workers) with a case fatality rate (CFR) of almost 10% [<a href="#CR3">3</a>] and a basic reproduction number (<i>R</i><sub>0</sub>) equal to 2â€"3 [<a href="#CR12">12</a>].</p> <p id="Par16">In humans, the incubation period ranges between 2 and 10Â days, and interhuman transmission is very effective, which is why the delay of 3Â months between the beginning of the epidemic and the first investigations has allowed a worldwide spread of the virus. The bat was identified as the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and the civet as the intermediate host [<a href="#CR13">13</a>]. Despite active surveillance, no more SARS cases have been recognized since July 2003 [<a href="#CR3">3</a>].</p> <p id="Par17">MERS was first identified in 2012. From then until January 16, 2020, 2521 cases were reported worldwide. These include 919 deaths, with a CFR of 36% [<a href="#CR4">4</a>] and an estimated <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> of 0.7 [<a href="#CR12">12</a>]. Most cases were found in the Arabian Peninsula and approximately 84% in Saudi Arabia [<a href="#CR4">4</a>]. However, the virus was isolated in 27 countries [<a href="#CR10">10</a>], and all patients outside the Arabian Peninsula had a travel history to or a contact with someone who had traveled to this region [<a href="#CR4">4</a>]. In humans, the incubation period ranges between 2 and 14Â days, and, unlike SARS, interhuman transmission is limited. The virus is not easily transmitted from person to person, unless a close contact occurs. The bat was also identified as an animal reservoir for the MERS-CoV, while the intermediate host was the camel [<a href="#CR13">13</a>].</p> <p id="Par18">Both SARS and MERS have a broad spectrum of clinical pictures ranging from flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Age and comorbidities are prognostic predictors. SARS mainly involved healthy young adults while half of MERS cases were identified in subjectsâ€‰&amp;gt;â€‰50Â years of age. The clinical picture at hospital admission is characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea and myalgia in both SARS and MERS. Atypical symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting are common in both syndromes [<a href="#CR10">10</a>].</p> </div> </div> <div class="thecurrentoutbreakofcovid-19" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
The Current Outbreak of Covid-19</div> <div class="epidemiology" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Epidemiology</div> <p id="Par19">On December 31, 2019, the WHO Chinese Office was informed about some cases of pneumonia of unknown origin in the city of Wuhan, located in the Chinese province of Hubei [<a href="#CR14">14</a>].</p> <p id="Par20">On January 3, 2020, a new coronavirus was isolated from the bronchial wash samples of a patient from Wuhan and was identified as the pathogen responsible for pneumonia [<a href="#CR15">15</a>]. On January 11 and 12, 2020, the WHO received further details and information from the Chinese National Health Commission regarding the possible association of this epidemic with exposure in a fish market in Wuhan, and the Chinese authorities shared the genetic sequence of a new coronavirus, subsequently identified as SARS-CoV-2 [<a href="#CR14">14</a>].</p> <p id="Par21">New evidence shows the relation between SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs that are circulating in bats, specifically in <i>Rhinolophus</i> bats [<a href="#CR16">16</a>]. These subspecies are abundant in southern China and Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. The mode of transmission to humans is still unclear. Bats are rare in Chinese markets; however, they are captured and sold directly to restaurants as food. The most recent hypothesis is that there is an intermediate animal host that has played a role in the new SARS-CoV-2 infection [<a href="#CR6">6</a>]. Several animals have been considered as possible hosts, including pangolins [<a href="#CR17">17</a>]. Identifying the animal source of this new virus would help to prevent other new infections and to understand the initial dynamics of spreading in the Wuhan market. In this regard, strengthening the control of food and hygiene within live animal markets is essential to prevent future new zoonosis [<a href="#CR6">6</a>].</p> <p id="Par22">The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet known. The key to human transmission is the ability of the virus to bind to human cells: CoVs use the spike protein to bind to cells, and it seems that SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-Co virus, uses the same receptor for the conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) [<a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR13">13</a>]. A recent study showed that the binding affinity between the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the host receptor ACE2, in the initial viral attachment step, determines the host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The greater transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV is partly explained by the fact that, due to a higher affinity, the binding capacity of viral RBD increases and the number of viruses required to infect a cell is reduced [<a href="#CR18">18</a>]. SARS-CoV-2 appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates, causing radiologic evidence of pneumonia in patients without any particular clinical symptoms [<a href="#CR19">19</a>].</p> <p id="Par23">Usually, the interhuman transmission of CoVs occurs through different pathways that include droplets, direct contact and indirect contact through surfaces [<a href="#CR13">13</a>]. The virus has also been isolated in serum, blood, rectal swabs, saliva, urine and stool [<a href="#CR18">18</a>]. Fecal-oral transmission has not yet been proven [<a href="#CR20">20</a>, <a href="#CR21">21</a>].</p> <p id="Par25">A recent study indicates that the highest viral load is found immediately after the onset of symptoms and in greater quantities in the nose rather than in the throat. This analysis suggests that the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus resembles that of influenza more than that of SARS. The viral load found in asymptomatic subjects was similar to that of symptomatic ones; this suggests the potential transmission role of asymptomatic subjects [<a href="#CR22">22</a>].</p> <p id="Par26">Despite several uncertainties, the evidence indicates that the CFR for hospitalized COVID-19 patients is substantially lower than that for hospitalized SARS, MERS and 2009 pandemic flu H1N1 patients (4%, 28%, 65% and 9%, respectively). Taking into account COVID-19 and influenza (pandemic and seasonal), it is important to carefully consider the differences in definition of cases, as these are relevant for CFR estimation [<a href="#CR18">18</a>].</p> <p id="Par27">The <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> has been estimated between 2 and 3 [<a href="#CR18">18</a>], and the risk assessment calculated by WHO is very high for the whole world [<a href="#CR23">23</a>].</p> <p id="Par28">As of March 10, 2020, there were 113,702 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the world, with 4125 new cases in the last 24Â h.

Public Health Impact</div> <p id="Par63">The advent of COVID-19 is unquestionably reminiscent of previous SARS and MERS epidemics. The increase in the number of cases and expansion of geographical areas have revealed issues regarding the future management of the infection: on March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic [<a href="#CR41">41</a>].</p> <p id="Par64">At the beginning, efforts were made by the Chinese government to limit the spread of the virus, such as suspension of public transport, closure of airports [<a href="#CR42">42</a>], cancellation of the Lunar New Year celebrations and closure of parks and cinemas. A ban on the wild animal trade within China was declared on January 26, 2020 [<a href="#CR12">12</a>]. As the number of cases increased, more drastic containment measures were applied in China up to the suspension of all non-essential activities. These measures appear to have slowed the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections in China, as can be seen from the progressive decrease in incidence in Wuhan [<a href="#CR23">23</a>].</p> <p id="Par65">Since the beginning, the WHO and the Emergency Committee under International Health Regulations have stressed China's need to strengthen screening of exits from affected areas. In general, evidence in the peer-reviewed literature does not support entry screening as an effective measure for detecting infected travelers, especially when symptoms of the disease are very common/aspecific and the seasonal flu activity in Europe and China is ongoing. However, some imported cases of COVID-19 in Asian countries have been detected through entry screening procedures at the destination airports [<a href="#CR12">12</a>].</p> <p id="Par66">One of the screening methods for COVID-19 is the measurement of body temperature, although current evidence shows that this method is not effective in controlling disease transmission [<a href="#CR18">18</a>].</p> <p id="Par67">As of March 10, 2020, WHO believes that restrictive measures for travelers and the exchange of goods must be proportional to the risk to public health, with the minimum duration possible and daily updates accordingly on the available epidemiology [<a href="#CR43">43</a>].</p> <p id="Par68">Currently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has increased the level of traveler health alert and recommends avoiding non-essential travel [<a href="#CR44">44</a>]. Other countries are considering implementing restrictions for people traveling from and to the most affected countries.</p> <p id="Par69">Since the beginning of the pandemic, the WHO has developed a strategy and response plan to contain the impact of COVID-19. The main points included in this plan are related to blocking the chain of transmission (working on patients as well as close contacts), identifying and reducing transmission from animal sources, developing correct and scientifically sound risk communication and controlling the social and economic impact of the pandemic as much as possible to minimize it through multisectoral partnerships [<a href="#CR6">6</a>].</p> <p id="Par70">The ECDC, taking into account the evolving epidemiologic situation, considers five possible scenarios (from 0 to 4).

The WHO recommends hand washing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based solutions [<a href="#CR45">45</a>].</p> <p id="Par73">The use of surgical face masks can reduce the risk of infection transmission; masks should be used by subjects with respiratory symptoms. There is no evidence of the usefulness of face masks by healthy subjects; besides, their use can be related to an increased risk due to a false sense of safety [<a href="#CR18">18</a>].</p> <p id="Par74">Isolation of symptomatic subjects can be considered to reduce transmission; patients (suspected or confirmed) should be asked to wear a surgical mask to reduce the spread of respiratory droplets, considered the most likely route of transmission [<a href="#CR18">18</a>].</p> <p id="Par75">Currently, many countries are considering or have already implemented relevant social measures such as school closures, smart working and cancelling meetings, sports and cultural events. Social distancing is essential. It implies avoiding shaking hands and kissing, use of public and crowded means of transportation, and gatherings of people [<a href="#CR18">18</a>].</p> <p id="Par76">Strict compliance with all these measures is essential to lower the spread of infection to gain time to identify adequate therapeutic options and to design and hopefully develop a vaccine [<a href="#CR18">18</a>].</p> <p id="Par77">Italy is now the second country in the world in terms of case numbers [<a href="#CR23">23</a>]. The first cases occurred in some areas of Lombardy and the Veneto regions and then spread all over the country. As of March 9, 2020, considering that new cases of COVID-19 registered in Italy had started to increase considerably and national restrictive measures had not yet been put in place, the Council of Ministers issued a decree law with measures to prohibit access to and exit from the country as well as suspension of all the activities that were not strictly necessary [<a href="#CR46">46</a>, <a href="#CR47">47</a>].</p> <p id="Par78">The current Italian situation confirms that a local outbreak, once started, can quickly spread and have a huge impact on the most vulnerable citizens, mainly elderly subjects with comorbidities [<a href="#CR18">18</a>]. Although to date no SARS-CoV-2 bloodborne transmission has been documented, the National Blood Center of the National Institute of Health (ISS) has activated precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 from blood donors [<a href="#CR48">48</a>].</p> <p id="Par79">ECDC reports that, as of March 2, 2020, the risk of COVID-19 infection in Europe is currently moderate to high and can change. It should be considered that the transmission chain has not always been identified and that the epidemiologic situation is constantly evolving [<a href="#CR18">18</a>].</p> </div> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="Par80">The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus represents a global health emergency involving the health authorities of all countries, especially since the pandemic state was declared.</p> <p id="Par81">Many aspects of the infection have been studied. Available epidemiologic, clinical and impact data have made it possible to outline preventive interventions that have been shared internationally. Unfortunately, the spread of the virus is ongoing, and the impact of the infection is still growing, despite the application of preventive interventions, which in some contexts are very restrictive. The impact of the infection is evident not only from a clinical but also from an economic point of view.</p> <p id="Par82">The considerable cost in terms of infected/dead health workers, who operate on the front line and, as such, are particularly exposed to the risk of infection, should not be underestimated [<a href="#CR25">25</a>].</p> <p id="Par83">Strict observance of the rules issued by the WHO and the other international bodies (e.g., CDC, ECDC, etc.) is essential, as we need to understand the dynamics of virus spread in more detail, identify new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and develop a vaccine reasonably quickly. The international effort is enormous and hopefully will allow preventing further spreading of the virus [<a href="#CR42">42</a>].</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="fn-group" title="fn-group"> <div class="fn-type-" title=""> <p><b>Digital Features</b></p> <p>To view digital features for this article go to <a href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11994465">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11994465</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div class="ack" title="ack"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
