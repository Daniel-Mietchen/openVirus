Along with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to cause a severe clinical picture in humans, ranging from mild malaise to death by sepsis/acute respiratory distress syndrome. The prognosis is worse in elderly patients with comorbidities. To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19.

Both viruses infect the lower airways and cause severe respiratory syndromes in humans. Other CoVs have a global distribution with a seasonality characterized by a peak in winter and in spring and few cases in summer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">The SARS epidemic began in 2002, starting from the town of Foshan in the Chinese province of Guangdong, and then spread globally, involving 33 countries in 5 different continents. More than 8000 cases were recognized (21% in health workers) with a case fatality rate (CFR) of almost 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and a basic reproduction number (<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub>) equal to 2&#x02013;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">In humans, the incubation period ranges between 2 and 10&#x000a0;days, and interhuman transmission is very effective, which is why the delay of 3&#x000a0;months between the beginning of the epidemic and the first investigations has allowed a worldwide spread of the virus. The bat was identified as the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV and the civet as the intermediate host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite active surveillance, no more SARS cases have been recognized since July 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">MERS was first identified in 2012. From then until January 16, 2020, 2521 cases were reported worldwide.

In humans, the incubation period ranges between 2 and 14&#x000a0;days, and, unlike SARS, interhuman transmission is limited. The virus is not easily transmitted from person to person, unless a close contact occurs.

On January 11 and 12, 2020, the WHO received further details and information from the Chinese National Health Commission regarding the possible association of this epidemic with exposure in a fish market in Wuhan, and the Chinese authorities shared the genetic sequence of a new coronavirus, subsequently identified as SARS-CoV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">New evidence shows the relation between SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs that are circulating in bats, specifically in <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These subspecies are abundant in southern China and Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe. The mode of transmission to humans is still unclear. Bats are rare in Chinese markets; however, they are captured and sold directly to restaurants as food. The most recent hypothesis is that there is an intermediate animal host that has played a role in the new SARS-CoV-2 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Several animals have been considered as possible hosts, including pangolins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Identifying the animal source of this new virus would help to prevent other new infections and to understand the initial dynamics of spreading in the Wuhan market. In this regard, strengthening the control of food and hygiene within live animal markets is essential to prevent future new zoonosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet known. The key to human transmission is the ability of the virus to bind to human cells: CoVs use the spike protein to bind to cells, and it seems that SARS-CoV-2, as SARS-Co virus, uses the same receptor for the conversion enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A recent study showed that the binding affinity between the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD) and the host receptor ACE2, in the initial viral attachment step, determines the host susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. The greater transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV is partly explained by the fact that, due to a higher affinity, the binding capacity of viral RBD increases and the number of viruses required to infect a cell is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 appears to have affinity for cells located in the lower airways, where it replicates, causing radiologic evidence of pneumonia in patients without any particular clinical symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Usually, the interhuman transmission of CoVs occurs through different pathways that include droplets, direct contact and indirect contact through surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The virus has also been isolated in serum, blood, rectal swabs, saliva, urine and stool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Fecal-oral transmission has not yet been proven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">A recent study indicates that the highest viral load is found immediately after the onset of symptoms and in greater quantities in the nose rather than in the throat. This analysis suggests that the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus resembles that of influenza more than that of SARS. The viral load found in asymptomatic subjects was similar to that of symptomatic ones; this suggests the potential transmission role of asymptomatic subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Despite several uncertainties, the evidence indicates that the CFR for hospitalized COVID-19 patients is substantially lower than that for hospitalized SARS, MERS and 2009 pandemic flu H1N1 patients (4%, 28%, 65% and 9%, respectively). Taking into account COVID-19 and influenza (pandemic and seasonal), it is important to carefully consider the differences in definition of cases, as these are relevant for CFR estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> has been estimated between 2 and 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and the risk assessment calculated by WHO is very high for the whole world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">As of March 10, 2020, there were 113,702 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the world, with 4125 new cases in the last 24&#x000a0;h.

Furthermore, deaths occurred only in critical cases. Fortunately, COVID-19 seems to be relatively rare in children, whose clinical picture is often mild [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">According to another Chinese study, the median age of patients is 56&#x000a0;years, with a slightly higher percentage in males (54.3% males vs. 45.7% females). Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was needed in 26% of subjects, and 4.3% of them died of multiorgan failure. Once more, the worst clinical pictures refer to elderly subjects with comorbidities such as diabetes, high blood pressure and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">Inter-human transmission was considered for 41% of patients: the infection seems related to previous exposure to the Huanan fish market in 8.7% of cases, family members in 12.3% and healthcare workers in 29% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">According to another study, some cases have also been reported in children aged 1&#x02013;11&#x000a0;months: the clinical picture was less severe than in adults, with fever and mild respiratory infections as prevalent symptoms. The transmission was mainly intra-familiar or through contacts with visitors to the Huanan market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">A recent study analyzed nine pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Their clinical picture was similar to that of non-pregnant women affected by the virus. In all cases, a cesarean delivery was done, and no vertical transmission has been documented. Therefore, it can be assumed that there is no evidence of vertical transmission during the third trimester of pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Diagnosis, Therapy and Prevention</title><p id="Par53">The diagnosis and confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection are carried out by specific tests recommended by WHO that are described on a dedicated webpage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also provided a specific webpage on laboratory support by a coronavirus-specialized laboratory in the European Union [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Any person satisfying the criteria of a suspected case (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) should be tested for SARS-CoV-2, and, when possible, samples from both the lower respiratory tract (bronchoalveolar lavage, endotracheal aspirate, expectorated sputum) and upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal swab, oropharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate or nasal wash) should be collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">According to a recent Chinese study, collecting specimens from different sites could be useful to improve the sensitivity and reduce false-negative test results. This study highlights that bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens showed the highest positive rates, followed by sputum, nasal swabs, bronchial biopsy, pharyngeal swabs, feces and blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">To date, there is no specific therapy for COVID-19. Patients with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms, and, for severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">Several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are currently underway, not yet published, which are testing different therapies for COVID-19. One of the drugs, normally used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, targets the interleukin 6 receptor and has been included in the COVID-19 treatment guidelines issued by the Chinese National Health Commission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

The increase in the number of cases and expansion of geographical areas have revealed issues regarding the future management of the infection: on March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">At the beginning, efforts were made by the Chinese government to limit the spread of the virus, such as suspension of public transport, closure of airports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], cancellation of the Lunar New Year celebrations and closure of parks and cinemas. A ban on the wild animal trade within China was declared on January 26, 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As the number of cases increased, more drastic containment measures were applied in China up to the suspension of all non-essential activities. These measures appear to have slowed the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infections in China, as can be seen from the progressive decrease in incidence in Wuhan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">Since the beginning, the WHO and the Emergency Committee under International Health Regulations have stressed China's need to strengthen screening of exits from affected areas. In general, evidence in the peer-reviewed literature does not support entry screening as an effective measure for detecting infected travelers, especially when symptoms of the disease are very common/aspecific and the seasonal flu activity in Europe and China is ongoing. However, some imported cases of COVID-19 in Asian countries have been detected through entry screening procedures at the destination airports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">One of the screening methods for COVID-19 is the measurement of body temperature, although current evidence shows that this method is not effective in controlling disease transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">As of March 10, 2020, WHO believes that restrictive measures for travelers and the exchange of goods must be proportional to the risk to public health, with the minimum duration possible and daily updates accordingly on the available epidemiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">Currently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has increased the level of traveler health alert and recommends avoiding non-essential travel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Other countries are considering implementing restrictions for people traveling from and to the most affected countries.</p><p id="Par69">Since the beginning of the pandemic, the WHO has developed a strategy and response plan to contain the impact of COVID-19. The main points included in this plan are related to blocking the chain of transmission (working on patients as well as close contacts), identifying and reducing transmission from animal sources, developing correct and scientifically sound risk communication and controlling the social and economic impact of the pandemic as much as possible to minimize it through multisectoral partnerships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par70">The ECDC, taking into account the evolving epidemiologic situation, considers five possible scenarios (from 0 to 4). The objective is to avoid the health system disruption and to limit the impact of the pandemic as much as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Different scenarios and options to limit the impact of the epidemic (modified from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>])</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Scenarios</th><th align="left">Characterization</th><th align="left">Risk management and options for response</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Scenario 0</td><td align="left">No case</td><td align="left">Rapid identification of individual cases and prevention of domestic transmission</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Scenario 1</td><td align="left">Some imported cases and local transmission with epidemiologic identification</td><td align="left">Prevent transmission where possible and slow the progression of infection</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Scenario 2</td><td align="left">Increase in imported cases and more than two generations of cases with inter-human transmission within the country with epidemiologic identification</td><td align="left">Strengthen the health system, protect the population most at risk, increase the availability of airborne transmission precautions (PPE) and diagnostic tests</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Scenario 3</td><td align="left">Localized outbreaks, which start to merge, becoming epidemiologically indistinct</td><td align="left">Reduce burden on the health system and protect the population at risk</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Scenario 4</td><td align="left">Widespread sustained transmission and health care system over-burdened because of the large demand for services</td><td align="left">Mitigate the impact of dissemination, protect the population at risk and reduce excessive mortality</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par71">Crucial general preventive measures should include: rigorous hand hygiene, avoiding coughing and/or sneezing without covering the mouth and the use of disposable tissues to mechanically block droplets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The WHO recommends hand washing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par73">The use of surgical face masks can reduce the risk of infection transmission; masks should be used by subjects with respiratory symptoms. There is no evidence of the usefulness of face masks by healthy subjects; besides, their use can be related to an increased risk due to a false sense of safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par74">Isolation of symptomatic subjects can be considered to reduce transmission; patients (suspected or confirmed) should be asked to wear a surgical mask to reduce the spread of respiratory droplets, considered the most likely route of transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Currently, many countries are considering or have already implemented relevant social measures such as school closures, smart working and cancelling meetings, sports and cultural events. Social distancing is essential. It implies avoiding shaking hands and kissing, use of public and crowded means of transportation, and gatherings of people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par76">Strict compliance with all these measures is essential to lower the spread of infection to gain time to identify adequate therapeutic options and to design and hopefully develop a vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par77">Italy is now the second country in the world in terms of case numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The first cases occurred in some areas of Lombardy and the Veneto regions and then spread all over the country. As of March 9, 2020, considering that new cases of COVID-19 registered in Italy had started to increase considerably and national restrictive measures had not yet been put in place, the Council of Ministers issued a decree law with measures to prohibit access to and exit from the country as well as suspension of all the activities that were not strictly necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par78">The current Italian situation confirms that a local outbreak, once started, can quickly spread and have a huge impact on the most vulnerable citizens, mainly elderly subjects with comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although to date no SARS-CoV-2 bloodborne transmission has been documented, the National Blood Center of the National Institute of Health (ISS) has activated precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 from blood donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par79">ECDC reports that, as of March 2, 2020, the risk of COVID-19 infection in Europe is currently moderate to high and can change. It should be considered that the transmission chain has not always been identified and that the epidemiologic situation is constantly evolving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par80">The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus represents a global health emergency involving the health authorities of all countries, especially since the pandemic state was declared.</p><p id="Par81">Many aspects of the infection have been studied. Available epidemiologic, clinical and impact data have made it possible to outline preventive interventions that have been shared internationally. Unfortunately, the spread of the virus is ongoing, and the impact of the infection is still growing, despite the application of preventive interventions, which in some contexts are very restrictive. The impact of the infection is evident not only from a clinical but also from an economic point of view.</p><p id="Par82">The considerable cost in terms of infected/dead health workers, who operate on the front line and, as such, are particularly exposed to the risk of infection, should not be underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par83">Strict observance of the rules issued by the WHO and the other international bodies (e.g., CDC, ECDC, etc.) is essential, as we need to understand the dynamics of virus spread in more detail, identify new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and develop a vaccine reasonably quickly. The international effort is enormous and hopefully will allow preventing further spreading of the virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Digital Features</bold></p><p>To view digital features for this article go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11994465">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11994465</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Epidemiologic daily updated cases can be found on the following web pages: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/</ext-link>. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china">https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/novel-coronavirus-china</ext-link>.</p><sec id="d30e1587"><title>Funding</title><p>No funding or sponsorship was received for this study or publication of this article.</p></sec><sec id="d30e1592"><title>Authorship</title><p>All named authors meet the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship for this article, take responsibility for the integrity of the work as a whole and have given their approval for this version to be published.</p></sec><sec id="d30e1597"><title>Disclosures</title><p>Erica d&#x02019;Anchera, Federica Sandri, Marta Savio and Armando Stefanati declare that they have no conflict of interest.
