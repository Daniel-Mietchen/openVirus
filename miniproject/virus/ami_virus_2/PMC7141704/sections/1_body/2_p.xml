<p id="para0004">To contain the epidemics of COVID-19, prevention from both import and export of contagious people is an essential intervention. It is also important to clearly clarify the infection source in order to initiate an efficient and successful contact tracing for the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, and thereafter people exposed to the contagious patients could be quarantined to avoid further disease spreading. Here we present a COVID-19 patient whose infection source could not be completely clarified initially, and later was illuminated by using the phylogenetic analysis of the isolated virus.</p>
