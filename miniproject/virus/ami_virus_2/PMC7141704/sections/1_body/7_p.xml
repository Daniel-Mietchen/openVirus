<p id="para0009">With the limited transmission clusters in Taiwan and the fact that NTU03 exhibits at least 8 unique nucleotide difference compared to other previously reported viruses from Taiwan, we conclude that it is much more probable that the present patient was infected during her travelling abroad. To our best knowledge, in late February and early March, several foreignÂ COVID-19 patients who had travel histories to Egypt were reported. Further phylogenetic analysis including viral sequences derived from the 45 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections on the quarantined Nile cruise boat will help to delineate the outbreak on Nile tourism boat and its impact on the COVID-19 epidemic.
