 <p>Bovine pestiviruses include 
  <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> (BVDV-1), 
  <italic>Pestivirus B</italic> (BVDV-2), and 
  <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>, which was originally called 
  <italic>HoBi-like pestivirus</italic>. We conducted an epidemiological investigation for pestiviruses circulating in backyard cattle farms in central China. RT-PCR assays and sequences analysis were conducted on 54 nasal swabs, 26 serum samples, and three lung samples from cattle with respiratory infections and identified 29 pestivirus strains, including 24 
  <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> and five 
  <italic>Pestivirus H</italic> strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial 5â€²-UTR and Npro sequences showed that the genotypes of 24 
  <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> strains included 
  <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1b (six isolates), 
  <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1m (six isolates), 
  <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1q (two isolates), 
  <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1u (one isolates), and 
  <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1o (nine isolates, a putative new sub-genotype). In addition, a single 
  <italic>Pestivirus H</italic> agenotype included all five 
  <italic>Pestivirus H</italic> strains. This study revealed extensive genetic variations within bovine pestivirus isolates derived from cattle in backyard farms in Central China, and this epidemiological information improves our understanding of the epidemics of bovine Pestiviruses, as well as will be useful in designing and evaluating diagnostic methods and developing more effective vaccines.
