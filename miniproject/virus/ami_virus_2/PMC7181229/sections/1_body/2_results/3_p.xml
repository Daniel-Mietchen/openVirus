<p>The sequences detected by 5′-UTR and Npro RT-PCR in the five 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>-positive samples were deposited in GenBank as accession numbers 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="MN442384" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MN442384</ext-link>–

 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="MN442413" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MN442413</ext-link>–
 <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="MN442417" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">MN442417</ext-link>. Sequence alignment using CLUSTAL W program of the five samples revealed a 5′-UTR and Npro region respective sequence identity within the range 95.8–99.5% and 98.4–99.6%. BLAST analysis of the 5′-UTR and Npro sequences showed that all five 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>-positive isolates belonged to 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>. Comparative analysis of the 5′-UTR and Npro region of the Henan isolates and the reference strains of 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic> (TH/04_KhonKaen, HN1507) revealed a sequence identity within the range of 87.5–99.5% and 90.3.2–99.4%, respectively. In particular, the nucleotide homologies between these isolates and the other strain (HN1507) (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) isolated from goat in the same area were 97.9±1.6% and 98.6 ± 0.4% in the above two regions.
