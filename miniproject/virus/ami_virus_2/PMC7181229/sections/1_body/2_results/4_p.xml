<p>All 24 isolates from the BVDV-positive samples were classified as 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>, and on the basis of phylogenetic analysis of 5′-UTR and Npro genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) further classified into five genotypes: 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1b (six isolates), 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1m (six isolates), 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1q (two isolates), 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1u (one isolate), and the other nine 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> isolates cluster in the same genotype with Chinese strain XH-2 which was assigned as 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1o, but phylogenetic analysis showed this cluster of isolates were under different cluster from other 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1o strains, further analyzed by the PNS software which available at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pns-software.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.pns-software.com</ext-link> (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), these cluster should be members of a new sub-genotype (1.7.2) within the genotype 1o (1.7). In addition, five isolates from 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>-positive samples were classified as 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>, and all further were classified into genotype “
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic> a” based on the results of phylogenetic analysis of the 5′-UTR and Npro genes (
