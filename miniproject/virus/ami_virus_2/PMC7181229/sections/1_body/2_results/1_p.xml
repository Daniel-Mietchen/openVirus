<p>Using first-round nRT-PCR to identify bovine pestivirus by amplification of a 1,013-bp fragment, 83 samples were screened and the pestivirus genome was detected in 17 out of the 54 nasal swab samples, 10 out of the 26 serum samples, and two out of three lung samples. The results of the second-round nRT-PCR showed that in 17 positive nasal swab samples, 14 were positive for 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> and the other three were positive for 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>; in the 10 positive serum samples, nine were positive for 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> and one was positive for 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>; in the two positive lung samples, one was positive for 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> and the other was positive for 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>; no 
 <italic>Pestivirus B</italic>-positive samples were detected. The 29 pestivirus-positive samples are presented in
