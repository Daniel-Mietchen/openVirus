<p>From November 2014 to April 2019, a total of 54 nasal swabs and 26 serum samples were collected from different cattle in 41 backyard farms in Henan Province in Central China; these animals had never been vaccinated against 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> and were diagnosed with respiratory infections by rural veterinarians and treated with antibiotics for days, resulting in slow recovery. In addition, three lungs of deceased calves were collected in 2015, 2016, and 2018. All samples were stored at −80°C until analysis.
