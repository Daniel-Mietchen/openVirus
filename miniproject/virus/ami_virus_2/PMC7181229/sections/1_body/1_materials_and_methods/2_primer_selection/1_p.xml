<p>The nested RT-PCR primers for genotyping bovine pestiviruses, including 
 <italic>Pestivirus A, Pestivirus B</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic> (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) were used to detect the pestivirus genome in the samples. For phylogenetic analysis, the BVDV-positive samples were further subjected to 5′-UTR and Npro RT-PCR using primers 324/326 (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and BD1/BD2 (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), respectively. Because the sequences of 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>-positive samples were most closely related to the HN1507 strain (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), the positive samples further subjected to RT-PCR covering a partial 5′-UTR fragment and the entire Npro region with the primers HN-F (sense; 5′-CCTTCAGTAGGACGAGCATAA-3′) and HN-R (antisense; 5′- AGACGGGCTATACCACAATAA-3′), corresponding to nt 109–1,107 of 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic> strain HN1507 (GenBank accession number:
