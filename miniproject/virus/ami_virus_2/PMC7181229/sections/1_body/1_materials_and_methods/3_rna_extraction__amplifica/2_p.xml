<p>nRT-PCR to detect the pestivirus genome was performed as described elsewhere (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Then, the BVDV-positive samples were further subjected to 5′-UTR and Npro RT-PCR earlier described (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>-positive samples were subjected to RT-PCR in a 50-μL reaction mixture similar to the 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> reaction mixture according using the following conditions: reverse transcription at 50°C for 60 min, then denaturation at 93°C for 3 min; followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 45 s, 56°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Then the amplified products were recovered from the agarose gel using a gel extraction kit (Omega Bio-Tek, China), and the purified amplicons were directly sequenced in both directions using an ABI automated A373 sequencer (ABI, USA). Lastly, all of the sequences were compared to the NCBI databases using a BLAST search.
