<p>China is one of the countries that have the largest domesticated ruminant population in the world, including a large number of backyard farms (

 <italic>Pestivirus A or Pestivirus B</italic> vaccines were released to the market. However, vaccination is not mandatory, and awareness of the importance of immunization to prevent Pestivirus infections among backyard farm keepers is rare, despite the occurrence of pestivirus epidemics in large-scale farms in China in recent years (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). It is thus essential to investigate the genetic diversity of pestiviruses in backyard farms. Furthermore, the new genotype pestivirus might result in the immune failure of pestivirus vaccine (
