<p>Five isolates of the 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic> “a” genotype were detected in Fangcheng and Shangcai in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Before this research, Pestivirus H has been previously detected in goats and sheep in Fangcheng (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and phylogenetic analysis showed that these five isolates were closely related to the HN1507 strain isolated from goat (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). These results indicated that these isolates shared the same origin. Furthermore, considering that these strains were all isolated from animals raised in backyard farms where livestock commonly grazed in the mix, this specific feeding method provides a convenient route for interspecies transmission of 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic>. To date, in China, 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic> has been reported in contaminated cells, commercial FCS, goats, and sheep (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). This study showed that 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic> could be detected in cattle immediately after being detected in goats and sheep in Central China (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).
