<p>Bovine pestivirus isolates in backyard farms exhibited a high level of genetic diversity, as indicated in the novel epidemic genotypes of 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> and 
 <italic>Pestivirus H</italic> first emerging in cattle in China. These results indicate that backyard cattle farms could be a special reservoir for the evolution of bovine Pestivirus and provide an important complement to understand the epidemics of bovine Pestivirus. Furthermore, this study will be useful in designing and evaluating diagnostic methods and in developing more effective vaccines.
