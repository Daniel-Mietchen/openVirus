<p>Six isolates of the 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1b genotype were detected in Zhenping, Fangcheng, Shangcai, Sheqi, and Yucheng in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This widespread distribution of 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> is not surprising, as the first genotype of 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> was isolated in China in 1983. Subsequently, 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1b was later detected in most of the provinces, including Henan Province and the neighboring provinces numerous reports (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>–
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>–
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Meanwhile, a recent study has shown that 31.6% (2193:6939) of the corresponding 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> isolates around the world were 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1b (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). These reports indicate the strong spreading ability of 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1b among large-scale farms, and the high detection rate (6/24) in our study also suggests that 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1b is a predominant genotype among backyard farms.
