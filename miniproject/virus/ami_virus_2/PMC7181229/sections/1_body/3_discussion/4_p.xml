<p>Six isolates of the 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1m genotype were detected in Fangcheng, Sheqi, Shangcai, and Xinye in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The first 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1m strain ZM-95 in China was isolated from pigs in 1995 (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Subsequent reports revealed that 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1m is emerging in most of provinces and is considered to be a predominant 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> genotype in herds (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), and also detected in Henan province and neighbor province (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In addition, sequences of 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1m strains in different regions showed high-nucleotide homology, indicating that these strains share the same origin (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Recently, other surveys on goats uncovered that the 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1m could infect goats naturally and cause diarrhea (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). In this study, 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1m strains were detected in different backyard farms that shared grassland with goats, this feeding method provided more chances for interspecies transmission of BVDV-1m, further accelerating the evolution of these viruses and more widely spreading disease.
