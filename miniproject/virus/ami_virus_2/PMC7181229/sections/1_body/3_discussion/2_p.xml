<p>The results of phylogenetic analysis showed that 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1o, 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1b, and 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1m were the predominant genotypes in our samples, followed by 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1q and 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1u. Furthermore, among these three predominant genotypes, 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1b and 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic>−1m are frequently reported in China (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) the 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1a found in Henan province (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) was not detected in this work.
