<p>The other nine 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> isolates shared the highest sequence identities (97–98%) in strains such as XH-6, XH-5, XH-1, XH-2, and BJ09 that were isolated from other provinces in China which was assigned as 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1o. Furthermore, the Npro sequences of these strains were not found in GenBank, and thus, confirmation could not be done based on the Npro phylogenetic tree analysis. The Npro sequences of the 21 isolates were also analyzed by BLAST, and the highest identities (86–91%) were observed in strain IS26/01ncp from Japan, and BJ0703, BJ0702, BJ0701, and JS12/02 that were isolated from other provinces including the Jiangsu province near to the Henan province in China and were classified as BVDV-1o or BVDV-1p (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Then the PNS method was used to analyze the existing strain such as XH-2, then the genotype 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1.7 (1o) was verified, but the cluster in phylogenetic tree this cluster was in different cluster from other 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1.7 (1o) strains, this result indicated these strains form a new sub-genotype (1.7.2). (

 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1o was first isolated from a calf that developed a mucosal disease and from PI calves in Japan (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), and has been detected in camels, goats, and pigs in China (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). In this study the new sub-genotype 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1o were detected in different backyard farms in a few of counties, and the 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1o could infect goats and sheep, it is in need that necessary measures should be taken to avoid this new sub-genotype 
 <italic>Pestivirus A</italic> 1o spread in other hosts.
