<p>Today, both viral and non-viral vectors have been subjected to preclinical and clinical studies in the field of gene therapy. A brief description of different viral vector systems for gene therapy applications is presented below, with a special emphasis on melanoma treatment. The range of viral vectors is very broad. It includes delivery vehicles developed for both short-term and long-term expression, including single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) RNA and DNA genome viruses [
