<p>It has been observed that some tumor cells and spontaneously transformed cell lines show favorable sensitivity toward reoviruses [

Other studies have revealed that intratumoral injection of reoviruses leads to regression of v-erbB-transformed NIH 3T3 or human U87 glioblastoma tumors in 80% of SCID mice. Moreover, multiple reovirus injections resulted in total tumor regression in 65% of immune-competent C3H mice [

It was confirmed that reoviruses can kill six human breast cancer cell lines (SK-BR-3, KPL4, MDA-MB-453, CRL1500, MCFT and MDA-MB-231) expressing HER-2, but not the breast cancer cell line Hs578Bst, which did not show HER-2 expression [
