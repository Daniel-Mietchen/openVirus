<p>Regarding preclinical studies, the NDV strain 73-T caused complex tumor regression in athymic mice containing fibrosarcoma xenografts [
 <xref rid="B169-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Even a single intratumoral administration caused complete regression and multiple administrations provided superior efficacy [
 <xref rid="B169-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. Intratumoral administration of NDV vectors expressing G-CSF, IL-2 or TNF resulted in decreases in tumor growth in a colon carcinoma model, and the majority of treated mice showed complete and long-lasting remission. The NDV LaSota strain showed superior suppression of tumor growth in comparison to a recombinant rNDV vector when both expressed IL-2 and IL-15 [

Another study using recombinant NDV expressing IL-2 and TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand) increased anti-neoplastic activity through induction of apoptosis and induced proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in mice, which reduced tumor development [

In order to reduce the environmental risk of NDV, which is toxic in birds, and the neurotoxicity of VSV (Vesicular stomatitis virus), a hybrid vector was engineered, where the VSV G protein was replaced with NDV hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and further modified by fusion proteins. The hybrid demonstrated lower neurotoxicity, and no virulence in embryonated chicken eggs was detected [
