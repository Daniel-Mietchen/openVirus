<p>The LaSota strain of NDV has been modified by reverse genetics in order to be applied as a recombinant vaccine vector [
 <xref rid="B165-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. The distinct advantages of NDV relate to the host restriction and lack of pre-existing immunity in humans, where high-titer NDV replication can be obtained in certain cell lines suitable for human vaccine development [
 <xref rid="B166-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. Reverse genetics was employed in order to optimize foreign gene expression from NDV vectors. This was achieved through application of red fluorescence protein (RFP) at multiple sites downstream of the nucleocapsid (NP), P, M, fusion (F), hemagglutinin-neuramidase (HN) and large polymerase (L) genes [
 <xref rid="B167-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>]. The sequential transcription mechanism was confirmed according to the RFP expression levels. In a similar way, the avirulent NDV strain TS09-C was modified using reverse genetics for GFP expression after gene insertion upstream of the NP, M and L genes, resulting in remarkable expression [
