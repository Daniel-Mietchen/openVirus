 <sub>50</sub> of CAVATAK™ on days 1, 3, 5 and 8 in a phase II trial. A phase II trial using CVA21 enrolled 57 patients with unresectable stage IIIc-IVM1c melanoma. The therapy continued every three weeks, with a total of six injections followed by sequential tumor biopsies for injected and non-injected lesions, where monitoring of viral replication and virus-induced immune activation was observed. The obtained DRRs were 28.1 % (16 out of 57 patients) and 38.6% (21 out of 57 patients) and showed immune-related progression-free survival six months after the treatment [

According to a phase II study, intralesional admission of CVA21 can substantially influence the dynamics of the tumor micro-environment, which can be observed by an increase in immune cell infiltrates and immune-related response genes [
