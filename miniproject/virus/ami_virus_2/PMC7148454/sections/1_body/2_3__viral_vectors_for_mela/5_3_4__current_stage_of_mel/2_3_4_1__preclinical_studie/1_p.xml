<p>Overexpression of ICAM-1 and DAF in malignant melanoma compared to normal cells represents the potential for CVA21 applications [
 <xref rid="B159-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Upregulation of ICAM-1 in melanoma is well studied, and it has been considered a relevant marker in disease prognosis [
 <xref rid="B160-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. It has been suggested that ICAM-1 is responsible for metastasis generation, as it facilitates cell-cell interactions between malignant melanocytes and circulating lymphocytes [

 <xref rid="B158-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. These results were obtained from the human melanoma chemotherapy-resistant Mel-CV and Mel-FH cell lines. The primary melanoma MM200 cell line showed in vitro oncolysis [

 <xref rid="B86-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Later, it was demonstrated that other group A coxsackie viruses had similar oncolytic properties and were not sensitive to neutralizing antibodies against CVA21. This opens the possibility of multivalent approaches through the application of different serotypes [
