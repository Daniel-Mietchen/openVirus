<p>After encouraging results were obtained from the phase II trials, a phase III trial (OPTiM) was conducted for patients with stage IIIB to IV melanoma [

 <sup>2</sup> daily for 14 days in 28-day cycles. Since the frequency of pseudo-progression with TVEC was high, treatment discontinuation was not required before 24 weeks. After this period, treatment continued. The primary endpoint was a durable response rate (DRR), defined as the percentage of patients experiencing a response lasting more than 6 months and beginning within the first 12 months of treatment. The most common adverse effects upon application of TVEC were fatigue, chills, nausea and local injection symptoms. Statistical analysis revealed that overall survival in the TVEC arm was superior for patients with stage III and IV M1a melanoma (metastases only in skin or lymph nodes) and for treatment of naive patients with
