<p>The ICP34.5-deleted HSV-1 vector was engineered to express beta-galactosidase [
 <xref rid="B122-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Strong expression was observed in the brain and dorsal root ganglia, with only minor toxicity, which indicates that deletion of the HSV-1 neurovirulence gene eliminates neurotoxicity. However, it preserves tolerable infectivity, in order to allow dominant trans-gene expression in neural tissue [
