<p id="p0090">New engineering technologies have transformed the way we think of vaccines, making us able to use precise structure-based design, and manufacture faster from a gene synthesis platform. The emergent coronavirus was used to illustrate the potential for rapid vaccine development. The viral sequence selection was conducted in just three days, the production and proof of immunogenicity was completed in just 38 days, and clinical trials were expected to start in March 2020. This was possible because multiple groups work together and because a lot of preexisting work on coronavirus is available in the scientific community. For an unknown emerging virus, this progress was estimated to take years and therefore basic research was emphasized to play a huge role in preparedness for emerging epidemics.</p>
