<p id="p0085">Approximately three million individuals die of vaccine-preventable diseases each year. Six of the top ten leading causes of death in low resource settings could potentially be prevented by vaccination [
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Tuberculosis, which causes 1.5 million deaths annually, Malaria, which causes 435,000 deaths annually, and HIV are pathogens with considerable biological complexity. The antigen selection has been convoluted by the complex lifecycles of

 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus with each having the ability to establish chronic, asymptomatic infection and presumably escaping immune detection for at least part of the cycle. The challenges inherent to translation from the laboratory to clinical trials during the development of any vaccine include the complexity of the manufacturing process and analytical methods in the early phase, and the clinical assay optimization and running of large clinical trials in the later phases. Global international research cooperation is necessary to understand the immunopathogenesis and protection mechanisms while simultaneously testing vaccine candidates.
