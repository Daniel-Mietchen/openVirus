<p id="p0095">Acceleration of development time and reduction of costs are paramount to future vaccinology for the global population. Structural biology is becoming more and more important 
 <italic>e.g.</italic> in reverse vaccinology, engineered recombinant proteins, and Self-Amplifying mRNA (SAM) vaccines. Synthetic approaches to vaccine manufacturing have the potential to streamline development and enable rapid production of effective and safe vaccines. Pre-clinical proof of principle has been achieved for multiple SAM vaccines, which could radically simplify the way rationally-designed vaccine antigens are discovered, developed and manufactured [
