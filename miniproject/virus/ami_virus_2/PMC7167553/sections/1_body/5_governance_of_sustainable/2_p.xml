<p id="p0160">In many areas of the world, vaccines are not available due to costs and distribution obstacles. The vaccine industry outside the EU and US is developing rapidly, 
 <italic>e.g</italic>., in India and China, which may contribute to reduce the time of license and cost of production down from 12 to 15 years and 1 billion $ for a licensed product, including manufacture in less expensive facilities. Several public, private, or philanthropic institutions are trying to improve the situation. For example, the European Vaccine Initiative (EVI) develops vaccines for poverty or neglected diseases like Malaria, Zika, Nipah, and Leishmaniasis that are not developed by industry. The approach is based on cooperation because few institutions can do the entire development pathway comprising screening, optimization, adjuvants, delivery, analytical services, GLP, GMP, animal models, and clinical trials. Gavi, the vaccine alliance, funds immunization programs and vaccines for the poorest countries and correlates the amount of funding with the income of the country so the help is phased out when the country's economy improves.
