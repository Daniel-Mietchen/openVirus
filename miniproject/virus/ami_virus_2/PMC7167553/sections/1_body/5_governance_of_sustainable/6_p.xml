<p id="p0180">Research and development in rich areas of the world does not mean more access in poor areas after a while, i.e. the 
 <italic>trickle-down</italic> model does not work. The current economic model creates the lack of availability of medicines to poor children due to the lack of income for the private industry manufacturers. Outbreaks are opportunities for philanthropic and public investments to create new governance systems with better decisions and not based on return of investment. However, when vaccines are developed in common with public bodies but licensed by a private company, the public institutions often lose influence on the final pricing, production facilities, and distribution areas. Medicines and vaccines are typically ordinary goods existing by the rules of the financial market; however, a new governance model should provide a new special status to tackle this topic particularly in poorer regions, because you cannot both maximize profit in medicines and have affordable medicines for all.
