<p id="p0110">Mathematical modelling based on the specific pathogen parameters can be used to design trials, evaluate spread of the virus, and decide on optimal control strategies. As the IABS meeting took place just when the COVID-19 spread from Asia to Europe and the Middle-East, a real-time modelling and outbreak response was performed for the audience, providing a simulation based on estimated key parameters like incubation period, R
 <sub>0</sub>, asymptomatic spreading, and case-fatality ratios, estimating the predicted outcome of a pandemic. The modelling can also be used to evaluate early control policies,
