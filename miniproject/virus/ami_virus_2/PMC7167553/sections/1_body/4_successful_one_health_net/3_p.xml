On the other hand, it can be frustrating to have to rely on animal models and potentially end up with wrong doses or irrelevant immune responses, so the final answer is always in the target population requiring the further development of human challenge models. The decrease in companies that have both a human and a veterinary vaccine department is an obstacle to fast cooperation.
