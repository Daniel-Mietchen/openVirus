<p id="p0130">The round tables discussions explored how to effectively transfer knowledge from the veterinary to the human field and vice versa. During centuries most vaccine technologies have been first developed and used in animals before moving into humans. Mass production of veterinary vaccines at low price for farm animals gives hope for affordable human vaccines. Cross-fertilization between the two fields requires an extra effort in projects but could be facilitated if funding organizations would stress the desire for vet/human representation in each funded project. Many priority vaccines share research, technology, or pathogen family with similar veterinary projects although some physiological parameters and the benefit-risk models are different. This is demonstrated by the narrower range of technologies used in human vaccinology, such as very few types of adjuvant.</p>
