<p id="p0150">A successful network requires a clear vision that all partners can align to and a team where all members can learn from each other,

It takes time to build up the trust to ensure sharing of knowledge. Complementarity means that people who are not too alike and who challenge each other must be brought together, for example by mixing academics, industry, and biotech people and having a manager to direct the team. In mutual benefit, the synergies must be used but without duplicating efforts. In international development projects it is essential to involve the countries/people that are the key stakeholders. Bridging the veterinary and human side in projects could be very beneficial but it requires the extra step to acknowledge the usefulness of differences.
