<p id="p0045">The development of vaccinology is an amazing scientific and biologic journey from the very earliest observation by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu who witnesses smallpox prevention by variolation in Turkey, over Edward Jenner's finding that milk maids were immune to smallpox and later introduction of vaccinia virus to immunize humans, and to Louis Pasteur who attenuated virus and bacteria in the laboratory and started vaccine production. Many new strategies for discovery and development of vaccines are employed in modern times, 
 <italic>e.g.,</italic> viral deletion mutants, replicating vectors, DNA-plasmids, and the use of improved adjuvants. However, several deadly diseases are still not covered by vaccines, 
 <italic>e.g.,</italic> HIV, where clinical trials fail because humans do not develop neutralizing antibodies except after long exposure to the virus or antigen. The impact of vaccination on human and animal health is hard to exaggerate and compares to the health improvements due to clean water.
