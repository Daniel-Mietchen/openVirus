<p id="p0060">Vaccine hesitancy is a growing concern, which is not new but increasingly expressed. It may be a function of the perception of reduced risk of disease outbreaks combined with observation of adverse events attributed to vaccination. Education about vaccines in medical schools is almost absent, which is unfortunate because patients and parents will ask their doctor's advice. In the area of social media, it is increasingly important to tell the factual stories about the benefit of vaccination.</p>
