<p id="p0195">Many priority human vaccines share research, technology, or pathogen family with similar veterinary projects although some physiological parameters and the benefit-risk models are different. The last 40 years, numerous zoonotic diseases have emerged, 
 <italic>e.g</italic>. HIV, Lyme disease, bovine spongiform encelopathy (BSE), avian influenzas, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), Zika, and the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Animal models could be much better explored to predict human vaccine efficacy, and there is a need to look for a broad input from veterinary science. Prevention and control of transboundary animal diseases that threaten food security and public health depends on the “One Health” principle and cooperation at an international level. Benefits within reach like tackling the many human fatalities from canine rabies is currently missing an international will, and a serious call for action was expressed.
