<p id="p0220">Because of the risk of viral transmission between patients, staff, physicians, and providers, and to comply with local restrictions for nonemergency surgeries, many programs of assisted reproduction have suspended procedures throughout the globe during the height of the pandemic. As the assisted reproductive technology programs resume operations it will be important to gather information regarding the status of individuals infected with the novel coronavirus, and to assess gametes and reproductive outcomes for those who had COVID-19. These studies will be enabled by the availability of serologic testing and more widespread RNA testing for the novel coronavirus. Likewise, researchers should collect data regarding outcomes of pregnancies in women who became infected during pregnancy. Although a vaccine may prevent disease, until one is available, information is needed on the safety of medical treatments and outcomes in pregnancy.</p>
