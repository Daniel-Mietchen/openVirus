<p id="p0225">One limitation of this review is that because of the rapidly increasing number of publications, it is possible that new information may be published contradicting the findings. Because of concern about possible adverse effects, there may be a risk of bias toward reporting positive outcomes. Additionally, because reports have focused on the acuity of treatment, the reproductive effects may be present, but not yet reported. The strength of this report is that our search was comprehensive and conducted, as much as possible, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.</p>
