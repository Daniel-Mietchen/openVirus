<p id="p0215">There is reason to be concerned based on data from other coronaviruses. As is typical of this family of viruses, the SARSâ€“CoV-2 spike protein binds the ACE2 receptor, a protein found in many reproductive tissues, including the testis. Of concern, evidence exists that related coronaviruses have caused severe orchitis. Although sperm counts can be reduced by high fever alone, the question of other possible long-term effects on male and female gametes is pressing, specifically, whether there might be shedding of virus in some individuals that might affect the safety and storage of gametes. As noted, evidence continues to emerge regarding effects of the novel coronavirus in pregnancy and some initial reports suggest that complications, particularly after delivery, may be increased. Additional studies are urgently needed.</p>
