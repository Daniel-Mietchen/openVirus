<p id="p0210">On January 7, 2020 thanks to the initial efforts of the late Dr. Jixian Zhang, the SARS–CoV-2 virus was identified as a cause of severe cases of pneumonia that began on December 8, 2019, in Wuhan, China. In the first 3 months of 2020, the novel virus has infected more than 1.4 million people and caused more than 87,000 deaths. Declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, the sickness has overwhelmed healthcare resources as it spread. Containment of SARS–CoV-2 has proven to be exceptionally difficult due to asymptomatic and presymptomatic spread of disease, as well as the relatively high person-to-person transmission. As the virus moved from host to host, as is typical of the single-stranded RNA viruses, SARS–CoV-2 has mutated. Notably, there is an enormous phenotypic difference in disease severity from asymptomatic infection to death, but the reasons for this striking variability remain obscure. Despite the overwhelming magnitude of the disease and its worldwide prevalence, information regarding the effects of the novel coronavirus on human reproduction are currently limited. This lack of evidence should not be considered reassuring because only 3 months have elapsed since the novel coronavirus jumped species and infected humans.</p>
