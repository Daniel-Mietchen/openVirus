<p id="p0170">Given the teratogenicity concerns associated with viruses such as Zika, there remains the question of whether vertical transmission is possible with SARS–CoV-2. Although no known cases of vertical transmission have been noted with similar respiratory viruses such as SARS and MERS, this cannot be assumed for SARS–CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). Numerous cases reports have described pregnant women who were infected by SARS–CoV-2. In one study of 38 women from China, COVID-19 infection did not lead to maternal deaths and there were no confirmed cases of vertical transmission (

 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) suggests that vertical transmission may be possible. In this case report, an otherwise healthy infant was born by cesarean section to a 29-year-old with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)–confirmed SARS–CoV-2 infection. This infant was placed immediately into isolation and a blood sample at 2 hours of age was noted to show an elevated SARS–CoV-2 IgG level. Although the IgG can be secondary to transplacental transfer, the infant was also positive for SARS–CoV-2 IgM, which cannot be explained by maternal-fetal transfer (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Furthermore, IgM antibodies only appear 3–7 days after infection. All five RT-PCR tests on the infant were negative for SARS–CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). The antibody profile of this infant is suggestive of exposure to SARS–CoV-2 in utero. A follow-up study done on six infants born to COVID-19–positive mothers showed positive IgM antibodies in two of them. Yet, all throat swabs and blood samples from the neonates tested negative for the virus. Overall, evidence of vertical transmission in the setting of COVID-19 infection is currently inconclusive. Continued observation is necessary as more data is gathered during the course of this pandemic.
