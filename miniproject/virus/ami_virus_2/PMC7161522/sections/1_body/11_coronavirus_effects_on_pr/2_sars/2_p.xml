<p id="p0115">Four of seven pregnant patients with SARS miscarried in the first trimester (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Four of five women infected after 24 weeks of gestation were delivered prematurely, largely due to their deteriorating maternal condition from SARS, at 26, 28, and 32 weeks of gestation (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The infants born at 26Â and 28 weeks developed respiratory distress syndrome requiring surfactant, but were normal weight for gestational age. However, among infants born weeks (5 to 7) after initial infection, fetal growth restriction and fibrin deposition on placental interface were seen in two of three pregnancies, suggesting compromise. There was no evidence of vertical transmission. Overall, SARS was a very serious disease for pregnant women and their fetuses.
