It is imperative to consider that, although some of these interventions are safe in pregnancy, none so far have been identified as definitive treatment and all have potential risks. These concerns need to be considered as an additional risk assumed by pregnant women; some potential therapies may carry risk to the fetus or be unavailable to pregnant women.
