<p id="p0200">It has been established that SARS–CoV-2 is spread by respiratory droplets, yet the potential for other routes of transmission, particularly during labor, is unknown (
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Limited data are available for COVID-19, but it is possible to extrapolate from limited information available on SARS–CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. In the SARS–CoV outbreak, small case reports showed no viral RNA in placental, umbilical cord blood, amniotic fluid, or breastmilk (

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). It is important to note that fecal matter that was aerosolized via the flushing of toilets was noted to spread disease (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). One could hypothesize that amniotic fluid could become aerosolized and infect others if viral RNA was present through mixing with fecal matter. MERS-CoV had an extremely high death toll, however, only 12 cases were documented in pregnancy, and no information is available on viral RNA in pregnancy-specific tissue (
