<p id="p0135">Full-term infants born when their mothers have active COVID-19 infections have done well overall. Most are normal weight and have normal Apgar scores. Although most have been delivered electively using cesarean section to reduce the risk of maternal transmission and reduce disease acuity, 18 cases of fetal distress have been reported. Among the 184 fetuses reported, one had intrauterine growth restriction, 13 were delivered prematurely, 12 were small for gestational age, and one was large for gestational age. One stillbirth and one neonatal death were reported.</p>
