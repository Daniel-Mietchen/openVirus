 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>); similar patterns of symptomatology, disease severity, and outcome were seen. Nonetheless, some infected pregnant patients do develop very serious disease requiring mechanical ventilation, and most very ill COVID-19 patients are delivered soon after the disease becomes severe, whether premature or full term. At least five pregnant patients have required mechanical ventilation, and two patients have died.
