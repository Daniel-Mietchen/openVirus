<p id="p0085">The involvement of SARS–CoV-2 infection within human male and female reproductive systems has yet to be elucidated fully. However, results from other coronavirus subtypes, specifically SARS–CoV, help inform knowledge of tissue-specific viral pathophysiology. Current data suggest that the female reproductive system may be spared from viral infection. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies on tissues from a small cohort of deceased patients that were infected with SARS–CoV failed to identify SARS–CoV viral RNA within the female reproductive tract, including both ovarian and uterine tissue (

The ACE2 protein, a main receptor for coronavirus viral entry, is expressed selectively by Leydig cells of the adult testes (

Leading theories postulate that this is an immune-mediated response to infection because direct inoculation of the coronavirus RNA within testicular tissue has not been described. In a 2005 study of eight postmortem SARS–CoV patients, testicular tissue contained focal atrophy despite lacking identifiable SARS viral RNA (

Accordingly, there have been reported cases of SARS–CoV causing severe orchitis, as evidenced by extensive immunoglobulin (Ig) G precipitation in testicular interstitial tissue causing germ cell destruction and widespread testicular leukocyte infiltration (
