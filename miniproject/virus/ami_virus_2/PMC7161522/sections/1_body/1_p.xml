<p id="p0020">The rapid spread of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS–CoV-2) has led to a pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) across the globe. As of April 8, 2020, there are more than 1.4 million cases and 86,000 deaths attributed to the virus worldwide. As a result, nations have implemented suppression and mitigation strategies to control community spread, including mandated social distancing, restrictions to nonurgent medical care, and closure of nonessential businesses.
