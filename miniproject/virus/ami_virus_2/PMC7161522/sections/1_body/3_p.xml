<p id="p0030">The novel SARS–CoV-2 virus spreads rapidly, with 2–3 people infected from every index case, a reproduction number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) or transmission rate of 2.24–3.58 (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In contrast, the 2009 H1N1 seasonal influenza had an R
 <sub>0</sub> of 1.46–1.48. The incubation period for SARS–CoV-2 ranges from 2–14 days, and asymptomatic spread occurs prior to onset of symptoms (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Transmission is thought to be mainly through respiratory droplets and fomites (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In one experiment, viable virus was detected in aerosols for up to 3 hours, with an estimated half-life of 1.1 hours. In addition, virus was detected on surfaces for days after application, with viable SARS–CoV-2 identified on plastic and stainless steel up to 72 hours (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). SARS–CoV-2 RNA also has been detected in blood and stool and it is not yet known whether the infection can be acquired through exposure to nonrespiratory bodily fluids (
