 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) or anosmia. The severity of infection ranges from asymptomatic carriers, to mild flu-like disease, to critical illness and death. Critically ill patients may experience respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction. Approximately 80% of infections are mild with flu-like symptoms, 15%–20% are severe, requiring hospitalization and supplemental oxygen, and 5% are critical and require mechanical ventilation (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Death may occur in up to 3% of infections. Death from SARS–CoV-2 is more common in individuals older than 60 years of age or with underlying medical issues but can occur in younger persons, perhaps related to the inoculum. Associated cardiac arrhythmias may be fatal.
