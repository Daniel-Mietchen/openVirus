<p id="p0095">The SARS–CoV-2 virus uses ACE2 receptors to gain entry into human cells. The male reproductive system expresses ACE2 within adult Leydig cells in the testis and there are data to suggest that ACE2 plays a role in spermatogenesis. The presence of ACE2 receptors is much more prominent in the male reproductive system than the female reproductive system, but gonadotropin-dependent expression of ACE2 has been reported in human ovaries (
