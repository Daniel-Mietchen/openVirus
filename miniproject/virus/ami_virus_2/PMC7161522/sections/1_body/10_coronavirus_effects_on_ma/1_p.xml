<p id="p0090">There are limited data regarding the impact of SARS–CoV-2 on human reproduction because the virus is novel and has only recently infected humans. To date, there have been no reports of the virus in the female reproductive tract, in vaginal secretions, in amniotic fluid, or in peritoneal fluid. Although there is nothing to suggest that female or male gametes would be impacted directly by infection with SARS–CoV-2 or other coronaviruses, there is evidence that fever can impact spermatogenesis. Therefore, male fertility may be diminished for 72–90 days following COVID-19 due to decreased sperm concentration and motility (
