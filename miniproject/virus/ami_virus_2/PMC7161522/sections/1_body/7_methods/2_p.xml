<p id="p0055">We reviewed all titles for eligibility. All reports including pregnancy or reproductive tissues were included. We excluded editorials and publications of guidelines. We excluded articles that were duplicates or did not contain information related to pregnancy or reproduction, the presence of virus in reproductive tissues, effects on gametes, pregnancy outcomes, or neonatal complications. Case reports were included. Because of the limited nature of the reports and the absence of randomized trials we did not use the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Similarly, because of the limited scope of the cohort studies, we did not use the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to rate the studies.</p>
