<p id="p0050">A systematic search in the literature published in the PubMed and Embase databases was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Literature review was done of available literature in English, both published and peer-reviewed on-line publications from 1996 to April 6, 2020. Additional sources were identified from citations of retrieved literature. The search strategy for the PubMed and Embase searches is shown later in this article. There was no limitation on sample size. Published reports of experiences with the SARSâ€“CoV-2 virus have increased greatly in the past months, but no randomized trials to date regarding possible treatments were identified. Most reports pertaining to reproduction or pregnancy involved small cohorts, case reports, guidelines, and editorials. Similarly, prior publications of other coronaviruses were limited in number.</p>
