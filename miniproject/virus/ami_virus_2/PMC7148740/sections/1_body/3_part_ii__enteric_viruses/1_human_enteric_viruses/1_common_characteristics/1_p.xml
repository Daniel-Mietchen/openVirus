<p id="p0220">Human enteric viruses are those that colonize the gastrointestinal tract. These organisms are excreted in large amounts in the stool of infected persons. These viruses have a high serotypic variability. Indeed, more than 140 different serotypes of human enteric viruses have been detected in the domestic releases. These viruses can infect both surface and groundwater. In the environment, these organisms do not multiply, because their multiplication requires adapted host cells such as the intestinal epithelial cells. The effectiveness of water treatment methods remains limited with respect to these microorganisms. This is the case for all oral–fecal transmission viruses via drinking waters and contaminated foods, but also other vectors of fecal–oral transmission. These viruses are responsible for various pathologies (
