An observation with the electron microscope was possible after the agglutination of particles by antibodies from the serum of a convalescent patient (

Thanks to the analysis of the genome, which is a single-stranded RNA of 7–8 kb, the Norwalk virus was then classified in the Caliciviridae family and in the gender NoV. This genus includes five genogroups whose genogroups I, II, and IV are pathogenic for humans (
