<p id="p0390">Only one serotype of HAV has been identified but several genotypes are described. The genotyping based on the sequence of the junction VP1–2 revealed 7 genotypes (

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Costa-Mattioli et al. (2002)</xref> and Read (2004) have proposed a new classification based on the complete analysis of the 900 nt of the sequence of the protein VP1: genotypes I and III are divided into two subgenotypes A and B, whereas the former genotypes II and VII are grouped into subgenotypes IIA and IIB, respectively.
