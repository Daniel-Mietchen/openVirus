<p id="p0315">Adenoviruses belong to the Mastadenovirus genus within the family Adenoviridae. Their genome consists of linear double-stranded DNA. Adenoviruses are the particles with 60–90 N m diameter, without envelope, including the capsid. It is formed of 252 capsomeres (240 hexons and 12 pentons). The genome is double-stranded DNA of 26–45 kb approximately, coding for 40 proteins, including the proteins of the capsid, the proteins of cores, and the proteins that are essential for the infectious viral cycle (
