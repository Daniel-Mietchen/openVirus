Wind is a crucial factor in the transmission of respiratory infectious diseases and it may modulate the dynamics of various vectors and pathogens (

GHSI is the first comprehensive assessment of global health security capabilities to be employed in 195 countries; the 2019 GHSI report scored (out of 100) the country-level capacity for “early detection and reporting for epidemics of potential concern.” HDI is a summary measure of average achievement in three key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. Population density is expressed as the number of people per square mile of land area; a high population density can promote the spread of epidemics (
