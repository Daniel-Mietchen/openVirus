<p id="p0115">Other studies have reported conflicting results. A study in 122 cities in China demonstrated that when the mean temperature (lag 0–14) was below 3 °C, the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased by 4.861% (95% CI: 3.209, 6.513%) for every 1 °C rise in temperature (

Another study investigated the daily deaths of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, from January 20 to February 29, 2020, which revealed that diurnal temperature ranges were positively correlated with daily COVID-19 deaths (

 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). However, these results were not stable, because the temperature was related to the reduction in COVID-19 deaths in lag 3 [−7.50% (95% CI: −10.99%, −3.88%)] and lag 5. These studies did not report the same trends as our study, which may be because of the different characteristics of the participants and different models. The conflicting study was only conducted in China and the temperature range was limited, whereas our study analyzed several countries.
