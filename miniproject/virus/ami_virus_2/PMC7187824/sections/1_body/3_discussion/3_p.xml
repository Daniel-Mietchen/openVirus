<p id="p0110">Few studies have investigated the association of temperature and humidity with COVID-19 incidence and death rates. A preprint study, which investigated the total confirmed cases in 429 cities globally from January 20 to February 4, 2020 indicated that the cumulative number of confirmed cases reduced by 0.86 for every 1 °C increase in the minimum temperature of higher-temperature cities (

 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Bannister-Tyrrell et al. (2020)</xref> reported that as of February 29, 2020, average temperature increases of 1 °C were negatively correlated with the predicted number of cases worldwide (excluding Hubei Province). Furthermore, a study reported that relative humidity was inversely related to daily deaths of COVID-19 (
