The future growth trend of COVID-19 has attracted considerable attention as the northern hemisphere enters summer. Our results suggest that the growth rate of COVID-19 may slow with an increase in temperature and humidity. However, COVID-19 is in a stage of high infectivity and rapid transmission. The latest study estimated that the basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 was approximately 5.7 (95% CI: 3.8â€“8.9) (

Countries must take active measures to control the first pandemic and prevent a second wave of COVID-19 (
