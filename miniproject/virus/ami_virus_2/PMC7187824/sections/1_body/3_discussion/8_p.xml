<p id="p0135">The advantages of this study are as follows. First, all countries in which COVID-19 cases had been reported, as of March 27, 2020, were included in our study; thus the results reflect the global COVID-19 situation. Second, this study was a time series analysis, which eliminated the long-term trend of the COVID-19 epidemic, and daily meteorological data were used to accurately reflect the effect of temperature and humidity on the daily new cases and daily new deaths of COVID-19. Third, this study further included variables that reflected economic level, medical conditions, population aging, and population density to reduce confounding bias.</p>
