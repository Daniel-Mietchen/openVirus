<p id="p0120">There are several possible explanations for our findings. Firstly, studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to high temperature and humidity (

 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Xie and Zhu, 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al., 2020</xref>). A laboratory study by 
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Chin et al. (2020)</xref> demonstrated a 0.7 log-unit reduction after 14 days of incubation in the virus transport medium at 4 °C (final concentration ~ 6.8 log-unit of 50% tissue culture infectious dose per mL); over 3 log-unit reduction after 7 days of incubation at 22 °C, and no virus detected at 14 days; over 3 log-unit reduction after 1 day of incubation at 37 °C, and no detection afterward. Moreover, a study by 
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">van Doremalen et al. (2020)</xref> demonstrated that under experimental conditions, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to that of SARS-CoV. 
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al. (2011)</xref> reported that at temperatures of 22–25 °C and relative humidity of 40%–50%, dried SARS-CoV could survive for over 5 days on smooth surfaces. However, the viability of SARS-CoV reduced rapidly when the temperature or relative humidity increased. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may be less stable in high-temperature and high-humidity environments. Second, the moisture in the exhaled bioaerosols evaporates rapidly in low relative humidity, forming droplet nuclei that remain in the air for longer, thereby increasing the likelihood of pathogen transmission (

 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Tellier, 2006</xref>). Third, the cold weather in winter hinders humans' innate immunity. Cold temperatures cause reduced blood supply and thus reduce the provision of immune cells to the nasal mucosa (
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, low humidity reduces the airway cilia cells' ability to remove virus particles, secrete mucus, and repair airway cells, thus exposing the host to the virus (
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Lowen et al., 2007</xref>). During viral infections, cells release signal proteins to alert neighboring cells of the danger of virus invasion. However, this innate immune defense system is compromised in low-humidity environments (
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Kudo et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the human body is at a higher risk of infection by viruses in low-temperature and low-humidity environments.
