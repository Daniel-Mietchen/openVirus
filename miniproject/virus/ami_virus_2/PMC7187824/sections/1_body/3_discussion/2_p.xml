Our findings revealed that temperature and humidity were inversely correlated with daily new cases and deaths of COVID-19. For every 1 °C increase in temperature, daily new cases of COVID-19 reduced by 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) and daily new deaths reduced by 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%); for every 1% increase in humidity, daily new cases of COVID-19 reduced by 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%), and daily new deaths reduced by 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%), according to analyses of 166 countries. After adjusting for potential factors and lag days, the negative relationships remained robust. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the effects of temperature and humidity on daily cases and deaths of COVID-19 may not be evident in countries where the community transmission of COVID-19 had not occurred because the proportion of imported cases was high. Therefore, countries where the time of onset was fewer than 10 days prior, or countries with fewer than 100 cumulative confirmed cases were excluded in the sensitivity analysis. The model-fitting results remained stable.
