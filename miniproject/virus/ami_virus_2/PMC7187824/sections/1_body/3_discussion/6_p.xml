<p id="p0125">Most respiratory viruses exhibit a seasonal trend of infection, such as the influenza virus, SARS-CoV. In 2019, a study by 
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Price et al. (2019)</xref> demonstrated that the respiratory syncytial virus and influenza A virus exhibited obvious seasonality, peaking in November–December and December–January, respectively. In 2010, 
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Gaunt et al. (2010)</xref> analyzed samples from 11,661 patients with respiratory tract infection from Edinburgh Hospital. This study reported that three types of coronavirus (HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43) had significant winter seasonality, mainly causing infection between December and April, which is similar to the transmission pattern of influenza (

 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al. (2006)</xref> analyzed the potential effect of environmental factors on the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. The results revealed that temperature was significantly correlated with the spread of SARS after adjustment for several factors, including various interventions, the number of medical staffs infected, the number of patients in intensive care units. The risk of increased daily incidence of SARS in lower temperatures was 18.18-fold (95% CI: 5.6, 8.8) higher than that in higher temperatures (
