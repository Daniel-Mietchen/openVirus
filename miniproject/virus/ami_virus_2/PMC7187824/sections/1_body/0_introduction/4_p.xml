 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Chin et al. (2020)</xref> reported that SARS-CoV-2 was highly stable at 4 °C but sensitive to heat. The virus survival time was shortened to 5 min as the incubation temperature increased to 70 °C. Epidemiological studies have explored the relationship between COVID-19 and meteorological parameters; however, findings are controversial (

 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Xie and Zhu (2020)</xref> reported that a 1 °C rise was associated with a 4.861% increase in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19, when mean temperature (lag 0–14) was below 3 °C. A study by 
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al. (2020)</xref> reported a positive association between daily deaths of COVID-19 and diurnal temperature range, and a negative association for relative humidity. However, a study by 
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Yao et al. (2020)</xref> reported that COVID-19 transmission did not exhibit an association with temperature in Chinese cities.
