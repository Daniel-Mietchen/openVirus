<p id="p0100">The cumulative number of cases and the outbreak time of COVID-19 exhibited a large variation between countries; thus the transmission mode and rate of COVID-19 differ between countries. We selected countries that reported their first case over 10 days before data collection and countries with over 100 cumulative cases to fit the core model. Among countries with over 10 days since the first reported case, a 1 °C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.05% and 1.22% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively, and a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.87% and 0.51% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively. In countries with over 100 cumulative cases, a 1 °C increase in temperature was associated with a 2.82% and 1.25% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively; a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.86% and 0.53% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively. The results of the comparisons of these datasets with the total data were not significant. These results demonstrate a robust effect of temperature and relative humidity on daily new cases and new deaths of COVID-19 (
