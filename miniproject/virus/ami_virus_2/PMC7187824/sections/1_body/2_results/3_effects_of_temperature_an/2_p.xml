<p id="p0090">After controlling the effects of potential confounders, temperature and relative humidity were both negatively related to the daily new cases and daily new deaths. A 1 °C increase in temperature was associated with a 3.08% (95% CI: 1.53%, 4.63%) reduction in daily new cases and a 1.19% (95% CI: 0.44%, 1.95%) reduction in daily new deaths. A 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.51%, 1.19%) reduction in daily new cases and a 0.51% (95% CI: 0.34%, 0.67%) reduction in daily new deaths. Different lag structures also indicated that temperature and relative humidity were negatively correlated with daily new cases and daily new deaths (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). The strongest cumulative effects were observed at lag 03, with a 1 °C increase in temperature being associated with a 5.94% and 2.30% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively, a 1% increase in relative humidity being associated with a 1.23% and 0.88% reduction in daily new cases and daily new deaths, respectively.
