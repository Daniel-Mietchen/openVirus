<p>Nuclear Medicine is slightly fortunate in that the majority of our scans and therapies tend to be outpatient, elective studies, and the new studies are usually in in-patients who would have been screened for COVID-19 on the wards before being transferred for scans. Unfortunately for us, in general there is no portability in our SPECT and PET scanners, not to mention the need for patients to be injected with radiopharmaceuticals. The option of reducing patient transport by portable machinery is limited to us in nuclear medicine departments.</p>
