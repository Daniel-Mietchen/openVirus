<p id="Par1">Humankind is currently confronting a new type of coronavirus, and it may take considerable time before the human population and the virus arrive at a mutual equilibrium. The first patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were recorded in December 2019 in China (Zhu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>), and since then the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally. Other reputed members of the coronavirus family are SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, which caused zoonotic events that resulted in epidemics in 2002 and 2012, respectively (Peiris et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>; Zaki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>). According to the WHO (22/4/2020), more than 2,400,000 individuals have been infected by SARS-CoV-2, and at least 165,000 have succumbed to the disease (

Most patients with COVID-19 suffer from severe respiratory problems, and elderly people in particular or persons with comorbidities seem to be at greatest risk (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). The fatality rates for males are two to three times higher than for females (Porcheddu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>), but seem to fluctuate depending on the territory and demography of the population. Gender-related social factors, immunological differences, hormonal disparaties, and lifestyle habits such as smoking and alcohol consumption are considered to play a role (Wenham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). The vulnerability of the male population with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic may to some extent be a result of gender-defined genetic polymorphisms.
