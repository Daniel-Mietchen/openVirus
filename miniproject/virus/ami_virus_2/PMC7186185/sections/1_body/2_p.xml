<p id="Par3">Another group of promising candidates could be genes involved in immunity. One of the prominent families that senses infection, and that is essential to the innate immune system, comprises the Toll-like receptors (TLR) (Akira and Takeda 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2004</xref>). In humans, there are 10 different members, and each of them can be activated by different types of ligands stemming from disparate pathogens. TLR often act in the form of homo- or heterodimers, and play a role in clearing infections. Some TLR types are expressed on the cell surface, but the ones present on intracellular membranes of endosomes (TLR3, 7, 8, and 9) are intended to register, though not exclusively, viral infections by detecting foreign types of nucleic acids (Fitzgerald and Kagan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). The nuclear material of coronaviruses is single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). TLR3 and 9 interact with double-stranded viral RNA and unmethylated CpG DNA from bacteria and viruses, respectively (Parker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2007</xref>). TLR3 may respond to infections by the West Nile virus – also an ssRNA virus – in a rodent model (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>). In contrast to TLR3 and 9, the structurally related TLR7 and 8 tandem is encoded by the female X chromosome (Armant and Fenton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2002</xref>). Therefore, these latter two genes may represent gender-related risk factors. The prominent ligand for TLR7 and 8 is viral ssRNA (Diebold et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>; Heil et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>) and, more specifically for TLR8, its RNAse T2 degredation products (Greulich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>). In humans, TLR7 is constitutively expressed on the membranes of endosomes in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (DC) and B lymphocytes, whereas TLR8 is more prominently present in cells of the myeloid lineage such as monocytes and neutrophils (Hornung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2002</xref>). TLR7-positive plamacytoid cells are copiously present in lung tissue (Plantinga et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>). Upon activation of the TLR7 pathway, for instance by the influenza virus, plasmacytoid DC have the capacity to produce significant amounts of type I interferon (Di Domizio et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2009</xref>). Moreover, TLR8 is present in the lung, and is known to act upon infection by various viruses (Beignon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>; Heil et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>). An immune response activated via the TLR7 and/or 8 pathway may also induce unwanted side effects. SARS-Cov-1, for instance, may induce a cytokine storm (Tang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>), and the viral activation of neutrophils in the case of asthma may result in lung pathology (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>). One of the two female sex chromosomes is generally inactivated in females (Lyon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1992</xref>; Schurz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>). In female immune cells, however, TLR7 genes – and probably TLR8 – escape such silencing. As a consequence, the genetic information on both chromosomes is expressed, whereas male individuals possess only a single copy of the X chromosome (Souyris et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>). Gender-related expression profiles may result in a prominent dosage effect in which females are more prone to activate an immune response to single-stranded viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the induction of cytokine profiles seems also to be dose dependent on the amount of genetic material delivered by the virus (Tang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>).
