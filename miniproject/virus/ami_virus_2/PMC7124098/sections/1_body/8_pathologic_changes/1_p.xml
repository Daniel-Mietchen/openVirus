<p>SARS-CoV affects multiple organs but the major pathology is in the lungs. Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is the primary histologic finding, and the phase of DAD varies based on duration of illness. Cases of short duration, 10 days or less, demonstrate acute-phase DAD characterized by hyaline membranes lining alveolar walls, interstitial and airspace edema, mild chronic interstitial inflammation, and vascular congestion (Fig.

Bronchiolar injury is evidenced by luminal collections of fibrin associated with loss of cilia, denudation of bronchiolar epithelium, and deposition of fibrin on exposed basement membranes. Cases of more than 10 days duration exhibit organizing-phase DAD characterized by interstitial and airspace fibroblast proliferation accompanied by repair including type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and airway-centered squamous metaplasia. Hyperplastic type II cells show marked cytologic change, including cytomegaly, nucleomegaly, clearing of nuclear chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. Alveolar spaces contain a combination of macrophages and desquamated pneumocytes including multinucleated forms of both. Acute bronchopneumonia is a common feature in organizing-phase DAD, and fibrin thrombi may also be present. Intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions have been variably reported, but SARS lacks a unique tissue response and cytopathic effect, making diagnosis by light microscopy alone difficult. After several weeks there can be progression of the organizing phase to the fibrotic phase, with extensive restructuring of the lung parenchyma and development of honeycomb lung (Franks et al.
