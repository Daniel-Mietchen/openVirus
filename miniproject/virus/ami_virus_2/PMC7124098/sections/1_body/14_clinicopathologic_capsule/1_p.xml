<p>Of the six human coronaviruses recognized to date, SARS-CoV is the most aggressive. Four of the non-SARS coronaviruses mainly cause upper respiratory tract infections that are more common in children than in adults. The fifth non-SARS coronavirus, MERS-CoV, reportedly causes severe acute pneumonia similar to SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV has been identified as the etiologic agent for SARS, which caused 8,098 infections in 26 countries with 774 deaths during the 2002â€“2003 epidemic. Initial signs and symptoms of SARS are nonspecific and common, thereby generating a wide differential diagnosis of more commonly occurring lower respiratory tract pathogens. SARS primarily targets the lungs and produces a viral pneumonia with a high mortality rate. DAD is the histopathologic hallmark of SARS and the phase of DAD varies with the duration of illness: acute-phase DAD is seen in illnesses of 10 days or less, whereas organizing-phase DAD is associated with illnesses greater than 10 days in duration. SARS has no vaccine and no treatment.</p>
