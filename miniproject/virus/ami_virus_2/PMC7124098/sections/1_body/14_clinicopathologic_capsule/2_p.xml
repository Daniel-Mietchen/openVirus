<p>Currently, the world is in an interepidemic period for SARS. Resurgence of SARS remains a distinct possibility, as the circumstances that allowed a SARS-COV-like virus to cross the species barrier from animals to humans in the live-animal markets of southern China still exist. All countries must be vigilant for reemergence of SARS because, in the absence of a vaccine and specific therapy, containment through the classical epidemiologic procedures of early case detection, isolation, and infection control, contact tracing, and follow-up surveillance remain our only tools to contain local spread of infection and prevent international dissemination.</p>
