<p>Coronaviruses infect many birds and mammals, including humans, causing respiratory tract, enteric, hepatic, renal, and central nervous system diseases of varying severity. Since the isolation of the prototype murine virus in 1949 (Cheever and Daniels

 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> have been recognized primarily for causing a wide range of economically significant diseases in farm animals and domesticated pets, while the two known human coronaviruses,
