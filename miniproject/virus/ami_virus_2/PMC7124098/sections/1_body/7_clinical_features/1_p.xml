<p>The mean incubation period for SARS is 5 days with a range of 2â€“10 days. The clinical course of SARS follows a typical pattern that parallels viral load. The first week of illness is an influenza-like prodrome with fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, and rigors that coincide with increasing viral load. A decreasing viral load accompanies the second week of illness that is characterized by dry cough, dyspnea, and hypoxemia. Up to 70 % of patients develop large volume watery diarrhea. Clinical deterioration with rapidly progressive respiratory distress occurs in severe cases with approximately 20 % requiring intensive care. Progression to respiratory failure is the most common cause of death. Transmission occurs primarily in the second week (Hui and Chan
