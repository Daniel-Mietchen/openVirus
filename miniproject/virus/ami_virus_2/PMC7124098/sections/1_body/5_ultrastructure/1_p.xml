<p>Coronaviruses are the largest of all RNA viruses and have a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of 30–32 kilobases. Virions are enveloped and spherical with widely spaced club-shaped surface projections that give the virus its unique coronal fringe by negative-staining electron microscopy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">13.1</xref>). Cryo-electron microscopy reveals an outer envelope diameter of 85 ± 5 nm with 20 nm club-shaped surface projections, an exceptionally thick, 7.8 ± 0.7 nm envelope and a loosely wound, helical nucleocapsid separated from the envelope by a 4 nm gap. Certain structural proteins are common to all coronaviruses: the spike glycoprotein S, an envelope glycoprotein that mediates receptor-binding and membrane fusion; the envelope spanning glycoprotein M, which contributes to the thickness of the envelop; the envelope protein E, which has been identified as a virulence factor SARS-CoV
