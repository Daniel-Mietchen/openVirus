<p>SARS-CoV is an animal virus that crossed the species barrier when environmental change increased chances for the virus to enter humans and enable human-to-human transmission (Antia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>). Supporting this, research has identified a SARS-CoV-like virus in Himalayan masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, and Chinese ferret badgers sold in live-animal markets for human consumption in southern China, as well as, in humans working in the same markets indicating a route of interspecies transmission. Horseshoe bats have been identified as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses (Guan et al.
