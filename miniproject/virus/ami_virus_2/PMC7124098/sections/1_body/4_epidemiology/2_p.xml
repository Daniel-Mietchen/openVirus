<p>In contrast, most of the non-SARS human coronaviruses have been in continuous circulation globally since their initial isolation. They emerge in winter and spring and demonstrate periodicity with epidemics occurring at 2 to 3 year intervals. They primarily cause upper respiratory tract infections that are more common in children than in adults, and they account for an estimated 15 % of adult colds and up to 35 % of upper respiratory tract infections during peak viral activity. Less commonly, they are associated with lower respiratory tract disease in infants, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly (Gerna et al.
