<p>SARS-CoV is highly contagious, and spread occurs primarily by close person-to-person contact via droplet transmission or fomite. Virus is shed in respiratory secretions, feces, and urine. At room temperature it retains its infectivity for 4 days in diarrheal stool samples, for up to 6 days when dried, and for more than 7 days in respiratory specimens. The virus is readily inactivated by commonly used disinfectants (Lai et al.
