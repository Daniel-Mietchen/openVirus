<p>SARS-CoV is internalized through binding of the spike glycoprotein to the host cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2004</xref>). Binding initiates conformational change in the spike that mediates fusion of the viral and host cell membranes and release of the nucleocapsid into the target cell allowing for disassembly and replication of the genome. Spike-mediated cell-to-cell fusion can occur and promotes syncytium formation and viral spread (Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>).
