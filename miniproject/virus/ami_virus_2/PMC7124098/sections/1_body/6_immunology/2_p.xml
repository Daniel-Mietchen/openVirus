<p>Once internalized, the specific mechanism by which the human immune system responds to SARS-CoV is not well understood, and a particular area of controversy is the role of interferon (IFN). Cameron and colleagues measured plasma levels of IFN during the natural history of SARS in 40 patients. They found high IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IFN-stimulated chemokine levels, and robust antiviral IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression was present early in the course of illness. Patients entered a crisis phase starting at approximately day 8, and most patients resolved IFN responses at crisis and expressed adaptive immune genes as they recovered. In contrast, patients with poor outcomes demonstrated deviated ISG and immunoglobulin gene expression levels, persistent chemokine levels, and deficient anti-SARS spike antibody production, suggesting a malfunction in the switch from innate to adaptive immunity (Cameron et al.
