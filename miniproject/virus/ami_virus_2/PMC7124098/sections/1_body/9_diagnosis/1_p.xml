<p>There are no clinical or laboratory findings that reliably diagnose SARS-CoV infection early or rapidly enough to inform management decisions that must be made soon after a patient enters the healthcare system in order to contain potential infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection and initiation of isolation and stringent infection control measures should be based on risk of exposure. In the absence of person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV anywhere in the world, the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection should be considered only in patients who require hospitalization for radiologically confirmed pneumonia and who have an epidemiologic history that raises suspicion of SARS-CoV infection. Suspicion is heightened when the patient, within 10 days of onset of illness, has a history of recent travel to mainland China, Hong Kong, or Taiwan, or close contact with ill persons with a history of travel to these areas, or is employed in an occupation at risk for SARS-CoV, or is part of a cluster of cases of atypical pneumonia without an alternative diagnosis. Laboratory testing for SARS-CoV is available, including antibody detection by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, the positive predictive value of a diagnostic test is very low in the absence of person-to-person transmission worldwide, and the CDC recommends testing be performed judiciously and in consultation with local or state health departments (CDC
