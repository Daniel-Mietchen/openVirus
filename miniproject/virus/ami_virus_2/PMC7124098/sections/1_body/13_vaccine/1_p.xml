<p>Efforts to develop a SARS vaccine have been ongoing since the epidemic of 2002â€“2003, and significant advances have been made in our understanding of SARS-CoV. Notably, the domains of the S glycoprotein that allow for viral infection have been identified, ACE2 has been determined to be a surface receptor for binding the S glycoprotein, and the regions of interaction between the S glycoprotein and ACE2 have been mapped. All of these present targets for vaccine development. However, much of the immunology and pathogenesis of SARS is incompletely understood. Of particular concern is the potential for a SARS vaccine to trigger immunopathogenic mechanisms which could lead to more severe disease in vaccines, as has been observed with some veterinary coronavirus vaccines. Additionally, coronaviruses are notorious for their frequent mutations which further complicate development of a suitable vaccine. Currently there are no licensed vaccines for use in SARS (NIAID
