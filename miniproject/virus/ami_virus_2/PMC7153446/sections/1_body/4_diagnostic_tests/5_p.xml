<p id="Par29">Microbiologic investigations to determine etiology are increasingly being performed due to the availability of molecular and standard virologic methods. These tests are usually not recommended for diagnosis in mild cases of croup, but may be warranted in children hospitalized and/or requiring mechanical ventilation. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and viral cultures are also indicated with atypical courses of the infection, as described by reports of novel pathogenic strains for viral croup, e.g. coronavirus NL63 detected in samples isolated from Europe [

According to one study, the application of PCR increases the sensitivity of respiratory viral diagnosis, with results being made available within 6 h, thus increasing clinical relevance [
