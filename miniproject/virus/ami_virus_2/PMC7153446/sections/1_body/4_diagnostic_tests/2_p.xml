<p id="Par26"> Plain film radiography often is utilized to evaluate laryngotracheal edema in croup, but has inconsistent results. The typical picture is that of narrowing of laryngeal air column in the subglottic segment, approximately for ~5â€“10 mm below the level of the vocal cords, resulting from mucosal edema [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">12.1</xref>), but is observed only in ~50 % of instances [

The best practice in these circumstances is to consider radiographs in those children in whom the clinical presentation is atypical and whose respiratory status is stable enough to undergo positioning prior to obtaining the films [
