<p id="Par39">As the etiology of croup is not bacterial, there is no role for routine use of antibiotics. In the past, inappropriately prescribed antibiotics have been reported to cause superinfections, prolongation of hospital stay as well as general increase in costs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, when the diagnosis of bacterial tracheitis is strongly suspected, the management changes wherein culture-directed antibiotic therapy is the gold standard of treatment. Empiric therapy with coverage that includes 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae</italic> is indicated. In an era when both hospital-acquired and community-acquired methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) are prevalent, the combination of vancomycin and a third generation cephalosporin (such as cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) is a reasonable choice until identification and susceptibility of the causative organism is established. In an intubated patient, tracheal aspirates should be obtained. A very useful adjunct to anti-microbial therapy is the use of frequent pulmonary toilet and debridement of tracheal pseudomembranes under bronchoscopic guidance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In the presence of other co-morbidities such as immunosuppression, mortality increases. Reported complications of bacterial tracheitis include pneumomediastinum, sepsis and multi-organ failure, bronchospasm and impaired gas-exchange due to the burden of pseudomembranes with toxic shock syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Severe croup caused by influenza viruses as a part of epidemics may require treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors [
