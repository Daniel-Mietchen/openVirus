<p id="Par38">Since its description in 1979, use of helium as a carrier for oxygen (heliox) has beneficial effects in reducing eddy currents that interact with each other and thereby reduce turbulent flow. Heliox is routinely used in children with post-extubation stridor to reduce the risk of re-intubation. As an appreciable number of children with severe croup progress to respiratory failure needing an artificial airway, using heliox can reduce the work of breathing by easing the delivery of oxygen to the lower airway past the site of obstruction. Assessments with Croup Scores and blood gas analyses reaffirm the beneficial role of heliox as a useful adjunct to potentially circumvent the need for endotracheal intubation [
