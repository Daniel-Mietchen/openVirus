<p id="Par37">When respiratory failure is impending (cyanosis, severe retractions with lack of airflow, and persistent desaturations), endotracheal intubation is indicated until laryngeal edema resolves. This is usually transient and rarely evolves into a need for long-term mechanical ventilation, In children treated with steroids during the course of intubation, the time to extubation is shortened and the need for reintubation also is reduced [
