<p id="Par36"> The primary benefit offered by the use of aerosolized/nebulized epinephrine is the reduced need for intubation. Early studies showed immediate clinical benefit with use of 2.25 % racemic epinephrine, and the more recent studies demonstrated the same amount of benefit for L-epinephrine at a ratio of 1:1000 used with 5 mL saline [

The therapeutic effects of epinephrine are mediated via α-adrenergic receptors that results in constriction of capillary arterioles and reduced inflammation. Unfortunately, although the effects are almost immediate, they only last approximately 2 h, and hence the child should be watched for a reasonable period of time prior to discharge. This therapy may be suitable even in the outpatient setting if the observation period is adequate, although lack of improvement at about an hour following treatment may convert an outpatient encounter to hospitalization [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. With the peak effect occurring between 30 and 60 min, the child should be carefully monitored for the rebound effect—which usually occurs 3 h after treatment. The recommended dose is thus 2.25 % (0.25 mL in 3.75 mL of saline) for children &lt;6 months of age and 0.5 mL for infants and children &gt;6 months. Substituting isotonic with hypertonic saline (3 %) may enhance the effect by absorbing water from the submucosa.
