<p id="Par35">Other investigators have shown that orally administered dexamethasone is as efficacious as parenteral formulations. The choice of route should hence be determined based on cost and availability. Yet another study failed to show differences in therapeutic benefit between three different doses (0.15, 0.3 and 0.6 mg · Kg
 <sup>−1</sup>) of dexamethasone, so a single dose (0.6 mg · Kg
 <sup>−1</sup>
 <sub>;</sub> maximum of 8 mg) may be sufficient in the outpatient setting [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In this study, the overall rates of hospitalization were much less in the group treated with dexamethasone (23 %), compared with budesonide (38 %) and far less compared with placebo (77 %). Other studies have also advocated for the use of aerosolized budesonide given the rapidity of its action and effectiveness comparable to that of nebulized epinephrine [
