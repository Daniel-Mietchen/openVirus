<p id="Par32"> Croup kettles were first introduced in the late nineteenth century to provide aerosolized mist to alleviate the symptoms of viral croup [

There are at least three postulated mechanisms, which include (i) a soothing effect on inflamed mucosa, (ii) reduced viscosity of tracheal secretions and (iii) activation of laryngeal mechanoreceptors leading to reduction of turbulence [

Recent studies have, however, shown that the benefits offered by mist treatment may be overemphasized. Three separate studies, that did not include untreated controls, determined that the efficacy of aerosolized mist may not be proportional to the degree of mist saturation, for e.g. the effects of humidity at three different levels (100 %, 40 % and 33 %) remained the same [
