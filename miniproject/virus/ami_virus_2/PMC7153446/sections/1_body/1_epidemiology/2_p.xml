<p id="Par7"> Viral croup has the highest incidence in the second year of life and is virtually non-existent in the first 3 months. The incidence is slightly higher in male children (odds ratio = 1.43), and is highest in late fall and early winter [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) studied the overall burden of croup and showed that the mean annual number of croup hospitalizations is about 41,000 (range, 27,000–62,000/year) in the U.S. Ninety-one percent of hospitalizations occur among children &lt;5 years of age. The authors also reported that minor peaks in croup hospitalizations occurred each year in February, and major peaks occurred in October of odd-numbered years, which coincides with peak parainfluenza type 1 activity.
