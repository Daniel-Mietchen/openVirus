<p id="Par41">Despite the relative commonality of laryngotracheal infections, there are no clearly defined guidelines by national organizations for their treatment. The clinical picture can be often frightening to the parents who bring the child to the emergency room. Fortunately, the vast majority of children show signs of rapid improvement after initiation of treatment using steroids and racemic epinephrine. Only a very small proportion of children require hospitalization and an even smaller proportion require intubation and mechanical ventilation. Complications are rare exceedingly rare. In contrast, bacterial tracheitis may have varied presentations and often requires endotracheal intubation and debridement in the operating room. Mortality is higher but early institution of culture-directed therapy is known to reduce the severity of disease and the incidence of complications. It is important for the astute clinician to recognize the symptoms of croup and maintain a high index of suspicion for conditions that masquerade as croup, such as a foreign body, supraglottitis (epiglottitis), subglottic stenosis and other anatomic abnormalities. </p>
