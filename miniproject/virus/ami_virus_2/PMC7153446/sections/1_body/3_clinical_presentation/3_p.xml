<p id="Par18">The typical course of progression goes through stridor that is inspiratory in nature but may also be associated with an expiratory component that results from unique features of the larynx in young children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The infant larynx is narrowest in the subglottic segment, and inflammation of this area results in a fixed obstruction that leads to expiratory stridor. Children presenting multiple times with acute viral croup may have a masked presentation of subglottic stenosis wherein the already narrowed subglottic larynx is further reduced in diameter due to croup-related inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Hoarseness results from edema of the true vocal cords, often reducing their mobility. Wheezing is infrequently present. With increased severity, suprasternal and intercostal retractions may be present, and tachycardia and tachypnea are relatively common. It is important to note that reduction in the intensity of stridor in a sick-appearing child may be sign of impending respiratory failure as airflow may be reduced to the point where stridor may not be present.
