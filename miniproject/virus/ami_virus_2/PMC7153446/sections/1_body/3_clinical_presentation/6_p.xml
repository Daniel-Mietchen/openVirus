<p id="Par21"> Peltola et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] studied the clinical courses of croup caused by parainfluenza and influenza viruses to highlight the differences in morbidity caused by the different viral strains in hospitalized children. In general, there were no significant differences in the patterns of clinical features due to infections with the three parainfluenza subtypes, except that parainfluenza 3 was associated with wheezing. However, children with croup due to microbiologically-confirmed influenza virus tended to be hospitalized for longer (4 days 
 <italic>vs</italic>. 2 days for parainfluenza). In addition, the rates of readmission were higher for influenza due to the relapsing course of respiratory distress during the few days following discharge. The requirements for corticosteroids as well as supplemental oxygen also tended to be higher for those caused by influenza virus, emphasizing its enhanced virulence.
