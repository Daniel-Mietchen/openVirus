<p id="Par22">Notwithstanding the generally predictable course of viral croup, it is important to differentiate it from other acute disorders of the pediatric airway. Rapidity in progression to high fever, odynophagia, anxiety and relative aphonia should always alert the practitioner to supraglottitis (epiglottitis), which is a rare occurrence following introduction of universal immunization against 
 <italic>Hemophilus influenzae</italic> type b. Posturing in the upright position and extension of the neck with drooling in an anxious-appearing child mandates the need to secure the airway in a controlled setting such as the operating room. Care should be taken to not agitate the child for that may precipitate respiratory collapse. If there is history to suggest incomplete immunization, laryngeal diphtheria should be considered. This condition tends to have a slower progression, and has historically been associated with the presence of exudative membranes in the oropharynx.
