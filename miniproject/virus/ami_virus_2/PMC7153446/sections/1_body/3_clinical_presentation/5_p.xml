<p id="Par20">The severity of viral croup may be assessed using one of the many scoring systems available. The most well-known of these, the Westley Croup Score [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], utilizes key clinical signs including chest retractions, stridor, cyanosis, level of consciousness and air entry to obtain a composite score that is predictive of the need for intubation. As croup is primarily a clinical diagnosis, the utility of the Westley Score, as with other stratification systems, such as the Alberta Clinical Practice Guideline Working Group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], may be limited to use in a research scenario. For example, using the Westley Score, Johnson et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] showed that ≥ 85 % of children present with symptoms of generally mild croup, and less than 1 % were diagnosed with severe croup.
