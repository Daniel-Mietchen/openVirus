<p id="Par23"> Bacterial tracheitis typically is a secondary infection following a primary viral respiratory infection due to a cascade of events resulting from tracheal mucosal injury, impaired phagocytic function and cytopathic effects of the viral infection. This condition usually is recognized after reasonable efforts to treat viral croup have failed. Children with bacterial tracheitis are acutely ill, with symptoms to suggest dehydration and organ failure in the presence of other host factors such as immunodeficiency. Often seen in an inpatient setting in children admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure, bacterial tracheitis can have a variable presentation in the absence of pathognomonic clinical signs [
