<p id="Par10"> Acute laryngotracheitis, considered to be the most common cause for croup, is almost exclusively caused by viral organisms. Both bacteria and viruses may be responsible for infections with collateral components, such as laryngotracheobronchitis, and the more general laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. In 1958, the first evidence for association between croup and two newly isolated myxoviruses, parainfluenza virus types 1 and 2, resulted in separation of two categories of cases—mild, requiring only outpatient follow up, and severe, requiring hospitalization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Parainfluenza is a RNA paramyxovirus that actively replicates in respiratory epithelial cells and is comprised of four major serotypes. Parainfluenza type 3, more commonly associated with bronchiolitis or bronchopneumonia, can also produce severe croup in an endemic pattern, while type 4 is rarely seen. Parainfluenza 1 and 2, account for &gt;65 % of all causes of croup. A large series studied 6165 instances of lower respiratory tract infections (LRIs) wherein approximately 75 % of all isolates were identified as parainfluenza viruses. Of these, parainfluenza type 1 accounted for about 60 %. Conversely, the propensity of the various organisms to produce symptoms of croup reached 60 % for both parainfluenza 1 and 2. For parainfluenza type 3, the number dropped to about 30 %, whereas all the other microorganisms accounted for about 5–15 %. Thus, parainfluenza viruses were the most common cause for all age groups; whereas respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) caused croup in infants and the influenza viruses and
