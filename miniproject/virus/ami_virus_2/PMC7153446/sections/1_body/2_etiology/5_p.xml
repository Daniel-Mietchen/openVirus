<p id="Par14">Given the evolution of design features of modern day endotracheal tubes as well as enhanced monitoring of cuff pressures, reports of laryngotracheitis induced by indwelling endotracheal tubes have largely been limited to historic data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Modern endotracheal tubes use materials that intrinsically inhibit or are coated with substances such as micronized silver to reduce bacterial growth by providing less scaffolding for colonization [
