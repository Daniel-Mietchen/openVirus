<p id="Par11">Among other important viral pathogens causing tracheal infections, RSV was studied in isolates from sentinel practices in England and Wales from 1975 to 1990, during which an increase in mortality, by as much as 60â€“80 %, was observed in comparison with parainfluenza and influenza viruses [

Among the rare viral causes, measles, by virtue of immunosuppression, leads to a bacterial superinfection that results in a condition termed measles-associated bacterial tracheitis (MABT), which carries an increased risk for need of artificial airway and intensive care admission [
