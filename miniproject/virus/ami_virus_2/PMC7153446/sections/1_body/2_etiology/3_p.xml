<p id="Par12"> Bacterial tracheitis is much less common when compared to that of viral origin. Previous reports have shown that the most consistent organism is 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>aureus</italic>, followed by 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Due to the universal immunization against 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> type b, the incidence has dropped significantly. Similarly, immunization against 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>diphtheriae</italic> has restricted the incidence of diphtheritic tracheitis to unimmunized children only. Reports of this are largely limited in modern literature, compared to the beginning of the century when tracheostomy was a routine practice to circumvent acute airway obstruction due to formation of pseudomembranes [
