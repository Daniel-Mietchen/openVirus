<p id="Par13"> Fayon et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] studied independent risk factors for development of bacterial tracheitis in a large series of children admitted to the PICU (n = 955), and found that the incidence of bacterial nosocomial tracheitis in that population was about 1.8 %. The pathogens isolated in this series were in agreement with other studies of bacterial tracheitis, comprising 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and gram-negative bacteria, and sometimes, mixed flora. In this population, tracheitis was attributed to young age, with small-sized airways in which thick secretions and mucosal inflammation being blamed for impairment of air flow and increased stasis. Head trauma, neuromuscular blockade and mechanical ventilation were independent variables that increased the risk of infection, but the last two risk factors may be physiologically collinear, given that most patients who were administered neuromuscular blockade were intubated, and vice versa.
