 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An increase in incidence was observed during each influenza A virus pandemicâ€” H1N1 during the great Spanish flu (1918), Asian flu caused by H2N2 (1957), Hong Kong flu resulting from H3N2 (1968), and more recently the pandemic H1N1 of 2009. Autopsies performed during the 2009 pandemic showed tracheal denudation, maceration, de-epithelialization and other pathologic changes consistent with tracheitis [
