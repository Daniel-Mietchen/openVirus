<p id="Par5">Different diagnostic terms have been used for conditions that affect the larynx and trachea. Although it is useful to distinguish between supraglottic and subglottic laryngitis, this distinction is often difficult when the child is first seen. Laryngotracheitis or croup syndrome is a useful preliminary descriptive diagnosis until more definitive information is available [

In this chapter, “croup” is used to refer to subglottic laryngitis or laryngotracheitis, presumably viral. “ Epiglottitis” is an imprecise term often used in place of the better “ supraglottitis” as the epiglottis may be minimally involved in some cases in which most of the swelling is in the aryepiglottic folds. Preferred terms for tracheal infections are (with the usual terms in parentheses): croup, supraglottitis (epiglottitis), and suppurative tracheitis, laryngotracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, or laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis (bacterial tracheitis), depending on the extent of the bacterial superinfection [
