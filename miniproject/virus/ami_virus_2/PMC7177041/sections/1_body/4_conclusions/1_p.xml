<p>During February 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Hubei Province, China, included a 32-day quarantine period. This study aimed to compare the emotional state, somatic responses, sleep quality, and behavior of people in Hubei Province with mon-endemic provinces in China during February 2020. During two weeks in February 2020, front-line health workers and people in Hubei Province became less anxious about the COVID-19 epidemic, but sleep quality did not improve. Despite public awareness, levels of anxiety exist that affect the quality of life during epidemics, including periods of population quarantine or self-isolation. Therefore, health education should be combined with psychological counseling for vulnerable individuals that include people in the general population and specific occupations.</p>
