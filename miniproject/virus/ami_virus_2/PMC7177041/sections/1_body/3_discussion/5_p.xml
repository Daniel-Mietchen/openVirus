<p>In the present study, during the two weeks of the study, the 18–24 year age group had the lowest sleep quality scores when measured using the PSQI questionnaire, and the average score for all the study participants was negative, indicating that sleep quality deteriorated during two weeks as COVID-19 epidemic progressed. The symptoms of inability to fall asleep within 30 minutes and difficulty in staying awake during the day may have been due to three main factors, Firstly, in 2017, Akcali et al. [

Secondly, during the outbreak of COVID-19, the government strongly recommended all the citizens to stay at home as much as possible, but the government did not include a recommendation to maintain daily physical activities while staying home.

Thirdly, especially for the 18–24 year age group, who may have been working or studying at home during the two-week study period, their sleeping habits would have changed without the need to wake up early in the morning, which may have resulted in poor sleep quality and duration from staying up late and sleeping late into the morning.
