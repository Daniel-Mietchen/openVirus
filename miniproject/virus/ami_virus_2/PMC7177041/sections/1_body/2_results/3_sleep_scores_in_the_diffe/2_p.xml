 <xref rid="t4-medscimonit-26-e923767" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the findings of the responses of the study participants for the three specific questions from the PSQI questionnaire on sleep during the two-week study period. For the question regarding the ability to fall asleep in 30 minutes, there were significant differences between the age groups, with this problem being significantly increased in study participants aged between 25–39 years (P=0.030). For the question regarding having to get up at night and go to the bathroom, there were significant differences between the age groups, with this problem being significantly increased in study participants aged between 25–39 years (P=0.001). For the question regarding difficulty in staying awake during the day, most people responded that this was not relevant. During two weeks in February 2020, the study participants in the 18–24 year study group had reduced sleep quality (9.19%) when compared with other age groups.
