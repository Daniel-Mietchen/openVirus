<p>The numbers of reported 2019‐nCoV infections have increased rapidly, and many countries have reported infections for the first time. This indicates the disease has broad geographical, security and political implications. Whilst the control of an infectious respiratory disease relies on established principles of early detection, isolation, hygiene and social distancing, we face many gaps in our knowledge of this new pathogen such as its source, immunity in exposed individuals, the potential for vaccine development and the accuracy of diagnosis. How this pathogen emerged and the drivers of that emergence will be the subject of intense research in the months and years to come. With the examples of SARS and MERS—in which wildlife such as bats have been identified as a reservoir—2019‐nCoV is likely to become another example of an emerging zoonosis. Recent estimates of the basic reproductive number of 2019‐nCoV include 2.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.4–3.9) and 2.68 (95% credible interval 2.47–2.86) (Li et al.,

 <xref rid="tbed13509-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Although these are less than that estimated for SARS (3.0), it highlights the challenge for control given that spread to major, densely populated Chinese cities has already occurred (Li et al.,

 <xref rid="tbed13509-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>), and the strain on resources with an estimated epidemic doubling time of 6.4 days (95% credible interval 5.8–7.1) (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="tbed13509-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). It can be assumed that what began as a point source epidemic in Wuhan quickly has become an extended propagating pandemic. Of concern are super‐spreading events, which are yet to be identified (Li et al.,
