<p>Isolates of 2019‐nCoV to date are morphologically identical to coronaviruses under the electron microscope. Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which contain several viruses lethal to humans including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> family consists of four genera, 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Gammacoronavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> (Chen, Liu, &amp; Guo, 
 <xref rid="tbed13509-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). Based on genetic properties, 2019‐nCoV belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus.</italic> In a positive sign of research collaboration, 2019‐nCoV sequences are being shared to enable analysis to generate insights into this novel pathogen (
