<p>The initial 2019‐nCoV infections were apparently transmitted from wild animals to human. With the increased number of human infection cases and extended geographical distribution, human‐to‐human transmission of 2019‐nCoV was confirmed (Chan et al., 2020). Although the viruses were successfully isolated from cells, the exact infection mechanisms remain unclear. The computational remodelling of 2019‐nCoV S‐protein, the virus protein binding to host receptors, revealed its high tendency to interact with human ACE2 receptor (Xu et al.,
