<p>The emergence of zoonotic pathogens in human populations involves a complex causal web, with both proximal and distant drivers such as urbanization, climate change, global trade and the movement of people, ecosystem destruction and the bushmeat trade. Anticipating emergence is extraordinarily challenging and relies on sustained surveillance, data collection and novel approaches to data analysis. There are numerous reasons to invest in such research, from influenza to Ebola to SARS to 2019‐nCoV. 
 <italic>Transboundary and Emerging Diseases</italic> is committed to publishing high‐quality research on 2019‐nCoV.
