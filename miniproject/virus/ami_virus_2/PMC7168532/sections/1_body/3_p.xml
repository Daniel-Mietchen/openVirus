<p>Phylogenic analysis has shown that 2019‐nCoV isolates cluster within the group of SARS or SARS‐like coronaviruses, but are distinctive from MERS coronaviruses (Chan et al, 2020). They also have a close phylogenic relationship with bat coronaviruses, which might indicate a bat origin of the viruses (Chan et al, 2020). However, intermediate hosts—such as bamboo rat and badger—might be important in the transmission cycle since several early 2019‐nCoV cases were vendors in the market where they could have been exposed to wild animals that are sold in this market. Epidemiologic analysis of the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan has indicated that most (55%) with onset before January 1 were linked to this market in Wuhan, compared with 8.6% of the subsequent cases (Li et al.,
