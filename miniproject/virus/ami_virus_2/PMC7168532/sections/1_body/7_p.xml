<p>To summarize, what we have learnt about 2019‐nCoV to date: 
 <list list-type="bullet" id="tbed13509-list-0001">
  <list-item>
   <p>A novel betacoronavirus (SARS‐like coronavirus) likely from a wildlife source (perhaps bats via one or more intermediate species) caused an initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan in early to mid‐December 2019;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>This virus was capable of human‐to‐human transmission, perhaps due to its S‐protein affinity for the human ACE2 receptor;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Human‐to‐human transmission occurred during mid‐ to late‐December, resulting in widespread dissemination of infected individuals throughout China and also to many other countries;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Although apparently not highly contagious, reducing the basic reproductive number of 2019‐nCoV from 2–3 to &lt; 1, given its wide dissemination, will require vigorous and early disease detection, isolation of infectious individuals and strenuous promotion of social distancing measures;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The ultimate origin of this novel coronavirus awaits investigation and confirmation.</p>
