<p>One research group recently reported 2019‐nCoV having recombination between bat coronavirus and an origin‐unknown coronavirus in the viral spike (S) glycoprotein, the major viral protein that recognizes cell surface receptors and determines host range (Ji, Wang, Zhao, Zai, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="tbed13509-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2020</xref>). By analysing the released 2019‐nCoV sequences and comparing among different animal species with relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis, the authors suggested that snake is the most probable wildlife animal reservoir for 2019‐nCoV through recombination within spike glycoprotein. Currently, there is no report of 2019‐nCoV having been isolated from animal species, but this is a topic of much speculation.
