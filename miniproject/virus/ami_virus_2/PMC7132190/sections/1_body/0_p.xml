<p>While air travel from and to China has subsided and cases of people infected with the COVID‚Äê19 coronavirus appear all over the world, virologists, epidemiologists and public health experts are worrying that the virus could eventually become endemic in the human population as it has already spread beyond the Wuhan region where the Chinese government has enforced a strict quarantine. To no avail though as new outbreaks occurred in Japan, Korea and Northern Italy, along with patients being hospitalized in Austria, Germany, New Zealand and other countries at the time of writing. While it seems too late to contain the virus in the Wuhan region, the outbreak has enormously spurred research on the virus itself, along with a better understanding of its pathogenicity and vaccine development.</p>
