<p>Several key aspects of the COVID‐19 virus are more clear now, one being that it is likely to subside during the summer similar to the SARS outbreak in 2002 as most coronaviruses become far less infectious under warm weather. “These respiratory infections all tend to be winter diseases”, said by Paul Hunter, Professor of Health Protection at the Norwich School of Medicine, University of East Anglia, UK. “The big one that stopped SARS was summer in the Northern Hemisphere”. This has the corollary that warm countries are much less affected; Hunter noted there was only one single case of SARS in the whole of Africa and that was South Africa where there are seasonal variations in temperature. However, he also cautioned against complacency, noting that Mexico experienced quite a high number of cases during the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic, despite the country being hot except at higher altitudes inland. “So there are other factors determining infectivity beyond temperature”, Hunter added.</p>
