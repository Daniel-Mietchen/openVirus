<p>One of the earlier suggestions that has now been largely scotched was that the COVID‚Äê19 virus became infectious before patients showed the first symptoms, which would make containment measures such as quarantining less effective, like locking the stable door after the horse has bolted. This hypothesis arose after a cluster of cases was reported in Germany, appearing to have originated from an individual who had flown in from China but did not report symptoms until after returning to China. However, as was pointed out by Amesh Adalja, Senior Scholar at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, it was then established that the person had indeed experienced symptoms in Germany before they were reported by other people in that cluster.</p>
