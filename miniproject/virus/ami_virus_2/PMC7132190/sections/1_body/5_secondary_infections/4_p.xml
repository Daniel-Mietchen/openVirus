<p>There is still debate over the relative roles of primary viral and secondary bacterial pneumonia in the Wuhan outbreak and how to deal with it. Hunter is convinced that it is a primary viral pneumonia, echoing some of the early studies as well as more extensive analysis of the SARS outbreak

Also, the early symptoms of this novel coronavirus infection are in the lower respiratory tract”. This again is unlike most if not all influenza virus strains, where lower respiratory tract symptoms come later, presumably from secondary bacterial infection.
