<p>Hunter agreed though that some patients will get secondary bacterial pneumonia as well and that could account for some of the severe cases. However, John Edmunds, who develops control programmes for disease at the London School of Health and Tropical Medicine in the UK, reckons that the relative roles of bacterial and viral pneumonia are not yet clear. “Some anecdotal reports seem to suggest that most patients are initially OK, and then get severe disease, which might indicate a bacterial superinfection, but how consistent this pattern is is anyone's guess. Again, there is a lack of clinical as well as epidemiological data that are coming out”, Edmunds commented. This question of viral versus bacterial pneumonia is important for treatment, because the latter would require the routine use of antibiotics, whereas the primary viral infections would be treated with anti‐virals and antibodies.</p>
