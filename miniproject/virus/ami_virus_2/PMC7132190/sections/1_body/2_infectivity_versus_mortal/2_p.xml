<p>This pattern is typical of most respiratory virus outbreaks, even if part of the effect is an illusion resulting from the fact that reporting of less severe cases only tends to catch up later on. It also reflects the common decline of virulence during such epidemics, partly resulting from strong selective pressure imposed by social distancing, quarantine and other public health measures 
 <xref rid="embr202050334-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. These measures reduce the rate of transmission and slow down progression of the outbreak, giving the virus more time to attenuate. Social distancing amplifies selection for longer‐surviving low‐virulence sub‐groups, so that the majority of the population during the later stages of an outbreak are exposed to less virulent phenotypes
