They communicated that information transparently, completely, honestly and instantaneously to the world's scientific community. That meant three things happens immediately. Firstly countries around the world, including our own CDC (Centres for Disease Control), quickly ran their own PCR tests in their own laboratories and so were able to implement testing very promptly. Number two, within hours of transmission of that genomic information, people began working on a vaccine. […] Number three, research began looking for therapies, both new compounds and among existing compounds that might have an effect on that virus”.</p>
