<p>This could also delay the return to normality when the outbreak does start subsiding. Schaffner identified two possible metrics that could be used by global health authorities to determine when it would be safe to return to business as usual. “One is a determination of new cases in Wuhan”, he explained. “But to have confidence in that metric we need to be sure that testing intensity is reasonably constant. […] We are not sure how reliable that is.” Schaffner therefore suggested that the rest of the world would be unable to rely on that metric. “There may though be one other metric that can help us and that is the number of exportations from Wuhan and Hubei (the other area district at the epicentre of the outbreak) to other parts of China and the rest of the world”, he added. “If you can show a diminution in those exportations that will give public health and governments generally the confidence they can back off some of these quarantine restrictions”.</p>
