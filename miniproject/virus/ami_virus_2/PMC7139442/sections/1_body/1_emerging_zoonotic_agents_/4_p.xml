<p id="Par9">In a perfect world, we will answer four questions about a putative transfusion-transmitted agent before recipients are infected to prospectively inform consideration, development, and deployment of mitigation strategies [

 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par10">Is the agent present in the blood of otherwise qualified donors?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par11">Is the agent parenterally transmissible (by blood, organ/tissue transplantation), or is such transmission biologically plausible?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par12">Will the agent survive in contemporary blood components to be transmitted?</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par13">Does the agent, if transmitted, pose a material clinical risk after transfusionâ€”Does it cause significant illness among susceptible transfusion recipients?</p>
