<p id="Par7"> WNV, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), 
 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, Zika, and 
 <italic>Babesia microti</italic> are recent demonstrations that zoonotic infections, as they emerge (or emerge in our consciousness), become targets for intervention. There are many other zoonotic and/or arthropod-borne agents for which we have not implemented mitigation measures (beyond the requirement that donors are well when they give) but about which we need to think. They include, but are by no means restricted to, dengue, chikungunya, MERS-CoV, Nipah, Hendra, the severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), Bourbon and Powassan viruses, Mayoro virus, the tick-borne agents (
 <italic>Erlichia sp</italic>., 
 <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>) and 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic>. These agents persist in arthropods and/or nonhuman vertebrate reservoirs with spillover into human populations either by contact or vector transmission. Tick-borne infections are not further considered herein.
