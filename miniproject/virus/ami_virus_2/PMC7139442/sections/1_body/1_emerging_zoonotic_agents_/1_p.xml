<p id="Par6">Overlaying our history with these classic pathogens is “new” pathogen emergence and discovery. Identification of new agents is accelerating. The number of viral species recognized to infect human is predicted to rise from less than 10 in 1900 to more than 200 by 2020, with the large majority of the increase since 1960 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">10.1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The reasons are diverse and beyond the scope of this chapter, but a shrinking globe puts pathogens from the sub-Saharan rain forest within 24 h of a blood center in the Northern Plains. Urbanization, especially when combined with poverty and overcrowding, and human changes of and encroachment into diverse ecologic niches change host, pathogen, and vector relationships. Alterations of climate and animal husbandry also affect reservoir, pathogen, and vector distributions. New discovery systems like next-generation sequencing and metagenomics identify

Social media via the Internet brings us nearly instantaneous news and speculation about new diseases and outbreaks from anywhere in the world. How do we integrate, or decide not to, the potential threats into our blood safety regime? Our difficult task in the transfusion medicine community is choosing a proactive framework within which to approach emerging infections despite initially incomplete information about their impacts on transfusion safety.
