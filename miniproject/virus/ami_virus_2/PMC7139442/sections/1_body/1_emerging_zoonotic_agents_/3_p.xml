<p id="Par8">Zoonotic infections, excluding HIV, have certainly had less clinical impact in transfusion medicine than the classic sexually and parenterally transmitted agents, but, especially under epidemic scenarios, several are presently prominent in conversations about if and when to intervene for blood safety. In this context, we have taken to speculating on the need for interventions for pathogens for which transfusion transmission, when the asymptomatic presence of an agent is biologically plausible, is theoretical. This is indeed proactive, in contrast to our historical approach, but risks a response (and consumption of scarce resources) where none is appropriate. In the best light, this is “precautionism.”</p>
