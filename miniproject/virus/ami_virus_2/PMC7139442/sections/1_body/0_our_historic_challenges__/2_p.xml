<p id="Par3"> Surrogate testing using donor testing for alanine aminotransferase and antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen was an early initiative in this direction before the identification of hepatitis C virus and the availability of specific assays [

Infection with HTLV-I was known to cause acute T-cell leukemia and myelopathy, albeit with low disease penetrance, and infection was present in healthy individuals who would otherwise qualify as donors. Transfusion transmission was documented, but the attendant disease burden was poorly characterized. In the wake of events caused by another retrovirus (HIV), antibody testing was required in the United States in 1988. Controversy about its impact and cost-effectiveness persists [
