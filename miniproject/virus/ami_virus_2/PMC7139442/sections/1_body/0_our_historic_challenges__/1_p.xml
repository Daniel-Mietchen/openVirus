<p id="Par2">Among the “classic” transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs), person-to-person transmission was the important route of donor infection, and we 
 <italic>reacted</italic> to incontrovertible evidence of a clinical burden in transfusion recipients. These included syphilis, malaria, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV (originally a nonhuman primate zoonosis). Over time, epidemiologic and other scientific data about risk were examined with the aim of developing (roughly sequentially) overlapping mitigation strategies that included (1) the virtual elimination of paid blood donors in the United States, (2) donor risk education to promote self-deferral, (3) explicit deferral criteria to be applied at the time of the donor interview, and (4) laboratory testing to reduce donation of infectious blood by donors who might have limited understanding of and/or were reluctant to recognize or admit their “behavioral” risks. The morbid impacts of these historical agents on many thousands of recipients make the disadvantages of reactive approaches obvious—one need not look further than the thousands of transmissions of HIV and non-A and non-B hepatitis (i.e., before the description of HCV) [

In part resulting from shortcomings enumerated in the Institute of Medicine report, the US blood community has explored more precautionary and proactive applications of these approaches to the assessment and mitigation of infectious risks in recent decades.
