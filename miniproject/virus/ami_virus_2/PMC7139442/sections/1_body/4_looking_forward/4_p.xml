<p id="Par41">With the suspicion that a new infection threatens blood transfusion recipients, a risk must be quantified, initially using provisional clinical and epidemiological descriptions that will be refined over time. Online risk modeling tools to accomplish these analyses are being developed for transfusion medicine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], with the critical, if obvious, caveat that the precision of their output is wholly dependent on input parameters. These are necessarily least precise in the earliest stages of emergence when initial preparedness decisions must be made generally and specifically with regard to transfusion safety. There are critical data needed to inform any quantitative assessment of the importance of a potential pathogen. A “routine” search for and reports of the presence of the infectious agent (or the imperfect surrogates, nucleic acids, and antigens) in the blood of asymptomatic individuals at risk would be a valuable standard operating procedure during epidemiologic investigations of emerging infections; this does not often occur early and before the blood community must respond to a potential threat. Likewise, prospective determination of pathogen survival through contemporary component production, processing, and storage should be a research priority.
