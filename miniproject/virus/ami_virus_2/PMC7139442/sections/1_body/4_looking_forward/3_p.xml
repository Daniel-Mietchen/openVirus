<p id="Par40">The role and effectiveness of advanced molecular techniques (e.g., pathogen discover via metagenomics or next-generation sequencing and other non-culture-based techniques) to study clinically infected patients for diagnostic indications and populations (including blood donors) to elucidate the human microbiome and explore new disease associations are not yet clear. False alarms will occur when members of the “ normal human flora” are discovered. TT virus (an anellovirus) was discovered using representational difference analysis for the amplification of nucleic acids in patients with posttransfusion non-A, B, and C hepatitis [

More recently, next-generation sequencing was applied to sera from 204 US patients with acute liver failure of unknown etiology and failed to identify unexpected pathogens [
