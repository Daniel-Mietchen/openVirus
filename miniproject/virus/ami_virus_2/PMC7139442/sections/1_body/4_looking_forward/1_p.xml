<p id="Par38">The foregoing depict a very 
 <italic>ad hoc</italic> process for recognizing and responding to emerging infectious threats to transfusion safety, whether zoonotic, arthropod-borne, or others. Given the unpredictability attending the emergence of a specific pathogen, this is perhaps inevitable. That said, that new pathogens will emerge is axiomatic. The task for infectious diseases and epidemiology experts in the blood community is to be sensitive to this inevitability and to spend real effort anticipating which agents of many candidates pose material threats that bear forethought and planning. To that end, the emerging infections subgroup at AABB has engaged in developing a toolkit to guide that process (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">10.3</xref>). The most critical activity is “horizon scanning” that daily surveils a spectrum of online and print resources to identify new and emerging human pathogens. These include media reports, professional meetings, organizational and peer-reviewed publications, open source and subscription websites (e.g., ProMED [

This requires of clinicians the routine elicitation of a transfusion history as they establish a differential diagnosis in patients with apparent infections, so that they can ask themselves the four questions we have proposed as critical for imputing blood as a “vector.”
