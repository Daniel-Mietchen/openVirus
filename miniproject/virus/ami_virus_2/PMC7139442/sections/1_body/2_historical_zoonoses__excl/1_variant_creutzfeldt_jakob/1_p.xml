<p id="Par15"> vCJD is a zoonotic transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) that spreads from bovines to humans, mainly in the United Kingdom. Precautionary deferrals were required before the recognition of transfusion transmission based largely on the occurrence of TSEs (sporadic CJD, Kuru et al.) in humans, the presence of the vCJD prion in the reticuloendothelial system of apparently food-borne human cases, and a precedent of parenteral transmission of the prion that causes classic or sporadic CJD [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The cost has been the ongoing loss of many thousands of donors for residence in and travel to (and transfusion in some) the countries with risk. In addition to difficult donor counseling sessions, the estimates of donor loss ranged as high as 5% in the United States [
