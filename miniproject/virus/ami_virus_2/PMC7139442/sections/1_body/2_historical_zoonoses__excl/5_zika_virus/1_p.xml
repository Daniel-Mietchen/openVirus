<p id="Par19"> Zika virus, a nonhuman primate virus t hat has spilled over into human populations causing a pandemic, is covered elsewhere, but its example bears repetition here. Its nucleic acid is present in the blood of asymptomatic individuals (including donors), US donors have frequent travel to affected areas outside the mainland United States, the major vector is present in areas of the mainland United States, and sexual transmission is a documented, if poorly quantitated, route of infection [

Driven by the recognition of severe clinical outcomes among infants infected in utero (and neurologic morbidity in a proportion of infected adults), investigational individual-donation nucleic acid screening for Zika virus was implemented emergently in the United States in 2016. This was absent evidence of clinically significant morbidity associated with receipt of blood from viremic donors. At this writing, there have been three apparent transfusion transmissions of the virus published, all in Brazil, with none causing recognizable morbidity [
