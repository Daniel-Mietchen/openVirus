<p id="Par16">Mitigation strategies for the mosquito-borne avian pathogen WNV were implemented after the recognition of a single transmission of the virus from a blood donor to an organ donor and forward to the organ recipients [

An emergency response ramped up over several weeks in 2002, using an incomplete understanding of the level of risk being addressed based on clinical information from the cases and modeling data that had been produced before observation of those transmissions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Within less than 1Â year after the first case report, minipool nucleic acid tests were developed and implemented across the US blood supply. In subsequent seasons, strategies to trigger individual donation testing with increased sensitivity evolved and, despite persistent endemic activity in the United States, transfusion transmission WNV has been essentially eliminated [
