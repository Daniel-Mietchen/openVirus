<p id="Par17"> SARS-CoV is an enveloped RNA viral respiratory pathogen of zoonotic origin causing significant mortality. First identified in Asia during 2003, it spread from Asia to North America with sporadic travel-associated cases and subsequent extensive localized healthcare-associated (nosocomial) transmission. SARS was met with an FDA guidance for immediate implementation requiring the interrogation of US blood donors about a history of SARS, potential exposure to cases, and travel to or residence in areas during the 14 days before presentation to donate. Temporary deferral was required if “risk” was present. This was based on the theoretical possibility of asymptomatic viremia and isolation of the virus from tissues outside the respiratory tract, presumably as a result of blood-borne spread. These interventions occurred absent any clinical evidence of parenteral or transfusion risk [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], but there are still no data on infectious viremia in the incubation period or among asymptomatic contacts of cases on which to judge the plausibility of parenteral transmission. The requirement for donor screening was allowed to lapse 90 days after CDC lifted the last travel alerts and SARS has not reemerged.
