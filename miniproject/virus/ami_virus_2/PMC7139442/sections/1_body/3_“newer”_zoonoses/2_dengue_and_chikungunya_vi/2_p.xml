<p id="Par22">Dengue, while not strictly zoonotic, has a sylvan nonhuman primate-mosquito cycle in addition to the urban human-mosquito cycle responsible for human epidemics. Our response to dengue risk, or lack thereof, is informative of considerations used to address emerging pathogens. It is the most common human arboviral infection in the world (recent estimates suggest that more than 390,000,000 million infections occur annually) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Accordingly, dengue was labeled a priority agent in an AABB Transfusion-Transmitted Disease Committee exercise [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, to date, no interventions are being seriously considered in the United States, beyond the requirement that donors be well when they are bled and what is contributed by malaria deferrals. For donors with risk for dengue from travel or outbreaks, who can be identified prior to donation, management strategies that temporarily restrict their donations or use (currently investigational) donor screening tests have been considered or used with variable costs and impacts on the availability of donors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Recent data, using nucleic acid amplification tests, suggest that the clinical burden after transfusion transmission may be quite modest and not require action [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In this study from Brazil, 16 susceptible transfusion recipients of blood from dengue RNA-positive donors were clinically indistinguishable from susceptible controls who did not. Five exposed recipients experienced probable dengue transmissions, and one was a possible infection. Surveillance for the clinical sequelae of transfusion transmission is clearly a priority as the blood community considers the relevance of this virus.
