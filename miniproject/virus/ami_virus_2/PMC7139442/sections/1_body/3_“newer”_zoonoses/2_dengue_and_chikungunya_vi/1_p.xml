 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitos transmit both dengue, a , and chikungunya, an

They cause explosive epidemics, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions of the developing world, and manifest asymptomatic viremia; vector-borne infections are associated with morbidity and, in the case of dengue, mortality. The large global areas affected by dengue and chikungunya overlap those with endemic malaria, and temporary malaria deferral for travel to these areas surely provides partial protection of the blood supply in unaffected areas. However, the use of malaria deferral is clearly an incomplete approach [
