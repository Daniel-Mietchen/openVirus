<p id="Par24">The absence of recognized or alleged transfusion-associated morbidity from these two viruses may be a result of several things. It may be nearly impossible to recognize such events against a background of epidemic vector-borne transmission, especially when transfused cohorts might have risk from both sources. In non-epidemic locations, the diagnosis may never be considered by clinicians unfamiliar with a potential for parenteral transmission. The infections can be clinically nonspecific, patients ill enough to require transfusion may have multiple sources of fever, and (in the experience of this infectious diseases clinician) febrile patients are generally not asked for a recent transfusion history, i.e., clinical surveillance is passive and limited. Finally, there are important pathogenic differences between mosquito transmission and parenteral transmission that relate to the effects of arthropod mediators injected with virus and the innate immune or inflammatory responses associated with vector transmission [
