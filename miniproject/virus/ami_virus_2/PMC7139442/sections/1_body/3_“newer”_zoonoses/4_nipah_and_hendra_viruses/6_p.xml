<p id="Par36">In an outbreak context (potentially including travel to areas experience significant activity) or when a donor is diagnosed with one of these viral infections, it seems reasonable for a blood collection organization to have (generic) procedures to guide a recall of co-components of donations from exposed or ill donors from within some reasonable interval before donation. These would reflect their incubation periods and the best data on the presence and duration of putative viremia. It would be prudent to perform a lookback to recipients of blood transfused before such a recall was undertaken, for the purposes of assessing their likelihood of having been infected. Likewise, an allegation of transfusion transmission should be carefully evaluated and the need to evaluate donors assessed.</p>
