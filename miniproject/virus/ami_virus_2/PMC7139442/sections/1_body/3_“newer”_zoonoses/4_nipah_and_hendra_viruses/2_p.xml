<p id="Par32">Hendra virus is closely related to Nipah at the sequence level. Recognized human Hendra virus infection is much rarer than Nipah, with seven cases and four deaths recognized since the first equine outbreak in Australia in 1994 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Horses are infected after contact with infected urine from 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats. A total of 53 outbreaks of equine respiratory illness involving more than 70 horses have all been confined to the northeast coast of Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. There is no evidence of the infection before its 1994 emergence after serological studies on a number of vertebrate and invertebrate repository samples. It causes a spectrum of human illness from nonspecific fever to flu-like syndromes to fatal encephalitis, generally as a consequence of spillover from equine infections. Treatment is supportive. No effective prophylaxis is available. The incubation period is from 5 to 21Â days from exposure. Transmission to humans occurs mainly after direct contact during the care of sick horses or at the time of their autopsies. In early studies, recipient horses were infected intravenously using homogenates of the spleen and lung from two of the index horses. Postmortem lung, liver, kidney, and spleen from a human decedent were infectious in tissue culture [
