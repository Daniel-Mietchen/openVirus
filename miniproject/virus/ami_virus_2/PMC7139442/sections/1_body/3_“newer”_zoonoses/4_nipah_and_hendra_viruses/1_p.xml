<p id="Par31">Nipah, Hendra (and the apparently nonpathogenic Cedar virus), are are from the 
 <italic>Paramyxovirinae</italic> family. They are currently confined to South Asia and Australia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">10.2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Nipah is an emerging bat zoonosis, which spills over into humans to cause human infections ranging from inapparent to lethal encephalitis. It is an enveloped RNA virus sharing 70–90% amino acid homology across regions of the genome with Hendra virus. Nipah emerged in Malaysia in 1998–1999 where bats infected swine and the swine infected humans. During that outbreak of encephalitis and respiratory illness, there were approximately 300 human cases and more than 100 deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The clinical spectrum seems variable across geographically separate outbreaks. Treatment is supportive, but the antiviral ribavirin has been used in uncontrolled circumstances with some success. No effective prophylaxis (medication, immunoglobulin, or vaccine) has been reported. The human incubation period has ranged from 4 days to 2 months (90% ≤14 days), and there is, again, some variation according to the location of the outbreak. Direct contact with the respiratory secretions of infected swine that generally have a mild illness (apparently infected by consumption of mangoes contaminated with bat urine) was the source of the index outbreak. Bats of the genus 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> (“flying foxes”) appear to be the natural reservoir and can infect a variety of mammalian secondary hosts (i.e., felines, canines, swine, and equines). An outbreak in Bangladesh was associated with the consumption of date palm sap, again contaminated by infected bats. Direct contact with infected bats may also result in transmission. Human-to-human transmissions, including family and healthcare associated, are documented. There is indirect evidence (i.e., lacking virus isolation or nucleic acid tests) of reactivation of latent, chronic infection resulting in recurrent CNS disease and death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Despite recurrent outbreaks, especially in Bangladesh and India, there have been no allegations of transfusion transmission, and little attention has been paid to implications for blood safety.
