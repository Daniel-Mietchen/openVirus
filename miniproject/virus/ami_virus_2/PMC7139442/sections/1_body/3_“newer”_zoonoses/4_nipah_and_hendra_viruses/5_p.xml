<p id="Par35"> Donor deferral strategies for a history of exposure or infection will, necessarily, be empiric. For a history of exposure, they would be some multiple of the maximum credible incubation period (e.g., perhaps 6 weeks for Hendra and 6 months for Nipah). Since some proportion of infections are asymptomatic, donor reentry with a negative diagnostic serology might be considered. A history of infection is more problematic, given the apparent persistence of some Nipah infections and a single case report of relapsing Hendra in the CNS. A lifetime deferral is defensible for both viruses after clinical infection.</p>
