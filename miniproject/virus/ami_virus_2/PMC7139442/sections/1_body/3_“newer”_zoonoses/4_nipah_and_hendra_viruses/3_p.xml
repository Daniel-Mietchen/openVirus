<p id="Par33">There is a small amount of evidence for an acute, low-level viremia for Nipah virus, and one might expect the same for Hendra. Pathologic studies demonstrate that respiratory and vascular endothelial cells are important targets for both Nipah and Hendra. How they spread from the portal of entry, likely the respiratory epithelium, is not fully characterized. In later stages of clinical infection, pulmonary endothelium is infected, and small vessel vasculitis ensues. They are believed to enter the bloodstream at that point and disseminate as free and cell-associated virus [
