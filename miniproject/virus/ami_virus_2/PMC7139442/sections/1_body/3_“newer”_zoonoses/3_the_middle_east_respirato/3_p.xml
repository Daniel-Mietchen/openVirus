<p id="Par28">Transfusion transmission of MERS-CoV is neither reported nor suspected to date, and there is no such precedent with other coronaviruses. The occurrence of asymptomatic infection is obviously problematic, however [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Evidence for viremia is rarely sought but, where evaluated to date, has been confined to severely ill patients. The index patient in a family cluster in Tunisia in 2013 had viral sequences amplified by PCR from serum after more than a week of illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Another patient, with fatal infection, had sequences detected 4 weeks after onset of the illness, but was not apparently tested earlier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In neither case was infectious virus sought. One hundred ten Saudi blood donors were seronegative for neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], but there are no systematic studies looking for asymptomatic RNA-emia or viremia in higher-risk cohorts such as contacts of cases. The most recent formal WHO MERS-CoV risk assessment includes no mention of a risk from transfusion-transmitted infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>], nor does the European CDC rapid risk assessment of communicable diseases risk associated with the 2017 Hajj [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Given the low number of cases outside of the Middle East, and the apparent requirement for close contact with ill patients for person-to-person transmission to occur (esp. to healthcare workers), it does not appear that specific travel or risk deferrals are appropriate. Continuous monitoring (i.e., systematic “horizon scanning”) for changes in the epidemiology and clinical pathology of MERS to be alert to changes that would suggest some risk of parenteral spread and transfusion risk seems an appropriate response.
