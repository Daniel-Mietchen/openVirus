<p id="Par27">Symptomatic MERS-CoV infection is associated with a high-mortality (â‰ˆ35%) respiratory illness in humans, but asymptomatic infections (relevant to concerns about transfusion) have been recognized during aggressive laboratory investigation of contacts of cases, and infection is certainly considerably less lethal than the mortality reported for recognized disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. From emergence to September 2017, 2081 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported (82% from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia). 21.5% have had no or mild symptoms. 46.8% had severe disease or died [

The potential for more extensive transmission outside the endemic area is exemplified by the large 2015 outbreak of healthcare-associated infection in South Korea (185 linked cases) where the index patient was a traveler to the Middle East [
