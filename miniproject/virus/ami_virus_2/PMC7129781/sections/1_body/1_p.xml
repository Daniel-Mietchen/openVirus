<p id="para0003">Significant and realistic concerns have been raised regarding the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)–2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19 disease) dissemination during minimally invasive surgery owing to pneumoperitoneum-associated aerosolization of particles and the presence of the virus in blood and stool 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. It is important to recognize that our understanding of viral aerosolization by electrosurgical or ultrasonic tools comes from work with other viral diseases, such as hepatitis B 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Particles in surgical smoke have been demonstrated to contain a variety of toxic and virulent materials thought to be potentially capable of infecting those who inhale them, with case reports of doctors contracting a rare papillomavirus when surgical smoke exposure was suspected to be the source 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The plausibility of aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been established, with similar findings to that of SARS-CoV-1 (the virus responsible for a multinational disease outbreak in 2002–2003), which was associated with nosocomial transmission and superspreading events 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. There have been particular concerns raised about laparoscopic surgery because of the higher concentrations of particulate matter that occur compared with open surgery, which may be due to the electrosurgical devices employed, the low gas motility of pneumoperitoneum, and gas expulsion through ports or trocars
