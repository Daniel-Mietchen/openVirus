<p id="para0004">Regarding COVID-19 specifically, we emphasize that there are no data on surgical exposures translating into a definitive risk to the operating room team. With a dearth of scientific evidence to guide us, the healthcare community is left with 2 solutions. The first involves continuing on with normal practice unless it becomes clear that these practices are definitively harmful. Proponents of maintaining the status quo will no doubt highlight the fact that the scientific community is too early in our understanding of COVID-19 to have proven a causal link between surgical exposures and infection of healthcare workers. Surgeons may argue that there is no evidence specific to laparoscopic plume containing SARS-CoV-2 resulting in infection. The rebuttal to this stance is that neither is there evidence of safety. The authors suggest championing an alternative solution whereby we as a medical community become proactive rather than reactive, adopting a conservative yet balanced plan to protect both the patient and the healthcare team. When faced with a biologically plausible concern that could infer serious harm, we are obligated to act with an abundance of caution, examining and questioning our standard practices.</p>
