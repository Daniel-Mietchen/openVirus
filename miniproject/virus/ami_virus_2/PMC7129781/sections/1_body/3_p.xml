<p id="para0005">Certainly, it is uncomfortable to consider changing practice in the absence of definitive evidence, but let us consider whether it will be possible to obtain such evidence either now or in the foreseeable future. The necessary studies on this subject would require lengthy follow-up, be difficult to conduct, and expose a vast number of staff to potential risk in the process. Equipoise concerns may preclude such work taking place in the in vivo setting. Reliable information on this subject is not likely forthcoming anytime soon, and yet we are required to act now to alter practice if we wish to avoid exposure risks. We must bear in mind that the absence of data is not data in and of itself, or taken another way, just because surgical exposures have not been proven to be harmful, does not mean that it is safe to proceed with usual practice. The reality is that decision making and guideline development in this arena will be based on the limited available data and the information inferred from other viruses and similar epidemics.</p>
