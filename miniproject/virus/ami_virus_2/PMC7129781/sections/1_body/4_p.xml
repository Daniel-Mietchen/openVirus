<p id="para0006">Taking the aforementioned discussion into account, we propose the following management algorithm. In patients who are COVID-19 positive, unless they have a life-threatening emergency that requires surgery, we advocate for nonoperative treatment and delay of surgery until recovered. If surgery cannot be delayed for a patient who is COVID-19 positive, a laparotomic operation should be performed. In patients with unknown COVID-19 status, preoperative testing is ideal when available, although it is important to also consider the test's sensitivity/specificity and underlying degree of suspicion on the basis of symptoms and local disease prevalence. Laparoscopy can be performed in a patient whose COVID-19 status is unknown if the entire operating room team has access to necessary personal protective equipment and extreme care is taken to prevent release of pneumoperitoneum into the operating theater. If these measures are not in place, an open operation is the alternative. The many advantages of laparoscopy are well-known, and it is important to stress that there will be cases and patients for whom the risks of a laparotomy far outweigh the risks of laparoscopy, even when taking into account utilitarian concerns for the healthcare team regarding potential exposure issues. Outside of these unique situations, however, the use of laparoscopy should be reserved for the patient who is COVID-19 negative; or in the absence of testing, in patients who are symptom- and exposure-screened negative with full deployment of personal protective equipment (
