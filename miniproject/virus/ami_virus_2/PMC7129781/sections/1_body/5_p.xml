<p id="para0007">We must also keep an open mind to alternatives to traditional minimally invasive surgery, which may be appropriate in most cases during this pandemic. With the suspension of nonessential procedures, many of the emergent benign gynecologic cases that we will be approaching in patients who are COVID-19 positive or unknown status (such as ovarian torsion or ectopic pregnancy) could be accomplished through minilaparotomy with little to no use of electrosurgery and same day discharge. This approach could prove to optimize benefits to both the patient and the healthcare team. In addition, regional anesthesia is feasible with this technique, which could allow for further limitation of healthcare team exposures related to the aerosol-generating procedures of intubation and extubation. Whether operating using minimally invasive or open techniques, effective mechanisms exist for the removal of smoke and particulate matter that can significantly reduce the surgical team exposure. Whenever possible, electrosurgical/ultrasonic device use should be coupled with a smoke evacuation/filtration system.</p>
