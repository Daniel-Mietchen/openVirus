In fact, since the testing strategies across countries vary (e.g. testing symptomatic individuals in France with mostly a high viral shedding vs. testing asymptomatic individuals as in South Korea or Germany), the ratio of deaths among confirmed COVID-19 cases may not be a good estimate to compare the different strategies. More data will be needed in order to better determine the optimal model that should be used to face the next pandemic in the future.</p>
