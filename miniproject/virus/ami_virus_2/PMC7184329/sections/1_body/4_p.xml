<p>Sadly, deaths in Italy, a country which has 25 times fewer inhabitants than China, has today (26 March 2020) surpassed the number of deaths in China, reaching the highest standardized death rate (standardize rate = 135.37 per million) by 26 March 2020, despite having conducted mass testing (âˆ¼145 000 on 18 March). This large number of deaths could be due to the following potential reasons: (i) a delay between diagnosis of the first case (22 February) and the start of quarantine 16 days after the first diagnosed case; (ii) the late diagnosis of the first case; and (iii) the lack of mass testing, leading to poorly identifying and eliminating potential new infections and, in turn, isolating those infected individuals.</p>
