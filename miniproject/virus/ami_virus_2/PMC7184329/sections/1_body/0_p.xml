<p>Since COVID-19 has spread around the globe, most countries have applied quarantines and travel bans as a strategy to reduce or halt the spread of the virus and to avoid deaths reaching critical numbers.
 <sup>1</sup> However, one country, South Korea, appears to have greatly slowed its epidemic without resorting to drastic lockdown; it reported about 75 new cases today (18 March 2020), down from 909 at its peak on 29 February.
