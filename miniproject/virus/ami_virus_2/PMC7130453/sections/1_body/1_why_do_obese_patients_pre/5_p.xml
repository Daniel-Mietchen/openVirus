<p id="Par9">Several studies on IAV infection in OB mice show increased disease severity, increased secondary bacterial infections and a reduced vaccine efficacy [

In fact, in obese mice there is a delayed and blunted immune response, probably due to a reduced interferon (INF), adaptive cellular and antibody-mediated responses. Recently, Honce et al. found that serial passaging of a human H1N1 influenza virus through diet-induced models of obesity mice (DIO) or genetically obese mice (OB) results in a more virulent disease with an increased virulence and morbidity; in the mouse model, deep-sequencing viruses revealed several mutations in obese host-passaged viruses and an impairment of the interferon response is permissive for the generation of more virulent IAV populations. These findings are not limited by viral subtype and are also found in human studies. Diminished INF response and an increased influenza virus replication were found in normal bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells derived from obese subjects [
