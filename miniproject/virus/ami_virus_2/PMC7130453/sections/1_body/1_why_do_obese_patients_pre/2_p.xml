<p id="Par6">Firstly, obese subjects have chronically higher leptin (a pro-inflammatory adipokine) and lower adiponectin (an anti-inflammatory adipokine) concentrations. This unfavorable hormone milieu also leads to a dysregulation of the immune response and can contribute to the pathogenesis of obesity-linked complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the basal state, obese patients have a higher concentration of several pro-inflammatory cytokines like alpha-TNF, MCP-1 and IL-6, mainly produced by visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue leading to a defect in the innate immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. When an antigen is presented, the obesity-related chronic inflammation causes a reduced macrophage activation and a blunted pro-inflammatory cytokine production upon macrophage stimulation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Also B and T cell responses are impaired in obese and obese-diabetic patients, and this causes an increased susceptibility and a delay of resolution of the viral infection.
