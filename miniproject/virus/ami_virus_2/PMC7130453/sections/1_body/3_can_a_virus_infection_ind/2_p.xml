<p id="Par15">The effects of influenza virus on infected mammalian cells generally result in a metabolic shift toward an increase in glycolytic rate and a decrease in ATP production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The authors hypothesize that the onset of apoptosis causes this metabolic imbalance during the late stage of the influenza virus replication process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This pattern resembles an insulin-resistant condition with a reduction in the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity, usually involved in the rate of carbohydrate oxidation control. PDC is an important modulator of energy and metabolic homeostasis, and insulin resistance is associated with increased skeletal muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) that phosphorylates and inactivates PDC. Increased PDK4 expression in muscle has been observed in insulin-resistant status, including obesity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In mice infected by the H1N1 virus, there is a marked down-regulation of PDC activity and ATP level, with selective up-regulation of PDK4 in the skeletal muscles, heart, liver and lungs.
