<p id="Par14">The relationship between viral infections and obesity is more complex than a simple worsening of the influenza infectiveness and clinical picture and outcome in obese patients. Adenovirus 36 (Adv36) is the most studied infectious agent probably associated to obesity. Adenoviruses are DNA viruses causing mainly respiratory infections which were indicated both in animal models and in humans to be contributing factors for increased adiposity [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Atkinson et al. showed in over 500 individuals and 28 twin pairs a correlation between BMI and Adv36 positivity, with 30% of positivity in obese vs 11% positivity in lean individuals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Fourth, an up-regulation of adipogenesis is due to an improvement in adipocyte proliferation and differentiation [
