<p id="Par17">Incubation time for COVID-19 is considered 14Â days, at most. Based on the concept of prolonged shedding of the virus in obese subjects [

Until a specific vaccine is not available, the only actions that can be taken are isolation of positive patients and potentiation of positive immune modulation response. Diet and mainly physical exercise as immune modulatory action not only aimed at losing weight but also at quickly improving immune modulation; morbidity and mortality may, in fact, be reduced with regular exercise, even without substantial weight loss. Several studies suggest that regular physical exercise enhances levels of cytokines production mediated via TLR (toll-like receptor) signaling pathways during a microbial infection, improving host resistance to pathogen invasion [
