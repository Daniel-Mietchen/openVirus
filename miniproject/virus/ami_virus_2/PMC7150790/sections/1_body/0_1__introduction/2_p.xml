<p>Competition for host cells during coinfection can result in viral interference in the form of delaying or preventing infection by the secondary virus [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00275" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is possible that this cellular interference may be detectable on a population level. For example, research suggests that epidemics of RSV, coronavirus, and influenza B can be respectively delayed, intensified, or inhibited if circulation of influenza A begins early (before week one of a given seasonal year) [
