<p>The delay of influenza season due to rhinovirus has been a subject of epidemiological interest for some time. For example, a particularly high-burden rhinovirus epidemic is hypothesized to have delayed the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in France [

Detecting interference at the population level may only be possible during more extreme events, such as pandemic influenza or higher-than-normal rhinovirus burden. Further studies with individual-level data and in different populations should be pursued to better understand why viral interference at the individual level does not necessarily translate to interference at the population level.
