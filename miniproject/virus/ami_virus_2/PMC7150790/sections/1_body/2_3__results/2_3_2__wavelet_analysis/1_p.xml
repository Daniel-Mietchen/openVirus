<p>Results of the wavelet analysis are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00275-f0A3">Figure A3</xref>, and cross-wavelet power spectrums are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00275-f0A4">Figure A4</xref>. Enterovirus and RSV show the least synchrony, as expected, with phase differences between approximately −50° and −180°. Influenza A and RSV show close synchrony with phase angles near 0°, except for a notable difference during the 2009–2010 H1N1 pandemic, and a shift in the 2013–2014 season. Influenza B was in synchrony with RSV, except for the 2008–2009 and 2013–2014 seasons. Metapneumovirus was out of phase with RSV in the 2011–2012 and 2013–2014 seasons, while rhinovirus moved in and out of synchrony with RSV over the study period.
