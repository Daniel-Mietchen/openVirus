<p>For the descriptive analysis, we used a statistical change point model that was recently utilized to analyze RSV circulation throughout the United States [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00275" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We used this model to determine seasonal patterns in epidemic initiation, peak, and termination for all six viruses previously mentioned. For each year and virus, a base value count was determined as a starting value for the curve. Afterward, slopes of the mean counts were found, starting at base value, and four change points were identified: T1â€“T4. These data were used to create a line plot depicting the mean frequency count for each virus during each seasonal year.
