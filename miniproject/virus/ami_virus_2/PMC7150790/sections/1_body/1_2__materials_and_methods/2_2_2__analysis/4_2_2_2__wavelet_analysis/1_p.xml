<p>To conduct the wavelet analysis, we first normalized the frequency data to have a mean of zero. We then calculated the restructured component of the epidemic curves, using a period window of 32 to 65 weeks for each virus, except for influenza A and B. For the influenza viruses, a longer period of 108 weeks (2 years) was necessary to accurately capture epidemic patterns in pandemic years (2009â€“2010). A loess smoother was applied to the rhinovirus data, to adjust for increases in laboratory testing in late 2007 and early 2008. The period windows were chosen based on cross-wavelet power levels with RSV (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00275-f0A4">Figure A4</xref>). RSV was selected as the reference due to its very consistent repeating annual pattern.
