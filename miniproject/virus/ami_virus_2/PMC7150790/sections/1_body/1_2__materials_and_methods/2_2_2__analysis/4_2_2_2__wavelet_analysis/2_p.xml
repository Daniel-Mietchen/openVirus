<p>We plotted the phase angles and calculated the phase difference between each virus. Plots of each step of the analysis are found in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00275-f0A3">Figure A3</xref>e, synchrony between the epidemic curves is determined by the phase difference being zero, while deviation from the zero line indicates the epidemics are out of phase. Wavelet analyses were done by using the R package WaveletComp [
