<p>CTV has numerous variants, which could be grouped in at least seven major strains. Strains of CTV are defined as phylogenetically distinct lineages, which are classified based upon analysis of the viral genomic sequences [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Individual viral samples, on the other hand, are designated as isolates. Remarkably, it is not possible to link a CTV strain to a specific phenotype: Virus variants within the same strain could induce very different phenotypes, with some causing severe disease and others being mild or symptomless. The development of CTV-related disease syndromes such as quick decline, stem pitting, or seedling yellows depends on the infecting virus variant as well as on the citrus rootstock and scion combination. The degree of this complexity is further elevated by the fact that, in the field, long-living citrus trees are often infected by mixtures of variants of several different strains, which have been brought up by vectoring insects (e.g., aphids). Thus, a virus isolate obtained from an infected tree could be a population of multiple strains [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The overall phenotype or a degree of its manifestation would depend on the composition and structure of a particular virus population, which results in a wide range of phenotypes that can be found.
