<p>Citrus tristeza virus (CTV), a member of the family Closteroviridae, represents one of the most intricate viruses with an overwhelmingly complex biology. From a standpoint of economic importance, CTV is regarded as the most destructive viral pathogen of citrus. During the past century, virus-induced epidemics of quick decline (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008416.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), a disease, which was named “tristeza” after the Portuguese word for “sadness,” killed millions of trees in the citrus-growing areas in North and South America and the Mediterranean [

From a research standpoint, CTV is one of the most challenging viruses to handle, which is due to the large size of its RNA genome, the fragile nature of the virions that have a shape of long flexuous thread-like filaments (

Despite all these difficulties, there have been many instances when research on CTV has resulted in the discovery of novel aspects and phenomena in virus–virus and virus–host interactions and has allowed to generate reagents, which may not be amenable with small, less complex viruses. This Review discusses five exciting and important facts about this virus.
