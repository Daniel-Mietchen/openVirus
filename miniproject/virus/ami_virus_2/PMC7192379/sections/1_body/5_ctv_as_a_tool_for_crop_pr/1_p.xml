<p>A few years ago, CTV was developed into a vector for transient expression of sequences of interest (e.g., genes of polyproteins or RNA fragments) in citrus trees, which opened new avenues for managing citrus and, possibly, other perennial crops [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Upon infection of citrus trees, this vector was capable of expressing the foreign marker gene continuously for many years [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Fortunately, there are many variants of CTV that do not cause disease in most citrus cultivars. Those would be good candidates for the development of expression vectors.
