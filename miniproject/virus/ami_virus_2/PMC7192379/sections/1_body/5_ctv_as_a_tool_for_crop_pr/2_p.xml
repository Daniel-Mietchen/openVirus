<p>Several important traits make the CTV-based vector an attractive tool for crop management. One of them is its unprecedented stability: the modified virus has retained and expressed a foreign insert in planta for years, which compares to days or weeks for most other vectors engineered based on smaller plant viruses. Such a feature of the CTV vector correlates with an unusual intrinsic stability of the CTV consensus genome and slow evolutionary rate shown for this virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The CTV vector could be used to screen candidate genes for potential beneficial functions in citrus or as vehicles to express known sequences or silence host genes to protect or modify existing trees. Currently, the CTV vector is being tested as a tool to manage citrus greening (known as Huanglongbing [HLB]), a devastating bacterial disease that has been endemic in most citrus-growing areas in Asia for a long time and more recently has spread throughout citrus regions in South America and then in North America [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The variants of the vector carry potentially protective sequences (e.g., genes of antimicrobial polypeptides or RNA interference sequences) that are designed to target Candidatus 
 <italic>Liberibacter asiaticus</italic>, the disease causal agent, or the insects that transmit the bacterium. Importantly, although expected to work for a relatively long term, the modified viruses will eventually lose the inserted sequences such that those vectors would not add anything permanently to the environment.
