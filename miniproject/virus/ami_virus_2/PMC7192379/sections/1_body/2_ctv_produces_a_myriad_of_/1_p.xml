<p>During infection, CTV produces a plethora of different RNA species. Those include the genomic RNA and its complementary negative-stranded copy, a nested set of 3’-coterminal sgRNAs that serve as mRNAs for translation of the internal and 3’-end genes and their corresponding negative-stranded complements along with the 5’-terminal positive-stranded sgRNAs, which are generated as a result of promoting or terminating activity of the same sgRNA controller elements (CEs; [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008416.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). With CTV, the mechanism of sgRNA production is not fully understood, and, thus, the RNA signatures that drive their synthesis are referred to as CEs, rather than promoters or terminators. There are also two abundant 5’-terminal positive-stranded noncoding sgRNAs of about 750 and 650 nucleotides in size [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Those were named as low-molecular-weight tristeza RNAs 1 and 2 (LMT1 and LMT2, respectively). Not much is known about the shorter RNA, besides an observation that the emergence of LMT2 correlates with virus assembly [

LMT1 counteracts the host response against the invading virus by subverting the phytohormone-mediated (e.g., salicylic acid-mediated) plant defense [

In addition to these sgRNAs, various defective RNAs composed of variable-in-size 5’- and 3’-sequences with or without sequences derived from the central genomic region and large amounts of small RNAs generated in the process of viral RNAs being targeted by the host RNA silencing machinery add to the complexity of the RNA species produced upon CTV infection [
