<p>CTV possesses a 19.3 kilobase (kb) positive-stranded RNA genome, which is nearly twice as large as the average sized RNA virus genome of 10 kb [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In the world of plant viruses, CTV stands out as the virus with the largest nonsegmented RNA genome. In a broader perspective, the size of the CTV genome could be compared with that of animal nidoviruses whose genomes are represented by positive-sense RNA molecules ranging between 20 and 41.1 kb in size [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Besides the size, the genome of CTV that encodes 12 open reading frames (ORFs) has other peculiar features, among which are the presence of two sets of duplicated and diverged genes, e.g., the genes for the papain-like leader proteases and the genes for the major and minor coat proteins as well as the presence of a gene closely related to the genes coding for the cellular heat shock proteins in the HSP70 family and of three genes coding for suppressors of host RNA silencing [

The most 5’-proximal ORF, ORF1a, is expressed from the genomic RNA resulting in production of a 349-kDa protein that contains a tandem of two leader protease domains plus methyltransferase-like and helicase-like domains. Translation of ORF1a occasionally continues into ORF1b encoding the polymerase-like domain by a frameshift in an unusual +1 configuration. It was suggested that the large polyproteins undergo further proteolytic processing mediated by the viral proteases, which releases protein subunits participating in virus replication in a manner similar to other closteroviruses [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The other 10 ORFs are expressed via 3’-coterminal subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) and encode proteins involved in assembly of CTV virions, virus movement, suppression of the host antiviral response, and expansion of the viral host range [
