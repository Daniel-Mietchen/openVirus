<p>Most of the CTV proteins play multiple roles in the virus infection cycle, which is in agreement with often found multifunctional nature of viral proteins. Yet, one of them, a unique nonconserved p33, appears to be the champion when it comes to the functions it performs. The research demonstrated that p33 is a membrane-associated protein, and its membrane association confers virus ability to extend the host range [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008416.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The p33 protein possesses certain characteristics found in a number of movement proteins of other plant viruses: It localizes at plasmodesmata (the channels within the cell walls of plant cells connecting the cytoplasm of adjacent cells and enabling transport of materials) and has the ability to polymerize forming extracellular tubules [
