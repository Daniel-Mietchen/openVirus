  <p>Developmental phases of diagnostic tests. Phases 1 and 2 typically occur in an academic setting, while phases 3 and 4 occur in a company after commercial transfer. Most diagnostic technologies are at the proof-of-concept stage, and few are in phase 3 that can be quickly adapted for diagnosing pathogens in new outbreaks. The advancement of more phase 2 technologies into phase 3 would increase the number of approaches for detecting new pathogens.</p>
