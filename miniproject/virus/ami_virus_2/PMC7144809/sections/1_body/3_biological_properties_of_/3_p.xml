<p>The four structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include the spike surface glycoprotein (S), small envelope protein (E), matrix protein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N). In coronaviruses, the 
 <italic>S</italic> gene codes for the receptor-binding spike protein that enables the virus to infect cells.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
 </sup> This spike protein mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion, which determines host tropism and transmission capabilities.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>
 </sup> In SARS-CoV-2, the 
 <italic>S</italic> gene is divergent with &lt;75% nucleotide sequence similarity when compared to all previously described SARS-related coronaviruses.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>
 </sup> The other three structural proteins are more conserved than the spike protein and are necessary for general coronavirus function.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
 </sup> These proteins are involved in encasing the RNA and/or in protein assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis.
