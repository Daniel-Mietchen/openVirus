<p>SARS-CoV-2 appears to interact with the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for entry into cells. Zhou 
 <italic>et al</italic>. conducted infectivity studies by incubating SARS-CoV-2 with HeLa cells of differential ACE2 receptor expression.

 </sup> The authors showed co-localization of the fluorescently stained viruses with cells that express the ACE2 receptor from Chinese horseshoe bats, pigs, humans, and civets, but not from mice. The ACE2 mRNA is present in almost all human organs. ACE2 is present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in the lungs, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, liver bile ducts, kidney parietal epithelial cells, and the brain. It is also expressed on the surface of lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine that allows them to be infected. Tissues of the upper respiratory tract (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>., oral and nasal mucosa and nasopharynx) did not show surface expression of ACE2 on epithelial cells and therefore are unlikely the primary site of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

 </sup> CT scans may show higher opacity in the lower lungs because cells in that region express more ACE2. SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from oral swabs, BAL fluid, and stool.

 </sup> Higher viral loads have been recorded in the nose 
 <italic>versus</italic> the throat, with similar viral loads seen in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.
