<p>SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded positive sense RNA genome that is âˆ¼30,000 nucleotides in length.

 </sup> The genome encodes 27 proteins including an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (
 <italic>RdRP</italic>) and four structural proteins.

 <italic>RdRP</italic> acts in conjunction with nonstructural proteins to maintain genome fidelity. A region of the 
 <italic>RdRP</italic> gene in SARS-CoV-2 was shown to be highly similar to a region of the 
 <italic>RdRP</italic> gene found in bat coronavirus RaTG13 and 96% similar to the RaTG13 overall genome sequence.

 </sup> Of 104 strains sequenced between December 2019 and mid-February 2020, 99.9% sequence homology was observed, but, more recently, changes in the viral genome have been catalogued, showing a higher sequence diversity.
