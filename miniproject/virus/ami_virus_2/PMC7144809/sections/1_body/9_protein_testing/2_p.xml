 </sup> Zhang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. detected immunoglobulin G and M (IgG and IgM) from human serum of COVID-19 patients using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

 </sup> They used the SARS-CoV-2 Rp3 nucleocapsid protein, which has 90% amino acid sequence homology to other SARS-related viruses. The recombinant proteins adsorb onto the surface of 96-well plates, and the excess protein is washed away. Diluted human serum is added for 1 h, after which the plate is washed again. Antihuman IgG functionalized with horseradish peroxidase is added and allowed to bind to the target. The plate is washed, followed by the addition of the substrate 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. The peroxidase reacts with the substrate to cause a color change that can be detected by a plate reader. If anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG is present, it will be sandwiched between the adsorbed nucleoprotein and the antihuman IgG probe, resulting in a positive signal. The IgM test by Zhang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. has a similar structure but uses antihuman IgM adsorbed to the plate and an anti-Rp3 nucleocapsid probe. They tested 16 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient samples (confirmed by RT-PCR) and found the levels of these antibodies increased over the first 5 days after symptom onset. On day zero, 50% and 81% of patients were positive for IgM and IgG, respectively, but this increased to 81% and 100% at day five.

 </sup> Antibodies were detected in respiratory, blood, or fecal samples. Xiang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. also detected SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in suspected cases.

 </sup> Given the recent studies, there may also be other protein or cellular markers that can be used for detection. Guan 
 <italic>et al</italic>. showed that infected patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and D-dimer as well as low levels of lymphocytes, leukocytes, and blood platelets.

 </sup> The challenge of using these biomarkers is that they are also abnormal in other illnesses. A multiplex test with both antibody and small molecule markers could improve specificity.
