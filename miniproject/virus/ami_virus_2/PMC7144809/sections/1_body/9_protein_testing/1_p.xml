<p>Viral protein antigens and antibodies that are created in response to a SARS-CoV-2 infection can be used for diagnosing COVID-19. Changes in viral load over the course of the infection may make viral proteins difficult to detect. For example, Lung 
 <italic>et al</italic>. showed high salivary viral loads in the first week after onset of symptoms, which gradually declined with time.

 </sup> In contrast, antibodies generated in response to viral proteins may provide a larger window of time for indirectly detecting SARS-CoV-2. Antibody tests can be particularly useful for surveillance of COVID-19. One potential challenge with developing accurate serological tests includes potential cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with antibodies generated against other coronaviruses. Lv 
 <italic>et al</italic>. tested plasma samples from 15 COVID-19 patients against the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV and saw a high frequency of cross-reactivity.
