<p>COVID-19 is currently diagnosed with RT-PCR and has been screened for with CT scans, but each technique has its own drawbacks. There are three issues that have arisen with RT-PCR. First, the availability of PCR reagent kits has not kept up with demand. Second, community hospitals outside of urban cities lack the PCR infrastructure to accommodate high sample throughput. Lastly, RT-PCR relies on the presence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 in the sample collected. If an asymptomatic patient was infected with SARS-CoV-2 but has since recovered, PCR would not identify this prior infection, and control measures would not be enforced. Meanwhile, CT systems are expensive, require technical expertise, and cannot specifically diagnose COVID-19. Other technologies need to be adapted to SARS-CoV-2 to address these deficiencies.</p>
