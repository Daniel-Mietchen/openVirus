<p>After designing the primers and probes, the next step involves optimizing assay conditions (

 <italic>g</italic>., reagent conditions, incubation times, and temperatures), followed by PCR testing. RT-PCR can be performed in either a one-step or a two-step assay. In a one-step assay, reverse transcription and PCR amplification are consolidated into one reaction. This assay format can provide rapid and reproducible results for high-throughput analysis. The challenge is the difficulty in optimizing the reverse transcription and amplification steps as they occur simultaneously, which leads to lower target amplicon generation. In the two-step assay, the reaction is done sequentially in separate tubes.

 </sup> This assay format is more sensitive than the one-step assay, but it is more time-consuming and requires optimizing additional parameters.
