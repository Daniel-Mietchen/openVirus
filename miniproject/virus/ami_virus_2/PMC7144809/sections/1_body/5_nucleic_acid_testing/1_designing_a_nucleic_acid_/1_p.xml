 </sup> A number of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) kits have been designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 genetically (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref>). RT-PCR involves the reverse transcription of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) strands, followed by amplification of specific regions of the cDNA.

 </sup> The design process generally involves two main steps: (1) sequence alignment and primer design, and (2) assay optimization and testing. Corman 
 <italic>et al</italic>. aligned and analyzed a number of SARS-related viral genome sequences to design a set of primers and probes.

 </sup> Among the SARS-related viral genomes, they discovered three regions that had conserved sequences: (1) the 
 <italic>RdRP</italic> gene (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene) in the open reading frame ORF1ab region, (2) the 
 <italic>E</italic> gene (envelope protein gene), and (3) the 
 <italic>N</italic> gene (nucleocapsid protein gene). Both the 
 <italic>RdRP</italic> and 
 <italic>E</italic> genes had high analytical sensitivity for detection (technical limit of detection of 3.6 and 3.9 copies per reaction), whereas the 
 <italic>N</italic> gene provided poorer analytical sensitivity (8.3 copies per reaction). The assay can be designed as a two-target system, where one primer universally detects numerous coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2 and a second primer set only detects SARS-CoV-2.
