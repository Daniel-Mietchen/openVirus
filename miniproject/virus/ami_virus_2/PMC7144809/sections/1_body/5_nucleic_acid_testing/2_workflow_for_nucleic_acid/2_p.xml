<p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) uses a one-step real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay, which provides quantitative information on viral loads, to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> To perform the assay, the viral RNA is extracted and added to a master mix. The master mix contains nuclease-free water, forward and reverse primers, a fluorophore-quencher probe, and a reaction mix (consisting of reverse transcriptase, polymerase, magnesium, nucleotides, and additives).

 </sup> The master mix and extracted RNA are loaded into a PCR thermocycler, and the incubation temperatures are set to run the assay. The CDC has recommended cycling conditions for rRT-PCR.

 </sup> During rRT-PCR, the fluorophore-quencher probe is cleaved, generating a fluorescent signal. The fluorescent signal is detected by the thermocycler, and the amplification progress is recorded in real time. The probe sequence used by Guan 
 <italic>et al</italic>. was Black Hole Quencher-1 (BHQ1, quencher) and fluorescein amidite (FAM, fluorophore). This reaction takes âˆ¼45 min and can occur in a 96-well plate, where each well contains a different sample or control. There must be both a positive and a negative control to interpret the final results properly when running rRT-PCR. For SARS-CoV-2, the CDC provides a positive control sequence called nCoVPC.
