<p>At least 11 nucleic-acid-based methods and eight antibody detection kits have been approved in China by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) for detecting SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> However, RT-PCR is the most predominantly used method for diagnosing COVID-19 using respiratory samples.

 </sup> Upper respiratory samples are broadly recommended, although lower respiratory samples are recommended for patients exhibiting productive cough.

 </sup> Upper respiratory tract samples include nasopharyngeal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal washes, and nasal aspirates. Lower respiratory tract samples include sputum, BAL fluid, and tracheal aspirates. Both BAL and tracheal aspirates can be high risk for aerosol generation. The detectable viral load depends on the days after illness onset. In the first 14 days after onset, SARS-CoV-2 could most reliably be detected in sputum followed by nasal swabs, whereas throat swabs were unreliable 8 days after symptom onset.

 </sup> Given the variability in the viral loads, a negative test result from respiratory samples does not rule out the disease. These negatives could result from improper sampling techniques, low viral load in the area sampled, or mutations in the viral genome.
