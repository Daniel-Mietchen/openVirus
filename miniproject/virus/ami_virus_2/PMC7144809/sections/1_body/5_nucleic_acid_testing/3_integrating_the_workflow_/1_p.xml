<p>There are different implementation workflows for RT-PCR tests in clinical settings. Corman 
 <italic>et al</italic>. proposed a three-step workflow for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> They define the three steps as first line screening, confirmation, and discriminatory assays. To maximize the number of infected patients identified, the first step detects all SARS-related viruses by targeting different regions of the 
 <italic>E</italic> gene. If this test is positive, then they propose the detection of the 
 <italic>RdRP</italic> gene using two different primers and two different probes. If these results are also positive, then they conduct the discriminatory test with one of the two probe sequences.

 </sup> They screened samples using primers for the 
 <italic>N</italic> gene and used those from the 
 <italic>ORFlb</italic> gene for confirmation. A diagnosis where the patient sample is positive with 
 <italic>N</italic> gene primer and negative with the 
 <italic>ORFlb</italic> gene would be inconclusive. In such situations, protein tests (
 <italic>i</italic>.
 <italic>e</italic>., antibody tests) or sequencing would be required to confirm the diagnosis.
