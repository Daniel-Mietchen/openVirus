<p>Molecular techniques are more suitable than syndromic testing and CT scans for accurate diagnoses because they can target and identify specific pathogens. The development of molecular techniques is dependent upon understanding (1) the proteomic and genomic composition of the pathogen or (2) the induction of changes in the expression of proteins/genes in the host during and after infection. As of March 24, 2020, the genomic and proteomic compositions of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified, but the host response to the virus is still under investigation. The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted with metagenomic RNA sequencing, an unbiased and high-throughput method of sequencing multiple genomes.

 </sup> According to the joint report by the World Health Organization (WHO) and China, 104 strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were isolated and sequenced using Illumina and Oxford nanopore sequencing from the end of December 2019 to mid-February 2020.

 </sup> Illumina sequencing is a sequence-by-synthesis method using solid-phase bridge amplification, whereras nanopore sequencing involves translocating a DNA molecule through a protein pore and measuring subsequent shifts in voltage to determine the DNA sequence.
