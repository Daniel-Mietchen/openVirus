<p>In addition to isothermal amplification, there are other nucleic acid tests that could be used for SARS-CoV-2 detection. SHERLOCK is a detection strategy that uses Cas13a ribonuclease for RNA sensing.

 </sup> Viral RNA targets are reverse transcribed to cDNA and isothermally amplified using reverse polymerase amplification. The amplified products are transcribed back into RNA. Cas13a complexes with a RNA guide sequence that binds with the amplified RNA product.

 </sup> Upon target binding, Cas13a is activated. Cas13a then cleaves surrounding fluorophore-quencher probes to produce a fluorescent signal. All components of SHERLOCK can be freeze-dried. Prior studies using SHERLOCK could detect as few as 2000 copies/mL in clinical serum or urine isolates for Zika virus.
