<p>Isothermal amplification techniques can be multiplexed at the amplification and/or readout stage. Multiplexing can use polymeric beads encoded with unique optical signatures (

 </sup> Multiplexing increases the amount of information gained from a single test and improves clinical sensitivity and specificity.

 </sup> One way of encoding unique signatures is through agents that emit fluorescent signals. Each unique emission codes for the capturing DNA or antibody on the bead surface. A positive detection occurs when a patient’s sample contains a sequence or antigen that links the bead’s capture molecule with a secondary probe (labeled with fluorophore with a different emission than the beads). There are barcoded-bead multiplex panels for diagnosing cystic fibrosis and respiratory diseases.

 </sup> Barcoded-bead assays/systems are engineered for laboratory use, but efforts are underway to develop them for the point-of-care. However, the difficulty lies with the design of the readout device. The complex barcode signal, which stems from the organic molecules, requires a unique instrument design to discern the codes. Researchers are working on overcoming this limitation by using inorganic quantum dots for barcoding, which enables battery-operated excitation and a smartphone camera to capture the emission signal. Kim
