<p>Nucleic acid tests using isothermal amplification are currently in development for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Isothermal amplification techniques are conducted at a single temperature and do not need specialized laboratory equipment to provide similar analytical sensitivities to PCR.

 </sup> These techniques include recombinase polymerase amplification, helicase-dependent amplification, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Several academic laboratories have developed and clinically tested reverse transcription LAMP (RT-LAMP) tests for SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> RT-LAMP uses DNA polymerase and four to six primers to bind to six distinct regions on the target genome. In a four-primer system, there are two inner primers (a forward and a reverse inner primer) and two outer primers; LAMP is highly specific because it uses a higher number of primers.

 </sup> In LAMP diagnostic tests, a patient sample is added to the tube, and the amplified DNA is detected by turbidity (a byproduct of the reaction), color (addition of a pH-sensitive dye), or fluorescence (addition of a fluorescent dye that binds to double-stranded DNA).

 </sup> The reaction occurs in &lt;1 h at 60–65 °C with an analytical limit of detection of ∼75 copies per μL. The approach is simple to operate, easy to visualize for detection, has less background signal, and does not need a thermocycler.

 </sup> The drawbacks to LAMP are the challenges of optimizing primers and reaction conditions. Other isothermal amplification techniques for COVID-19 detection are in development.
