 </sup> The symptoms can vary, with some patients remaining asymptomatic, while others present with fever, cough, fatigue, and a host of other symptoms. The symptoms may be similar to patients with influenza or the common cold. At this stage, the most likely mode of transmission is thought to be through direct contact and droplet spread.

 </sup> A recent study looking at aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 showed that the virus may be found in aerosols (&lt;5 Î¼m) for at least up to 3 h and may be more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard.
