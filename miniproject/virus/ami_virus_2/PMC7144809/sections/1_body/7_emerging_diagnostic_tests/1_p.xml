<p>According to the WHO, the immediate priority for COVID-19 diagnostics research is the development of nucleic acid and protein tests and detection at the point-of-care.

 </sup> The longer-term priority is to integrate these tests into multiplex panels. In order to improve surveillance efforts, serological tests using proteins are needed in addition to nucleic acid tests. These tests have the benefits of detection after recovery, unlike nucleic acid tests. This enables clinicians to track both sick and recovered patients, providing a better estimate of total SARS-CoV-2 infections. Point-of-care tests are cost-effective, hand-held devices used to diagnose patients outside of centralized facilities. These can be operated in areas like community centers to reduce the burden on clinical laboratories.
