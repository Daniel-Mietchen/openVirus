<p>Point-of-care tests are used to diagnose patients without sending samples to centralized facilities, thereby enabling communities without laboratory infrastructure to detect infected patients. Lateral flow antigen detection for SARS-CoV-2 is one point-of-care approach under development for diagnosing COVID-19.

 </sup> In commercial lateral flow assays, a paper-like membrane strip is coated with two lines: gold nanoparticle-antibody conjugates are present in one line and capture antibodies in the other. The patientâ€™s sample (
 <italic>e</italic>.
 <italic>g</italic>., blood and urine) is deposited on the membrane, and the proteins are drawn across the strip by capillary action. As it passes the first line, the antigens bind to the gold nanoparticle-antibody conjugates, and the complex flows together through the membrane. As they reach the second line, the complex is immobilized by the capture antibodies, and a red or blue line becomes visible. Individual gold nanoparticles are red in color, but a solution containing clustered gold nanoparticles is blue due to the coupling of the plasmon band. The lateral flow assay has demonstrated a clinical sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 57%, 100%, and 69% for IgM and 81%, 100%, and 86% for IgG, respectively. A test that detects both IgM and IgG yields a clinical sensitivity of 82%.

 </sup> Nucleic acid testing can also be incorporated into the lateral flow assay. Previously, a RT-LAMP test was combined with lateral flow readout to detect MERS-CoV.

 </sup> These tests are single use and suffer from poor analytical sensitivity in comparison to RT-PCR. To improve the assay readout signal, researchers have developed a variety of signal amplifying techniques (
