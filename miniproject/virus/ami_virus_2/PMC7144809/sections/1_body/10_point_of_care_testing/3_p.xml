<p>Here, we described some diagnostic technologies that have shown clinical feasibility. 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref>
 </xref> provides a more extensive list of emerging technologies that can be adapted for detecting SARS-CoV-2. There are many platforms being developed in academic laboratories such as electrochemical sensors, paper-based systems, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering based systems. Such approaches are in the early stages of development and cannot be used to diagnose COVID-19 immediately. One can delineate diagnostic technology development into four phases (

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>). Phase 1 refers to technologies that are at the proof-of-concept stage where researchers use synthetic targets to validate the concept. Phase 2 refers to technologies that have analyzed a small number of patient samples (
