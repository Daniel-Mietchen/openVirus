<p>Another approach for use at the point-of-care is microfluidic devices. These devices consist of a palm-sized chip etched with micrometer-sized channels and reaction chambers. The chip mixes and separates liquid samples using electrokinetic, capillary, vacuum, and/or other forces. These chips can be constructed with materials such as polydimethyl sulfoxide, glass, or paper. The key advantages of using microfluidics include miniaturization, small sample volume, rapid detection times, and portability.

 </sup> Laksanasopin 
 <italic>et al</italic>. developed a microfluidics-based smartphone attachment to detect antibodies against three sexually transmitted infections by sequentially moving reagents prestored on a cassette. The platform showed 100% and 87% clinical sensitivity and specificity for HIV, respectively, when tested on 96 patients in Rwanda.
