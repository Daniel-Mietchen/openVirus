<p>People suspected to have COVID-19 can encounter communication barriers with their healthcare providers. Anyone exhibiting mild respiratory symptoms may be hesitant to travel to overcrowded hospitals, as they face an increased risk of contracting COVID-19. Smartphones can be leveraged to provide a direct line of communication between patients and clinicians without risking infection of either party. During the 2009 influenza pandemic, Switzerland used medical teleconsultations to manage suspected cases in addition to its existing reporting system.

 </sup> Teleconsultations led to higher total reporting of influenza compared to in-person consultations due to the lower barrier of access. If COVID-19 infected individuals visit a hospital and test positive, patients with mild symptoms are sent home for self-quarantine.

 </sup> Self-quarantine naturally deters communication between patients and clinicians, resulting in adverse mental health effects for the patient and reduced monitoring by the clinician. Smartphone apps can connect patients with mental health counselors to cope with isolation and fear during disease outbreaks and self-quarantine.

 </sup> In addition, patients can self-report symptoms and behaviors, facilitating remote monitoring by clinicians.

 </sup> Smartphone-based reporting also provides epidemiologists with information relevant to potential transmission mechanisms. For example, during the 2013 MERS outbreak, a smartphone app was used to monitor travelers during their Hajj pilgrimage. In the app, users reported hand hygiene protocols, animal contact, and onset of symptoms, both during the pilgrimage and after returning to their home countries.
