 </sup> At the time, Ontario did not have a provincial public health agency, but British Columbia’s agency previously identified that the province was at risk of importing emerging infectious diseases. Prior to the SARS outbreak, British Columbia’s public health agency established a digital network to facilitate communication across the province.
