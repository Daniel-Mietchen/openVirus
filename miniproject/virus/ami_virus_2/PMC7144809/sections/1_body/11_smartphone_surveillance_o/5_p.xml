 </sup> These devices can simplify diagnostic workflow by automating readout and databasing. For example, a smartphone-based microscope was field tested in Cameroon and demonstrated faster turnaround times than standard techniques.

 </sup> Kanazawa 
 <italic>et al</italic>. validated the use of smartphones accompanied by forward looking infrared radar (FLIR) for the thermal detection of body temperature due to inflammation. This technology may also be adapted for the detection of fever, a common symptom of many coronaviruses including COVID-19.

 </sup> Mudanyali 
 <italic>et al</italic>. also developed a smartphone-based microscope that transfers diagnostic results to a database for analysis and spatiotemporal mapping.

 </sup> These devices can help address the need for point-of-care testing at the community level, where there is underreporting.
