 </sup> A cluster of patients were admitted with fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms.

 </sup> Patients were scanned using computed tomography (CT), which revealed varied opacities (denser, more profuse, and confluent) in comparison to images of healthy lungs.

 </sup> This finding led to the initial diagnosis of pneumonia. Additional nucleic acid analysis using multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of known pathogen panels led to negative results, suggesting that the cause of pneumonia was of unknown origin.

 </sup> By January 10, 2020, samples from patients’ bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were analyzed to reveal a pathogen with a similar genetic sequence to the betacoronavirus B lineage. It was discovered that this new pathogen had ∼80%, ∼50%, and ∼96% similarity to the genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and bat coronavirus RaTG13, respectively.

 </sup> The novel coronavirus was named SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing COVID-19. As of April 2, 2020, the disease has spread to at least 202 countries, infected over 1 million people, and resulted in at least 45,526 deaths globally. It is suspected that the total number of reported COVID-19 infections is underestimated, as there are many mild or asymptomatic cases that go undetected.

 </sup> From the Diamond Princess cruise ship case study, an estimate of 17.9% of asymptomatic cases were reported. Asymptomatic individuals are as infectious as symptomatic individuals and are therefore capable of further spreading the disease.
