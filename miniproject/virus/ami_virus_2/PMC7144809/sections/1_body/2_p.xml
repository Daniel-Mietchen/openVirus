In this review article, we aim to summarize the current known biological properties of SARS-CoV-2, diagnostic tools and clinical results for detecting SARS-CoV-2, emerging diagnostics, and surveillance technology to curb the spread. This is a rapidly moving topic of research, and a review article that encompasses the current findings may be useful for guiding strategies to deal with the current COVID-19 pandemic.
