<p>The availability of established diagnostic technologies (phase 3,

 </xref>) have enabled researchers to plug-and-play in the design of COVID-19 diagnostics. Such technologies took decades to optimize, but they are now playing an important role in identifying and managing the spread of COVID-19. Lessons learned from the 2002 SARS outbreak have guided the development of COVID-19 identification and detection. Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify the morphology of the virus, genome sequencing was used to confirm the identity of the virus, and sequence data were used to help design PCR primers and probes. SARS-CoV took 5 months to be identified. The same techniques were used to identify SARS-CoV-2 in only 3 weeks.

 </sup> The rapid identification and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 has enabled the rapid development of nucleic acid tests. These approaches provide a first line of defense against an outbreak. The next step being worked on is to establish serological tests because they are easier to administer and may complement nucleic acid tests for diagnosing COVID-19 infection. There is now a call for development of point-of-care tests and multiplex assays. Technologies that are straddling phases 2 and 3 (

  <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>
 </xref>) such as isothermal amplification, barcoding, and microfluidic technologies should be further developed so that they can become plug-and-play systems and can be rapidly implemented in an outbreak situation. The combination of diagnostics and smartphones should provide greater communication and surveillance. In conclusion, diagnostics are an important part of the toolbox for dealing with outbreaks because they enable healthcare workers to direct resources and efforts to patients with COVID-19. This process can curb the spread of infectious pathogens and reduce mortality.
