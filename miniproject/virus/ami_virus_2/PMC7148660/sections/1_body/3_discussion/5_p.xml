<p id="p0115">RSV is known to be a major nosocomial hazard on paediatric wards, especially in cases of age less than 5 months, prematurity and chronic lung disease of prematurity [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Previous studies described rates of nosocomial RSV infections between 0.4 and 9.6% [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>], with poorer clinical outcomes than community-acquired RSV infections [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Contrasting with these results, we observed in our pediatric wards a low rate of nosocomial RSV-related ALRIs (0.06% of inpatients) and no death related to nosocomial RSV infection. This low rate of nosocomial infections could be related to our multifaceted infection control strategy including a high proportion of single-patient rooms (for both infected and uninfected patients), staff training repeated before each season of viral epidemics, screening of symptomatic patients, isolation/cohorting, hand washing, gloves and masks, gowns (for staff attending infants with respiratory symptoms) and restriction of visitors.
