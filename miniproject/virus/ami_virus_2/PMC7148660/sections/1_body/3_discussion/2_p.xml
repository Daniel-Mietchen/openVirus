<p id="p0100">Some results regarding community-acquired RSV infections requiring hospitalization are in line with previous reports: most of the subjects hospitalized with RSV were aged ≤ 12 months, and especially ≤ 6 months [

 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. The median length of hospital stay was in the range of that reported in previous pediatric studies (between 2 and 11 days). However, the prevalence of admission to ICU and the mortality rate were higher than previously described in high-income countries (41.0% versus 2–12%, and 1.3% versus &lt; 0.5%, respectively) [

This could be explained by the high prevalence of CCC in the population of children followed in our tertiary hospital, and, consequently, in those admitted for community-acquired RSV infections. This proportion was higher than in previous studies, where typically &gt; 70% of children hospitalized with RSV-related ALRI/bronchiolitis had no underlying medical conditions [

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>]. Thus, the epidemiological characteristics of patients admitted at our hospital with community-acquired RSV infections cannot be extrapolated to other French pediatric centers.
