<p id="p0060">Between October 2018 and February 2019, 229 patients admitted to our hospital were diagnosed with community-acquired RSV-associated ALRIs. Their characteristics are summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> . The majority were less than 6 months old (60.3%) and, among them, few were born preterm (18.8%). At least one CCC was present in 40.1% of subjects, most frequently a respiratory CCC. Viral and bacterial co-/supra-infections were documented in 17.5% and 5.7% of cases, respectively, but around one in two patients received antibiotics. The proportion of patients requiring ICU admission was high (40.1%) but only 3 patients (1.3%) died. All of them were children with severe cardiovascular ± respiratory CCC and died from acute respiratory distress syndrome.
