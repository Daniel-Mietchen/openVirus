<p id="p0055">Categorical variables appear with their frequency distribution. Non-normally distributed continuous variables are expressed as the median and interquartile range. Chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests were used to compare discrete variables, and the Wilcoxon rank test was used to compare continuous variables between patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial ALRIs. P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
