<p id="p0130">In summary, the burden of community-acquired infections requiring hospitalization is disproportionately higher in infants/children than in adults admitted to our center. Nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs rarely occurred, suggesting good efficacy of our multi-component preventive strategy. However, the burden of nosocomial infection was higher in adults than in children, suggesting that education and training of healthcare workers, patients and visitors about the risk of nosocomial respiratory viral disease should be reinforced on adult wards. The fact than &gt; 97% of patients hospitalized with community-acquired or nosocomial RSV-associated ALRI were not considered at “high-risk” (i.e. requiring immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab) according to the French and American guidelines, highlights the urgent need to develop new and more cost-effective antiviral preventive strategies, in order to decrease the burden of RSV infections requiring hospitalizations.</p>
