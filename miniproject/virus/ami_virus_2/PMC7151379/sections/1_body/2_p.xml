<p id="para0006">A 50-year-old woman, who suffered from acute-onset fever up to 38.6 °C four hours ago, visited the emergency department of a medical center in Taipei City, Taiwan. She denied of cough or other subjective discomforts, and disclosed that she lived in Wuhan, China and just traveled to Taiwan two days prior to hospital visit.
