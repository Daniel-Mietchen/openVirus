<p id="para0010">The sequential changes of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in throat swab, sputum, and gargling water are presented in Figure. A drop of three logs of viral loads was observed among all specimens within one week after admission. However, SARS-CoV-2 persisted to be detectable till 63th day after symptom onset. Among respiratory specimens from different sites, specimen from sputum showed superior sensitivity to samples from throat swab and gargling wash. Initially, specimen from gargling wash showed considerable results compared with specimens from sputum or throat swab. Nevertheless, RT-PCR examinations from sputum still outweighed samples from gargling and throat swab after fever subsided. Among three target genes of the RT-PCR examinations, E gene of SARS-CoV-2 showed superior sensitivity to N and RdRp gene after clinical symptoms resolved. The stool specimen collected on the third day after symptom onset yielded positive results, but turned negative in the following specimens. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 could not be detected in the plasma samples while the SARS-CoV-2 titers in the respiratory specimen remained high.</p>
