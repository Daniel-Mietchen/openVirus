<p id="para0012">This case demonstrated that the virus shedding might continue even after clinical resolution and seroconversion. In addition, although SARS-CoV-2 virus could not be isolated after the 18th day of symptom onset, the positive RT-PCR results continued for more than 60 days. Because of the long interval between these two time points, it might be reasonable to infer that a small amount of viable virus, yet could not be detected by virus culture, remained present after the 18th day of disease course and last for more days. This implies the contagious period of COVID-19 might last more than one week after “clinical recovery”. Many of COVID-19 patients in Taiwan also had similar findings (unpublished data). Such prolonged virus shedding was also observed among asymptomatic pediatric patients in fecal specimen.
