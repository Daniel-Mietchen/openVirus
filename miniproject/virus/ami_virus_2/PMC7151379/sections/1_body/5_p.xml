<p id="para0009">Plasmid DNA containing the SARS-CoV-2 target sequences, including the envelope (E), nucleocapsid (N), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes, was used to construct the standard curve to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 viral load by real-time RT-PCR. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 isolation was performed via Vero E6 and LLC-MK2 cell cultures. The full-length viral sequence was determined using SARS-CoV-2 amplified from the sputum specimen collected on the ninth day after symptom onset, and was submitted to the GISAID (accession number isÂ EPI_ISL_408,489). Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 viral N proteins was determined by western blotting using infected cell lysates.</p>
