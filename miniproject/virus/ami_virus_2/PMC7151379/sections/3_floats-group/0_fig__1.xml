Plasmids containing partial E, N, and RdRp fragments were used respectively as the standards to calculate the amount of SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the specimens. (D) Antibody responses of the present case. Antibody responses of the present case to viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero-E6 cells were determined by the western blot.
