<p>ICU admission and ventilation may be futile in some frail older people with multimorbidity; however, there is a very big ethical difference between decisions made on the basis of futility versus those based on rationing (

Arguments have been made that potential years of life lost should be considered if care is rationed, yet perhaps more critical to consider is the experience and wisdom of older adults. A case in point is Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in the United States. His experience with previous epidemics is priceless to us now. Therefore, it is important that now, more than ever, our communities advocate for our older people and listen to their advice.
