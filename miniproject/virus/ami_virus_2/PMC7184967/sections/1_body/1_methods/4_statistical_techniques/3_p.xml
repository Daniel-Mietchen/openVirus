<p>All models were conducted with maximum likelihood estimation. We estimated Huber-White standard errors that were robust to within-country clustering and modelled our residuals to account for the autocorrelated error structure of our longitudinal data. The models included random intercept and random slope for time with unstructured covariances. We reported regression coefficients and corresponding 95% confidence intervals and 
 <italic>P</italic> values for the fixed part of our models, and standard deviation with 95% confidence interval for the random effects.
