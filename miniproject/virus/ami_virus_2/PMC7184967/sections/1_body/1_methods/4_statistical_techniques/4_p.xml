<p>The progression of COVID-19 mortality before and after the first COVID-19 death were analyzed with random effects models to account for clustering at the country level. We modelled the amount of daily deaths in low and high institutional trust (cutoff point median value 23) after the first COVID-19 death (time=0), which was used as a reference category. We then analyzed countries reacting late (restrictions placed after the first COVID-19 death) and early (restrictions placed before the first COVID-19 death). In both analyses each time point (day) was allowed to have a separate coefficient for the COVID-19 mortality value (presented as deaths/million persons). Models are presented as figures, and they are adjusted for population density, gender, old-age ratio, the proportion of those 65 years or older living with children, life expectancy, and tourist arrivals. Models included country restrictions as daily varying dummies (0=no control, 1=control).</p>
