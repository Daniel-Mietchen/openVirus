<p>To assess the relationship between the daily mortality count and our main theoretical variables, we conducted three separate models: model 1 included perceived sociability, model 2 included timing of national restrictions, and model 3 included institutional trust as an independent variable. All models controlled for the following between-country factors: average household size, population, population density, old-age dependency ratio, life expectancy at birth, health care expenditure per inhabitant, high tourist arrival (dummy variable based on median), and the length of the follow-up period for each country. In addition, our models included time as a within-country predictor of mortality. The end point of our follow-up period (April 14, 2020) was coded as the zero point for our time variable. Preceding days had negative values in descending order until the first day of the countryâ€™s follow-up period. Thus, time was used to estimate the within-country change in mortality during the epidemic, and the between-country variables estimated the country differences in mortality. Except time and high tourist-arrival dummy variables, all independent variables were mean centered before adding them into the regression models.</p>
