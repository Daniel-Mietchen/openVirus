<p>All statistical analyses were conducted with Stata 16 software (StataCorp). Daily COVID-19 mortality during the COVID-19 epidemic in Europe was analyzed with multilevel mixed effects linear regression models. In the multilevel models, the dependent variable was the square root transformed daily mortality count. The count was based on daily follow-ups on COVID-19 mortality cases for each country, starting from the first confirmed infection and ending April 14, 2020. This resulted in follow-up periods that varied between countries (from 82 days in France to 37 days in Cyprus).</p>
