<p>Information on country restrictions included national bans or restrictions. These included bans on public events, curfews, country border closures, restrictions on restaurant operations, and elementary school contact teaching. Public events, curfews, or unauthorized outings were reviewed and applied from the date when the first nationwide restriction became effective. Country border closures were determined starting from the date when all the borders of the country were closed. Restrictions on restaurant operations and elementary school contact teaching were calculated from the date when at least some national restrictions became effective. Restrictions varied in exact content and accuracy across countries.</p>
