<p>The 
 <italic>perceived sociability</italic> was measured with a question: “How often do you take part in social activities compared to others of same age.” The given responses were 1, “Much less than most,” 2 “Less than most,” 3 “About the same,” 4 “More than most,” and 5 “Much more than most.” 
 <italic>Household size</italic> was based on respondents’ information on how many people live regularly in their household. 
 <italic>The proportion of older adults living with children</italic> was calculated by grouping respondents aged 65 years or older according to whether they currently live in the same household with children. 
 <italic>Institutional trust</italic> was measured by respondents’ trust in five institutions, namely, parliament, politicians, political parties, the police, and the legal system. Respondents were asked how much they personally trust these institutions on a scale from 0 to 10, in which 0 meant no trust at all, and 10 meant complete trust. Reliability of the measure was good with Cronbach alpha ranging from 0.82 to 0.92. In the analyses, institutional trust was categorized as very low (19 or less), low (20-22), high (23-29), and very high (30 or more) for an illustrative map, and as low (less than 23) and high (23 or more) based on the median for a random effects regression model.
