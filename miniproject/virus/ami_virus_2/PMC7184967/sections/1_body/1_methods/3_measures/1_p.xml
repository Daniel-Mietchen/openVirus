<p>COVID-19 mortality and incidence time series data were collected for 25 European countries and covered 84 days of the COVID-19 epidemic (January 22 to April 14, 2020). Incidence rates were also collected, but they are treated only as controls, because countries differ a lot in their testing rates. Hence, mortality figures provide more accurate information on the spread of the epidemic from February to April 2020.</p>
