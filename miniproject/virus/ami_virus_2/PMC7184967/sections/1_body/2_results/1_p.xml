<p>Descriptive statistics on the 25 European countries are shown in 
 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been fast everywhere, but our findings reveal significant differences between countries. The most impacted countries in Europe by April 14 are Italy, Spain, and France (see 
 <xref rid="table2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). All of these countries were also significantly late to implement national restrictions. For example, Italy placed national restrictions almost 2 weeks after the first COVID-19 incident (see 
 <xref rid="figure1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). France already had 1 death case in February and was the slowest to react nationwide. It is highly likely that during these days the virus was able to spread fast in the population, which explains the later mortality figures.
