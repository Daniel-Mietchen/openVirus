<p>Our multilevel linear regression models analyzed the daily mortality in 25 countries (
 <xref rid="table3" ref-type="table">Tables 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="table4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). The fixed effect of time was a significant predictor of mortality in all of the models, indicating the increasing trend in deaths during the crisis period. According to the random part of our models, however, there was a between-country variation in this trend. In addition to a within-country change, we found that between-country factors significantly predicted mortality. Model 1 shows that the perceived sociability predicted higher daily mortality. Model 2 shows that late restrictions were associated with higher numbers of COVID-19 deaths. Model 3 shows that institutional trust was negatively associated with daily COVID-19 mortality figures. Of our control variables, population density, life expectancy at birth, health care expenditure per inhabitant, high tourist arrival, and the length of the follow-up period were positively associated with daily mortality, yet the significance of these associations varied between models.
