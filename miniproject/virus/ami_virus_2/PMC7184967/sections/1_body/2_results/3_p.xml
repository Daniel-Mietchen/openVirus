<p>The final part of the analysis focused on the role of institutional trust and reaction time. 
 <xref rid="figure2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the map of Europe and the average number of deaths per million inhabitants in the analyzed 25 countries categorized in four country groups based on their level of institutional trust. The map demonstrates that those countries with low institutional trust have more deaths per million inhabitants on average compared to countries with high trust. We analyzed the difference between countries with low vs high perceived institutional trust using a random effects regression model. 
 <xref rid="figure3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows development after the first COVID-19 death case in low- and high-trust countries. There are no statistically significant differences between the curves. Both curves indicate increases in mortality 2 weeks after the first COVID-19 death case, and there were no statistically significant differences between them. 
 <xref rid="figure4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows deaths per million inhabitants for countries reacting late and early. We can see how the number of deaths per day varied in the 24 days following the first national restrictions, and there is a statistically significant difference between the curves. Increases in mortality were more rapid in those countries reacting late than those reacting early. For example, 23 days after the first COVID-19 death there were 2.5 times more deaths in late-reacting countries (4.56 deaths/million, 95% CI 3.34-5.78) than in early reacting countries (1.83 deaths/million, 95% CI 1.02-2.65).
