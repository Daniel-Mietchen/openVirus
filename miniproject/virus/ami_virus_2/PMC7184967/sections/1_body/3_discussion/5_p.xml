<p>Epidemiologists have not necessarily given enough attention to the societal and social psychological factors explaining epidemics. Although there have been virus epidemics before, the crisis caused by COVID-19 has created a unique global situation, demonstrating how poorly the previous epidemics (eg, SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome) have prepared countries to deal with this disease [

What has made the COVID-19 situation unique when compared to other epidemics, has been the rapid spread of the virus and the unusually hard restrictions placed to prevent physical contact and closeness between people. As European countries in general rely on individual freedom and democracy, it is difficult to close and shutdown societies completely. It becomes crucial to understand how different societies are capable of handling the crisis situation. This is typically reflected in the literature as societal resilience, and institutional trust is an important part of it [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As the crisis is not over, later developments will reveal what kind of role institutional trust eventually had on the wider picture, which also involves factors related to social contacts between people and timely restrictions placed within societies. Our analysis was limited to a relatively short follow-up period and the inability to control for all possible factors involved. We also wish to note that variations across countries exist. This involves, for example, the fact that high-trust countries have adopted different societal strategies to tackle the COVID-19 crisis. Future studies should continue using social scientific evidence in the investigations of worldwide epidemics.
