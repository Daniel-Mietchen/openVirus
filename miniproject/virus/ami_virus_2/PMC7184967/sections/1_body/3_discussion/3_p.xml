<p>One of the key points of our analysis is, however, that the COVID-19 mortality is tied to societal processes. We found major differences in how fast countries were reacting to the COVID-19 outbreak. Compared to China, European countries had time to react, yet national restrictions were placed late. Those countries that are now being hit the hardest by the disease were also the ones that were slowest to react nationwide, most notably Italy, Spain, and France. Our models showed that late national restrictions predicted a higher number of deaths. Despite the unity provided by the European Union, European countries were not working together against the emerging disease threat, and the regulations progressed slowly, taking one step at a time. There were also delays in putting the restrictions into action. Some countries have also taken different strategies to the COVID-19 epidemic. In Scandinavia, for example, Sweden has adopted less restrictions than Denmark, Finland, and Norway. Sweden also had a higher number of deaths per inhabitants at the time of this writing. This example shows that even within similar neighboring countries national precautions to COVID-19 have been different.</p>
