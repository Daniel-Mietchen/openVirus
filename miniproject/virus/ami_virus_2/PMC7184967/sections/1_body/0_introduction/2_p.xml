<p>Much of the focus of COVID-19 discussion and research has centralized on epidemiological factors. The reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) of COVID-19 has been considered higher than that of SARS. In a recent review study, the average R
 <sub>0</sub> of COVID-19 was found to be 3.28 with a median of 2.79 [

Data shows major country variations in the spread and mortality rates of COVID-19 within Europe, but reasons behind the spread of the disease and subsequent mortality remain partly unexplained. Different countries have also responded to the epidemic at different rates, which gives a starting point for our investigations on societal and psychological factors related to the spread of COVID-19. A social scientific perspective could help us understand COVID-19 mortality.
