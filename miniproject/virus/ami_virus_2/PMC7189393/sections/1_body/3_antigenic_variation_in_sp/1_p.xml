<p id="Par23">A study carried out to determine the antigenicity by comparing the antigenic variations in both spike glycoproteins of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV revealed the individuality of most of the CTL epitopes in COVID-19 compared to the SARS-CoV. However, six identical epitopes RISNCVADY, CVADYSVLY, RSFIEDLLF, RVDFCGKGY, MTSCCSCLK, and LKGVKLHY are present in spike glycoprotein of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV (Kumar et al.

As per available information and research data of antigenicity, COVID-19 shows little antigenic similarities with SARS coronavirus. It is possible that antigenic similarity may cause similar antigenic response, and therefore, it can be used as one of the precautionary approach. Variation and similarity in spike glycoprotein and epitopes may be useful to design newer and effective vaccines (Kumar et al.
