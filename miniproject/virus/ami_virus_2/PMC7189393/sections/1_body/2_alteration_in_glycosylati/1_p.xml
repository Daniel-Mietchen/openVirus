<p id="Par22">The comparison of the glycosylation sites between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV of the spike glycoproteins unveiled the presence of novel glycosylation sites in COVID-19, such as NGTK, NFTI, NLTT, and NTSN (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). The presence of novel glycosylation sites in COVID-19 might be due to the variation in sequence. Along with the deviation in reported four glycosylation sites, i.e., NGTK, NFTI, NLTT, and NTSN, COVID-19 spike glycoprotein exhibits the similar glycosylation sites, also present in SARS-CoV (NITN, NGTI, NITN, NFSQ, NESL, NCTF, and NNTV). There is a possibility of interaction between COVID-19 and host receptor through novel glycosylation sites which may have an effect on the process of internalization and linked pathogenesis (Kumar et al.
