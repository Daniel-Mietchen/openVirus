<p id="Par20">The viruses belong to 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family enclosed envelope and positive-stranded RNA (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020</xref>). Coronaviruses have the largest 26–32 kilobase (kb) positive-sense RNA genome. The genome of coronaviruses contains open reading frames (ORFs) of variable number (6–11). In the first ORF, two thirds of the total viral RNA are located. Upon infection, two large precursor polyproteins, namely pp1a and pp1ab, has been translated by viral genome in the host cells. These translated precursor polyproteins get processed into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsp1–nsp16) by viral proteinases. These nonstructural proteins have been numbered according to the position from N to C terminus (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Narayanan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">13.3</xref> depicts the structure of coronavirus representing essential proteins, accessory proteins, and nsp1–16. The remaining ORFs encode accessory proteins. The remaining part of viral genome encodes spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid protein (N). All these four are essential structural proteins. S protein is attached to the host receptor ACE2, including two subunits S1 and S2. The cellular tropism by RBD and virus host range is determined by S1. Virus cell membrane fusion is determined by S2 (Guo et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2009</xref>; Du et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>). Transmembrane nutrient transport and formation of envelop were performed by M protein. N protein and E protein along with several accessory proteins obstruct with host immune response (Guo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>; Pradhan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2020</xref>). The nonstructural proteins play a vital function at the time of viral RNA replication and transcription (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Narayanan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>). The assigned functions of these 16 mature nonstructural proteins are mentioned in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">13.2</xref>. Several nsps are unique enzymes implicated in one or more important step(s) in viral replication. Other nsps appear to be entirely involved in virus–host interactions (De Groot et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>).
