<p id="Par24">The length of encoded proteins in COVID-19 and SARS-like coronaviruses was found nearly same (Guo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). However, longer spike protein of COVID-19 showed a notable difference compared to the bat SARS-like coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. On the whole 12.5% of difference in sequences of S glycoprotein and difference in minimal RBD with 23.6% may cause structural differences in spike glycoproteins of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). The studies performed to measure the average distance between the molecules of superimposed proteins, i.e., RMSD, depict the 1.38 Å local RMSD value between two glycoproteins. This illustrates regardless of 12.8% sequence variation that there is an insignificant structural divergence among the spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and COVID-19. The absence of structural divergence in spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and COVID-19 raises a hope for the treatment of brutal COVID-19. As there is structural similarity in SARS-CoV and COVID-19, the previously trialed and tested attachment inhibitor used for SARS-CoV can be used as the present choice of treatment for COVID-19 (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>).
