<p id="Par25">Genetic recombination is an important evolutionary mechanism in positive-strand RNA viruses. Recombination drives toward the diversity in viral genome by the creation of novel chimeric genomes (Bentley and Evans 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>; Loriere and Holmes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2012</xref>). Irrespective of single- or multiple-segment genome, RNA recombination may occur in the entire RNA viruses (Loriere and Holmes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2012</xref>). Cross-species transmission in RNA viruses is the most common approach to get entered into a new host. The process of recombination assists the entry of viruses as it facilitates viruses to explore a larger proportion of the sequence area, than mutation. This increases the probability of finding a genetic configuration that assists host adaptation (Loriere and Holmes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2012</xref>). Both replicative and non-replicative recombination mechanism works for the viruses. In replicative recombination, the major role is played by viral polymerase; however, other viral or cellular proteins may exist. On the contrary, cellular components are solely responsible for non-replicative recombination (Bentley and Evans
