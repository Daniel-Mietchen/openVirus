<p id="Par26">Recently emerged many human diseases are originated from RNA viruses. There are three mechanisms by which viruses go through evolutionary changes. These are mutations also known as antigenic drift, re-assortment (antigenic shift), and recombination (Shao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>). The emergence of viral diseases in human exhibits active viral genome recombination or re-assortment. Coronavirus that emerged in turkey was a recombinant infectious bronchitis virus which attained a spike protein-encoding gene from coronavirus 122 (Loriere and Holmes
