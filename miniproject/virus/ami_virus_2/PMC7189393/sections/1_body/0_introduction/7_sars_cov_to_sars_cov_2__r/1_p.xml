<p id="Par19">Reported phylogenetic analysis revealed the close relationship between COVID-19 and Bat SARS-like coronavirus (Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>; Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). Although both emerged from the SARS coronavirus, suggesting the newly spread 2019-nCov into human is very much related to SARS-CoV (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">13.2</xref> represents the evolutionary relationship between different lineage of betacoronavirus and their respective cellular receptors through which they interact with the host cell. As per sequence alignment data, the sequence of spike glycoprotein of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV shows 76.2% individuality, 87.2% resemblance, and 2% gaps. This data indicates that COVID-19 spike glycoprotein exhibits higher sequence similarity with 12.8% of variation with SARS-CoV. The study performed by Kumar et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>), on variation of sequences of minimal receptor-binding domain (RBD), revealed 73.3% uniqueness, 83.9% matches, and 0.4% gaps, suggesting a difference of 16.1% and tertiary structure of minimal receptor-binding domain. COVID-19 may have changes in virus-binding capacity shift and infectivity into the receptors of the host cell, due to notable deviation in minimal RBD of S-glycoprotein.
