<p id="Par18">The evolution and emergence of novel coronaviruses are mostly due to the lack of proofreading mechanism in RNA recombination among the present coronaviruses (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). The S gene which encodes viral spike (S) glycoprotein has been proposed the higher frequency of recombination (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). The novel coronavirus is closely related to bat SARS like betacoronavirus. Although, the longer spike protein of 2019-nCoV has remarkable difference when compared with the bat SARS-Cov and SARS-like coronaviruses (Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>). In this chapter, we will discuss about the emergence and reemergence of the SARS coronaviruses and genetic variations from SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2.
