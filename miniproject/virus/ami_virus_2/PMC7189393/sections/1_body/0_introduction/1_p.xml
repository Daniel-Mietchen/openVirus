<p id="Par13">Coronavirus belongs to the large family of viruses, i.e., 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family and the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> (Cui et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Phan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2018</xref>). Genomic structures and phylogenetic relationship reveals that subfamily Coronavirinae contains the four genera alpha coronavirus and betacoronavirus which are restricted to mammals and responsible for respiratory illness in humans such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>; Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Payne 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>; Phan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2018</xref>). The other two genera gamma coronavirus and delta coronavirus infect both birds and mammals (Cui et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Payne 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>; Phan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2018</xref>). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV show severe respiratory diseases in humans, and four others (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HKU1) cause normal upper respiratory illness in the hosts which are immunocompetent, even though some can induce severe infections in elders, young children, and infants (Cui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>; Cascella et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). Alpha and betacoronaviruses can give rise to intense burden on animals; these include recently emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) and the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine enteric diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Cui et al.
