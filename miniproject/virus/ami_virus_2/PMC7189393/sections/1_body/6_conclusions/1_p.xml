<p id="Par34">The newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is strongly related to the predecessor SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV is becoming pandemic which is declared as public health emergency of global concern. The presence of novel glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV-2 makes it possible to become pandemic due to its antigenic divergence. At this time, it is important to understand and educate the mass to follow the instructions given by the authorities and avoid any social gathering. By this at least we can delay the transmission in widespread community. Slowdown of transmission rate will provide time to the researchers and scientists to prepare well and develop vaccine and treatment for this novel coronavirus. The similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV in terms of antigenic sites proposes the scope of SARS-linked peptide-based vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The structural similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV suggests the use of attachment inhibitor, specific to coronavirus as the current option of the treatment. Although the mechanism of species to species transfer of the SARS coronavirus is difficult to understand, SARS-CoV 2003 epidemic makes it clear that animal coronaviruses are budding threats to the human community. Still researches are going on COVID-19. Limited information on novel coronavirus makes some boundaries to explain the complete antigenicity and structure of COVID-19.</p>
