    "The positive-strand RNA viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and recently emerged COVID-19 epidemics, demonstrated the transmission capability of the coronaviruses by crossing the species barrier and emergence in humans. The source of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), firstly reported in December 2019 at Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is a kind of viral pneumonia. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been reported as the introduction of the third highly pathogenic coronavirus which crossed the species barrier and spread into the human population. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were the first two epidemic viruses, respectively, in the twenty-first century. Introduction of the 2019 novel coronaviruses (2019-nCoV) in human population is a worldwide concern, and this might have generated via RNA recombination among the previous reported coronaviruses. The COVID-19 is spreading in an alarming rate, and till date no vaccine or specific medicines are available in the market. The newly emerged coronavirus COVID-19 is strongly related to SARS-CoV except little dissimilarity. In this chapter, we will discuss about the alterations and variations in antigenicity, structural changes, and RNA recombination which might be responsible for the COVID-19 emergence."
