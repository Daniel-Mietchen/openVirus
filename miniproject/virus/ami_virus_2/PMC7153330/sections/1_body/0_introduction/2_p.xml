<p id="p0010">Viruses are small infectious organism or obligate intracellular parasite found in virtually all ecosystem, numbering in millions. Within the last 30Â years, the etiological mechanisms of some notorious viruses affecting humans have been described. Viruses are enclosed by structural coded protein coat along with either a DNA or RNA genome. The genetic material (DNA or RNA) of viruses contain information needed to replicate or to make number of copies of the virus. Viruses are considered as genetic mobile elements of mainly cellular origin, identified by an extended coevolution of host and virus. Specialized host cells providing complex biosynthetic and metabolic machinery of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms help in the propagation of viruses and a whole virus particle is known as virion.</p>
