<p id="p0035">Viruses that are pathogenic to human are broadly classified according to the different regions of the body mostly affected and clinical nature of the infection or disease produced (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 16.1</xref> ). A simple classification system of viruses is the following:
 <list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010">
  <list-item id="u0010">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0040">Neurotropic viruses: These are viruses that affect the central nervous system, e.g., viruses of rabies and poliomyelitis.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0015">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0045">Dermotropic viruses: This class of viruses produces generalized infection by inducing characteristic lesions on the skin, e.g., viruses of measles, small pox, and chicken pox.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0020">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0050">Pneumotropic viruses: These are viruses that produce characteristic symptoms of the respiratory tract, e.g., viruses of influenza and common cold.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0025">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0055">Hepatotropic viruses: This group of viruses infects the liver, e.g., viruses of infectious hepatitis.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0030">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0060">Sialadenitis or salivary gland infection: These are viruses that affect salivary gland or duct, resulting in viral infection such as mumps and flu.</p>
  </list-item>

   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0065">Ocular viral infection: These are viruses that affect the eyes, e.g., viruses of trachoma and epidemic keratoconjunctivitis.</p>

   <p id="p0070">Viruses producing generalized infections: These include viruses of dengue fever and yellow fever.</p>
