<p id="p0020">The genetic material of viruses controls the cells by forcing it to replicate. Generally, infected cells dies as it cannot perform the normal function and after cell death it releases a new virus which continues to infect other cells. A number of viruses alter the cellular functions instead of killing the cells and these infected cells multiply abnormally by losing the control over normal cell division and turning into cancerous cells. A virus proliferates and infects cells causing viral infection.</p>
