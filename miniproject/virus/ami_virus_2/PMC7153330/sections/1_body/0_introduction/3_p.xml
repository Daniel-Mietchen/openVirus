<p id="p0015">Viral infections have the ability to spread from man to man or from other sources to man either by indirect or direct contact, particularly by means of excretal matter, contaminated articles, throat and nose secretions, and very common is droplet infection. An insect vector also spreads infections, e.g., transmission of dengue fever is by mosquito

Sometimes viruses change the function of the cell without destroying the host cell. Viruses might remain dormant for a period of time before multiplying again.
