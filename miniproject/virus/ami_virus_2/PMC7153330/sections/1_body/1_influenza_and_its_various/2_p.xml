<p id="p0075">Influenza is a contagious respiratory infection caused by an influenza virus, commonly known as the flu. The most common symptoms is high fever, coughing, sneezing, runny nose, headache, sore throat, muscle aches (myalgias), and a general feeling of illness (malaise). In early stage of infection, the symptoms of flu are similar to those of the common cold and commonly confused with common cold; however, it is a much more severe disease. In more serious conditions, influenza leads to pneumonia, which could be fatal, significantly in young children and the elderly. However, nausea and vomiting can be produced, especially in children, and mistaken by gastroenteritis or “stomach flu” Typically, influenza is spread by the air because of coughs or sneezes and through infected birds because of their droppings. In addition, it can also be transmitted by direct contact with virus-contaminated surfaces and body fluids such as saliva, nasal secretions, feces, and blood.</p>
