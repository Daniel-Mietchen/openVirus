<p id="p0150">Viral arrangement and mutation processes are the next important mechanism for an antiviral policy. The genome could be managed earlier, and it can utilize the cellular machinery to its benefit (RNA viruses) or it could directly integrate to the host genome (DNA viruses). Reverse transcription, integration, replication, transcription, and translation are the potential steps of this procedure. Coumarins also known as the calanolides are extracted chiefly from 
 <italic>Calophyllum lanigerum</italic> and belong to eminent category of plant-derived antivirals. They have been found to irreversibly bind to the active site of the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Large quantity of calanolides could be extracted from the latex of relevant species of the plant. Calanolide are also chosen for phase II clinical studies for antiretroviral treatment and has shown a synergistic effect with currently approved drugs.
