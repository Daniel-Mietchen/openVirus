<p id="p0155">These medicines hinder the transcription of newly amalgamated viral proteins into virions and their liberation out of the cell. Neuraminidase inhibitors work by hampering the influenza virus liberation out of the infected cells, hence resulting in safeguarding cell-to-cell transmission. Zanamivir and oseltamivir are the two most important parts of the approved drugs of this group. Up till now, more than 30 various types of protease inhibitors are extracted from plants possessing potential antiviral activities. Compounds of different botanical and chemical sources have been studied for this purpose. Extracts from 
 <italic>Zingiber zerumbet, Orostachys japonicus, Boesenbergia pandurata, Alpinia galanga, Coccinia grandis, Cassia garretiana</italic>, and 
 <italic>Eclipta prostrata</italic> have proved their antiviral potential exploiting their protease inhibiting property. Bevirimat extract obtained from a Chinese herb, 
 <italic>Syzygium claviflorum</italic>, has been found to have “maturation inhibition” capability

Hence, both the structural and enzymatic proteins are not formed. Another Chinese preparation, Ching-fang-pai-tu-san consumed as a traditional herbal decoction, contains quercetin, isoquercetin, and chaihu. These compounds stop influenza virus replication by interrupting the intracellular protein processing, transportation, and budding properties
