<p id="p0135">Plants are the foundational element of many medicinal structures under application today. About 50% of the drugs prescribed are either directly extracted from plants or are derivatives of products resulted from plants 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Antivirals extracted from natural origin have found to possess pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties. Using different medicinal plants in combination therapy has been proved to be effective against a numerous viruses such as HSV and influenza viruses

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Many plant extracts are observed to have broad spectrum of antiviral activity. For example,

 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, e.g.,Â a plant-derived product. Polycitone A is functional against the resistant strains of HIV 
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Plant-derived products are also inexpensive and could be easily accessible in different parts of the world. Natural products are even found to be less toxic, cheaper, and impart no side effects in comparison with the synthetic drugs. Apart from this, they have proved their wide therapeutic benefits for different types of conditions. Plant-derived ingredients have shown different kind of mechanisms against the activities of viruses:
