<p id="p0140">The enhancement of defensive immune reaction is one of the most important mechanisms of antiviral treatment. Many of the recently registered products are working on the immunity boosting procedures toward viral infections. Interleukins, colony-stimulating factors, and interferons are the most well-known immunostimulants. Interferons, which are the derivable polypeptides and glycoproteins, act as catalyst to enhance the growth of certain peculiar enzymes that control viral reconstruction in the cell

Carbohydrates, stilbenoids, alkaloids, polyphenols, lectins, and peptides from plant sources are the chief categories of drugs that could be used as immunomodulators.
