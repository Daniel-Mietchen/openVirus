<p id="p0145">Another most important target for the antiviral therapy is the adjunction of virus to the host cell and its entrance. The entry of the virus occurs into the cell by interacting either by a single cell surface receptor or by certain coreceptors. After that, the viral envelop gets fused with host cell membrane, and as it intrudes into the cell, the virus is dismantled to release its genome. Many of the approved drugs affect this procedure of viral infection, e.g., tromantadine for the treatment of HSV infections changes the glycoproteins present on the surface of the host cells and stops the adhesion, intrusion, and uncoating of the virus. Studies on different plant-derived materials have shown the similar mechanisms for preventing viral growth, e.g., plant lectins extracted from genera Hippeastrum and Galanthus have shown the inhibition activity against the HIV-specific glycoproteins, thus resulting in inhibiting the entrance of virus into the cell. Other categories of plant materials, which includes, galactose, glucose, and N-acetylgalactosamine, have been found to contain antiviral action against severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-coV) and the feline infectious peritonitis virus. These factors also inhibit the viral adhesion to the host cell. Many of natural agents also work against influenza virus receptor attaching and merging protein, i.e., hemagglutinin. In many studies, retardation of virus dismantling and emergence of genetic matter into the cell has been done by the extracts derived from various seaweeds. Heparin sulfate molecules extracted from carrageenans, seaweed, also have shown to employ antiviral activity toward dengue virus by arresting the uncoating of virus in host cells.</p>
