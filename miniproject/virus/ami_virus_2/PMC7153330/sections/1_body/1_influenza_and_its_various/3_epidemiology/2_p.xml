<p id="p0080">Each year, 10%–20% of the world's population is affected by seasonal epidemic influenza. Seasonal influenza epidemics occur every year both in the Northern and the Southern hemispheres, mainly in the winter; however, in tropical countries, influenza can occur throughout the year. According to the World Health Organization, the annual pandemic leads to about 3–5 million cases of serious illness and about 250,000–500,000 deaths. About 20% of unvaccinated children are infected each year. Death occurs mostly in the young, the old, and those with other health problems. Antigenic shifts lead the emergence of a new and very different influenza virus that may cause an influenza pandemic. Pandemics are less frequent and result in larger outbreaks. In the 20th century, three influenza epidemics occurred: Spanish influenza in 1918 (∼50 million deaths), Asian influenza in 1957 (2 million deaths), and Hong Kong influenza in 1968 (1 million deaths). In June 2009, the World Health Organization announced an outbreak of a new type of influenza A/H1N1 to be a pandemic. It was found to affect other animals also, such as pigs, horses, and birds.</p>
