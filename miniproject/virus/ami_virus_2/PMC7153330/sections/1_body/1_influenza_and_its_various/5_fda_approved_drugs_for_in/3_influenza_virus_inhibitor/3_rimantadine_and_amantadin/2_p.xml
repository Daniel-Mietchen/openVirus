<p id="p0115">Amantadine (1-adamantanamine) approved in 1966 was the first antiviral compound for the treatment of widely distributed influenza A virus infections. This compound has the ability to block the transfer of H ions with the help of M2 (matrix 2) protein medium into the inner portion of viral particles and hence prevents the disassembling of influenza virus molecule inside the endosomes. Amantadine and rimantadine were approved for adult patients, but they were not able to prevent, treat, or reduce the severity of influenza A virus infestation in children and older ones. The prevalent resistance also leads to abandon amantadine in the medication of influenza infections. However, the interest is growing for the application of amantadine in the evidential therapy of Parkinson disease and levodopa-induced dyskinesia, although more clinical researches are necessary to explore its new application.</p>
