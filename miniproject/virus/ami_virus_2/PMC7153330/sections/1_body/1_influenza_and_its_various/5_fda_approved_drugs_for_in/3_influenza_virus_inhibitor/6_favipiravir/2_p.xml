<p id="p0130">Favipiravir (T-705), having chemical structure as 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazine carboxamide, has been chiefly introduced for therapy of influenza virus infections. Favipiravir was invented and approved in Japan and could be effectively used for the treatment of influenza A, B, and C virus infections. Importantly, favipiravir triphosphate is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent and shows inhibitory activities against the RNA polymerases present in influenza A viruses. Highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses and many other positive- and negative-sense RNA viruses also belong to the group of influenza A virus and hence favipiravir is active against them. Recently, favipiravir was found effective to cure patients infected because of Ebola virus (EBOV). It also inhibits the growth of human norovirus and human arena viruses (Machupo, Junin, and Pichinde viruses), but these new applications need further extensive researches and clinical trials.</p>
