<p id="p0125">Ribavirin also known as Virazole (1-
 <sc>d</sc>-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) has been reported as the first synthetic nucleoside analogue, which is active toward a broad spectrum of RNA viruses (RSV, HCV, and influenza virus). It was found to be the broadest spectrum antiviral agent ever reported for a synthetic material which did not induce interferon. The chief mechanism of its drug action includes the inhibition of inosine-5-monophosphate (IMP) dehydrogenase, which helps in conversion of IMP to xanthosine monophosphate and thus responsible for the production of GTP. Ribavirin inhibits the IMP dehydrogenase and hence possesses immunosuppressive activity, which leads to the remarkable success of ribavirin, for the therapy of HCV infestation accompanied with peginterferon alfa-2a. The patients of HCV infection undergoing therapy of telaprevir, peginterferon alfa-2a, and ribavirin are found to have an outstanding level of response against the virus. Ribavirin effectively hinders the RNA polymerase of influenza virus in the triphosphate form. Apart from this, ribavirin could also be used in the treatment of “Lassa fever” (hemorrhagic fever virus infection), but ribavirin has yet not got the formal license for this medication. The effect of ribavirin on RNA viruses has also been found to have potential effects against many other infectious diseases such as dengue virus, norovirus, Hendra and Nipah viruses, and Marburg virus. However, more clinical evidence is still necessary to prove these new applications.
