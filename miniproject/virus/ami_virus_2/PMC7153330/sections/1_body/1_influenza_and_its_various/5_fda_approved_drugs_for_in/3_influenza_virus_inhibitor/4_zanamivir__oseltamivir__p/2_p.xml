<p id="p0120">Zanamivir is a distinct and potent inhibitor of neuraminidases protein of influenza A and B virus. It prevents the influenza infections by affecting release of virus. Zanamivir applied by inhalation was also accompanied with oseltamivir, ingested by the oral route. According to many researches, oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir have proved to be a net benefit by controlling death rate and the severity of influenza symptoms and complications. Two more neuraminidase inhibitors were introduced for the therapy of influenza infections after the success of zanamivir and oseltamivir. First was peramivir, which could be administered as an intravenous injection, and the other was laninamivir octanoate, which was found to be effective if administered in an inhalation. Notably, peramivir has been found to have clinical potency equal to that of oseltamivir for curing the severe seasonal influenza, and the efficacy of laninamivir octanoate has been found for the treatment of seasonal influenza, as well as oseltamivir-resistant virus, in adults. Both peramivir and laninamivir are effectively used as a one-dose therapy for influenza A and B viruses, but their applications are bounded in very few countries only.</p>
