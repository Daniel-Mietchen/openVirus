 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> have introduced a novel method for the enzymatic synthesis of shikimic acid from quinic acid with the help of dried cells or the membrane portion of gluconobacter oxydans IFO 3244. The enzymes obtained quinate dehydrogenase and 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase and were utilized to transform quinic acid into 3-dehydroshikimate. Dehydroshikimate was then treated with NADPH-dependent 
 <sc>d</sc>-glucose dehydrogenase and shikimate dehydrogenase for obtaining shikimic acid. This technique is suitable for laboratory recovery of shikimic acid only but not from the perspective of industrial production.
