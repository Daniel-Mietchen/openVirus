<p id="p0215">The shikimic acid pathway is a biosynthetic pathway which is absent in mammals. It involves the metabolism of carbohydrates and allows the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and aromatic compounds such as naphthoquinones, ubiquinones, and folates. The shikimate pathway is a part of the metabolism occurred only in plants and microorganisms such as microbial eukaryotes, bacteria, and parasites. The sequence of seven-step shikimate pathway consists of transforming phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate starting with the condensation of them. Their condensation and cyclization lead to the synthesis of chorismic acid. Active forms of these with coenzyme A (CoA) can lead to the formation of phenolic compounds, which in turn by β-oxidation changes to acids of the benzoic acid series (gallic, protocatechuic, etc.). Gallic acid in combination with simple sugars transforms to the tannin compounds such as gallic and ellagic tannins and, after the addition of a molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate and additional intermediate stages, leads to the formation of aromatic amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine amino acids. The pathway includes various enzymes such as 2-keto3-deoxy-
 <sc>d</sc>-arabinoheptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase, 3-enoylpyruvylshikimate-5-phosphate synthase, shikimate dehydrogenase, shikimate kinase, 5-dehydroquinate dehydratase, and chorismate synthase. Shikimic acid is the intermediate product of this biological pathway by shikimate dehydrogenase, which facilitates the reversible transformation by reduction of 3-dehydroshikimate into shikimate. The shikimic acid pathway provides a new methodology for developing new herbicides and herbicide-resistant crops. It also provides the opportunity for engineering new antibiotic and antiparasitic drugs by interrupting the action of its enzymes. Hence, various important researches are being carried out to explore this pathway.
