 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> have firstly isolated high purity C14-labeled shikimic acid from 
 <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> L. and conducted experiments for studying the metabolism in plants, especially for studying the shikimate pathway. For this purpose, the plant was kept for metabolism in an atmosphere of radioactive carbon dioxide for several days. Extraction of the plant material was done with ethanol and water, and the impurities of the extract were removed by passing it through a Dowex 50-X4 (H+ form) column. The column of Dowex 1-X8 (acetate form) was used to pass the eluate. The excellent separation of shikimic and quinic acids was achieved by gradual elution with an aqueous acetic acid, and sufficiently pure compounds were found after the final passage through the Dowex 1-X8 column. 2.12 g of shikimic acid and 0.593 g of quinic acid were yielded by 287 g of fresh leaves. 
 <italic>G. biloba</italic> L. is known to yield shikimic acid no less than 4% based on wet leaves. During chromatographic purification, high loss of shikimic acid occurs and hence the above technique gave an extremely low yield (below 20%). A modified technique was employed by Underhill et al. 
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> in which 
 <italic>Ginkgo</italic> and rose shoots were grown with each other in a radioactive atmosphere, which yielded higher content of shikimic acid (2.5% on a dry basis of 
 <italic>Ginkgo</italic> leaves) than in case of using 
 <italic>Ginkgo</italic> only. These techniques are important from the perspective of research but could not be used to the industrial-level production of shikimic acid as they are multistage process and results in high product loss.
