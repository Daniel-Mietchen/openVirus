<p id="p0230">An efficient method for isolating shikimic acid from leaves of plants of the 
 <italic>Liquidambar</italic> genus was developed by Li et al. 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In the process, fruit coatings and leaves of the 
 <italic>Liquidambar</italic> genus trees were dried at 65°C and milled, which was further soaked in deionized water for 4 h subsequently three times. The extracts were then passed through Amberlite IRA-400 (acetate form), and shikimic acid was eluted with 25% acetic acid, concentrated, and then crystallized from the mixed ethyl acetate and methanol. The shikimic acid was obtained of 98% purity and 70% yield depending on the original content of shikimic acid in the 
 <italic>Liquidambar</italic> fruits leaves, which is approximately 3%–8% on a dry basis, depending on a species. The above-described method is being actively exploited in the Chinese industry for the production of shikimic acid from the 
 <italic>Liquidambar</italic> genus plants.
