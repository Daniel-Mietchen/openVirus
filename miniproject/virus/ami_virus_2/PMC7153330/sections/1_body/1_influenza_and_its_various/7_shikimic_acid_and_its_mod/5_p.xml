<p id="p0175">Oseltamivir is a compound acting as neuraminidase inhibitor, which is a potential inhibitor of influenza's neuraminidase enzyme. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) define a class of drugs that stop and block the activity of neuraminidase enzyme and hence they are generally utilized as antiviral medicines. They inhibit the action of viral neuraminidases present in influenza viruses and prevent their reproduction through budding in the host cells. This enzyme is responsible for cleaving the sialic acid, which is present in glycoproteins on the surface of human cells, which in turn helps new virions to come out from the cell. Oseltamivir inhibits the function of neuraminidase protein and prevents new viral particles from being released, so that the virus cannot leave the cell to infect other cells. Eventually, the virus dies.</p>
