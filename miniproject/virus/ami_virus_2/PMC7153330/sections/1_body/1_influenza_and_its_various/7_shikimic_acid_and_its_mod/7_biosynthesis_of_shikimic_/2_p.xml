<p id="p0185">Shikimic acid, obtained from star anise present in its anionic form shikimate, is a cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, a cyclohexene, and a cyclitol. The shikimic acid is formed through the following biosynthesis pathway as described in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.16.1</xref> . Phosphoenolpyruvate reacts with erythrose 4-phosphate to yield 3-deoxy-
 <sc>d</sc>-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate (DAHP), in the presence of catalyst, i.e., enzyme DAHP synthase. DAHP then changes to 3-dehydroquinate (DHQ), in the presence of enzyme DHQ synthase.
