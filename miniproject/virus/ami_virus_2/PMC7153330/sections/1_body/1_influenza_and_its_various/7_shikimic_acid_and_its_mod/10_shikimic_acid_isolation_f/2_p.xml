<p id="p0220">The 
 <italic>Illicium</italic> genus is the basic source of shikimic acid, and the acid was discovered in 1885 from its fruits. The techniques are constantly improving for isolation of shikimic acid from these plants' fruits. Adams et al. 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> extracted shikimic acid of 98% purity and &gt;5% yield based on a dried fruit weight obtained with the help of Soxhlet extractor in 24 h extraction and subsequent purification by a Solka-Floc anion exchange resin from 900 g of 
 <italic>Illicium anisatum</italic> seeds. Adams's method was modified and simplified by Payne and Edmonds 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and improved the yield of shikimic acid up to 7% on a dry basis. In their method, about 25 g of 
 <italic>I. anisatum</italic> seeds were ground to dust and were extracted in a Soxhlet extractor with 95% ethanol as a solvent for approximately 2 h. The extract was then treated with water and few drops of formaldehyde solution to obtain an orange clear solution which was passed through an anion exchange column (Amberlite IRA-400, acetate form, dry weight 25 g). Shikimic acid was than eluted with acetic acid and the yellow eluent was collected, which was again heated with methanol, activated carbon and recrystallized with toluene to yield a brilliant white, crystalline substance. The modified Adams's and Payne's methods are being exploited in China for the industrial production of shikimic acid from 
 <italic>Illicium</italic> genus plants.
