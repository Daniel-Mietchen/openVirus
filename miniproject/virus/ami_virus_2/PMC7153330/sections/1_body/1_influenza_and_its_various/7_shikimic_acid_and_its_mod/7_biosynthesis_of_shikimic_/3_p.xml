<p id="p0190">DHQ is dehydrated to 3-dehydroshikimic acid by the enzyme 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase in the next biosynthetic step, which transformed into shikimic acid in the reduction reaction catalyzed by the shikimate dehydrogenase. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) contributes as a cofactor in this reduction reaction.</p>
