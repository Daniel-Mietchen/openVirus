<p id="p0180">The isolation of shikimic acid from the fruit of 
 <italic>Illicium religiosum</italic> was primarily reported by Ekmann in 1885 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The name shikimic acid was derived after the oriental plant shikimi-no-ki in Japanese. Shikimic acid is now available in more quantities through the extraction from the fruit 
 <italic>Illicium verum</italic> (Chinese star anise). It was recently reported that 
 <italic>Liquidambar styraciflua</italic>, more commonly known as the sweetgum tree, could be a renewable source of shikimic acid. In fact, it was shown that the sweetgum tree can yield shikimic acid in amounts comparable with that of 
 <italic>I</italic>. 
 <italic>verum</italic>, through the seeds of its annual fruit. Other plants to which shikimic acid have been isolated from were presented in
