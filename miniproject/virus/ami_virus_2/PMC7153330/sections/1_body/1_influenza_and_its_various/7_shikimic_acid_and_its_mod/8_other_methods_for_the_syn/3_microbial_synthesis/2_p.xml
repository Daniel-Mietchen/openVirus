<p id="p0205">The SA first isolated of microbial source was from 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> by Millcan 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. It was also reported that bacillus species increases the yield of SA by initiating the activity of shikimate dehydrogenase and shikimate kinase enzyme. Other strains of 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> such as 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> SP1.1/pKD12.112 yields 20.2 g/L culture while W3110.shik 1 yields a significant amount of SA through the increase of the activity of kinase II enzyme for the synthesis of SA.
