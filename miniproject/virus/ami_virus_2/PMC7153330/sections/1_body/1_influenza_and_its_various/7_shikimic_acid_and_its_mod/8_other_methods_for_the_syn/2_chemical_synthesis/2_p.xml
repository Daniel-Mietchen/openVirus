<p id="p0200">The most common method for synthesis of racemic SA was obtained by Diels Alder reaction with (1E, 3E)-1,4-diacetoxy-1,3-butadiene, and in this method acrylic acid was used as starting material for the SA synthesis with 15% yield 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Other studies have also reported that SA was synthesized from (âˆ’)-quinic acid obtained from cinchona bark 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Grewe and Hinrichs 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> also reported a synthesis of SA, but achieved only 11% overall yield. Koreeda and Ciufolini 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> achieved a higher yield (29% overall yield). Among all the highest yields, up to 55% was found in synthesis by Fleming oxidation.
