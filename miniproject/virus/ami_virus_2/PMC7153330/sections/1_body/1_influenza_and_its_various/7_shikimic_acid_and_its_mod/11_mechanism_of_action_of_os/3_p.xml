<p id="p0240">After ingestion of oseltamivir, firstly it acts like an inactive chemical or prodrug which changes into its active state by metabolic process inside the liver, where because of hydroxylation, it changes to active metabolite—the free carboxylate of oseltamivir (GS4071). It was the firstly used orally active neuraminidase inhibitor, which serves as a competitive inhibitor for the action of the viral neuraminidase (NA) enzyme on sialic acid, present on glycoproteins found on the surface of normal host cells. By hindering the activity of the enzyme, oseltamivir stops new viral particles from being formed by infected cells. Oseltamivir is indicated for the treatment and prevention of infections due to influenza A and B viruses. In gastrointestinal tract, there is approximately 80% bioavailability of oseltamivir phosphate, which made it readily absorbed in the cells. Consequently, the oseltamivir is well distributed after ingestion as pill to the nasal mucosa, the tracheal lining, and the tissues of the middle ear. The elimination of oseltamivir carboxylate from the body follows the route for its elimination by glomerular filtration and then renal tubular excretion without undergoing further metabolism process. The estimated average half-life of elimination in adults ranges from 6 to 10 h. Influenza A and B are the two most important viruses responsible for the yearly flu seasons in human beings. They are named on the basis of major types of antigenic proteins present on the viral coating. These antigenic proteins are hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), out of which the NA is a primary target of oseltamivir and zanamivir.</p>
