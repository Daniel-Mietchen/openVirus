<p id="p0245">Despite the rapid growth of pharmaceutical and biotechnological approaches, the development of effective antiviral therapy is still a challenge. Influenza has created a global menace for the society as it has yet not developed the appropriate technology to manage the epidemic from resistant strains. Apart from the emergence of drug resistance, development of mutant strains of the virus, introduction of a more virulent strain, expensive available drugs, time lapse in vaccine manufacture, and mass mortality cause difficult problems. In this scenario, counterpart and alternate medicine offers huge possibilities to help patients. Herbs possess a wide array of biological actions and could be efficiently exploited for managing pandemic flu. Nutritional and botanical properties together are responsible for providing potent tools for controlling different types of viral infections. The accessibility of a wide array of herbs and constituents with potentially active phytochemicals, to increase the effect as antiinfluenza agents, could have an important role in the ongoing research toward the novel H1N1 infection. Shikimic acid is also found as potential antiviral source as it could be used as a precursor for industrial production of the antiviral oseltamivir or Tamiflu, a potent viral neuraminidase inhibitor. Rigorous researches for optimization of shikimic acid production and its utilization can bring a revolutionary change in antiviral therapy.</p>
