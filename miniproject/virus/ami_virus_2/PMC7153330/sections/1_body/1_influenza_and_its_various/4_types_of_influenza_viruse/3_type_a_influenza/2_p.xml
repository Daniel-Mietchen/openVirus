<p id="p0090">Type A influenza is the most dangerous and known to cause outbreaks and diseases. Wild birds represent the natural hosts for these viruses, while these viruses can infect animals, birds, pigs, and horses. Influenza A viruses are subdivided into a number of subtypes based on the composition of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins. There are 18 different hemagglutinin subtypes and 11 different neuraminidase subtypes (H1 through H18 and N1 through N11, respectively) exist so far. Type A flu virus is continuously changing and generally causes the large flu pandemics; however, influenza B viruses are not responsible for pandemics. Mutation in influenza viruses resulted in a number of different influenza subtypes and strains; it is more common in influenza A virus. Specific varieties of the virus are generally named according to the host of origin, geographical location, strain number, and year of isolation.</p>
