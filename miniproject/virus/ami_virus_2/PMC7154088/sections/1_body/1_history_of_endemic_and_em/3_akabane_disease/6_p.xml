<p>Diagnosis of Akabane disease is usually conducted by VNT for detection of specific antibodies to AKAV in fetal fluids or precolostrum sera of malformed newborns (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). ELISAs were also established for serological tests to detect antibodies to AKAV (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>) and the commercial ELISA kits are often used for the diagnosis and serological surveillance (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>–
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). The virus may be isolated from aborted fetuses (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). Because the neutralization antibodies to AKAV probably clear the virus and virus infected cells before the delivery of affected neonates, virus isolation is not successful from them. The virus gene is also unable to be detected from most of the affected calves. However, conventional and real-time RT-PCR assays can provide a sensitive detection of the AKAV-specific gene in central nervous system of the postnatally infected cattle with encephalomyelitis (

 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Attenuated and inactivated vaccines against AKAV for breeding cows have been developed (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>–
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>) and commercially provided in Japan and Korea.
