<p>The pathogenicity of these orthobunyaviruses is poorly understood, because no experimental infections to cattle successfully developed clinical signs that are observed in the clinical cases in the field. The reported cases that were probably affected by PEAV, SATV, or SHAV were highly sporadic after their epizootic in Japan. The congenital lesions in the brains of calves infected with PEAV or SHAV were milder than those of calves infected with AKAV or AINOV (

 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>). It is probable that the viruses currently circulating in East Asia have relatively low pathogenicity. However, like other segmented viruses, a genetic shift of orthobunyaviruses with three segmented genomes potentially strengthens their virulence to ruminant hosts (
