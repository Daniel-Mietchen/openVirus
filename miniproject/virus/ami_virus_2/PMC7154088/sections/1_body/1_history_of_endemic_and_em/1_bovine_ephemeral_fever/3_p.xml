<p>From 1955 to 2011, BEF epidemics were often recorded in mainland China (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). China's nationwide sero-surveillance in cattle between 2012 and 2014 demonstrated that the range of BEFV covered most of the area of mainland China (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Epidemics of BEF have also occurred in Korea, and some of them were probably linked to those in Japan (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Meteorological analysis demonstrated that a low-jet stream blew from mainland China, along the Korean Peninsula, to western Japan at the peak of BEF epidemic in China and Korea in 1988 and 1991 (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The stream probably brought the infected vectors and contributed to the BEF expansion to Japan. The seroprevalence of BEFV without clinical cases was demonstrated in Korea between 2009 and 2012 (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Several intervals of BEF epidemic have been documented in Taiwan between 1967 and 2014 (
