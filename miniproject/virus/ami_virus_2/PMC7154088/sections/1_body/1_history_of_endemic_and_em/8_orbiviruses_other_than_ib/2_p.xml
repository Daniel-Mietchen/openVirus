 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>), its association with clinical cases in ruminants has not been demonstrated. A strain of EHDV that was isolated in the southwestern islands of Japan was serologically and genetically distinct from the known EHDV serotypes and was tentatively assigned to the new serotype 10 (
