<p>Clearly, knowledge gaps remain regarding the transmission cycles of arboviruses and vector ecology in East Asia. To the best of our knowledge, there is no detailed distribution map of vectors in the East Asia region. The vector capacity for arboviruses of veterinary importance has been evaluated for only a limited number of species. Further studies of the systematics, biology, and vector competence of mosquitoes, 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges, and ticks should be conducted. The knowledge obtained from vector studies will contribute to increased accuracy of epidemiological analyses based on landscape and meteorological data. Risk assessments based on such analyses will enable the development of better surveillance and preventive measures for arbovirus infections which threaten the production of ruminant livestock, as suggested in earlier investigations (
