<p>The genogroup shifts of AKAV in Japan clearly reflected the change in the types of disease (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). The newly emerged clade of BEFV seems to be more virulent than those of previously endemic strains (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In addition, the reassortment of segmented RNA viruses (such as orthobunyaviruses and orbiviruses) may increase the viral fitness in vertebrate hosts and/or invertebrate vectors and enhance the virulence in vertebrate hosts and/or the transmission efficacy by invertebrate vectors. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the virulence and pathogenicity of endemic arboviruses should be conducted in East Asia.
