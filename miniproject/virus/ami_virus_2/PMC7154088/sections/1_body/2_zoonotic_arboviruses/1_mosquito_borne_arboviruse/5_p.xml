<p>Batai virus (BATV), which belongs to the species 
 <italic>Batai orthobunyavirus</italic> of the genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, has been isolated in Japan and mainland China since 1994 (
 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>). BATV is widely distributed in Asia and Europe, and its infection has been observed in cattle, sheep, and goats (

 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>). BATV was reported to cause a mild flu-like illness in humans and mild illness among sheep and goats. At present, no affected case associated with BATV has been reported in East Asia. Ngari virus, which is a possible reassortant between Bunyamwera virus and BATV, has been implicated in human hemorrhagic fever in Africa (

 <xref rid="B208" ref-type="bibr">208</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>). In the future, BATV may obtain a higher virulence by genetic reassortment with other related orthobunyaviruses. The potential risk of BATV to public health in East Asia should be considered.
