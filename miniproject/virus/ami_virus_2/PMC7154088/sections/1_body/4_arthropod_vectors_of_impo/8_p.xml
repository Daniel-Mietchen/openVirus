<p>In light of the BTV and SBV endemic experiences in northern Europe, it appears that the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species that are indigenous in northern temperate regions have the potential to transmit ruminant arboviruses (
 <xref rid="B273" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B274" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>). It is necessary to assess the vector capacity of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species which are distributed in the higher-latitude regions in East Asia. It is also important to determine their distribution range and seasonality to gain a greater understanding of the potential risks of arbovirus spreads, even in previous arbovirus-free regions.
