<p>These findings suggested the vector capacity of 
 <italic>C. asiana</italic> as with 
 <italic>C. brevitarsis</italic>. The above-cited studies also suggested that 
 <italic>C. brevitarsis</italic> and 
 <italic>C. asiana</italic> were co-distributed throughout Southeast Asia and its neighboring regions, including Hainan Island, which is in a subtropical zone in China (
 <xref rid="B258" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B259" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>). The role of these two species in arbovirus transmission should be further evaluated in their distribution ranges.
