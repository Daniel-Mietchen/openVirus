<p>An ephemerovirus tentatively called KSB-1/P/03 was isolated from sentinel cattle in southern Japan in 2003 (
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>). The phylogenetic analysis based on the L protein of rhabdoviruses revealed that this virus is clustered with other ephemeroviruses. The infected cattle did not demonstrate any clinical signs. Other than BEFV, no ephemerovirus had been isolated in East Asia. Further genetic analyses should be conducted to determine the taxonomic assignment of KSB-1/P/03.
