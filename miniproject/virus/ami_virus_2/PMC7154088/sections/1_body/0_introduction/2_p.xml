<p>Bluetongue virus (BTV; the genus 
 <italic>Orbivirus</italic>, the family 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic>) is probably the most well-known arbovirus affecting livestock ruminant productions in the world (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The virus causes severe illness in ruminants and its presence can act as a barrier for international trades of animals and animal products. Since end of the last century, the global range of BTV has remarkably changed (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The incursion of BTV serotype 8 into northern Europe caused large economic damage to the livestock industry. Another important arbovirus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV; the genus 
 <italic>Orbivirus</italic>), also has been regarded as a threat to European counties in recent years, because its outbreaks has been reported in the countries bordering the region (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The ruminant diseases caused by both viruses have been listed as notifiable terrestrial animal diseases by World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and well-investigated through the world. In addition, recent appearance of an emerging arbovirus, Schmallenberg virus (SBV), in northern Europe (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) has caught the world's attention (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, many other arboviruses, which are not listed by OIE, also have been involved in ruminant illness and their epizootic might have severely impacted on the livestock industry in each region. Unfortunately, the situation of arbovirus infections of ruminant livestock remains uncertain in many parts of the world.
