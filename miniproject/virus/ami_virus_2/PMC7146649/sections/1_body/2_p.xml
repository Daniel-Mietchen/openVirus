<p id="par0010">Studies have shown that viremia, such as SARS, usually peaks in the first week of infection [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In the second week after symptom onset, patients usually develop an immune response which is more likely to cause cytokine storm that could be lethal [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Although there is one study which has indicated that CP therapy could reduce serum cytokine response with uncertain implementing time [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], CP infusion still has its latent risk such as aggravating hyperimmune attacks, based on the foundation that CP therapy is passive immunity with administering pathogen-specific antibodies to patients [
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This implies that CP therapy is more effective in earlier stage of disease and researches on SARS have confirmed it [
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Therefore, the optimal timing of administering CP on COVID-19 needs to be carefully considered.
