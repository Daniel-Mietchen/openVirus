<p id="par0015">In fact, the therapeutic effect of CP on COVID-19 is determined by the level of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titer (NAT). A research on SARS demonstrated that the specific IgG began to increase around week 3 after onset, and peaked at week 12 [

Moreover, due to various limitations of acquiring CP such as age, weight, state of health, informed consent, the amount of CP required, the ratio of recovered patients to those who need plasma causes the shortage of CP. As a result, the source of CP limits its wide application, especially in countries which are in the acceleration stage and late accumulation stage of COVID-19 development.
