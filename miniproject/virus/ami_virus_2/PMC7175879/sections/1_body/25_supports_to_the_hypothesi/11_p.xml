<p id="p0190">The efficacy of cancer immunotherapy relies on the generation of specific anti-tumour CD8 + T cells that recognize peptides presented on the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Effective anti-tumour activity requires fast T cell mediated responses, which is highlighted for example by clinical success with the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 in B cell malignancies 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Importantly, it has been shown that the cooperation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells is required for efficient anti-tumour immunity to occur 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Indeed, CD4 + T cells provide signals that improve the functionality of CD8 + T cells within the tumour microenvironment (TME) 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and their depletion prior to tumour challenge results in complete loss of tumour rejection in murine tumour models
