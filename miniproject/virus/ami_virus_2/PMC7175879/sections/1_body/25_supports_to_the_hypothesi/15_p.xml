<p id="p0210">Thus, data suggest that pre-existing CD4 + memory T cell repertoire can be exploited to support the anti-tumour CTL response and some studies demonstrated a slower tumour growth in pre-immunized mice and an improved anti-tumour response in glioblastoma patients. The pathogen-specific pre-existing immunity can enhance the anti-tumour response and the mechanism of action is dependent on the memory T cells.</p>
