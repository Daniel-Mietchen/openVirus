<p id="Par30">Prophylactic vaccines are extremely important to prevent the EV71 epidemic, especially for susceptible children. Owing to their complete immunoprotective activity, viral inactivated vaccines are the preferred treatment strategy. In mainland China, the development and clinical evaluation of inactivated EV71 vaccines and the promotion of vaccinations have progressed rapidly to prevent the prevalence of HFMD caused by EV71 infection [

 <sub>ΔVP4</sub>) structurally mimics the 80S empty capsid, which is the end stage of EV71 uncoating, thereby exhibiting desirable immunogenicity and protection as a vaccine candidate [

A tetravalent VLP vaccine comprising CVA10-VLP, EV71-VLP, CVA16-VLP, and CVA6-VLP reportedly elicited antigen-specific lasting serum antibody responses with neutralization titers similar to those of their monovalent counterparts. Most importantly, passively transferred tetravalent vaccine-immunized sera showed efficient protective effects against single or mixed infections with EV71, CVA16, CVA10, and CVA6 viruses in mice [
