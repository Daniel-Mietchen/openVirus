<p id="Par32">We previously reported that the sera of HFMD patients could react with human brain sections, suggesting potential cross-reactivity between antibodies of EV71 and brain tissues. Since EV71 induced IgG was permitted to enter into brain tissues by the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) after EV71 infection, cross-reactivity might result in neurological symptoms [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In addition, a common epitope (PPGAPKP) between capsid VP1 protein and human mediator complex subunit (MED25) was identified, suggesting the involvement of the immune response in neurological complications caused by EV71 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The component fragment P
 <sub>746–876</sub> and P
 <sub>324–443</sub> of the fusion protein displayed weak positive cross-reactivity, hence probably resulting in weak cross-reactivity of the entire fusion protein. However, after immunizing neonates with the inactivated whole virus, no case of side reaction in brain was reported; hence, we presumed that the cross-reactivity may have resulted from the exposure of intracellular cross-antigens during the preparation of brain tissue sections, and it has been suggested that immune cross-reactivity should be monitored upon administration of the whole inactivated virus vaccine to children with neurological diseases.
