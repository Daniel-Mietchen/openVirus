<p id="Par24">To detect the viral RNA copies in tissues of infected-mice, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In brief, total RNA was extracted from muscle tissue, using TRIzol reagent (Thermo). Reverse transcription was carried out immediately using random hexamers with a reverse-transcription kit (Promega). The cDNA was subjected to qPCR (QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit, QIAGEN) for 40 cycles with a Roche LightCycler 3.5 system. The primers were EV71-S1 (5′-AGATAGGGTGGCAGATGTAATTGAAAG-3′) and EV71-A1 (5′-TAGCATTTGATGATGCTCCAATTTCAG-3′). A fragment corresponding to nucleotides 2462–2635 of FY0805 was used as standard with an adjusted concentration gradient (1 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μL to 1 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> copies/μL) to determine the viral RNA copies.
