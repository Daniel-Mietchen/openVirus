<p id="Par18">To evaluate the protective effect of maternal antibodies on neonatal mice, female mice aged 6 weeks were immunized. Each mouse was immunized with 10 μg fusion protein vaccine candidate, and their immunity was boosted 3 weeks later at the same dose and volume. One week later, female mice were allowed to mate. Sera for the determination of the neutralization titer to analyze cross-reactivity were collected from the female mice at 1 week, 4 weeks, 5 weeks, and 8 weeks after the first immunization. Six female mice were immunized for each group, including fusion protein vaccine candidate group, inactivated virus group and 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate group. For viral infection experiments, 12–15 neonatal mice born by immunized female mice were used for each group.
