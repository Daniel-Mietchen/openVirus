<p id="Par17">For immunization, a commercial Alu-Vac 15 adjuvant (Serva, Germany), which contains 15 mg/mL of aluminum hydroxide was formulated with the purified and assembled fusion protein. Briefly, the fusion protein was diluted to 200 μg/mL, 40 μg/mL, and 10 μg/mL in a volume of 50 μL (which corresponds to 10 μg, 2 μg, and 0.4 μg antigen for each mouse), which was mixed with 10-fold diluted Alu-Vac 15 adjuvant at a volumetric ratio of 1: 1 in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Heat-inactivated EV71 (FY0805) was dissolved at 5.0 × 10
