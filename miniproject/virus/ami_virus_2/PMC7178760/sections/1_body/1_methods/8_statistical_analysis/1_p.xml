<p id="Par25">Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, USA). Data of neutralizing titers (NTs) and viral RNA copies were presented as mean ± SD values. The significance of differences between two groups was assessed with the unpaired two-tailed Student t-test, while the data for more than two groups were assessed using Duncan’s multiple-range test followed by a one-way analysis of variance. Survival rates were analyzed via Kaplan–Meier analysis. Clinical scores were analyzed using Milcoxon test. A

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
