<p id="Par20">The CPE method was applied to determine the neutralization titer (NT) of mice sera from vaccinated female mice in infected RD cells. First, 100 μL of RD cell suspension with 2.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells was added to each well in 96-well plates (Falcon) and incubated at 37 °C in a carbon dioxide incubator containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Thereafter, series of two-fold dilutions of each mouse serum sample were prepared using DMEM with 2% FBS, and then 50 μL of each dilution was mixed with 50 μL of 200 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of FY0805 in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Finally, the DMEM supernatant of overnight incubated RD cells was replaced by the total 100-μL mixture (4 wells/dilution), and CPE was observed after three consecutive days of culturing. NTs of sera were determined by calculating the highest dilution of serum that prevented infection in 50% of replicate inoculations [
