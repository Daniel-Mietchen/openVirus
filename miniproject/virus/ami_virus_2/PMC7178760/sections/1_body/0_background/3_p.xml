<p id="Par13">We previously found that a vaccine comprising a combination of four peptides from EV71 capsid protein (VP1–VP3) (Vac6, including P
 <sub>70–159</sub>, P
 <sub>140–249</sub>, P
 <sub>324–443</sub>, and P
 <sub>746–876</sub> peptides) effectively elicited the production of neutralization antibodies in female mice and adequately protected neonatal mice against EV71 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, we engineered these peptides into one fusion protein (including P
 <sub>70–249</sub>, P
 <sub>324–443</sub> and P
 <sub>746–876</sub>), using a prokaryotic expression system. The expressed fusion protein finally assembled into sphere-like particulates (VLPs) of 25–40 nm, and were proved to induce humoral and cell-mediated immunity effectively in mice after vaccination, with the detection of high-titer antibodies and promoted splenocyte proliferation and cytokine secretion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this study, we further investigated the immunoprotective effects of this fusion protein, using a mouse model of EV71 infection, including its effects on the production of neutralizing antibodies, the immunoprotective role of maternal antibodies in neonatal mice, and the protection of active immunization in neonates.
