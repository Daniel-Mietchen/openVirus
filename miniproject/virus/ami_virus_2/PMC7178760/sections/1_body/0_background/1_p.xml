<p id="Par11">Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is extremely contagious and prevalent among infants and children aged less than 5 years. Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) has been considered the major pathogen for HFMD, having triggered several disease outbreaks worldwide with high morbidity and mortality rates since its initial isolation in 1969 [

Since the establishment of national surveillance system in 2008, more than 15 million HFMD cases were reported according to the China National Center for Disease Control (CDC) by 2015, with over 3400 deaths. EV71 predominated among the laboratory-confirmed cases, especially for the severe and fatal cases [

All approved vaccines comprise inactivated viruses with the obvious advantage of almost complete immune protection; in fact, the vaccines are proved to protect over 90% vaccinated children from EV71-related HFMD or herpangina [
