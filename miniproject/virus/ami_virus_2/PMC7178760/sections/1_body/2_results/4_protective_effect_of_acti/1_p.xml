<p id="Par29">We actively immunized normal 1-day-old mice twice to assess the protective effects of immunization with the fusion protein on new-born mice. One week after booster immunization, the vaccinated neonatal mice were subjected to a non-lethal dose of MP10 infection (5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL). From the 4 d.p.i of symptom onset, the clinical scores of the mice in the fusion protein immunization group were significantly lower than those of the negative control group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Similar to the inactivated virus group, the average clinical score of mice in the fusion protein immunization group peaked at 4 d.p.i, and then gradually decreased until the symptoms alleviated on 13 d.p.i. Furthermore, viral replication was assessed in hind limb muscle tissue of mice, since the skeletal muscle was considered the primary site for viral amplification after EV71 infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Viral RNA in the muscle of mice in the fusion protein group was approximately 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/mg on 3 d.p.i., which reduced to 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/mg at 5 d.p.i., being significantly lower than that of the negative control. In summary, the fusion protein exerted an excellent active immunoprotective effect on neonatal mice, albeit still inferior to the inactivated virus.
