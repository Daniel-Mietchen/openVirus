<p id="Par27">The serum of combined peptides vaccine comprising EV71 capsid protein peptides (P
 <sub>70–159</sub>, P
 <sub>140–249</sub>, P
 <sub>324–443</sub>, P
 <sub>746–876</sub>) did not exhibit strong cross-reactivity with human brain tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, it was necessary to check the reaction again when all peptides fused into one protein. The sera obtained from mice immunized with inactivated virus or P
 <sub>646–755</sub> polypeptide (strong cross-reactivity peptide) were used as positive controls, while those immunized with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate or P
 <sub>70–159</sub> polypeptide (no cross-reactivity peptide) were used as negative controls [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Immunohistochemical staining revealed weak cross-reactivity when the sera of mice immunized with the fusion protein vaccine candidate were applied to adult or fetus human brain tissues (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This might be related to the weak cross-reactivity of peptides P
 <sub>324–443</sub> and P
 <sub>746–876</sub>, which constituted the fusion protein [
