  <p>Determination of the neutralizing titers (NTs) of mice sera immunized with the vaccine candidate containing the fusion protein. 
   <bold>a</bold> NTs of sera of mice immunized twice with 0.04 μg, 2 μg, and 10 μg vaccine candidate or inactivated virus were measured, respectively. *

   <bold>b</bold> The NTs of the sera of mice immunized once with 10 μg vaccine candidate or inactivated virus were measured temporally, respectively. 
   <bold>c</bold> The NTs of sera of mice immunized twice with 10 μg vaccine candidate or inactivated virus were measured temporally, respectively. Arrows indicate the time of boosting. The data represent the mean ± SD (
