<p id="p0010">Head and neck cancer patients are generally at high-risk for COVID-19 infection and severe adverse outcomes. Given the highly contagious nature of the virus in respiratory droplets and aerosolization, it is reasonable to identify patients with tracheostomy or total laryngectomy as possibly those who are most exposed to infection. Laryngectomized patients also experience a high risk for the most severe complications of COVID-19, being in most cases former smokers and alcohol abusers with frequent medical comorbidities including chronic pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, underlying cancer history, and a propensity for atelectasis due to loss of upper airway resistance

In case of infection, laryngectomized patients carry a high risk of transmitting viral particles to surrounding people, both to healthcare workers and members of the community, due to their altered airway anatomy and to aerosolization of tracheal secretions
