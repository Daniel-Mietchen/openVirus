<p id="p0040">The safe management of laryngectomized patients during the COVID-19 pandemic should be conducted carefully and responsibly, applying unprecedented cautious and preventive measures, with the awareness that there is high risk for both patients and healthcare providers. We recommend the regular use of a surgical face mask to prevent contact with mouth and nose mucosal surfaces and adhesive stomal support coupled with highly efficient HME filtering for all laryngectomized patients, during in-community activities that cannot be deferred (
