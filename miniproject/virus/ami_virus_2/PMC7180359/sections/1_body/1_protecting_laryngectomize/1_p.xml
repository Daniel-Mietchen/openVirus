<p id="p0020">Impairment of nasal humidification and filtrating functions, due to anatomical iatrogenic changes of the upper aerodigestive tract after total laryngectomy, can be partially restored with the adoption of measures such as filtrating bibs or stomal devices with heat and moisture exchangers (HME). The latter, available from many commercial suppliers, are effective in reducing the incidence of tracheobronchial infections in laryngectomized patients 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Concerning the best protection of the laryngectomized during daily life in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic, we recommend the use of both facial protection (e.g., masks or scarfs) to reduce the risk of contact with oral or nasal mucosal surfaces and the adoption of filtrating devices to cover the stoma, possibly hidden with bibs or customized masks, to further reduce the risk of spreading droplets (
