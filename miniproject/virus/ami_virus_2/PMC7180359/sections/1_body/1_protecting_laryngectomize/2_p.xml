<p id="p0025">Several ventilators’ filters with viral filtering capability are physically couplable with tracheostomy cannulas, but their resistance features, not specific for spontaneous breathing, should advise against their easy use in awaken laryngectomized patients. Among stomal HME filters, since 2007 is available the Provox Micron HME, aimed to reduce the risk of bacterial and viral infections in high-risk laryngectomized patients and to be used during flu epidemics. To the best of our knowledge, the Micron HME is the only specific stomal device with proven virus filtering properties available on the market. This device achieves its filtering activity through an electrostatic mechanism, without the need for a dense texture, and as such does not compromise the quality of life of patients in term of breathing or speaking functions (for voice prosthesis carriers) 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The device was developed by investigating the filtering activity against bacteriophage ΦX174, a virus measuring 22–25 nm in size, with 99.9% viral filtration efficiency 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These results, considering that SARS-CoV-2 particles are 60–140 nm 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, support the use of a Micron HME filter as further protection during the current ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
