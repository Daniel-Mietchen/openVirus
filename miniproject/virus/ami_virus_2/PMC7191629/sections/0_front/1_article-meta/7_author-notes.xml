  <p>Editor’s Note: This Letter to the Editor is a response to the current concern in understanding the mechanisms of infection by COVID-19, the virus that is currently circling the globe and potentially may be responsible for high levels of mortality and morbidity in the vulnerable population. Patients with cardiopulmonary disorders are especially at risk. In our desire to develop new and perhaps unconventional therapies, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for membrane binding and internalization of the virus are especially important. The 
   <italic>American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology</italic> is committed to providing a forum for discussion of these potential therapies and rigorous original research that can guide therapy in an evidence-based manner. We encourage our readers to submit any relevant research articles or commentary (as a Letter to the Editor) concerning COVID‐19, SARS‐Cov‐2, and cardiovascular disease. Editor-in-Chief Irving H. Zucker, PhD.
