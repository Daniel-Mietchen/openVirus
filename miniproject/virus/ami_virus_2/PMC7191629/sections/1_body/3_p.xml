<p>Indeed, corona virus has already been shown to induce myocardial inflammation and dysfunction accompanied with adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS, assumedly due to downregulation/elimination of the myocardial ACE2 system (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Support for this concept emerges from previous experimental reports demonstrating cardiac contractility defects in rats with reduced X chromosomal-derived ACE2 expression and heart failure with pulmonary congestion in ACE2-knockout mice (ACE2-KO) (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). These undesired changes were prominent in males and progressed with age, coincidentally overlapping the observations that elderly and men are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2-induced serious infection. Interestingly, the hearts of animals depleted of ACE2 exhibited similar changes that occur after coronary artery disease or bypass surgery in humans (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Subsequent studies demonstrated extended infarct size, reduced contractility, altered ventricular remodeling, and increased mortality following myocardial infarction (MI) induced by ligation of the proximal LAD in mice with ACE2 deletion, as compared with their wild-type controls (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Moreover, these mice showed enhanced oxidative stress and concomitant upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, plausibly parallel to the observed hypersensitive immunological response reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
