<p>Collectively, evidently ACE2 exerts beneficial effects on cardiac function under normal conditions and particularly in the presence of heart failure. Moreover, some of the cardioprotective effects of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and MR blockers are mediated by their positive impact on ACE2 abundance in cardiac tissues. Nevertheless, in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, ACE2 may transform to a Trojan horse. Its binding with ACE2 neutralizes the advantageous cardiac effects of this enzyme, especially in patients with heart failure. The susceptibility of these subjects to life-threatening SARS-CoV-2 infection could be attributed to the simultaneous upregulation of both ACE2 and furin in the diseased myocardium and to the wide use of RAAS inhibitors in this population (
