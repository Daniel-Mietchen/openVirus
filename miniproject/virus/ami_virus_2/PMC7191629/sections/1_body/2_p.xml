<p>Binding of the SARS viral spike glycoprotein to ACE2 triggers its internalization along with the virus (

It is tempting to assume that consequent ACE2 elimination might participate in many features of acute corona virus infection. Among such clinical characteristics are decompensation of preexisting CHF, respiratory distress irrespective to left-ventricular backward failure (due to impaired pulmonary capillary endothelium and endothelial barrier function), acute kidney failure (reflecting altered renal microcirculation and hypoxic injury), and diarrhea (caused by injured gut microcirculation with hypoxic damage and injured mucosal barrier.
