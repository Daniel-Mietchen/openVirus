 <sc>to the editor</sc>: Emerging clinical reports from China, Italy, and the United States reveal that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a prominent incidence of cardiovascular morbidities and complications (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), including myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction, and worsening heart failure. These cardiovascular manifestations have been encountered in preceding epidemics of corona viruses, namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), as well as during H1N1 influenza outbreaks (

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Moreover, several preliminary reports indicate that a vast majority of patients with comorbidities are prone to SARS-CoV-2 complications (50â€“86%). Congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, and pulmonary diseases are the principal-identified clinical conditions predisposing to SARS-CoV-2-induced morbidities and mortality (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Although pneumonia, the principal alarming feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, could by itself evoke cardiovascular complications as a result of hypoxemia, systemic inflammation and enhanced myocardial oxygen demand, a direct cardiovascular injury, likely develops, initiated by binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), widely expressed in myocardial and vascular endothelial cells, leading to adverse cardiovascular consequences. The following short commentary outlines potential mechanisms by which elimination of ACE2 by this virus may lead to deleterious cardiovascular outcome.
