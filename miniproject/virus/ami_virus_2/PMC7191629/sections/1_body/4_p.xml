<p>Furthermore, preliminary alarming data from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients suggested that those treated with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAAS) inhibitors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) experienced severe symptoms with a higher mortality rate as compared with nonuser counterparts (

 <sub>1</sub> receptors in target organs, including the heart, activates ADAM 17, a sheddase affecting ACE2 (

 <sub>1</sub> receptors by RAAS inhibitors likely leads to the upregulation of ACE2 and eventually hypersensitizing the heart to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Enhancement of myocardial invasion by the virus due to enhanced ACE2 likely plays an important role.
