<p>An additional player that may contribute to the vulnerability of patients with heart failure to SARS-CoV-2 is furin, also termed paired basic amino acid-cleaving enzyme (PACE). Furin is essential for permeating viral functionality as it cleaves viral envelope trimeric transmembrane glycoprotein (

 <italic>S</italic>-glycoprotein, vital for the entry of the virus into the cell, contains two functional domains: an ACE2-binding domain (also called receptor-binding domain (RBD) and a second domain essential for fusion of the viral and cell membranes (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Furin activity exposes the binding and fusion domains essential for the entry of the virus into the cell (

Patients with heart failure are specifically characterized by upregulation of cardiac furin, providing an additional potential explanation for their vulnerability Covid-19 infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Fig. 1</xref>). Moreover, furin is detected in circulating T cells that are activated during infections (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This may form a feed-forward loop of furin-facilitated coronavirus replication that may be responsible for hypersensitive immunological response (cytokine storm) in some patients, leading to fulminant myocarditis, devastating lung injury, and lethal multiorgan failure.
