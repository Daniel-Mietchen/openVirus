  <p>The initial step after the invasion of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 is binding to membranal angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) widely expressed in cardiac cells including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells in the myocardial vasculature and in cardiac myocytes. ACE2 is responsible for the conversion of ANG II to Ang-(1â€“7) that exerts beneficial effects on the cardiac tissue such as vasodilation, antifibrosis, and anti-inflammation via Mas receptor (MasR). The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 is preceded by furin-mediated exposure of the viral receptor binding protein (RBP) localized to 
   <italic>S</italic>-glycoprotein (S1 domain of the viral spike). Furin is abundant in the heart both intracellulary and in the circulation as a free enzyme, making it a key factor in the uncovering of RBP and eventually in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In addition, furin enhances the affinity of the virus to ACE2 by not only exposing the viral binding site on S1 domain but also revealing the effusion site on the S2 domain in the viral spike. Consequently, the virus undergoes endocytosis and massive replication accompanied by profound activation by cathespsin L (CatL) and the abundant intracellular furin. The activated intracellular SARS-CoV-2 undergoes exocytosis where it binds again to ACE2 elsewhere, thus creating a vicious feed-forward devastating cycle. Importantly, heart failure is characterized by enhanced expression of myocardial ACE2, which is further upregulated by ACE-I, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid-receptor (MR) antagonists, thus sensitizing ACE2 expressing target organs to SARS-CoV-2. ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM 17) is responsible for shading of ACE2, a process stimulated by ANG II type 1 receptors (AT
   <sub>1</sub>-R) and may explain why renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors augment ACE2 expression. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.
