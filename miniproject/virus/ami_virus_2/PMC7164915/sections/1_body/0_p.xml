<p id="par0005">Human coronavirus (CoV) infection is associated with mild upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms, both in children and in adults. The 4 endemic human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 are included among the known causes of common cold. HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are classified as αCoV, whereas HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are βCoV.

 </xref> Two new βCoV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, were recently discovered; these present a much more aggressive behaviour and have caused epidemics associated with extrapulmonary manifestations and high mortality rates. In 2003, SARS-CoV was identified as the cause of a severe respiratory syndrome first appearing in the Chinese province of Guangdong; in 2004, MERS-CoV caused an epidemic that mainly affected the Arabian Peninsula. On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization reported a novel CoV (SARS-CoV-2) in patients with pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, in the Chinese province of Hubei; it subsequently spread rapidly through China and the rest of the world. The novel virus is classified as a βCoV and bears considerable similarity to SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been declared a pandemic; it is associated with high mortality and has caused significant societal impact. The virus is expected to infect a large proportion of the world's population.
