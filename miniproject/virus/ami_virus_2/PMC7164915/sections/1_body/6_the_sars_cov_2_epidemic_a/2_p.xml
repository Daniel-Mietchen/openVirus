<p id="par0040">The main structural differences between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are observed in the fusion protein and in accessory proteins ORF3b and ORF8. The coronavirus genome encodes 4 main structural proteins, namely spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins.

 </xref> After infecting host cells, the viral genome is translated into 2 large precursor polyproteins, which are processed by ORF1a-encoded viral proteinases into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsp1-nsp16). Nonstructural proteins play an essential role in viral RNA replication and transcription,

 </xref> As occurs with SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein S1 subunit receptor-binding domain binds to ACE2 receptors, the site of viral entry into the host cell; this has given rise to the possibility of creating an experimental model of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

 </xref> Interestingly, the ACE2 receptor is widely expressed in the brain,

 </xref> In vitro studies report a positive correlation between ACE2 expression and SARS-CoV infection.

 </xref> Viruses can enter the CNS via the haematogenous route (in which the virus infects the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier) or the neuronal route. It is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 is able to cross the blood-brain barrier
 <xref rid="bib0875" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>87</sup>
 </xref> due to its large size; the most likely entry route is through the olfactory or trigeminal nerves. Thus, the high incidence of olfactory alterations in SARS-CoV-2–infected individuals may indicate viral entry into the CNS. Findings from studies of the MHV model and the detection of CoV in patients’ brains suggest that the virus may remain in the host's CNS for long periods of time without causing neurological symptoms and that the brain may be a viral reservoir.
