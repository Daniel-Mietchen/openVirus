<p id="par0020">MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV can cause severe lower respiratory tract infections, characterised by acute breathing difficulties and such extrapulmonary manifestations as diarrhoea, lymphocytopaenia, hepatic and renal dysfunction, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, both in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. The associated mortality rate is higher than 10%, although some cases are asymptomatic.

 </xref> MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV have caused 2 epidemics, with a large number of people infected. Presence of neurological symptoms in these epidemics was rare according to the literature, although the available studies only analyse the initial phase of each epidemic. A retrospective study conducted in Saudi Arabia reported confusion in 25.7% of patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and seizures in 8.6%.

 </xref> Only 4 cases of CNS involvement (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, stroke, and encephalitis) and one case of critical illness polyneuropathy have been reported in the context of MERS.

 <xref rid="bib0590" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and delayed-onset peripheral neuropathy have also been reported, and one article even presents the timeline of neurological symptoms in a patient with MERS.

 </xref> The literature also includes a case of MERS-CoV infection associated with intracerebral haemorrhage; according to the author, MERS-CoV infection was the only possible explanation for the stroke, with no other risk factors recorded.

  <sup>32</sup>
 </xref> An in vitro study has shown that certain cell lines, such as human neuronal cell lines, are particularly susceptible to MERS-CoV.
 <xref rid="bib0605" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>33</sup>
 </xref> The delayed onset of neurological complications of MERS-CoV infection, the absence of the virus in cerebrospinal fluid, and the unclear association between MERS-CoV infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome suggest that the manifestations of MERS-CoV infection involve an immune component.

 </xref> According to some authors, however, the failure to detect the virus in biological samples may be explained by methodological issues.
 <xref rid="bib0615" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> During the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002–2003, reports of neurological symptoms were anecdotal.

 <xref rid="bib0625" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Some patients developed axonal polyneuropathy a month after the onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and improved during follow-up. Other patients presented such neuromuscular disorders as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.

 <xref rid="bib0635" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> SARS is associated with more severe symptoms than non-SARS viral respiratory tract infection.

 </xref> Therefore, muscular disorders may be the result of the patients’ critical situation rather than the virus itself. Stroke has also been reported in the context of SARS-CoV infection.
