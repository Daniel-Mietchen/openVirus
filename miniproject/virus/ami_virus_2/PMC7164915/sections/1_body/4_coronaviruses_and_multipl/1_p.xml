<p id="par0025">CoV infection has been proposed as a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS).
 <xref rid="bib0655" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>43</sup>
 </xref> This hypothesis is supported by findings from several studies. Coronavirus-like particles have been detected in autopsied brain tissue from a patient with MS.
 <xref rid="bib0660" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>44</sup>
 </xref> CoV isolates were identified in autopsied brain tissue from 2 patients with MS,
 <xref rid="bib0665" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>45</sup>

 <xref rid="bib0680" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Another study reports intrathecal synthesis of antibodies to human CoV, which suggests CNS infection.

  <sup>49</sup>
 </xref> Human CoV RNA has also been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS.

  <sup>50</sup>
 </xref> Experimental studies have found that human CoV can infect neurons, astrocytes, and microglia in primary cultures,

  <sup>52</sup>
 </xref> Interestingly, human CoV can also infect oligodendrocytic cell lines.
 <xref rid="bib0705" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>53</sup>
 </xref> The hypothesis is further supported by the fact that viral upper respiratory tract infections, which may be associated with human coronaviruses, constitute an important trigger of MS relapses.
