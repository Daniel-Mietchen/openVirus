 </xref> Microglial activation and inflammatory mediator expression in the CNS contribute to a local microenvironment that regulates viral replication, which may promote demyelination.

 </xref> The demyelinating lesions associated with MHV infection suggest that this model may be useful in multiple sclerosis research.
