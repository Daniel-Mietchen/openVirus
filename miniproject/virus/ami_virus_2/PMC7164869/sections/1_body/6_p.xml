<p id="par0030">Some general principles have been established for the intervention with patients and health workers such as: (a) psychological support by multidisciplinary teams, with clinical screening for anxiety, depression and suicidality; patients with psychiatric comorbidity should benefit from adequate follow-up; (b) accurate information to patients and health personnel; stay up to date and correct misinformation; (c) attention to symptoms such as insomnia as an early clinical marker; (d) efforts to overcome interpersonal isolation; (e) anticipate and counsel about stress reactions, teaching to recognize signs of distress and discussing strategies to reduce it. The responses of the majority of patients and health workers are adaptive to stress of this nature.
