<p id="par0025">The COVID-19 pandemic has also required the quarantine of multiple subjects exposed to the infection, with uncertain effects on their Mental Health. In a recent review on the effect of quarantine of some epidemics of this century (SARS, MERS, A/H1N1 flu and Ebola), a higher prevalence of psychological distress, affective symptoms (low mood or irritability) and post-traumatic stress are described, some of which could be long-lasting. Fear of contagion, lack of information, financial losses and stigma are some of the stressors associated with the quarantine, so measures are proposed aimed at improving communication or providing the necessary material means.
