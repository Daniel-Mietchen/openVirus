<p id="p0020">This relatively peaceful co-evolution between some zoonotic pathogens and human populations is thought to have originated when agriculture enabled people to live in larger communities, creating effective population sizes big enough to sustain a permanent equilibrium with a weakened pathogen. By contrast, viruses that have made the transition more recently may still be more lethal. Thus, Ebola virus disease, which occasionally causes outbreaks in tropical Africa, where its natural reservoir is in bats, typically causes a very high rate of mortality among those infected and therefore has to be confined at all costs (Curr. Biol. (2018)
