<p id="p0060">People donâ€™t often mingle with bats, but Brook and colleagues note that the diseases are often transferred from bats to humans via another mammalian host, like the palm civet in the case of SARS. Moreover, they note that disturbing bat habitat may stress the bats and make them shed more viruses via their saliva and excretions. Their Bat One Health field project, currently operating in Madagascar, Bangladesh, Ghana and Australia, explores the link between the loss of bat habitat and the transfer of their viruses into other animals and humans.</p>
