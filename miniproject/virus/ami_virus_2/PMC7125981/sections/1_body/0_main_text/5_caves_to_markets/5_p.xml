<p id="p0050">Bats are known to have a remarkable tolerance of viruses that may cause serious disease in other species. This feature has been linked to the dampened inflammation response to stress factors such as DNA present in the cytosol, which can be an indicator of viral infection but in the case of bats can also be linked to the stress caused by the high amount of energy needed for powered flight (Curr. Biol. (2019)
