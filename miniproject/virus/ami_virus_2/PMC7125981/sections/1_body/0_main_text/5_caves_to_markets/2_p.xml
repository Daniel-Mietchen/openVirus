<p id="p0035">The first major outbreak of a new and dangerous zoonotic disease linked to a coronavirus was the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002â€“2003. Starting in November 2002 in southern China, the disease affected more than 8,000 people, with a mortality rate of just under 10%. After spreading to 17 countries, the outbreak could be contained and no cases of SARS have been reported since 2004. </p>
