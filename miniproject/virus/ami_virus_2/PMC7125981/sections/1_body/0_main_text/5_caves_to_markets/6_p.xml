<p id="p0055">In a recent study of bat resistance to viral disease, Cara Brook from the University of California at Berkeley, USA, and colleagues analysed and modelled these effects in detail using cell cultures derived from two different species of bats (eLife (2020) 
 <italic>9</italic>, e48401). The authors conclude that viruses respond to robust bat immunity by establishing more rapid cell-to-cell transmission rates than do comparable viruses in other groups of mammals. Therefore, when they transfer to humans, they may become more deadly than established human viruses.
