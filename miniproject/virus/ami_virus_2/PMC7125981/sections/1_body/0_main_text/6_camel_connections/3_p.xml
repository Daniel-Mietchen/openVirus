<p id="p0075">Virus strains identical to the one in MERS patients were discovered in dromedary camels. The virus appears to have passed from camels to humans on several occasions, causing further outbreaks in 2015 and 2018. Following the first outbreak in 2012, government advice to avoid close contact with camels has led to a backlash among farmers in Saudi Arabia. The BBC reported in 2014 that farmers kissed their camels in defiance of health advice. This kind of resistance to medical advice might explain the later recurrence of the disease. As recently as November 2019, several new cases of MERS were reported from Saudi Arabia, and in each of these cases the infected people were known to have had contact with camels, but not with other patients infected with the virus.</p>
