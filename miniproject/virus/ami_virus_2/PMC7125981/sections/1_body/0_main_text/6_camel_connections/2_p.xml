<p id="p0070">Compared with SARS, it is more deadly but less infectious in the transmission between humans. According to WHO figures from January 2020, there have been just over 2,500 cases so far, causing 862 deaths. In spite of the high mortality of 34%, this virus is not regarded as a major global health threat, as its spread can be contained relatively well.</p>
