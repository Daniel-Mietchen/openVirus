<p id="p0080">In a recent study, Sohail Hassan from the University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences at Lahore, Pakistan, and colleagues tested for MERS-specific antibodies in camel handlers and their families in Pakistan, where no cases of MERS infection have been reported (Emerg. Infect. Dis. (2019) 
 <italic>25</italic>, 2307â€“2309). Of 91 ELISA tests, more than half were positive for MERS-CoV antibodies. With a 50% reduction plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT
 <sub>50</sub>), 12 participants tested positive for exposure to the coronavirus, and 10 of these were confirmed by immunofluorescence. While the authors interpret the high ELISA result as possible cross-reaction from other coronaviruses, they consider the ten positive tests obtained by the other two methods as an indication that exposure to MERS-like coronaviruses is widespread among camel handlers in Pakistan.
