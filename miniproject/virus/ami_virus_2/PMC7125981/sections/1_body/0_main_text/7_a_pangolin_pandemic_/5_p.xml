<p id="p0115">In October 2019, Ping Liu, Wu Chen and Jin-Ping Chen from the Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources, Guangzhou, China, reported that they had discovered high loads of coronavirus in blood samples of 21 Malayan pangolins (
 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>) that had been confiscated from wildlife traffickers (Viruses (2019) 
 <italic>11</italic>, 979). Many of these animals were ill and 16 of them died despite rescue efforts. Although the motivation of the study was rooted in conservation concerns, as the Malayan pangolin is critically endangered, the discovery of the viruses led the researchers to conclude: “Malayan pangolins could be another host with the potential of transmitting the SARS coronavirus to humans. As a consequence, the viral metagenomic study of Malayan pangolin is meaningful both for the conservation of rare wild animals and public health.”
