<p id="p0125">The suggestion casts a spotlight on one of the most endangered and most trafficked groups of mammals. Pangolins, which are armoured with tough scales like armadillos, have the defence strategy of curling up into a ball like a hedgehog. Unfortunately, this makes them vulnerable to human hunters who can just pick them up and take them home. Hunted both for their meat and for the use of their keratin scales in traditional medicine, the four species of Asian pangolins are all endangered, three of them critically. The four African species (two of genus 
 <italic>Phataginus</italic>, two of 
 <italic>Smutsia</italic>) are listed as vulnerable or endangered.
