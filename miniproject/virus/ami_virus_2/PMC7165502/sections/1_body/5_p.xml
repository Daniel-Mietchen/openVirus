<p>One of the earliest interventions during the 2019‐nCoV outbreak involved quarantining an estimated 50‐60 million people in multiple Chinese cities, in what appears to be the largest mass quarantine in history.

Quarantines, even though they are controversial, come at a high cost, and have been viewed with suspicion, were historically found to delay and slow the spread of various outbreaks.

 <xref rid="ijcp13488-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref> Quarantines are one of the non‐pharmaceutical interventions, which also include personal hygiene measures, cancellation of mass gatherings and public events, school and workplace closure, and travel restrictions.

 <xref rid="ijcp13488-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> What all these interventions share is that at least during the initial stages of a new outbreak, particularly when a novel pathogen is involved and therapies are not yet available, they are one of the few options available. A lesson that flu taught us is that non‐pharmaceutical interventions are at least as important as drugs or vaccines in controlling a pandemic.
