<p>On the bright side, despite the inevitability of future pandemics that could quickly spread globally due to the escalation of air travel, science reached the point where it can quickly identify a pathogen, learn about its biology, and protect global health. For example, as 2019‚ÄênCoV illustrated, modern science can identify and sequence new viruses within days. Thus, even though future pandemics are inevitable, embracing technological advancements and learning from the past will make the consequences of epidemics and pandemics less inevitable.</p>
