<p>As of February 26, 2020, &gt;82,000 COVID‐19 infections and 2,798 deaths were reported. The first major outbreak in Europe, and the largest one outside of Asia, was reported in Italy, with 453 cases and 7 deaths as of February 26, 2020. In Italy, the difficulty to trace the chain of the outbreak to the first infection in the country represents a huge setback in terms of the public health interventions that could help contain the spread of the virus. The SARS‐CoV‐2 (previously referred to as 2019‐nCoV) outbreak has brought to prominence another topic related to epidemic and pandemic preparedness, which involves transmission of the virus, the management of an outbreak, and the role of quarantines aboard cruise ships.</p>
