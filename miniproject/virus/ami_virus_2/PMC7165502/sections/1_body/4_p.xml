<p>The SARS‐CoV spike protein receptor binds the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells, an interaction that shapes cross‐species and human‐to‐human transmission.

 <xref rid="ijcp13488-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> Sequencing indicates that the 2019‐nCoV might also use ACE2 as a receptor.
 <xref rid="ijcp13488-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> The 2019‐nCoV spike receptor‐binding domain is 73%‐76% similar at the genomic level to the one from the SARS‐CoV from human, civet, or bat viruses.
 <xref rid="ijcp13488-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> In late 2003‐early 2004, after the first coronavirus outbreak, a second coronavirus outbreak was reported in Guangdong, China, in four individuals in contact with animals, all of whom recovered, and the strain was different from the one that caused the first outbreak.

 <xref rid="ijcp13488-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">36</xref> Amino acid analyses indicate that 2019‐nCoV uses human ACE2 less efficiently than the 2002‐2003 SARS‐CoV but more efficiently than the 2003‐2004 SARS‐CoV. In 2019‐nCoV, the presence of asparagine at position 501, which is compatible with, but not ideal for binding human ACE2, suggests that the virus has acquired the ability for human‐to‐human transmission, but this appears to be more limited than that of the 2002‐2003 SARS‐CoV strain.
 <xref rid="ijcp13488-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> The mutation of this asparagine to threonine in 2019‐nCoV was predicted to significantly increase the ability of the virus to bind the human ACE2 receptor and should be closely monitored for.
