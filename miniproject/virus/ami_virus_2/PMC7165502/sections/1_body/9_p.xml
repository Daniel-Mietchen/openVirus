<p>The 2019‐nCoV outbreak has brought an element of déjà‐vu, plenty of fears, some assumptions, and a relentless race to better understand this novel virus. Critical questions include identifying the reservoirs, understanding the transmission route(s), defining the incubation period and the time when the virus can be transmitted, characterizing the clinical spectrum of the disease, exploring the potential of long‐term health effects, and learning more about susceptible populations. As we approach mid‐February, we don't know yet much about the epidemic curve of the outbreak. Its morbidity, mortality, mental health impact, and psychological effects are impossible to predict. The existence and the contribution of super‐spreaders, defined as contagious hosts that create more secondary contacts that most others in the population, will be a critical component of retrospective analyses, and there is an indication that super‐spreading might already have occurred in the current outbreak.
