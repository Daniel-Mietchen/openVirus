One aspect that all outbreaks share is their potential for rapid global dissemination through air travel. As we attempt to predict and quantitate the impact of international travel on an infectious disease outbreak and visualize the host, environmental, and microbial factors that make some outbreaks spread faster and others have higher mortality, it is worth noting that in 2013, for the first time, the annual number of passengers exceeded three billion.
