<p>Given the many uncertainties regarding the potential for widespread community transmission of COVID-19, community mitigation measures to curb local transmission must be carefully considered and applied where possible. In the 1918/1919 influenza pandemic, timely and sustained use of a broad set of NPIs including school closures, banning of mass gatherings, mandatory wearing of masks, isolation of ill persons, and appropriate disinfection and/or hygiene measures reduced mortality in several US cities [

These measures decreased transmission, spread the epidemic over a longer period of time, reduced the height of the epidemic peak, and reduced the overall number of infected persons and overall health impact. In this study, we discuss NPIs that may be most effective given our current understanding of COVID-19 epidemiology (
