<p>Because hand hygiene does not affect direct transmission of COVID-19 by respiratory droplets or aerosols, face masks have been widely deployed by at-risk populations in China and some other locations in Asia, for example, in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The efficacy of face masks among healthy individuals is unclear, but masks may protect others, particularly healthcare workers, from actively symptomatic individuals with COVID-19. However, the combination of masks and hand hygiene has been shown to reduce transmission of respiratory viruses and serves to highlight that layering of NPIs is more effective at reducing disease transmission than any NPI alone [

Mask use could be recommended for ill persons, for uninfected persons who are caring for ill persons, and for those interacting in highly crowded settings where widespread community transmission is known to be occurring. If face masks are widely recommended, demand may quickly exhaust limited supplies that are most critical for reducing transmission in high-exposure settings such as hospitals and clinics. This balance requires careful attention. N95 masks should be preserved for medical personnel only.
