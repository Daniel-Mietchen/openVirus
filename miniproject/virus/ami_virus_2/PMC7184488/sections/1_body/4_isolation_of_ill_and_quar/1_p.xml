<p>In some locations around the world, confirmed cases of COVID-19 are being medically isolated in hospitals, and their close contacts are being carefully traced and quarantined at home or in designated quarantine facilities. This requires intense laboratory surveillance to pick up COVID-19 cases in the community, including cases with mild illness. To date (March 13, 2020), these containment measures appear to have been able to prevent sustained local transmission in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan.</p>
