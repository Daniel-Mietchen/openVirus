<p id="Par5">Mask-wearing practises have been a source of contention and a hotly debated topic amongst healthcare workers and the general public in the UK. It is not clear as to why respiratory protection practise in UK ophthalmic workplace during the COVID-19 pandemic should be any different to the rest of the world. Based on the lack of existing literature to support any or all of the above variations, we propose that every patient entering the ophthalmic department during the pandemic should be suspected to be COVID-19 positive (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These patients can be further sub-classed as symptomatic if they display symptoms of cough, fever or anosmia; or in the absence of the aforementioned symptoms considered asymptomatic. This distinction is important as the viral load expressed in the nasopharyngeal tract of affected patients is directly proportional to the severity of disease [
