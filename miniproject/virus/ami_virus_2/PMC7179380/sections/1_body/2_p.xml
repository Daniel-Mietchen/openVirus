<p id="Par3">It is universally known that masks offer respiratory protection to the healthcare workers, and are an essential part of the PPE armamentarium, alongside aprons, gloves and visors. There are two common types of masks available: surgical masks and filtering face piece (FFP) respirators (Fig.

Proper use of surgical masks, with moulding to the user’s nasal bridge, can as a barrier to infectious droplets (&gt;5 μm), and offer a sixfold exposure reduction [

Respirators, on the other hand, provide additional benefit to surgical masks by containing a mechanical filter, which can remove airborne contaminants through interception. There are three categories of FFP in Europe: FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3. Class three (FFP3) provides the highest quality of protection and is the only one approved for UK healthcare settings, especially in AGPs, such as intubation and noninvasive ventilation. They must meet industry-standard regulations including strict industry tests with biological aerosols and cannot exceed 2% leakage. FFP3 respirators provide 99% efficiency in filtering particles sized from 100 to 5000 nm, including airborne small droplets [
