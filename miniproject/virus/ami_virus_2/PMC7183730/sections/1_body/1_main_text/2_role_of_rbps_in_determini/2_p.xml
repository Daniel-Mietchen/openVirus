<p id="Par70">Studies on extracellular RNAs have primarily focused on microRNAs (miRNAs), small (20–22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that target mRNAs and usually induce silencing of gene expression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. Exosome-associated miRNAs regulate multiple cellular processes within the recipient cells and are considered potential biomarkers for cancer and metabolic diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>]. Nevertheless, we lack understanding of the mechanisms that govern sorting of these RNA molecules into exosomes. Because exosomes are enriched in particular classes of RNAs and their content does not always reflect the intracellular RNA pool [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>], a mechanism by which certain RNAs are selected as cargo for exosomes must be in place. Whether 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory sequences/structures on the RNA molecule or 
 <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors – or both- are responsible for the export of RNAs remains largely unknown. Potential 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting factors are the short motifs GGAG and GGCU that were found enriched in exosomal miRNAs and were specifically recognized by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1) in human primary T-lymphocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>] and by hnRNP Q in hepatocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. Nevertheless, not all exosomal miRNAs contain those (or other) motifs. For example, despite lacking particular signals associated with exosomes, miR-223 was found to be specifically sorted into exosomes by YBX1 in HEK293T cells and in cell-free reactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. Further evidence points towards a more general role of YBX1 in the sorting of other highly abundant types of small RNAs such as tRNAs, Y RNAs and Vault RNAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. Because RBPs such as hnRNPA2B1, hnRNP Q and YBX1 do not contain transmembrane domains it remains unclear how they mediate interaction with MBVs. Interestingly, all these proteins localize to cytoplasmic RNP complexes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>] and it has been suggested that intersection between RNPs and MBVs is a required step prior to the secretion of RNA molecules [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>]. Hence, determinants for secretion are likely cell specific and dependent on factors such as the binding affinity of certain RBPs for particular RNA molecules. Certainly, a wide range of RBPs are also found in exosomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>], favouring a hypothesis in which RNP complexes carry the signals for secretion.
