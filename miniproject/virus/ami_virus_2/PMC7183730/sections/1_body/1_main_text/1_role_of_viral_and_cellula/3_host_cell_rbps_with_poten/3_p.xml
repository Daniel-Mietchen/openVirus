<p id="Par68">Recently, our group uncovered two other RBPs that are required beyond the replication step of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> vRNA. One of them is Y-box-binding protein 1 (YBX1), a highly conserved cold shock domain protein that binds to DENV vRNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. We previously reported that siRNA-mediated knockdown of YBX1 increased the intracellular DENV vRNA levels while the release of infectious particles was impaired, suggesting a role for YBX1 at the stages of assembly/secretion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. We have now expanded these findings and confirmed that CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of YBX1 results in a significant decrease of infectious titers, vRNA and structural proteins in supernatants, whereas no changes in intracellular viral proteins are observed (Diosa-Toro et al, unpublished results). Currently, we hypothesize that assembly of infectious particles is impaired in cells lacking YBX1. The second protein complex affecting late steps is Topoisomerase 3B (Top3B)-Tudor Domain Containing protein 3 (TDRD3) complex. The Top3B-TDRD3 is a dual activity complex that is essential for promoting both transcription and translation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. CRISPR/Cas9 based deletion of Top3B-TDRD3 complex components did not affect 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> translation and replication, whereas it impaired the production of infectious virus particles. We further characterized that depletion of Top3B-TDRD3 complex did not inhibit particle release (Prasanth et al, unpublished results).
