<p id="Par57">Further specificity to the encapsidation process could be given by RNA modifications or by interactions of C and vRNA with viral or host proteins. For example, the vRNA of DENV, ZIKV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the 
 <italic>Hepacivirus</italic> genus of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, are targets for N6-methyltransferases within the E and RdRp regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The presence of this modification in the E region was shown to abrogate HCV vRNA packaging without altering replication, suggesting that the formation of the HCV nucleocapsid is regulated in such way that vRNA lacking the N6-methylation is preferentially packaged into budding virions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Nevertheless, it remains to be established whether this modification is implicated in the regulation of DENV and ZIKV vRNA packaging.
