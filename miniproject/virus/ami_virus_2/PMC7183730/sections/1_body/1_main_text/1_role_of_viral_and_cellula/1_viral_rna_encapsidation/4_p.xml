<p id="Par58">Lastly, several host factors have been found to interact with 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> C protein with the potential of modulating the encapsidation process. For example, Li and collaborators identified 70 WNV C-interacting partners, the majority of which are involved in RNA processing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In the same study it is shown that despite the limited sequence similarity between the C protein from DENV, WNV and ZIKV, there is a significant overlap between their interacting host factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. One of these is the exon-junction complex recycling factor PYM1, a protein involved in non-sense mediated decay (NMD). The authors showed that the NMD pathway is antiviral against WNV, DENV and ZIKV, and that WNV antagonizes this response by binding of C to PYM1, which protects vRNA from NMD-mediated degradation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Other RBPs such as Caprin1, nucleophosmin and hnRNPK were previously shown to bind JEV and DENV C protein, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. These host factors are important for infection given that their knockdown reduced virus titers; however, whether the encapsidation and/or assembly steps were affected by these proteins was not determined. On the contrary, DDX56 and nucleolin are host RBPs described to bind C protein and specifically affect the assembly step of WNV and DENV, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. We refer to these proteins in a later section.
