<p id="Par66">Numerous studies have been undertaken in order to characterize the mechanism by which cellular RBPs regulate 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> replication cycle and we refer the reader to recent reviews on this topic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. In most cases, cellular RBPs have been shown to play roles in vRNA translation and replication; however, few of these proteins have been shown to affect 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> infection beyond the replication step. One such example is DDX56, a nucleolar RNA helicase member of the DEAD box protein family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Hobman and collaborators have comprehensively studied the mechanism by which DDX56 regulates the packaging of WNV vRNA. DDX56 was initially identified as a C-interacting partner by the means of yeast two-hybrid screening followed by immunoprecipitation. Importantly this interaction was shown to be RNA-independent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Knockdown of DDX56 in several human-derived cell lines resulted in a significant decrease of infectious WNV in the supernatant. The reduced infectivity was associated with a decrease in the amount of vRNA being packaged and secreted in virions given that same levels of WNV C protein were secreted from control and DDX56-knockdown cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The authors then showed that infectious virus production is rescued in 
 <italic>trans</italic> by wild-type DDX56 but not by the mutants D166N and E167Q in which the helicase activity is abrogated. Furthermore, over-expression of the C-terminus of DDX56, which was identified as the C-interacting domain, reduced the amount of secreted vRNA but not secreted C. Therefore, the authors proposed that interaction of DDX56 with C enables loading of vRNA during the assembly of the virus particle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Given these results and because during WNV infection DDX56 relocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], it was presumed that interaction between WNV C and DDX56 would occur in both cellular compartments. However, recent data indicate that such interaction only occurs in the nucleus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. In contrast, a large proportion of cytoplasmic DDX56 colocalized with WNV E protein at the ER, suggesting that DDX56 indeed localizes to virus assembly sites. Nevertheless, how the C-DDX56 and E-DDX56 nuclear and cytoplasmic interactions, affect the packaging of vRNA into virions remains unknown.
