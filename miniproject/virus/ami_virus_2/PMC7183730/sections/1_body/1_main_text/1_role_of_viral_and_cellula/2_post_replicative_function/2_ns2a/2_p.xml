<p id="Par61">More recently, a detailed mechanism of the function for NS2A during DENV virus assembly was described by Xie and collaborators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. The authors reported a set of mutations that specifically impaired virus assembly without affecting vRNA synthesis. These mutants, which were incompetent for viral assembly, (Gly-11-Ala, Glu-20-Ala, Glu-100-Ala, Gln-187-Ala, and Lys-188-Ala), could be rescued in 
 <italic>trans</italic> by expressing wild-type NS2A or a mutant unable to support vRNA replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Further studies demonstrated that despite similar levels of viral protein synthesis and ER membrane rearrangements between wild-type RNA and the Gly-11-Ala mutant, the latter failed to form viral particles, as assessed by transmission electron microscopy, and reduced release of extracellular vRNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Moreover, the Gly-11-Ala mutant showed a significant decrease in the C-prM cleavage which resulted in an altered cellular localization of C, a decreased expression of E and an abrogation of prM expression. This defect in C-prM cleavage was explained by enhanced binding of mutant NS2A to prM on the ER lumen, which pulls the C anchor towards the ER membrane making it inaccessible to NS2B/NS3 in the cytoplasmic side. This defect was rescued by 
 <italic>trans</italic> complementation with wild-type NS2A and several mutations in C which shifted the C-prM cleavage site by two amino acids. Similarly, ZIKV NS2A was shown to independently bind prM/E and NS2B/NS3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>] which would facilitate the recruitment of these complexes to the virion assembly site by oligomerization of NS2A.
