 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> NS2A is a small (~â€‰22 KDa), hydrophobic protein generated after processing of the viral polyprotein by an unknown host protease and the viral protease at the NS1-NS2 and NS2A-NS2B boundaries, respectively [

 <underline>s</underline>egments (pTMS), although only five of them truly transverse the ER membrane. The N-terminus, pTMS1 and pTMS5 localize to the ER lumen and do not interact with its membrane; pTMS2 is in the ER lumen and interacts peripherally with the ER membrane; pTMS3, 4, 6, 7 and 8 are integral transmembrane domains and a short C-terminus localizes to the cytoplasm [

It has been shown that the mutation Lys-90-Ser or the triple mutation Arg-22-Ala/Lys-23-Ala/ Arg-24-Ala in YFV NS2A does not affect the accumulation of viral protein or vRNA, but decreases the production of infectious virions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Interestingly, the Lys-90-Ser mutation had no effect on the production of VLPs that lack capsid and vRNA, suggesting that NS2A participates in the incorporation of vRNA into the budding particle [

The mutation was associated with the absence of the ER membrane remodelling present in cells transfected with a wild-type infectious RNA replicon. Importantly, a compensatory mutation Thr-149-Pro restored the membrane remodelling and virus production to levels similar to wild-type [
