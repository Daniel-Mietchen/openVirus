<p id="Par45">The 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> is a family composed of a large number of enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses, many of which pose serious risks to human health on a global scale. This virus family name is derived from the prototype member: the deadly yellow (
 <italic>flavus</italic>) fever virus (YFV). In 1882, Carlos Finlay suggested that 
 <italic>Culex cubensis</italic> (now known as 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) was the mosquito responsible for the transmission of yellow fever, but he was unable to prove his hypothesis [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and caused by a filterable agent found in the blood of infected patients [

Decades later the causative virus was isolated and, with the advent of tissue culture methods, passaged extensively by Max Theiler and colleagues, leading to isolation of an attenuated strain (17D) that would later serve as a highly effective vaccine and earn Theiler a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine [
