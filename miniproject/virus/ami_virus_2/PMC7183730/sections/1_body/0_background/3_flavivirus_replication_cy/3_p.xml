<p id="Par53">Viral non-structural proteins mediate vRNA replication, which occurs within virus-induced ER invaginations, known as vesicle packets (VPs). The components of the replication complex, vRNA, NS proteins and possibly host factors, are found inside VPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. VPs are connected to the cytoplasm via a pore, through which other factors needed for replication such as nucleotides can enter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Using the viral genome as template, NS5 synthesizes antisense (−)RNA, generating double stranded (ds) RNA replicative intermediates. The (−)RNA serves as template for additional positive-sense vRNA synthesis.
