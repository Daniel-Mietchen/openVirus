<p id="p0365">The identification of serum-neutralizing antibody as a correlate of protection against serious RSV lower respiratory tract disease has been an important advance. Although a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the RSV F protein, palivizumab, has been licensed since 1998 to prevent RSV disease in young children with underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease, it is also currently used in children who are severely immunocompromised, such as infants with severe combined immune deficiency or congenital leukemia. Children younger than 24 months who are profoundly immunocompromised may be considered for palivizumab prophylaxis. The development of a potent and long-acting RSV monoclonal antibody directed against the pre-F protein of RSV is undergoing clinical trials in young infants. This, or similar products, may be available in the future to prevent RSV infection or disease in transplant candidates. Passive immunoprophylaxis against PIV and HMPV infection has not been studied in children.</p>
