<p id="p0360">New advances in the understanding of RSV and HMPV, including the characterization of the RSV fusion (F) protein in its preinfusion and postfusion states, have contributed to the development of new RSV vaccines and monoclonal antibodies with the potential to be used for prophylaxis against RSV. Vaccines stimulating antibody directed to the F protein, and specifically to the pre-F protein, are now under development. RSV-specific serum-neutralizing antibodies are efficiently transferred from the mother to the newborn, and ongoing clinical trials may offer potential protection against RSV in family members and health care workers surrounding immunocompromised patients, with the potential to protect these patients. Candidate vaccines against PIV and HMPV, as well as chimeric vaccines containing genes from more than one virus, have also been tested in preclinical models.</p>
