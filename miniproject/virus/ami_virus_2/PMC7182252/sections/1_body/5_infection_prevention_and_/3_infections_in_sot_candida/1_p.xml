<p id="p0470">For SOT candidates, there are limited data examining clinical outcomes for pretransplant respiratory viral infections and often organ availability is a significant consideration on proceeding with transplantation. Specific clinical circumstances, such as duration of infection and severity of symptoms, should be considered. Donor transmission of influenza is of particular concern in lung or small bowel transplantation; however, non-lung and nonâ€“small bowel organs can be considered after donor antiviral treatment for 48 hours coupled with treatment of the recipient.

 </xref> No clear guidance exists for other respiratory viruses, and decisions regarding organ use from infected donors should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
