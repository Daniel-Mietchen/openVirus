<p id="p0315">HCT recipients of all ages may have a more fulminant course after respiratory viral infections, particularly if infection occurs around the time of transplantation. Risk factors for disease progression include lack of engraftment, decreased lymphocyte count, and older age. Evidence of pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs may be delayed or absent in patients with severe neutropenia but may become apparent after immune reconstitution or on chest computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. In a multicenter retrospective review of pediatric HCT recipients, the all-cause and attributable case-fatality rates within 3 months of hospitalized respiratory viral infection onset were 11% and 5.4%, respectively.

 </xref> Lower respiratory tract infection was rare except in HMPV infections; fever was more common for influenza and HMPV. Multivariate models indicated that onset within 60 days of HCT, steroid use in the 7 days before onset, and the need for respiratory support at onset were associated with subsequent morbidity or death. Several risk scores have been proposed for adult HCT recipients with respiratory virus infections to predict the risk of progression to lower respiratory tract infection and mortality.
