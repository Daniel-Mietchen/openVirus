<p id="p0265">Exposure to sick contacts is the single most well-described risk factor for respiratory viral acquisition in immunocompromised children. Respiratory viruses are typically transmitted by respiratory secretions through direct contact, via fomites, or by large droplet spread. Entry generally occurs through contact with nasal mucosa or eyes, in contrast to the less permissive oral route. Transmission by small-particle aerosols of RSV has not been proven and, if it occurs, it is an infrequent route. Clinical observations suggest PIVs and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are transmitted similarly to RSV. Although PIV-1 and PIV-3 have been recovered from air samples collected in the vicinity of infected patients, direct contact and transmission via fomites are likely to be more important. The high initial and subsequent infection rates, as well as outbreaks reported in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients in both inpatient and outpatient settings, demonstrate that these viruses spread readily and that a relatively small inoculum is likely able to cause infection.</p>
