<p id="p0375">Nasopharyngeal swabs and mid-turbinate swabs are not as sensitive as nasal washes for viral diagnosis using culture but have good diagnostic yields with molecular detection methods. In general, molecular methods of detection are preferred over fluorescent antigen-antibody detection or antigen detection tests in immunocompromised patients. Specimens from children are often more readily diagnosed than those from adults owing to higher viral loads. Other clinical specimens useful for the detection of respiratory viruses in patients of all ages include endotracheal aspirates collected from intubated patients, bronchoalveolar lavage, nasal mucosal epithelium collected by scraping, sputum, and lung tissue obtained by biopsy or at autopsy.</p>
