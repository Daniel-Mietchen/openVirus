<p id="p0440">A new potential antiviral therapy for PIV and other sialic acidâ€“binding viruses targets the lung epithelial sialic acid receptor for PIV, thereby preventing viral entry. A novel recombinant sialidase fusion protein, DAS181 (Ansun Biopharma, San Diego, CA), first developed as an antiviral agent for influenza, functions by cleaving sialic acid from the host cell surface, thereby inactivating the host cell receptor recognized by PIV. Successful use of this agent in pediatric and adult transplant recipients under compassionate use has been reported, and clinical trials in immunocompromised subjects are ongoing.</p>
