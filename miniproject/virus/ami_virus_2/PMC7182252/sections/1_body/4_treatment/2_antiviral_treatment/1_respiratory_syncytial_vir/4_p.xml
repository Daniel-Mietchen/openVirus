<p id="p0405">Systemic antibody therapy, combined antibody therapy with ribavirin, and aerosolized antibodies have been used to treat RSV disease. The combination of high-titer RSV immunoglobulin and ribavirin has been associated with therapeutic success in uncontrolled studies in severely immunocompromised adults with RSV disease but has not been confirmed in others. A small, nonrandomized unadjusted analysis in pediatric cancer patients with RSV lower respiratory tract infection suggested a beneficial effect of adjunctive palivizumab or IVIG.
