<p id="p0430">The management of other respiratory viral infections in immunosuppressed patients is generally supportive (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 21.2</xref> ). Ribavirin has shown efficacy against HMPV in vitro and in mouse models, with anecdotal reports describing its use in severe infection in immunocompromised hosts (with and without IVIG). Lack of controlled studies of ribavirin and the known toxicities of therapy, including hemolytic anemia, limit its recommendation for HMPV. Currently, no approved antiviral agents exist for treatment of HCoV, HRV, HBoV, or enteroviruses, although some investigational agents are upcoming. The use of IVIG has not been evaluated prospectively and is not routinely recommended for treatment of respiratory viral infections. Some centers routinely check and replete immunoglobulins, but the impact on respiratory virus acquisition and severity is not known.
