<p id="p0395">In adult HCT and hematologic malignancy patients with RSV lower respiratory tract infection, use of aerosolized ribavirin was associated with decreased mortality. Oral or IV ribavirin although not statistically significant as the effect was smaller.

 </xref> Current international guidelines recommend aerosolized or systemic (oral or IV) ribavirin with intravenous immunoglogulin (IVIG) in patients with RSV upper respiratory tract infection undergoing allogeneic HCT, allogeneic HCT recipients with risk factors for progression to lower respiratory tract infection, and allogeneic HCT patients with lower respiratory tract infection.

 </xref> For HCT and oncology patients, high-risk situations include patients with lymphopenia; additional risk factors, such as smoking history and use of high-dose total body irradiation, could be used to further risk-stratify patients. In general, aerosolized ribavirin is reserved for subjects with virologically confirmed (BAL positive for RSV) lower respiratory tract infection. It is administered by small-particle aerosol from a solution containing the drug at a concentration of 20 mg/mL sterile water via aerosol for 2 to 20 hours/day, or at a concentration of 60 mg/mL water over 2 hours 3 times daily. Aerosol administration results in high levels of ribavirin in the secretions, with levels exceeding 1000 Î¼M and little systemic absorption. The potential environmental release of ribavirin has caused concern in hospital personnel because of the potential teratogenicity of ribavirin and thus exposure is contraindicated in pregnant women because of its teratogenic potential. Administration of ribavirin via a ventilator, using a high-dose, short-duration method of drug delivery or with a vacuum-exhausted treatment hood, results in minimal or no detectable ribavirin in the rooms of treated children.
