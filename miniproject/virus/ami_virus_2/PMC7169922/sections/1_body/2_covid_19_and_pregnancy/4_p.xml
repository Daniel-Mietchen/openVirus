<p>No studies on severe COVID-19 and obstetric complications during the first trimester of gestation are available so far; therefore, we lack information on potential effects of infection on pregnancy during the initial stages. Regarding other coronaviruses, SARS and MERS epidemics showed no correlation with frequencies of malformations. Moreover, data from the current epidemic should be considered for managing COVID-19 infections during pregnancy, as the clinical course of this disease and the response to treatments seem to differ from those of previous outbreaks of other types of coronaviruses (

Further research is needed in order to understand pathogenesis and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy, including aspects such as the time of maternal infection, gestational age, effects of comorbidity factors, and frequencies of adverse outcomes; however, preliminary observations of pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 suggest an optimistic outlook regarding the clinical course.
