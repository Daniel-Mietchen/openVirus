<p>Despite that COVID-19 epidemic is ongoing and the data are limited, recent reports indicate that clinical characteristics reported in pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to those of non-pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia, and no evidence of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in late pregnancy has been produced so far. Nine studies reported COVID-19 in pregnant women, with a total of 69 patients; however, some of these patients may have been included in more than one study (
 <xref rid="t1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The reported cases included five patients in the second trimester of pregnancy, and all other patients were in the third trimester. Most women showed mild or moderate symptoms, and three of them required intensive care. Preterm birth occurred in 8 out of 61 women who gave birth (

A joint investigation carried out by the WHO and China evaluated 147 pregnant women in China (64 confirmed and 82 suspected COVID-19 cases and an asymptomatic patient), 8% showed severe symptoms, and 1% showed a critical course of disease. It was concluded that pregnant women with COVID-19 were not at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms (

One case of a neonate infected with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed 36 hours after birth; however, it is unclear whether this was due to vertical transmission from mother to child (
