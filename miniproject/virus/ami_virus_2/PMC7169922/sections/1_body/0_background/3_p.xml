<p>The Brazilian Health Ministry confirmed the first COVID-19 case on February 26 2020 in São Paulo. The patient was a 65-year-old man who had recently returned from northern Italy, where a significant outbreak had occurred. This was also the first confirmed case in South America, a continent with a population of over 640 million people who have previously experienced significant outbreaks of infections such as zika, dengue, and measles. The number of COVID-19 cases has been increasing constantly since the first reported case, and while initial cases were associated with travelers arriving from countries with ongoing COVID-19 epidemics, since March 13 2020, the stage of 'community transmission' was announced to be reached in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. At the time this manuscript was drafted (March 25 2020), 2,201 cases have been confirmed in Brazil, and the pandemic continues to increase worldwide, with currently 375,498 confirmed cases and 16,362 deaths in 195 countries (
