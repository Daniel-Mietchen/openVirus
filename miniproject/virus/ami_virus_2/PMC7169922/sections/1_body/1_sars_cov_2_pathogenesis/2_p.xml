<p>Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that infect humans and a wide range of animals. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus beta-coronavirus, and it may originate from a virus of bats, as the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is to approximately 90% identical with that of a bat coronavirus. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 sequences show only about 80% sequence identity with SARS-CoV and about 50% with MERS-CoV (
