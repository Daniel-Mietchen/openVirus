<p>The study describing approximately 45.000 cases of COVID-19 in China showed that in most cases (86%), the course of disease was mild (i.e., no or mild pneumonia), and it was severe in 14% (i.e., dyspnea, respiratory frequency ≥ 30/min, blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93%, partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio &lt;300, and/or lung infiltrates &gt;50% within 24-48 hours) and critical in 5% (i.e., respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure). The overall case fatality rate was 2.3%, but it was 8.0% in patients aged 70-79 years and 14.8% in patients aged 80 years and older; no deaths occurred in patients aged 9 years or younger and among mild and severe cases. However, case fatality rates were higher in patients with preexisting comorbid conditions, varying from 5.6% to 10.5%, depending on comorbidity (

 </xref>). Despite considerably higher case-fatality rates in SARS and MERS patients, COVID-19 seems to be more transmissible and has led to a higher number of deaths due to the large number of cases. In addition, the true number of COVID-19 cases can be presumed to be higher than the number of reported cases owing to inherent difficulties in identifying mild and asymptomatic cases in addition to insufficient COVID-19 testing capacities in all affected countries (
