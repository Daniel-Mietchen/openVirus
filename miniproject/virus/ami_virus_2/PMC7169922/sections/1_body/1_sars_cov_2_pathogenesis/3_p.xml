<p>SARS-CoV-2 has four key structural proteins: the nucleocapsid protein (N), spike protein (S), small membrane protein (SM), and membrane glycoprotein (M). The angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed on type-I and type-II alveolar epithelial cells, is the main SARS-CoV-2 receptor, and infection causes respiratory symptoms and eventually the acute respiratory syndrome. This receptor is also expressed in the gut, albeit at a low abundance, and infection may lead to diarrhea and vomiting, despite it is less frequent. The S protein is required for the virus to fuse with the host cell through the receptor-binding domain. This protein includes two subunits, S1 and S2, and while S1 determines cellular tropism, S2 mediates virus-cell membrane fusion. After membrane fusion, viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm, and viral replication is initiated. Newly formed viral particle buds then fuse with the plasma membrane through virion-containing vesicles to release the virus (

It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV also uses ACE2 as a receptor for cell entry; however, receptor binding ability of SARS-CoV-2 is 10- to 20-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, and the number of infections with SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded that of SARS infections during the outbreak in China in 2002/2003, indicating higher transmission rates. Moreover, men typically have higher ACE2 levels than women, and Asians show higher levels of ACE2 expression in alveolar cells than Caucasian and African American people, which would suggest Asian males to be most susceptible to infection (
