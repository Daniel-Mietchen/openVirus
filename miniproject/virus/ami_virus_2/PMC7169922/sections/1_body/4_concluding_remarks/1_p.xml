<p>Based on most recent epidemiologic data on COVID-19 and pregnancy, there is no evidence to suggest increased risk for mothers or fetuses. It appears that the course of disease after infection with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnant women does not differ from that in other young adults. Moreover, recent evidence suggests no association of vertical transmission and malformations, and the management of pregnant patients should be individualized based on obstetrical indications and maternal/fetal health status. It is important to consider that the current COVID-19 pandemic causes psychological stress and anxiety in pregnant women, which may exert adverse effects. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize the recommendations regarding social isolation and quarantine as issued by health authorities in order to avoid further spreading of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, deciding between initiating/resuming or postponing assisted reproductive treatments depends more strongly on social isolation than on COVID-19 and its potential effects during pregnancy, bearing in mind potential emotional effects on patients.</p>
