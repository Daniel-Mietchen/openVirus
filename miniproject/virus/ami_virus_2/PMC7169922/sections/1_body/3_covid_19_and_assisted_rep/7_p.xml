<p>Taken together, we currently face a pandemic with a novel virus, and considerable uncertainty remains regarding SAR-CoV-2 infections and consequences of infection during pregnancy. Hence, most of Human Reproduction Societies are restrictive suggesting to postpone embryo transfer independently of confirmation or suspicion of COVID-19 and suspend all cycle's initiations, with rare exceptions. However, whilst every effort must be made to reduce services over coming weeks or maybe months, it is necessary to think forwards towards a resumption of services and a number of questions need to be answered around the management of ART: Should we cancel all ART cycles at this moment? Should we keep the treatments and postpone all embryo transfers? Should we keep only embryo transfers for couple whose success of treatment can be impaired or those who desire transfer the embryos?</p>
