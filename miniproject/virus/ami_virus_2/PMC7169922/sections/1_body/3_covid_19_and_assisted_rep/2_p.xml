The same day, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) published a bulletin suggesting that patients who are highly likely to suffer from COVID-19 (i.e., patients who were tested SARS-CoV-2 positive or who have been exposed to confirmed COVID-19 cases within 14 days of onset of their symptoms) should consider freezing oocytes or embryos and avoid embryo transfer until they are symptom-free; however, this recommendation was emphasized to not necessarily apply to suspected COVID-19 cases as symptoms of COVID-19 closely resemble those of other more common forms of respiratory disease (

On March 17 2020, the ASRM published a new document named "Patient Management and Clinical Recommendations During the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic" in which the key recommendations were: 1. Suspend initiation of new treatment cycles, including ovulation induction, intrauterine inseminations (IUIs), in vitro fertilization (IVF) including retrievals and frozen embryo transfers, as well as non-urgent gamete cryopreservation. 2. Strongly consider cancellation of all embryo transfers whether fresh or frozen. 3. Continue to care for patients who are currently "in-cycle" or who require urgent stimulation and cryopreservation. 4. Suspend elective surgeries and non-urgent diagnostic procedures. 5. Minimize in-person interactions and increase utilization of telehealth (
