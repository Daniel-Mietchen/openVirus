<p>The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) issued a statement on March 14 2020 detailing that so far, only few cases of COVID-19 during pregnancy have been reported, thus the respective data must be interpreted with caution as no information is available regarding potential effects of COVID-19 infection during the initial stages of pregnancy; furthermore, medical treatment administered to severe COVID-19 cases may include drugs that are contraindicated during pregnancy (

The same publication advised that all patients considering or planning treatments, independently of confirmation or suspicion of COVID-19 infections, should avoid becoming pregnant at this time and consider deferring pregnancy by freezing oocytes or embryos for embryo transfer at a later point (
