<p id="para40">As in all outbreaks, there is an urgent need to develop effective diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. Several experimental diagnostic platforms are already in use in China and elsewhere. The whole-genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 had been obtained and shared widely by mid-January, a feat not possible at such speed in previous infectious disease outbreaks. This sequence will allow fine-tuning of existing technologies and development of better diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. Several potential treatments have been proposed, including a Janus kinase inibitor known as

However, no antiviral treatment has been approved for coronaviruses, and despite two outbreaks of novel coronaviruses in the past two decades, vaccine development is still in its infancy. WHO has announced that a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 should be available in 18 months, but achieving this will require funding and public interest to be maintained even if the threat level falls.
