  <p>Examples of HCoV shedding patterns in young children attending child care centers [
   <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
   <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Children attending group childcare were tested prospectively for respiratory viruses at each acute respiratory illness (ARI). Swabs were collected weekly from ARI onset until symptoms were nonworsening and swabs were negative by real-time-polymerase chain reaction [
   <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Human coronavirus (HCoV)â€“positive swabs (for all species) are represented by filled circles, and negative swabs are represented by open circles. Weeks on 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis were calculated as weeks since symptom onset with an HCoV (+) acute respiratory illness. The lower limit of positivity was set at 1000 copies/mL for this analysis. Sequencing of HCoV isolates was not performed.
