<p>Understanding the history and epidemiology of the common community human coronaviruses (HCoVs) and those responsible for recent past epidemics is crucial to the control and treatment of novel coronaviruses. The epidemiology of previously described community coronaviruses in children is relatively well known from surveillance studies. However, important clinical and laboratory details of these viruses, such as duration of shedding, transmission rates, viral load over time, immunity, and morbidity in high-risk populations, are not well characterized. Such information becomes more important and clinically relevant as we consider world-wide pandemics such as the ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak.</p>
