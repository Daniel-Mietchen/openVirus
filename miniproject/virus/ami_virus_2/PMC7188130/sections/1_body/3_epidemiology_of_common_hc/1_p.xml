<p>Community-acquired HCoVs species OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E are found worldwide in temperate and tropical countries, as well as low-, middle-, and high-income countries [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. HCoV infection can occur at any time of the year, with unpredictable year-to-year patterns, and outbreaks are reported in some years and in certain parts of the world. All 4 species may circulate yearly and even simultaneously [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], with the highest rates of HCoV infection seen in winter and spring months in temperate climates [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Almost all surveillance data indicate HCoV-OC43 is the most common species. A large prospective surveillance study conducted in Norway from 2006 to 2015 that enrolled all hospitalized children aged â‰¤16 years with respiratory tract infections revealed that HCoVs OC43 and NL63 were detected most frequently and were epidemic every second winter [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. HCoV-HKU1 was prevalent every second winter during the year when detection rates for HCoVs OC43 and NL63 were low; HCoV-229E was the least common.
