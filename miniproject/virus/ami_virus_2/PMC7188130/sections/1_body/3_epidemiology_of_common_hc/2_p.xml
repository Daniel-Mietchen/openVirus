<p>Seroprevalence data suggest that exposure is common in early childhood [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. More than 90% of adults are seropositive for at least 1 HCoV species [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A recent prospective active surveillance study of young infants in Nepal that used multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed that HCoVs are less common in neonates compared with older infants [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Outbreaks of variable sizes have been reported sporadically in medical students, young asthmatic children, and neonatal intensive care units [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38â€“41</xref>]. For example, an outbreak of HCoV-229E was reported in a neonatal intensive care unit where 92% of infected preterm neonates developed symptoms, including worsening respiratory conditions and bradycardia [
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Potential nosocomial transmission by staff members was speculated.
