<p>An analysis of new and old data reveals, not surprisingly, that viral coinfections are less common in children with influenza virus (9% of influenza in Seattle, Washington; 27% in Seoul, South Korea) than in children infected with a community HCoVs (43% of HCoV infections in Seattle and 42% in Seoul;

Multivariable analyses suggest that higher viral load (cycle threshold &lt;28 by PCR), codetection of generally symptomatic viruses (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], human metapneumovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza virus), younger age (&lt;2 years), being female, and high-risk underlying conditions (lung, heart, or neurologic disorder) were associated with symptomatic children. Children with only HCoV detected were more likely to have a higher viral load compared with those with viral coinfection.
