<p>Associations of HCoVs with LRTI or asthma exacerbation in children have been reported [

 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Specific HCoV species and associated risk factors for disease severity have been evaluated, although some studies did not address potential confounders, such as the presence of coinfection [
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. One retrospective study of 212 hospitalized children with HCoV (54 with and 158 without viral coinfection) showed that similar numbers of children received respiratory support and intensive care [
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Bivariate analyses showed that younger age (&lt;2 years) and chronic complex medical conditions (cardiovascular, respiratory, genetic, or congenital) were associated with increased disease severity. No specific species were associated with severity of illness. Although the presence of viral coinfection was not associated with increased disease severity, the analysis did not assess the impact of specific types of coinfections. A retrospective analysis of 1237 children who presented to Seattle Childrenâ€™s Hospital (Washington) for acute care with detected HCoVs showed that disease severity did not vary by HCoV species [
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Younger age, presence of underlying pulmonary disorder, and presence of coinfection, particularly RSV, were associated with increased likelihood of LRTI in multivariable models. The impact of RSV coinfection with HCoV has been described in other studies [
