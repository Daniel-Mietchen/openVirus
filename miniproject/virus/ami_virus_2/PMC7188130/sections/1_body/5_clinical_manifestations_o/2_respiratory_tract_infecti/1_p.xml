<p>HCoVs 229E and OC43 were shown to be pathogenic in adult human volunteer studies. Cold symptoms (eg, sore throat, rhinorrhea, cough) are very similar to those caused by other respiratory viruses [

 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. It is assumed that HCoVs NL63 and HKU1 have similar pathogenicity, although this has not been proven in challenge studies. The frequent detection of HCoVs in asymptomatic patients as well as coinfection with other respiratory viruses make the interpretation of HCoV pathogenesis and clinical findings challenging. A multicenter, prospective surveillance study conducted in the United States evaluated the prevalence of HCoVs among hospitalized children with acute respiratory illness and demonstrated that the prevalence of HCoVs was similar in both asymptomatic and symptomatic groups of children [

In contrast, a prospective community surveillance study of respiratory viruses in Utah showed HCoV detection was often associated with symptoms in all age groups, suggesting HCoV infection might have been previously underestimated as an etiology of respiratory tract infection [
