<p>HCoV has been described as a possible etiology of severe pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts [
 <xref rid="CIT0064" ref-type="bibr">64–67</xref>]. Data are limited for this high-risk population and particularly are lacking in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients [
 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Among 404 children aged &lt;18 years who underwent allogeneic HCT from April 2008 to September 2018 at Seattle Children’s Hospital, HCoVs were the third most common respiratory viruses detected post-HCT following rhinovirus and parainfluenza virus (preliminary data). The cumulative incidence of HCoVs in children during the first 365 days following HCT are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>. HCoVs were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from 2 young children in this cohort. The detection of HCoV in BAL specimens among HCT recipients and patients with hematologic malignancy was also evaluated, but only 1 of 35 patients was a child [
 <xref rid="CIT0069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Among 16 patients in that study (15 adults, 1 child) with HCoV and without other coinfections identified by BAL, 10 required oxygen support, suggesting a role of HCoV as a significant respiratory pathogen. In a retrospective study of immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised children with HCoV detected in nasal specimens in Seattle, the prevalence of LRTI that required oxygen supplementation (severe LRTI) was 15% (13/85) and 11% (122/1152), respectively [
 <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Multivariable models showed that immunocompromised state, presence of RSV, and underlying pulmonary disorder were associated with increased risk of severe LRTI.
