<p>A prospective surveillance study with weekly nasal sampling in 215 allogeneic HCT recipients of all ages demonstrated that the median shedding duration of HCoVs was 3 weeks (range, 0–22 weeks) [

Using available nasal samples from patients with prolonged shedding, we performed whole-genome sequencing, which revealed only small and slow genomic changes, consistent with previously estimated evolution rates. This is in contrast to more rapid genomic changes associated with influenza infections [
