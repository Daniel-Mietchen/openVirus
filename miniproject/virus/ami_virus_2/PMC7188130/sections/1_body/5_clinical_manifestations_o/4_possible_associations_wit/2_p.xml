<p>HCoV-OC43 has been detected in the central nervous system of children with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or fatal encephalitis [
 <xref rid="CIT0075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. A prospective study investigated associations between HCoVs detection and various clinical manifestations [
 <xref rid="CIT0077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. This latter study proposed an etiological role of HCoVs in febrile seizures given that children with febrile seizures had higher rates of HCoVs detection with higher viral load in nasopharyngeal swabs than those with bronchiolitis or gastroenteritis and healthy controls. However, an etiologic connection between HCoVs and neurologic diseases remains unproven [
 <xref rid="CIT0078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Carefully conducted epidemiological studies have not demonstrated an association between HCoVs and Kawasaki disease [
