<p>The role of HCoVs as enteric pathogens in humans has been debated, perhaps in part because of the known enteric disease associated with coronavirus in animals, including dogs. Risku et al investigated the presence of HCoVs in stool of children with and without gastroenteritis. All 4 species were found in 2.5% of stool samples (22/878) from children with gastroenteritis, whereas 1.7 % of stool samples (2/112) from controls were positive for HCoVs. However, other known enteric pathogens, such as rotavirus or norovirus, were also found in 18 of 22 stool samples in children with gastroenteritis. Among 4 patients with only HCoV detected in stool, 3 had respiratory symptoms [

Interestingly, in patients with gastroenteritis, more than half (13/23) had respiratory symptoms and HCoVs were more frequently found in nasopharyngeal samples than in stool samples (22/256, 8.6%, vs 6/260, 2.3%, respectively). Based on these studies, the significance of HCoVs as enteric pathogens appears minor.
