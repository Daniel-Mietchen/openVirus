<p>Coronaviruses are already known to be ubiquitous viruses and recognized as pathogens in both humans and animals. A coronavirus was first isolated as a causative agent of bronchitis in birds in 1937 [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and was originally discovered in humans during studies that evaluated the common cold. The history of the discovery of HCoVs is shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2â€“20</xref>]. The common human coronaviruses known today include the species 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1. These 4 viruses are primarily viewed as relatively benign respiratory pathogens in humans, typically causing upper respiratory tract disease and common cold symptoms. By contrast SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) are highly pathogenic in humans, with high rates of severe pneumonia and fatal outcomes [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Currently, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is spreading worldwide, causing anxiety, disease, and mortality [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Despite the heightened interest, limited pediatric data are available regarding either the community HCoVs or the newer pathogenic species in children. Here, we review what is known about HCoV infections in children in the pre-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era.
