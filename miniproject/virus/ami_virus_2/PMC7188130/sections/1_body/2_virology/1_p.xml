<p>Coronaviruses belong to the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family in the 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order. The coronavirus subfamily is further classified into 4 genera known as the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coronaviruses. These viruses cause a wide variety of generally species-specific illness in mammals and birds, including chickens, turkeys, bats, rats, dogs, cats, piglets, and whales [

Coronaviruses were named for their characteristic crown-like surface projections seen in electron micrographs that correspond to large surface spike proteins. These viruses are enveloped, nonsegmented, positive-sense RNA viruses and have the largest identified viral RNA genomes, with an approximate length of 30 kilobases [
