<p>HCoVs OC43 and 229E were isolated from nasal cavities of people with the common cold in the 1960s. In the 1970s, studies that used serology and viral culture linked HCoVs 229E and OC43 with 8% of cases of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in hospitalized infants [

Poor replication in tissue culture and a lack of cytopathic effect in early attempts at culture were major obstacles in making further progress in the field. The development and widespread use of molecular diagnostics as well as the emergence of SARS-CoV in 2003 significantly accelerated coronavirus research. Subsequently, new HCoVs NL63 and HKU1 were identified and are frequently seen in children. Additional pathogenic coronavirus species and outbreaks with MERS-CoV and, recently, SARS-CoV-2 have led to increased interest, research, and concern [
