<p>Only alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans. Both HCoVs 229E and NL63 are alpha coronaviruses and HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV are beta coronaviruses (

 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 also falls within the beta coronavirus in the same subgenus as the SARS-CoV, but in a different clade [
