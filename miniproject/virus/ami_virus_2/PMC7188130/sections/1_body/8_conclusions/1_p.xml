<p>Recognition of the importance of community coronavirus disease due to 4 established HCoVs has increased over the past 20 years, with widespread availability of molecular diagnostic methods. However, detailed information on pathogenesis, immunity, and viral characteristics of disease in children remains limited. Recent and ongoing epidemics of novel coronaviruses in the 21st century have highlighted issues of zoonotic origins of transmissible respiratory viruses and potential transmission, disease, and mortality related to these viruses. The role of children in the spread of disease with these novel viruses remains unclear. As the current pandemic with SARS-CoV-2 unfolds, more information regarding the role of children in viral transmission and their clinical presentation and outcome will become more evident. Further study of coronaviruses in humans is imperative.</p>
