<p>A study reported outcomes of 5 pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="CIT0089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]; the gestational ages of their infants ranged from 26 weeks to 32 weeks. In 3 of these 5 pregnant women, cesarean section was needed because of maternal conditions, including hypotension and worsening pulmonary function. However, a systematic search for perinatal transmission of the SARS-CoV did not detect the virus in any of the 5 babies.
