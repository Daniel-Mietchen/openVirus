<p>Among laboratory-confirmed and probable pediatric SARS-CoV cases, the most common symptoms included fever (98%), cough (60%), nausea or vomiting (41%), and constitutional symptoms such as myalgia (29%), chills (28%), and headache (28%) [

Clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV in children are nonspecific, and it can be very difficult to differentiate SARS-CoV from other respiratory tract infections without laboratory testing in the outbreak setting. However, certain features may provide a clue. A comparison of 15 pediatric patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV and 15 age- and sex-matched patients with culture-confirmed influenza in Taiwan revealed that rates of fever, cough, and constitutional symptoms such as chills and myalgia were similar between the 2 groups, but patients with SARS-CoV had significantly less rhinorrhea, sputum production, and sore throat than those with influenza [

However, a much higher proportion of adult patients progress to severe pneumonia, even acute respiratory distress syndrome. In fact, despite a high mortality rate in adults (9.6%–16.7%) [
