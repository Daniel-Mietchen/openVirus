<p>The transmission of HCoV in community epidemics is impacted by the characteristics of HCoV infection and shedding in children. Children have higher attack rates, as high as 78% within households, compared with adults, as shown in an active surveillance study in Kenya [
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These data complement community studies in the 1960s that showed a higher frequency of HCoV-229E in families with children aged &lt;15 years [
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], a higher rate of HCoV-OC43 infection in children aged &lt;5 years [
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and frequent clustering of infections within families [
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The attack rate of HCoV in childcare settings has also been shown to be higher with younger age [
