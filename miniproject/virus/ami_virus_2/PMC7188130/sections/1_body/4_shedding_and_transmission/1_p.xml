<p>The mode(s) of HCoV transmission is not known [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It is assumed that transmission occurs via a combination of droplet and direct/indirect contact, similar to other respiratory viruses. HCoVs OC43 and 229E appear to be primarily transmitted during the first few days of illness when symptoms and viral load in the respiratory tract are highest. The incubation period of HCoV-229E was 2 to 5 days (median, 3 days) in adults in challenge studies and has not yet been clearly defined for other HCoVs or in children [

 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
