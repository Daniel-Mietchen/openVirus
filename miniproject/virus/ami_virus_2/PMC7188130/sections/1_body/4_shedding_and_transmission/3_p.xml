<p>Children may shed HCoVs for extended periods of time after infection, potentially leading to additional transmissions within close-contact settings. There are very limited data regarding duration of shedding in children. In prospective childcare studies, 34% of children with HCoV had detectable virus at 1 week or more following symptom onset, with shedding documented for up to 18 days (
