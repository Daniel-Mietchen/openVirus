<p>RNA was extracted with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Briefly, organs were homogenized in Trizol Reagent and phase separation was achieved by adding chloroform (Emsure, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). RNA was precipitated by addition of isopropanol (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA). After washing with 70% ethanol (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA), the RNA pellet was dissolved in DEPC treated RNAse free water (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, USA). 400 ng of RNA were synthesized into cDNA with Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Gene expression of 
 <italic>Ifna4</italic> (QT01774353), 
 <italic>Ifna5</italic> (QT00327656) and 
 <italic>Ifnb1</italic> (QT00249662) was analyzed with primers obtained from Qiagen and normalized to Gapdh (QT01658692). VSV-NP expression was analyzed by primer sequence made in house.
