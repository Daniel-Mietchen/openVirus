<p>The VSV Indiana strain was originally obtained from D. Kolakofsky. VSV was propagated as described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. VSV-EBOV (rVSV-EBOV, Ervebo) was obtained from M. Addo (Division of Infectious Diseases, First Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; Department of Clinical Immunology of Infectious Diseases, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany; German Center for Infection Research, Partner Site Hamburg-LÃ¼beck-Borstel-Riems). VSV-EBOV was propagated on BHK-21 cells. To analyze VSV-EBOV titers, 11 serial 1:3 dilutions of samples were prepared. Every second dilution was transferred to preseeded, confluent Vero E6 cells and overlaid after 2 h of incubation. After 48 h, plaque forming units were visualized by staining with crystal violet.
