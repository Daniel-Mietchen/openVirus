<p>Recent studies show that the early protection of VSV-EBOV is dependent on a strong activation of the innate immune responseâ€”mainly type I interferon induction. In line, we found strong induction of type I interferon in WT mice. Absence of

 <sup>+</sup> macrophages blunted this strong IFN-I response. Therefore, we would suggest that this could be one factor making patients susceptible to side effects. This hints toward a dual advantage of enforced replication, as it accelerates vaccination success, but also limits the induction of side effects. Successful live vaccination does not only rely on early immune events; moreover, a strong memory guarantees long-term immunity against infections [
