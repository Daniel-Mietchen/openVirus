<p>VSV-EBOV (Ervebo) displays a recently developed VSV-vectored vaccine expressing the Ebola virus glycoprotein. Little is known about its behavior in systemic infection. Former models of VSV vectors with expression of filovirus glycoproteins, stated phenotypical identity of vectors and WT rhabdoviruses [

Interestingly, new insights underlined that CD169 may also serve as an entry factor for EBOV in humans, which strengthens the finding from our data that CD169-expressing cells contribute to immune responses after VSV-EBOV challenge [
