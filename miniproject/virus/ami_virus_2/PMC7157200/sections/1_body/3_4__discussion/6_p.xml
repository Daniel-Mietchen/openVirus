<p>Besides the VSV-EBOV (Ervebo) vaccine, viral vaccine vectors on the backbone of the VSV have risen over the last decade [

 <xref rid="B46-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Here, we show that VSV-based vector vaccines are ideal vehicles for immunization with special regard to enforced replication in CD169
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages. Type I interferon is essential to prevent the lethality of VSV infections in immunocompetent mice [

 <xref rid="B48-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, VSV replication is only enhanced in cells with deprived IFN signaling, like CD169
 <sup>+</sup> MÎ¦s. It is possible that the enforced replication of VSV-based vector vaccines would not only boost immunity, but could also lessen immunization-associated adverse effects by restricting replication to CD169
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages.
