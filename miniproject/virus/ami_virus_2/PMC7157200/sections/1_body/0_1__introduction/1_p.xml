<p>The Ebola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped, non-segmented negative RNA virus from the family of Filoviruses. It causes hemorrhagic fever in non-human primates and humans [

 <xref rid="B2-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. EBOV is one of the most pathogenic viruses worldwide, and epidemic outbreaks in the past, such as the Ebola virus outbreak in western Africa from 2013â€“2016, have demonstrated an urgent need for new vaccines in order to protect the human population. VSV-EBOV (rVSV-EBOV, Ervebo) is among the most powerful newly developed VSV vector vaccines; demonstrating safety and efficacy in clinical studies, and was recently approved by the EMA [
