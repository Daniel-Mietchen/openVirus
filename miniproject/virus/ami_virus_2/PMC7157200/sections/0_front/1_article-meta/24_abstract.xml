 <p>Ebola virus epidemics can be effectively limited by the VSV-EBOV vaccine (Ervebo) due to its rapid protection abilities; however, side effects prevent the broad use of VSV-EBOV as vaccine. Mechanisms explaining the efficient immune activation after single injection with the VSV-EBOV vaccine remain mainly unknown. Here, using the clinically available VSV-EBOV vaccine (Ervebo), we show that the cell-intrinsic expression of the interferon-inhibitor

  <sup>+</sup> macrophages is one important factor modulating the anti-Ebola virus immune response. The absence of 
  <italic>Usp18</italic> in CD169
  <sup>+</sup> macrophages led to the reduced local replication of VSV-EBOV followed by a diminished innate as well as adaptive immune response. In line,

  <sup>fl/fl</sup> mice showed reduced innate and adaptive immune responses against the VSV wildtype strain and died quickly after infection, suggesting that a lack of

  <italic>Usp18</italic> expression in CD169
