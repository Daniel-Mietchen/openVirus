<p>Although prompt diagnosis and patient isolation are the hallmarks for initial control of this new epidemic, molecular epidemiology, evolutionary models, and phylogenetic analysis can help estimate genetic variability and the evolutionary rate, which in turn have important implications for disease progression as well as for drug and vaccine development. In this short report, we provide a phylogenetic tree of the 2019‚ÄênCoV and identify sites of positive or negative selection pressure in distinct regions of the virus.</p>
