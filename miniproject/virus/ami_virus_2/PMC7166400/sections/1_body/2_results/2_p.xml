<p>The ML phylogenetic tree, performed on whole genome sequences, is represented in Figure 
 <xref rid="jmv25688-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In the tree, MERS virus sequences formed a distinct clade (clade I) from Bat SARS‐like coronavirus, SARS virus, and the 2019‐nCoV clustering together in clade II. This clade includes two different clusters: cluster IIa with Bat SARS‐like coronavirus and the 2019‐nCoV sequences, and cluster IIb with the bat SARS‐like coronavirus and the SARS virus sequences. The 2019‐nCoV is significantly and closely related only to the specific bat SARS‐like coronavirus isolated from
