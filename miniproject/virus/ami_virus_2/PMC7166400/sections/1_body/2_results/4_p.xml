<p>On the S region, a significant (

For the sequences in clade II, on the 536th aminoacidic position in the Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is an asparagine residue instead of an aspartic acid residue, whereas, on the 644th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a threonine residue instead of an alanine residue. A significant (
