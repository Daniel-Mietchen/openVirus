<p>Regarding the FUBAR analysis performed on the N Region, significant (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) pervasive episodic selection was found in two sites (380th and 410th nucleotide position using the reference sequence; Wuhan seafood market pneumonia virus isolate labeled Wuhan‐Hu‐1 MN908947.3). On the 380th aminoacidic position in the Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a glutamine residue instead of an asparagine residue, whereas on the 410th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a threonine residue instead of an alanine residue. A significant (

Concerning the sequences in clade II, on the 409th aminoacidic position in the Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is glutamine instead of an asparagine residue, whereas, on the 380th aminoacidic position in Wuhan coronavirus sequence, there is a threonine residue instead of an alanine. A significant (
