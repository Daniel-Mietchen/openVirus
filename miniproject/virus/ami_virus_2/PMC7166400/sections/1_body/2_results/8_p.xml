<p>Regarding the sites under positive selective pressure found on the spike glycoprotein, the results have shown that the 536th aminoacidic position in 2019‐nCoV has an asparagine residue, whereas the bat SARS‐like coronavirus has a glutamine residue. The SARS virus, instead, has an aspartic acid residue. On the 644th aminoacidic position in 2019‐nCoV sequence, there is a threonine residue, whereas the bat SARS‐like virus has a serine residue. The SARS virus, however, has an alanine residue.</p>
