<p>The further structural and molecular analysis of the Nucleocapsid region of the 2019‐nCoV (MN908947.3) has highlighted that 2019‐nCoV and the bat SARS‐like coronavirus (MG772934.) share the same aminoacidic sequence near the 309th position (SKQLQQ,) whereas the SARS reference genome has a different aminoacidic sequence (SRQLQN). The same results have been found in the 380th aminoacidic position (KADET for 2019‐nCoV and bat SARS‐like coronavirus and KTDEA for the SARS reference genome). In particular, in this case, the 2019‐nCoV has a polar amino acid, whereas the SARS has a nonpolar amino acid (Figure
