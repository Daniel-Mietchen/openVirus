<p>The N region of the 2019‐nCoV homology model has been built using a SARS coronavirus nucleocapsid protein structure (2jw8.1) as the statistical test has shown that this is the most stable and similar model among the other possible structures (Ramachandran favored 90.52%, GMQE 0.17, QMEAN −2.43), whereas, for the S region, the 2019‐nCoV homology model has been built using a SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein (6acc.1) for the same reason (Ramachandran favored 87.87%, GMQE 0.83, QMEAN −3.14) (Figure
