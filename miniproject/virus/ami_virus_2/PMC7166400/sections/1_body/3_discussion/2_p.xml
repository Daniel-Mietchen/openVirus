<p>The data reported above show that the new 2019‐nCoV significantly clustered with a sequence from the bat SARS‐like coronavirus isolated in 2015. Moreover, in the phylogenetic tree, these two sequences are separated from the other bat SARS‐like coronavirus sequences, suggesting that this bat SARS‐like coronavirus is homologous and genetically more similar to the 2019‐nCoV than to the other sequences of Bat SARS‐like coronavirus. This supports the hypothesis that the transmission chain began from the bat and reached the human. All other genomic sequences represented in the phylogenetic tree, also including SARS and MERS coronavirus, clustered separately, thus excluding the fact that the virus involved in the actual epidemic could belong to these subgenuses. The structural analysis of two important viral proteins, the nucleocapsid and the spike‐like nucleoprotein (protein S), confirmed the significant similarity of the new coronavirus with the bat‐like SARS coronavirus and its difference from SARS coronavirus.</p>
