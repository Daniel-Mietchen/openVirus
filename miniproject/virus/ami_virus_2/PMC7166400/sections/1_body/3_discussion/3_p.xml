<p>From the selective pressure and structural analysis, mutations of surface proteins, as the spike protein S, and of nucleocapsid N protein conferring stability to the viral particle have been shown. The viral spike protein is responsible for virus entry into the cell after by binding to a cell receptor and membrane fusion, two key steps in viral infection and pathogenesis. The N protein is a structural protein involved in virion assembly, playing a pivotal role in virus transcription and assembly efficiency. Mutation of these proteins could determine two important characteristics of the coronavirus isolated during the 2019‐nCoV epidemic: a higher ability to infect and enhanced pathogenicity than the bat‐like SARS coronavirus but lower pathogenicity than SARS coronavirus. These features can explain the 2019‐nCoV zoonotic transmission and its initial lower severity than SARS epidemic. These results do not exclude the fact that further mutation due to positive selective pressure, led by the epidemic evolution, could favor an enhancement of pathogenicity and transmission of this novel virus.</p>
