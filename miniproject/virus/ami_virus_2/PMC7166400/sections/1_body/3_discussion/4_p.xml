 </xref> described homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of 2019‐nCoV favoring cross‐species transmission and suggested snake as probable virus reservoir for human infection because its resampling similarity codon usage bias is more similar to 
 <italic>Bungarus multicinctus</italic> snake compared with other animals and humans. In a previous article, it has been proven that compositional properties, mutation pressure, natural selection, gene expression, and dinucleotides, affect the codon usage bias of 
 <italic>Bungarus</italic> species.
