<p>Maximum likelihood (ML) methods were employed for the analyses because they allow for testing different phylogenetic hypotheses by calculating the probability of a given model of evolution generating the observed data and by comparing the probabilities of nested models by the likelihood ratio test. The best‐fitting nucleotide substitution model was chosen by jModeltest software.
