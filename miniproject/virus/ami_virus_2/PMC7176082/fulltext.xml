In Bhutan, first outbreak of dengue fever (DF) was reported in 2004 in a southern border town, followed by sporadic cases over the years. In this study, we analysed DF outbreaks that occurred in 3 different places during the years 2016 and 2017. A total of 533 cases in 2016 and 163 in 2017 were suspected of having of DF, where young adults were mostly affected. A total of 240 acute serum specimens collected and analyzed for serotype by nested RT-PCR revealed predominance of serotypes 1 and 2 (DENV-1 and 2). Phylogenetic analysis using envelope gene for both the serotypes demonstrated cosmopolitan genotype which were closely related to strains from India, indicating that they were probably imported from the neighboring country over the past few years.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Endemicity of DENV in some places of southern Bhutan has been established previously.

Infection by a particular serotype confers long-lasting homotypic immunity to that serotype, but only leads to transient cross-protective immunity to a different serotype. Heterotypic antibodies often lead to dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), the severe forms of dengue [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>DF continues to be one of the most common vector borne diseases in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

E gene sequencing with acute serum samples and virus isolates was performed by either of the two methods- the capillary-based Sanger sequencing at AITbiotech Pvt Ltd. using DENV specific primers following the method previously described [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) (Illumina MiSeq) using random primers and TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, USA) [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For Sanger sequencing, E gene fragment was amplified under the following thermocycler conditions; 48&#x000b0;C for 45 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 20 sec, 50&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min and 1 cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 7 min. For NGS, the DNA fragments were amplified during DNA library preparation under the following thermocycler conditions; 98&#x000b0;C for 10 sec, followed by 15 cycles of 98&#x000b0;C for 10 sec, 60&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, 72<sup>o</sup>c for 30 sec, and 1 cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 5 min.

Geographically, Bhutan is a mountainous country with most part of the country falling at an average height of 8000 ft above sea level. Nevertheless, incursion of tropical diseases into the low-lying areas in south have been noted in recent years [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. As pointed out by studies, urbanization, globalization and lack of effective vector control, have probably contributed to the increasing epidemics of dengue and other tropical diseases in otherwise a low-risk country [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Here we are reporting outbreaks of DF from 3 places in southern Bhutan- Phuntsholing town under Chukha district (2016), and the main towns of Samtse and Samdrup Jongkhar districts (2017). This is also the first DF outbreak reported from Samdrup Jongkhar district. These 3 outbreaks occurred during the summer months of June-September of 2016 and 2017, as has been the case in past years [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Hot and humid climatic conditions during these months in the southern regions of Bhutan could also have contributed to dengue epidemics. Age groups affected during the 2016 and 2017 outbreaks were similar to those of previous outbreaks. High number of adults being affected is consistent with findings from studies in other countries where adults were found more likely to have clinical dengue than young children [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In Bhutan, this observation may also suggest that presence of dengue na&#x000ef;ve individuals in the adult Bhutanese population, since these recent outbreaks were reported in places were dengue was either not previously or recently reported.</p><p>During the outbreaks of 2016 and 2017, we found DENV-1 as the predominating serotype circulating in the country followed by DENV-2. DENV-1 was first detected in Bhutan in 2006 and DENV-2 in 2004 [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, DENV-3 was the predominating serotype during 2004 outbreak and DENV-2 in subsequent years (2005&#x02013;06). There was no surveillance conducted during the years 2007&#x02013;2012, and hence we have no information on dengue virology for these years. In 2013 and 2014, DENV-1 was the predominating serotype [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. DENV-1 E gene sequences of 2016 and 2017 fell under genotype V, also known as the cosmopolitan genotype, the same genotype detected in 2013 and 2014. However, in this study Bhutanese DENV-1 isolates from Phuntsholing in 2016 and one isolate from Samtse in 2017 were located in the Indian clade VI which was closely related with the viruses that circulated in India in 2003 and 2006, but different from the Indian clade IX found in Bhutan in 2013. Meanwhile, most of the Bhutanese DENV-1 isolates from Samdrup Jongkhar in 2017 were grouped with the Indian clade IX that was the same clade previously found in Bhutan in 2013, and closely related to the viruses that circulated in India during 2015&#x02013;2016. Without proper dengue surveillance, we can only speculate that the two distinct clades of DENV-1 genotype V found in 2016 and 2017 were rather imported from India, where they persist. The Indian clade IX could have been imported to Phuntsholing in 2013 and later to Samdrup Jongkhar in 2017, while the Indian clade VI was first imported to Phuntsholing in 2016 and later found in Samtse in 2017.</p><p>DENV-2 E gene sequences from Bhutan grouped with the cosmopolitan genotype, the same genotype as previous sequences found in 2007 in Bhutan. Within this genotype, sequences from the recent and past outbreaks grouped separately in clades. There is no information on sequences of DENV-2 obtained for the years between 2007 and 2016. Nevertheless, based on epidemiology and phylogenetic tree, it is likely that the strains for both the outbreaks were imported across the border.</p><p>Genotypes of DENV-1 (genotype V) and DENV-2 (cosmopolitan genotype) circulating in Bhutan were found different from the DENV-1 (genotype I) and DENV-2 (Asian I genotype) strains in the components of Dengvaxia vaccine, the first licensed tetravalent dengue vaccine, respectively. Previous study investigating the association between DENV genotypes and level of vaccine efficacy from the two phase III efficacy trials of the Dengvaxia vaccine including CYD14 trail in the Asia-Pacific region and CYD15 trial in Latin America, revealed the various association in each serotype [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Different level of vaccine efficacy against the three DENV-1 genotypes was not found. Among DENV-2 genotypes, the vaccine efficacy against Asian I genotype was significantly lower than that against the American-Asian and Cosmopolitan genotypes. Vaccine efficacy against DENV-4 genotype I was significantly lower than that against genotype II in participants of all ages, but among participants 9&#x02013;16 years of age, the vaccine efficacy were similarly high between the two DENV-4 genotypes. For DENV-3, the association between vaccine efficacy and genotype was still uncertain [<xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Post-licensure research of this vaccine and other vaccines in the future is necessary to enhance understanding of this association. Continued investigation of DENV genetic epidemiology is critical to provide genetic background information of viral populations that would imply the vaccine efficacy, and benefit in providing and/or managing vaccine program in the country. We have several limitations in this study. The surveillance being a passive one, many pertinent demographic and epidemiological data could not be captured. We lack information on the days of infection (DOI) and details of symptoms presented. We were unable to establish the actual laboratory cases of the total suspected cases since due to lack of standard protocol and shortage of test kits for performing either IgM/gG or NS1 tests to screen all the cases. Thus we have no information on seroprevalence of DENV.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The serotype and genotype of DENV isolated during the outbreaks of 2016 and 2017 in Bhutan closely resemble the Indian strains, suggesting that dengue outbreak in 2016 and 2017 was due to DENV imported from neighboring India.

The surveillance may need to be strengthened and stream-lined to have a well-planned study whereby epidemiological and virological data representing different geographic region, age group and other factors are well captured.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008165.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Dataset bearing age, sex, place and year of detection for suspected dengue cases.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008165.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008165.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Laboratory results of samples subjected to PCR.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008165.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008165.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Source modifiers table bearing gene accession numbers of samples subjected to sequencing.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008165.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Butsaya Thaisomboonsuk and Ms. Jindarat Lohachanakul, Department of Virology, AFRIMS for carrying out virus isolation; Dr. Thinley Dorji of Samtse Hospital and Dr. Kezang Dorji of Samdrup Jongkhar Hospital for the support rendered in collecting specimens and data during the outbreaks.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0008165.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>OhAinle</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Balmaseda</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Macalalad</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Tellez</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Zody</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Saborio</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
