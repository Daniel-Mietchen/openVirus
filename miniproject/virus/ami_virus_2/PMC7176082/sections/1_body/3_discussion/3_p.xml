<p>During the outbreaks of 2016 and 2017, we found DENV-1 as the predominating serotype circulating in the country followed by DENV-2. DENV-1 was first detected in Bhutan in 2006 and DENV-2 in 2004 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, DENV-3 was the predominating serotype during 2004 outbreak and DENV-2 in subsequent years (2005–06). There was no surveillance conducted during the years 2007–2012, and hence we have no information on dengue virology for these years. In 2013 and 2014, DENV-1 was the predominating serotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. DENV-1 E gene sequences of 2016 and 2017 fell under genotype V, also known as the cosmopolitan genotype, the same genotype detected in 2013 and 2014. However, in this study Bhutanese DENV-1 isolates from Phuntsholing in 2016 and one isolate from Samtse in 2017 were located in the Indian clade VI which was closely related with the viruses that circulated in India in 2003 and 2006, but different from the Indian clade IX found in Bhutan in 2013. Meanwhile, most of the Bhutanese DENV-1 isolates from Samdrup Jongkhar in 2017 were grouped with the Indian clade IX that was the same clade previously found in Bhutan in 2013, and closely related to the viruses that circulated in India during 2015–2016. Without proper dengue surveillance, we can only speculate that the two distinct clades of DENV-1 genotype V found in 2016 and 2017 were rather imported from India, where they persist. The Indian clade IX could have been imported to Phuntsholing in 2013 and later to Samdrup Jongkhar in 2017, while the Indian clade VI was first imported to Phuntsholing in 2016 and later found in Samtse in 2017.
