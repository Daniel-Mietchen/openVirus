<p>DENV-2 E gene sequences from Bhutan grouped with the cosmopolitan genotype, the same genotype as previous sequences found in 2007 in Bhutan. Within this genotype, sequences from the recent and past outbreaks grouped separately in clades. There is no information on sequences of DENV-2 obtained for the years between 2007 and 2016. Nevertheless, based on epidemiology and phylogenetic tree, it is likely that the strains for both the outbreaks were imported across the border.</p>
