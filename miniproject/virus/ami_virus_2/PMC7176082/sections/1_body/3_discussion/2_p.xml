<p>Here we are reporting outbreaks of DF from 3 places in southern Bhutan- Phuntsholing town under Chukha district (2016), and the main towns of Samtse and Samdrup Jongkhar districts (2017). This is also the first DF outbreak reported from Samdrup Jongkhar district. These 3 outbreaks occurred during the summer months of June-September of 2016 and 2017, as has been the case in past years [

Age groups affected during the 2016 and 2017 outbreaks were similar to those of previous outbreaks. High number of adults being affected is consistent with findings from studies in other countries where adults were found more likely to have clinical dengue than young children [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In Bhutan, this observation may also suggest that presence of dengue na√Øve individuals in the adult Bhutanese population, since these recent outbreaks were reported in places were dengue was either not previously or recently reported.
