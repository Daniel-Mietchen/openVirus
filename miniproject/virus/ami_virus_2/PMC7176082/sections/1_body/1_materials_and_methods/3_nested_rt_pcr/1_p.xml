 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. One step RT-PCR was carried out using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and AmpliTaq DNA polymerse (Life Technologies, USA) in the first round PCR. Nested PCR was performed using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase in the second round PCR.
