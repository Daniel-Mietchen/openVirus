<p>Isolation of DENV was carried out with only the DENV nested RT-PCR positive acute serum samples from which the envelope gene sequences were not obtained directly. Virus isolation was performed to amplify viruses in samples with low viral load and facilitate sequencing. Specimens were inoculated into freshly prepared monolayers of C6/36 cells grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, GIBCO) containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS), 1% Glutamine and 1% Penicillin and streptomycin. These cultures were maintained in maintenance medium (MM) containing RPMI with 5% HIFBS. A mock-infected C6/36 cell flask was included as a negative control. Cells underwent 3 passages and were observed for cytopathic effect (CPE). Identification of DENV serotypes was carried out by antigen capture ELISA as previously described [
