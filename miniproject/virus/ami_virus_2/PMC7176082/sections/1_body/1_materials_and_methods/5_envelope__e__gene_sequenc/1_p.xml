<p>Based on their volume adequacy, the DENV nested RT-PCR positive samples were selected for E gene sequencing. The first attempt was to obtain the full length of DENV E gene sequences directly from the DENV nested RT-PCR positive serum samples. The positive serum samples from which E gene sequences could not obtained directly were subjected for virus isolation. The obtained DENV isolates were used for E gene sequencing. E gene sequencing with acute serum samples and virus isolates was performed by either of the two methods- the capillary-based Sanger sequencing at AITbiotech Pvt Ltd. using DENV specific primers following the method previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) (Illumina MiSeq) using random primers and TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, USA) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For Sanger sequencing, E gene fragment was amplified under the following thermocycler conditions; 48°C for 45 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 20 sec, 50°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 1 min and 1 cycle of 72°C for 7 min. For NGS, the DNA fragments were amplified during DNA library preparation under the following thermocycler conditions; 98°C for 10 sec, followed by 15 cycles of 98°C for 10 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, 72
 <sup>o</sup>c for 30 sec, and 1 cycle of 72°C for 5 min. Consensus sequences were generated by using Sequencher software (Gene Code Corp., USA) and ngs/mapper v1.2.4. [a Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Viral Disease Branch (WRAIR VBD) bioinformatics in-house developed software]. The GenBank accession numbers of E gene sequences obtained from this study are MK651217-MK651236.
