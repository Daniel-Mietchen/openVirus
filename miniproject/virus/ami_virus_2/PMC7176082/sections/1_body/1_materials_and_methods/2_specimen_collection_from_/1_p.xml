 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Acute blood specimens were collected from clinically suspected cases of DF in district hospitals of Phuntsholing, Samtse and Samdrup Jongkhar. A commercial rapid immunochromatographic test kit, SD BIOLINE Dengue IgG/IgM (Catalogue no. 11FK10) was used for initial confirmation of DENV infection. Samples that tested positive by rapid method, along with samples from clinically suspected cases were sent to RCDC to determine the infecting serotype by nested RT-PCR. Acute serum samples positive by nested RT-PCR were further sent to AFRIMS for investigation (
