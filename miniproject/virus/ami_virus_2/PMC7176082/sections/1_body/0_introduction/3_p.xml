<p>Bhutan is a land-locked Himalayan country lying at a height ranging from about 300 to 25,000 ft above sea level, It borders India to the east, west and south; and Tibet, China’s autonomous region to the north. India, Bhutan’s closest neighbor, reported dengue as early as 1946, and continues to exhibit a complex epidemiology with co-circulation of all 4 serotypes [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> were prevalent in all the seven southern districts, dengue remained endemic in the town of Phuntsholing and its nearby locality only [
