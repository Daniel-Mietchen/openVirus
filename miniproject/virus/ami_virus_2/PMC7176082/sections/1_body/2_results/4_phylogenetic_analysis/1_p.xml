<p>The genotypes and clades of DENV circulating in Bhutan since 2004 to 2017 are summarized in in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008165.s003">S3 Table</xref>. ML tree for DENV-1 E gene was generated using 731 E gene sequences (1,485 bp), which included 15 sequences from Bhutan obtained during this study (red bold), 33 sequences obtained from previous studies in Bhutan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (blue), 680 global sequences (black), and 3 vaccine strain sequences including Dengvaxia, TetraVax-DV, and DENVax (black bold italics) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008165.g004">Fig 4</xref>). 680 global sequences used in this analysis included sequences from India previously analyzed by Dash et al., 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and sequences with known DENV-1 genotypes from other countries randomly selected from the data available in GenBank on 8
 <sup>th</sup> November 2018. All 15 new DENV-1 and 33 previous sequences from Bhutan belong to genotype V, as per the classification by Weaver et al, 2009 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Within genotype V, the recent 2016/2017 Bhutan DENV sequences grouped separately into 2 clades. All of the sequences (9/9) from Phuntsholing, obtained in August 2016 and one sequence (1/1) from Samtse, obtained in July 2017 fell in Indian clade VI while five sequences (5/5), obtained in the month of July, 2017 fell in clade IX as per classification by Dash et. al. 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. None of the vaccine strain sequences included in our phylogenetic tree fell within the same group as the Bhutan DENV-1.
