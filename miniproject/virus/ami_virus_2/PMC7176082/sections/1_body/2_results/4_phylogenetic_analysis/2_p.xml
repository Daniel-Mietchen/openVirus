<p>Similarly, ML tree generated for DENV-2 E gene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008165.g005">Fig 5</xref>) using 5 new sequences obtained from this study (red bold), 2 sequences obtained from a previous study in Bhutan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] (blue), 165 global sequences (black), and 3 vaccine strain sequences that include Dengvaxia, TDEN, and DENVax (black bold italics) obtained from GenBank. 165 global sequences used in this analysis include sequences from India and sequences with known DENV-2 genotypes from other countries randomly selected from data available in GenBank as on 8
 <sup>th</sup> November 2018. All new sequences from Bhutan belong to the 
 <italic>Cosmopolitan</italic> genotype as was the case in Bhutan in 2007 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008165.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and is closely related to sequences from India, 2015. Sequences obtained from the recent and past outbreaks were found to group in a separate clade.
