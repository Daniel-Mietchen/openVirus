<p>Among DENV nested RT-PCR positive acute serum samples with adequate volume available, 15 DENV-1 and 15 DENV-2 were selected for sequencing. We were able to obtain E gene sequences directly from all 15 DENV-1 serum samples but not from DENV-2 serum samples. To obtain E gene sequences from DENV-2 serum samples, the 15 DENV-2 samples were subjected for virus isolation. Only 5 DENV-2 were successfully isolated and used for E gene sequencing. We were able to obtain E gene sequences from all 5 DENV-2 isolates.</p>
