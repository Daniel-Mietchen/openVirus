<p id="par0085">In this study, conducted in children admitted for CAP, we observed a lower use of antibiotics in those with an early detection of RSV in a respiratory sample. Similarly, we observed a shorter duration of antibiotic therapy in those in whom RSV or influenza was detected. However, no differences were found with the detection of other respiratory viruses. The lack of impact of the identification of other respiratory viruses in antibiotic therapy may be due to excessive time until the result is obtained.</p>
