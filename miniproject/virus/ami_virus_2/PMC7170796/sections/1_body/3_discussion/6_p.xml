<p id="par0110">The limitations of the study are its retrospective nature and the difficult assessment of the detection of respiratory viruses to differentiate infection colonisation in this population. In addition, the insufficient statistical power due to the small sample size precludes the demonstration of significant differences in several comparisons made. As advantages, we would highlight the use of strict inclusion criteria that allow increasing sensitivity in the detection of respiratory viruses, together with specific radiological criteria. Additionally, the non-interventionist methodology followed allows the evaluation of the use of these techniques in routine clinical practice.</p>
