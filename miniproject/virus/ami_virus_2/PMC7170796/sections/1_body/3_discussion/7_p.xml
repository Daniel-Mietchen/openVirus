<p id="par0115">In conclusion, the use of respiratory virus diagnostic techniques in our setting can optimise the use of antibiotics in children admitted with CAP. The decrease in the execution times of the mPCR panels could offer an additional benefit, by allowing the duration of antibiotic therapy to be shortened. Moreover, the use of predictive models, which take into account the detection of respiratory viruses along with clinical and analytical parameters, could improve the identification of children with CAP in whom the use of antibiotics can be safely dispensed with.</p>
