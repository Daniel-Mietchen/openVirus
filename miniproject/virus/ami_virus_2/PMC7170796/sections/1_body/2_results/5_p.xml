 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the start of empirical antibiotic therapy according to the detection of RSV or influenza by TDR and the subsequent start during hospitalisation in cases where it was not empirically initiated. 55.9 and 57.9% of pneumonias with RSV or influenza detection by TDR, respectively, of the total CAPs with TDR, received no antibiotic therapy. 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> compares the characteristics, including initiation of antibiotic therapy and its duration, in the different groups according to the identification of different respiratory viruses. There is a notable decrease in the start of antibiotic therapy in cases with RSV detection as compared to those that were not detected (35.1% vs. 55.9%, OR: 0.43 [95% CI: 0.19–0.98];
