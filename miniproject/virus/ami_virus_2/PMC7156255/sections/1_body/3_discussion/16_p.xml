<p>The main limitation of this study is that the surveillance data may have contained a poor diagnostic classification in reports, possibly due to the rapid emergence of arboviruses and similarity in the symptoms when defining the diagnoses according to clinical epidemiological criteria. Simultaneous circulation of the three arboviruses was a factor that may have compromised the investigation of some of the diseases and led to more intense investigation of others. Since most cases were asymptomatic, we considered that a substantially lower number of cases might have been reported. It is likely that diagnostic cross-classification errors occurred during the simultaneous triple epidemic, but it is difficult to evaluate the magnitude of such bias. It might be that the cross-diagnosis brings the specific spatial diffusion patterns close to that observed for Dengue. This would obscure specific characteristics that might happen for Zika and Chikungunya.</p>
