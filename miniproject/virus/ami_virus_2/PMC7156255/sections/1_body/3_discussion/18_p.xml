<p>Our study of the spatial diffusion of Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue arboviruses in in Salvador-Bahia, in the period of triple epidemics between 2015 and 2016, enabled an identification of the propagation process of these arboviruses, indicating that the diffusion pattern of the Zika fever epidemics was the same as that of the Dengue and Chikungunya fever epidemics. During the two years of study, these diseases spread through diffusion expansion. This knowledge on how and where arboviruses spread in Salvador in a triple epidemic situation provides important information for improving epidemiological surveillance, both in terms of monitoring cases and in terms of targeting interventions for disease control.</p>
