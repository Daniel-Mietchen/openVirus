<p>The regression curve that best fit the R curves was the S-curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), with R
 <sup>2</sup> 0.94;0.95 (Zika fever), R
 <sup>2</sup> 0.99;0.98 (Chikungunya fever), and R
 <sup>2</sup> 0.93;0.99 (Dengue fever) in 2015 and 2016, respectively; therefore, showing a process of diffusion through expansion.
