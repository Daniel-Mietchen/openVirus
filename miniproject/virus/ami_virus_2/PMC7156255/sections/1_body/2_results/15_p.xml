<p>In the analysis of LISA changes, LISA values ​​were generated with reference to periods of three EWs, for each of the 160 neighborhoods within the Salvador municipality. Analyzing the changes in these values, 19 of 1,280 LISA changes were significant for Zika fever in 2015 and 34 of 2,400 LISA changes were significant for Zika fever in 2016. The local autocorrelation changes characteristic of expansion diffusion[14] were predominant in 2015 and hierarchical diffusion[20] in 2016. Relocation diffusion was considered likely here, along with hierarchical diffusion, due to similarity in the characteristics of the processes that occurred in jumps.</p>
