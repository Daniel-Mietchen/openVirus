<p>In the most commonly used classification, it is stated that spatial diffusion can occur through four phenomena. The first is expansion, in which the phenomenon propagates from one place to the other, often intensifying in the region of origin. The second phenomenon is relocation, when the phenomenon propagates to new localities but when moving, leaves the areas where it originated. The third is contagion, dependent on direct contact and, therefore, strongly influenced according to distance (individuals in nearby regions have a much higher probability of contact than individuals in distant regions). Lastly, a hierarchical phenomenon is characterized by the occurrence of diffusion respecting an ordered sequence of classes or places, as from a large metropolitan center to remote villages
