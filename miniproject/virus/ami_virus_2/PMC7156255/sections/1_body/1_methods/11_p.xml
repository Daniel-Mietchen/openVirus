<p>In the modeling of the NNI, the ratio of the nearest neighbor, or R, is calculated by dividing the mean of the distances of the nearest points in a point pattern by the average of the distances of a random distribution of the same number of points in the same area. R is calculated cumulatively whenever a new case is diagnosed. The Rs are presented as a function of time and modeled with a set of regression curves to find the one that best fits the distribution. The results were interpreted according to Lee et al. (2014)
