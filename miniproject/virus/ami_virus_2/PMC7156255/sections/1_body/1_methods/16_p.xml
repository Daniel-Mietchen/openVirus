<p>The values ​​of a variable for a location and its neighboring areas provide the most basic representation of local spatial associations. Each Local-Neighbor (LN) pair consists of standardized levels of a variable in the local spatial unit L and in neighboring spatial units N. Each element of the pair is low (L) or high (H) relative to the local and neighbor value distributions in all observations
