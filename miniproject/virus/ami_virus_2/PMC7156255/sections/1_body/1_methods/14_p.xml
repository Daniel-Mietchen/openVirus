 </xref>, in which a propagation by contagion model is considered when the correlogram shows a tendency to autocorrelation in a soft decline, pointing to distance as a principal factor in determining the similarity of incidence rates. A hierarchical diffusion is suggested when the trajectory decreases and then rises, forming a V-shaped curve, indicating that distant areas show similarity in rates and that the diffusion then occurs in jumps.
