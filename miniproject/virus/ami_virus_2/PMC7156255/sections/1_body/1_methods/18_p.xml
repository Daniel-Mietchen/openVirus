 </xref> suggested analyzing changes in local-neighbor pair levels over time, looking for evidence of diffusion that involves the propagation of high rates (or low rates) to other spatial units. The authors claimed that the types of pair changes in successive periods were compatible with a different type of diffusion, and allowed for a determination of the mechanisms behind the change corresponded to each type of diffusion.
