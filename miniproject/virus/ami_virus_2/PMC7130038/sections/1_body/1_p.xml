 </xref> Once the virus infects humans it can evolve into strains not previously identified. Recently, the first case of a new type of coronavirus, causing pneumonia, was found in December 2019 and linked to the largest seafood market in Wuhan (China). This novel coronavirus has been designated as 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, as determined by sequencing the viral RNA genome. Many patients were exposed to the seafood market to several potential wildlife animals acting as reservoirs, such as poultry, snakes, bats, and other farm animals. The sequence analysis and the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) bias among different known coronaviruses suggest that 2019-nCoV is a recombinant virus between a bat coronavirus and another unknown coronavirus. The recombination between the two species of viruses occurred within the viral spike glycoprotein which recognizes cell surface receptors. Additionally, the findings suggest that snake is the most probable wildlife reservoir for the 2019-nCoV based on the RSCU bias resembling snake compared to other animals.

 </xref> It should be noted that this is a preliminary result and other phylogenetic analyses are being conducted. Peridomestic animals may serve as intermediate hosts, facilitating the recombination of the virus, and serving as amplification hosts.
