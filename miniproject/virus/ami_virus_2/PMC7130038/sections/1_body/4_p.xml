 </xref> The use of "platform technology", a system that uses the same basic components as a backbone, can be adapted for use against different pathogens as needed by inserting new genetic or protein sequences. Another technology used for vaccines is called "molecular clamp". Enveloped viruses, like influenza, have antigenic proteins in their surface- although the proteins can elicit an immunological response, they are unstable. One approach to vaccine design is to synthesize these surface proteins while "clamping" them into a stable shape, making it easier for the immune system to induce a response. This synthetic antigen can be purified and rapidly manufactured into a vaccine, within 16 weeks from pathogen identification.
