<p id="par0020">A preliminary analysis of 41 patients with laboratory-confirmed 2019-nCoV showed that most were men, less than half had an underlying condition with a median age of 49 years. Common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever, dry cough, and myalgia or fatigue. However, some patients can be asymptomatic and/or afebrile and can still spread the infection. This was the same seen in the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic that started in Mexico and the United States. Dyspnea developed in half of the patients with a median time to develop of 8.0 days. All patients had abnormal findings on chest CT, showing bilateral multiple lobar, and subsegmental areas of consolidation. Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome in 29%, acute cardiac injury (12%), and secondary infections (12%). One-third of patients required ICU admission and six (15%) died.

 </xref> Due to the high production of cytokines induced by coronaviruses, corticosteroids have been used to reduce inflammatory lung injury. However, current evidence shows that patients receiving corticosteroids did not have benefit, and had a delayed viral clearance. Since 2019-nCoV is an emerging virus, it is not known whether drugs used for MERS-CoV
