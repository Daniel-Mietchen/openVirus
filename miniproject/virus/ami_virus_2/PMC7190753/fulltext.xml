The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of cattle vaccination 7 and 14&#x000a0;days prior challenge using a vaccine commonly applied in systematic vaccination campaigns against transmission of FMD virus (FMDV). Transmission of FMDV was investigated in three groups of ten cattle each: one non-vaccinated group and two groups that were either vaccinated 7&#x000a0;days (&#x02212;7/vaccinated group) or 14&#x000a0;days (&#x02212;14/vaccinated group) before intranasal (IN) inoculation. Five cattle heads from each group were inoculated using the IN-route with the A/Argentina/2001 FMDV strain, while the remaining five cattle heads of each group were contact-exposed to inoculated cattle. Clinical signs were recorded; virus isolation and genome detection by RT-PCR were carried out on oesophageal&#x02013;pharyngeal fluid (OPF) and blood. Neutralizing antibody titers and antibodies against non-structural proteins (NSP) of FMDV were also determined. Results suggest that the experimental design, virus challenge dose, and virus infectivity were appropriate and that the virus had been transmitted to na&#x000ef;ve calves. Under the outlined experimental conditions, vaccination 7 and 14&#x000a0;days prior to challenge induced full clinical protection against virus inoculation. Moreover, &#x02212;7/ or &#x02212;14/vaccinated calves that had been contact-exposed to &#x02212;7/ or &#x02212;14/vaccinated IN-challenged calves, did not become infected. Consequently, no virus transmission occurred from vaccinated and subsequently infected calves to cohabitating vaccinated calves (R&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0). According to our results, early vaccination during an outbreak is effective as virus transmission can be significantly reduced using a vaccine commercially available, routinely applied in systematic vaccination campaigns.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kg005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Foot-and-mouth disease</kwd><kwd>Vaccination</kwd><kwd>Cattle</kwd><kwd>Virus transmission</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals and considered the socioeconomic most important disease of livestock. The maintenance of the FMD-free status is a challenging task for countries free of FMD without and with vaccination. Introduction of FMDV into several FMD-free countries where vaccination is not practised caused severe epidemics (United Kingdom 2001, South Korea 2000&#x02013;2002, among others). However, also FMD-free countries where vaccination is practised, such as Argentina (2006), Brazil (2005), Paraguay (2011), Colombia (2009&#x02013;2017&#x02013;2018), Republic of Korea (2010, 2014) and others, have experienced the introduction of FMDV <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Thus, measures to avoid introduction of FMDV and exposure of susceptible animals as well as establishment of early detection systems and contingency plans are needed to control and prevent outbreak of FMD.</p><p id="p0010">The last FMD outbreak in Argentina was recorded in 2006 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and currently the whole country holds the FMD-free status. Argentina and other South American countries achieved FMD eradication through control strategies essentially based on systematic and mandatory vaccination of cattle. Although the overall cattle population has a high level of population immunity, highly susceptible groups of animals do exist such as calves with failure of passive immune transfer and/or a not yet developed immunity (i.e. calves that have not yet been vaccinated, or those that showed a poor response to vaccination, etc.).</p><p id="p0015">Immediate vaccination of most susceptible and epidemiologically relevant animals is a decisive part of control measures to eliminate the virus in case of FMD-re-entry, if &#x0201c;vaccination to live&#x0201d; policy is followed. The effect of vaccination on an animal involves three aspects: (i) induction of protection against the disease (individual immunity), (ii) reduction of susceptibility of an individual animal (reduced infection risk), and (iii) reduction of infectivity or horizontal transmission within a herd (herd immunity) <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. It is of particular importance to understand the effect of emergency vaccination on the reduction of virus transmission.</p><p id="p0020">The transmission of FMDV between susceptible species at a small-scale such as experimental studies and at higher-scales such as between farms, countries and regions has recently been reviewed <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The current contingency plan of Argentina foresees that in case of an FMD-outbreak through reintroduction of strains against which the current vaccine strains are effective, a commercially available polyvalent immunogen will be applied. Accordingly, in an event of disseminated outbreak, FMD-free countries in which vaccination is not practiced may consider to acquire an important volume of doses from countries that have stocks of ready-to-use vaccines <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p id="p0025">The effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent virus transmission within a vaccinated population is determined best in homogeneous groups. This implies that all animals in a group should either all be vaccinated or all be unvaccinated <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of cattle vaccination 7 and 14&#x000a0;days prior challenge using a commercial vaccine on the transmission of FMDV. In this study, we set out to test the suitability of a commercially available polyvalent vaccine, routinely used for systematic vaccination campaigns, to reduce virus transmission between vaccinated cattle.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Animals and experimental design</title><p id="p0030">Thirty na&#x000ef;ve Holando-Argentino breed male calves with an average age of 216&#x000a0;days (range 210&#x02013;225) and an average weight of 205&#x000a0;kg, were used.

Previous studies in cattle determined the effectiveness of vaccination in inducing early protection <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Correspondingly, in our study, calves vaccinated either 7 or 14&#x000a0;days prior to IN-inoculation were protected against clinical disease. Previous experiments also showed the capacity of vaccination in reducing virus transmission in cattle <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p id="p0165">The aim of our study was to provide additional data on FMDV transmission among non-vaccinated and vaccinated calves using a regular commercially available vaccine applied in vaccination campaigns.</p><p id="p0170">As expected, IN-inoculation of non-vaccinated calves with FMDV induced clinical disease, shedding of FMDV, viremia, seroconversion to NSP, and generation of neutralizing antibodies indicating successful inoculation. During the FMD outbreak in Argentina in 2001, the A/Argentina/2001 strain showed a high transmissibility within and between herds, and was therefore used in this study for challenge. As infection parameters demonstrated, IN-inoculated calves transmitted the virus to cohabitating na&#x000ef;ve calves (R&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x0221e;).</p><p id="p0175">Duration of genome excretion in OPF was similar between IN-challenged groups of non-vaccinated, &#x02212;7/, and &#x02212;14/vaccinated calves, demonstrating the very high virus challenge doses applied in our experiment. In comparison to virus isolation, duration of genome detection in non-vaccinated animals was longer in the IN-challenged than in the contact-exposed group, which may be explained by the higher sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay as compared to virus isolation. In overall, these data demonstrate that the experimental design, challenge virus dose and virus infectivity were appropriate and that virus transmission from na&#x000ef;ve IN-challenged calves to na&#x000ef;ve calves took place.</p><p id="p0180">One animal of the &#x02212;7/vaccinated IN-challenged group (#728) showed at 28 dpi virus detection in OPF and became &#x0201c;carrier&#x0201d;. This situation is not unexpected as vaccination protects against clinical signs, and a proportion of animals may remain subclinically infected and turn into carriers <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p id="p0185">The detection of viremia and viral genome in a single vaccinated calf (#729, from the &#x02212;14/vaccinated IN challenged group) has been suggestive for low virus replication that did not lead to dissemination and development of vesicles in epithelial areas. This finding may be explained by the fact that the animal #729 showed the lowest neutralizing titer of this group on the day of challenge (data not shown). Previous studies did not find virus in the blood of vaccinated inoculated cattle, even in the presence of virus or virus genome in OPF samples <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This difference with regard to our finding may be due to challenge methods, dose of challenge, virulence of the strain of challenge, vaccine potency, among others.</p><p id="p0195">Regarding seroconversion to NSP, it should be pointed out that antibodies to NSP were detected later in IN-challenged vaccinated groups (from 14 dpi) than in the IN-challenged non-vaccinated group (from 9 dpi), along with lower ELISA values, probably due to the effect of vaccination that limit viral replication <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Additionally, no NSP antibodies were detected in animal #727 from &#x02212;7/vaccinated challenged group by NCPanaftosa-Bovine, but it was found positive by PrioCHECK FMDV NS at 28 dpi. This late detection of NSP antibodies in cattle in which virus was isolated from OPF was not unexpected. The discrepancy in the NSP antibody detection between both tests may be explained by the borderline result of this serum (PI value&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;51%) in PrioCHECK FMDV NS that resulted in a nonreactor by NCPanaftosa-Bovine test, frequent finding in samples near the detection limit as the diagnostic sensitivity reported by both tests was similar <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p id="p0200">Under the applied experimental conditions, vaccination 7 or 14&#x000a0;days prior to challenge induced full clinical protection against IN virus inoculation. Moreover, &#x02212;7/ or &#x02212;14/vaccinated calves that had been contact-exposed to-7/ or &#x02212;14/vaccinated IN-inoculated calves, did not become infected. Consequently, no virus transmission occurred from vaccinated and subsequently infected calves to cohabitating vaccinated calves (R&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0).</p><p id="p0205">The registered vaccine in Argentina is composed of 4 vaccine strains, including C3 Indaial, as well as the vaccine authorized in USA and Canada for emergency situation <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Although there were no reports of serotype C in the world since 2004, the authorized vaccine in Argentina requires the inclusion of serotype C since 2006 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Regarding potency, the vaccines manufactured in Argentina are formulated to meet a minimum of 75% of EPP (or minimum of 3 PD50). However, most of the batches released to the market showed &#x0003e;85% of EPP in the potency test in cattle conducted by SENASA <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Additionally, a commercial vaccine similar to the one used in our study has shown early immunity in cattle <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Unlike previous studies in cattle in which high-potency vaccines were used <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, this study used a polyvalent vaccine that is regularly administered in systematic vaccination campaigns in Argentina. This has the added advantage that in case of an epidemic outbreak is faced, the vaccine would be rapidly available in large quantities. In this sense, rolling stocks of ready-to-use polyvalent vaccines have been considered as a feasible vaccine reserve to respond rapidly to outbreaks <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Mostly, FMD free countries have Antigen Banks through contracts with vaccine manufacturing companies. In the case of disseminated outbreaks in high density areas, the number of doses from Antigen Banks may be insufficient, and therefore the use of ready-to-use vaccines from countries that apply such vaccines in their vaccination programs has been proposed <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In agreement with the results presented in this controlled study, field evidence on the effects of vaccination reducing within herd transmission was reported by Brito et al. <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> in which the protective effect of the vaccine was evidenced by the association between vaccination and low rate of within herd transmission.</p><p id="p0210">The full protection and the lack of virus transmission between vaccinated calves at an early stage after vaccination, as observed under the outlined experimental conditions, are key features for effective contingency policies. According to our results, vaccination seems to be a suitable measure to control an outbreak because it has the potential to reduce significantly virus transmission under the premise that the corresponding vaccine is rapidly applied.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0215">We studied the effect of vaccination on the transmission of FMDV in cattle using a commercially available polyvalent vaccine. Our work demonstrated that vaccination 7 and 14&#x000a0;days prior to challenge induced full clinical protection against virus inoculation. Additionally, the vaccinated calves that had been contact-exposed to vaccinated and inoculated calves did not become infected. Thus, no virus transmission occurred from vaccinated and subsequently infected calves to cohabitating vaccinated calves.</p><p id="p0220">According to our results, early vaccination during an outbreak is effective as virus transmission can be significantly reduced using a commercial polyvalent vaccine, routinely used in systematic vaccination campaigns.</p></sec><sec id="s0095"><title>CRediT authorship contribution statement</title><p id="p0225"><bold>Sergio Duffy:</bold> Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing - original draft. <bold>Norberto Fondevila:</bold> Investigation, Methodology. <bold>Sabrina Galdo Novo:</bold> Investigation, Methodology. <bold>Mar&#x000ed;a Aznar:</bold> Data curation, Formal analysis. <bold>Carlos Garro:</bold> Data curation, Formal analysis. <bold>Eliana Smitsaart:</bold> Visualization, Writing - review &#x00026; editing. <bold>Gustavo Monti:</bold> Conceptualization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="p0230">The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Smitsaart E, employee of Biogenesis Bago, declares that its judgment and objectivity was not biased by their contractual condition.
