 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The duration of OPF virus excretion was estimated as the number of days from the first to the last day the virus could be isolated from each animal until day 14 post infection. The mean daily virus detection (MDVD) in OPF was estimated as the average of TCID50%/ml per day in each group for the days the virus was detected. The duration of viral genome detection in OPF was estimated as the number of days from the first to the last day the viral genome was detected by RT-PCR until day 14 post infection. The mean daily viral genome detection (MDVGD) in OPF was estimated as the average per day for the days viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR.
