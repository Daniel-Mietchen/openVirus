<p id="p0095">Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze differences between the three groups. When differences were statistically significant, pairwise comparison between groups were performed (Statistix 8.0©). When a comparison between two groups were required, Wilcoxon rank sum test was applied (Statistix 8.0©). A stochastic susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model was used to estimate the reproduction ratio R by maximum likelihood 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The estimator of R was based on the final size of the outbreak observed in the experiments. R is defined as the average number of new cases of an infection. Comparison between R in non-vaccinated and vaccinated calves was done by testing that R is higher in vaccinated than in non-vaccinated calves (one-tailed test)
