<p id="p0040">One day before challenge, five calves of each group were assigned to be exposed by either intranasal or contact route through a simple randomization process. At the day of challenge, the five animals to be exposed by contact route from the −14/vaccinated, −7/vaccinated and non-vaccinated group were removed from their pens and housed in three other separate rooms. The five animals of each group that remained in the pen were challenged via the intranasal (IN) route.</p>
