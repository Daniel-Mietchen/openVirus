<p id="p0215">We studied the effect of vaccination on the transmission of FMDV in cattle using a commercially available polyvalent vaccine. Our work demonstrated that vaccination 7 and 14Â days prior to challenge induced full clinical protection against virus inoculation. Additionally, the vaccinated calves that had been contact-exposed to vaccinated and inoculated calves did not become infected. Thus, no virus transmission occurred from vaccinated and subsequently infected calves to cohabitating vaccinated calves.</p>
