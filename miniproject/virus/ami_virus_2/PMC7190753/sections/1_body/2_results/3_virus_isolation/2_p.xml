<p id="p0110">Virus in OPF was isolated from all IN-challenged calves with the exception of one calf of the −7/vaccinated group (#715) (

 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Regarding the number of days of virus detection (OPF), pairwise comparisons among groups showed significant differences exclusively between the IN-challenged non-vaccinated and the −7/vaccinated groups (P &lt; 0.05). In addition, the MDVD was significantly different only between the IN-challenged non-vaccinated group (TCID50%/ml = 4.25) and the −7/vaccinated group (TCID50%/ml = 1.95) (P &lt; 0.05;
