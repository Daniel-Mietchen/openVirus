<p id="p0145">Regarding seroconversion to NSP antibodies, all IN-inoculated cattle (with the exception of animal #715 of the −7/vaccinated group) developed NSP antibodies. In non-vaccinated IN-challenged and contact-exposed groups, NSP antibodies were detected from 9 and 14 dpi, respectively, whereas in vaccinated IN-challenged groups, NSP antibodies were detected from 14 dpi. Vaccinated inoculated calves that scored positive showed T/C values between 1 and 2 by NCPanaftosa-Bovine (cut-off value T/C ≥ 1) and PI values between 51 and 69% by PrioCHECK FMD NS (cut-off value PI ≥ 50%), whereas non-vaccinated inoculated calves showed T/C values above 2 by NCPanaftosa-Bovine and PI values above 70% by PrioCHECK FMD NS (data not shown). Noteworthy, of non-vaccinated calves challenged by contact, one calf died at day 11 dpi due to an undetermined cause not related to FMD. None of the contact exposed −14 and −7/vaccinated groups developed detectable antibodies to NSP at any time during the study (
