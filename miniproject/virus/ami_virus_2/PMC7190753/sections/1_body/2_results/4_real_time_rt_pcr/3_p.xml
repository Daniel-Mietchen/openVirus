<p id="p0130">In blood samples, viral genome could be detected from 4 out of 5 IN-challenged calves and contact-exposed calves of the non-vaccinated groups (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Importantly, this result corresponds with the detection of virus in blood sample in 4 out of 5 calves in each non-vaccinated group (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, as in the detection of viremia, the viral genome was detected with delay of one sampling in the in contact-exposed calves regarding the IN-challenged calves. In the non-vaccinated calves, viral genome in blood samples was detected until 7 dpi in the IN-challenged group and until 11 dpi in the contact-exposed calf group.
