In the group of IN-challenged non-vaccinated animals, lesions compatible with FMD were detected in the interdigital space, coronary band, tongue, gums, and nostrils. All animals in this group showed severe lesions in two or more of the above mentioned sites and fever (&gt;40 °C) between 3 and 7 dpi. One of the 5 IN-challenged calves evidenced lesions after 3 dpi and the remaining animals after 5 dpi (data not shown).
