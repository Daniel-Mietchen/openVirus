<p id="p0010">The last FMD outbreak in Argentina was recorded in 2006 
 <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and currently the whole country holds the FMD-free status. Argentina and other South American countries achieved FMD eradication through control strategies essentially based on systematic and mandatory vaccination of cattle. Although the overall cattle population has a high level of population immunity, highly susceptible groups of animals do exist such as calves with failure of passive immune transfer and/or a not yet developed immunity (i.e. calves that have not yet been vaccinated, or those that showed a poor response to vaccination, etc.).
