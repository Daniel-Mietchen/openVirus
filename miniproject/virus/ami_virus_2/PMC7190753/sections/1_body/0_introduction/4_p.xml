<p id="p0015">Immediate vaccination of most susceptible and epidemiologically relevant animals is a decisive part of control measures to eliminate the virus in case of FMD-re-entry, if “vaccination to live” policy is followed. The effect of vaccination on an animal involves three aspects: (i) induction of protection against the disease (individual immunity), (ii) reduction of susceptibility of an individual animal (reduced infection risk), and (iii) reduction of infectivity or horizontal transmission within a herd (herd immunity)
