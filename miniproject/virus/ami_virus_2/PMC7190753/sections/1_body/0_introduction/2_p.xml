<p id="p0005">Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals and considered the socioeconomic most important disease of livestock. The maintenance of the FMD-free status is a challenging task for countries free of FMD without and with vaccination. Introduction of FMDV into several FMD-free countries where vaccination is not practised caused severe epidemics (United Kingdom 2001, South Korea 2000–2002, among others). However, also FMD-free countries where vaccination is practised, such as Argentina (2006), Brazil (2005), Paraguay (2011), Colombia (2009–2017–2018), Republic of Korea (2010, 2014) and others, have experienced the introduction of FMDV
