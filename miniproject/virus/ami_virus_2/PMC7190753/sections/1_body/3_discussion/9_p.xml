<p id="p0200">Under the applied experimental conditions, vaccination 7 or 14 days prior to challenge induced full clinical protection against IN virus inoculation. Moreover, −7/ or −14/vaccinated calves that had been contact-exposed to-7/ or −14/vaccinated IN-inoculated calves, did not become infected. Consequently, no virus transmission occurred from vaccinated and subsequently infected calves to cohabitating vaccinated calves (R = 0).</p>
