<p id="p0175">Duration of genome excretion in OPF was similar between IN-challenged groups of non-vaccinated, −7/, and −14/vaccinated calves, demonstrating the very high virus challenge doses applied in our experiment. In comparison to virus isolation, duration of genome detection in non-vaccinated animals was longer in the IN-challenged than in the contact-exposed group, which may be explained by the higher sensitivity of the RT-PCR assay as compared to virus isolation. In overall, these data demonstrate that the experimental design, challenge virus dose and virus infectivity were appropriate and that virus transmission from naïve IN-challenged calves to naïve calves took place.</p>
