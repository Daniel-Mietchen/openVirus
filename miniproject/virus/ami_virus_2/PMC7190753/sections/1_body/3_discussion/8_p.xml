<p id="p0195">Regarding seroconversion to NSP, it should be pointed out that antibodies to NSP were detected later in IN-challenged vaccinated groups (from 14 dpi) than in the IN-challenged non-vaccinated group (from 9 dpi), along with lower ELISA values, probably due to the effect of vaccination that limit viral replication 
 <xref rid="b0110" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Additionally, no NSP antibodies were detected in animal #727 from −7/vaccinated challenged group by NCPanaftosa-Bovine, but it was found positive by PrioCHECK FMDV NS at 28 dpi. This late detection of NSP antibodies in cattle in which virus was isolated from OPF was not unexpected. The discrepancy in the NSP antibody detection between both tests may be explained by the borderline result of this serum (PI value = 51%) in PrioCHECK FMDV NS that resulted in a nonreactor by NCPanaftosa-Bovine test, frequent finding in samples near the detection limit as the diagnostic sensitivity reported by both tests was similar
