<p id="p0170">As expected, IN-inoculation of non-vaccinated calves with FMDV induced clinical disease, shedding of FMDV, viremia, seroconversion to NSP, and generation of neutralizing antibodies indicating successful inoculation. During the FMD outbreak in Argentina in 2001, the A/Argentina/2001 strain showed a high transmissibility within and between herds, and was therefore used in this study for challenge. As infection parameters demonstrated, IN-inoculated calves transmitted the virus to cohabitating naïve calves (R = ∞).</p>
