<p id="p0185">The detection of viremia and viral genome in a single vaccinated calf (#729, from the âˆ’14/vaccinated IN challenged group) has been suggestive for low virus replication that did not lead to dissemination and development of vesicles in epithelial areas. This finding may be explained by the fact that the animal #729 showed the lowest neutralizing titer of this group on the day of challenge (data not shown). Previous studies did not find virus in the blood of vaccinated inoculated cattle, even in the presence of virus or virus genome in OPF samples
