<p id="para0003">Before initiating either of these strategies, we need to estimate the 
 <italic>basic</italic> reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>), or the more ‘real-life’ 
 <italic>effective</italic> reproductive number (R
 <sub>t</sub>) for a given population. R
 <sub>0</sub> is the number of secondary cases generated by the presence of one infected individual in an otherwise fully susceptible, well-mixed population. R
 <sub>t</sub> is a more practical real-life version of this, which uses real-life data (from diagnostic testing and/or clinical surveillance) to estimate the reproductive number for an ongoing epidemic.
