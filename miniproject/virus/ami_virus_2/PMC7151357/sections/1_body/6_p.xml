<p id="para0007">Exploring these parameters and their implications further, the difference between R
 <sub>0</sub> and R
 <sub>t</sub> is related to the proportion of individuals that are already immune (either by vaccination or natural infection) to that pathogen in that population. So another way of calculating R
 <sub>t</sub> for a pathogen in a given population is by multiplying R
 <sub>0</sub> by the proportion of that population that is non-immune (i.e. susceptible) to that pathogen.

 <sub>0</sub> will only equal R
 <sub>t</sub> when there are no immune individuals in the population (i.e. when all are susceptible). This means that any partial, pre-existing immunity to the infecting agent can reduce the number of expected secondary cases arising.
