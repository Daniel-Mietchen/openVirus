<p id="para0005">Using these values of R
 <sub>t</sub>, we can then calculate the minimum (‘critical’) level of population immunity, P
 <sub>crit</sub>, acquired via vaccination or naturally-induced (i.e. after recovery from COVID-19), to halt the spread of infection in that population, using the formula: P
 <sub>crit</sub>= 1-(1/R
 <sub>t</sub>). So, for example, if the value of R
 <sub>t</sub> = 3 then P
 <sub>crit</sub>= 0.67, i.e. at least two-thirds of the population need to be immune.
