 <italic>Radio-immunoassay </italic>(
 <italic>RIA</italic>) is probably the initiating method (1960s); it uses radioisotopes (such as Iodine 125) to label antigen or antibody. The amount of substance to analyse is determined by the amount of the generated radioactivity. RIA is a highly sensitive method but the main drawback is the handling and disposal of hazardous radioactive substances.
