<p>Despite the popularity of immunoassay in clinical testing, erroneous results may occur for many reasons, which confer inconsistencies to the testing.

   <p>Immunoassays are more prone to interferences than any other assay, which leads to false-positive or false-negative results. In most cases, interferences are due to the presence of agents with structural similarities to the reagents (
    <xref rid="hzw010C51" ref-type="bibr">Miller, 2004</xref>), and fluctuate according to the concentration of the interfering substance and the analyte. Endogenous antibodies (autoantibodies, hetero-antibodies or human anti-animal antibodies) are commonly the main culprit in these interferences (

   <p>Accurate QC guarantees reliable results and assumes that the assay is performed well. Therefore, poor QC measures lead to low accuracy and precision. In immunoassays, QC is assured by regular calibration and control of the reagents, using standardized solutions delivered by the manufacturers.</p>

   <p>The high cost of reagents and equipment is another drawback in immunoassays, particularly for resource-limited settings, considering that the most accurate and sensitive methods are automated.</p>
