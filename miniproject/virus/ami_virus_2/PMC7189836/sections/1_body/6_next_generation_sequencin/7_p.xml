<p>In data analysis, recent technical approaches have included adjustment of the software reading platforms for simultaneous detection of genotypes and mutants of clinical importance (

 </xref>), and partial sequencing of the HBV S gene with high sensitivity (98.64%), considering that portion as the site of most drug-resistance mutations (

  <italic>et al</italic>., 2013
 </xref>). Nevertheless, implementation of NGS in clinical settings is increasing, particularly for detecting low-abundance drug-resistance patterns such as in HIV and HCV (

  <italic>et al</italic>., 2010
