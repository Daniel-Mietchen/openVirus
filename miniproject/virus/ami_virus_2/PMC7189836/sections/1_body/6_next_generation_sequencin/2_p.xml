<p>The journey began in the 1970s with the works of Sanger and Barrel, followed by Maxam and Gilbert, who first initiated the principle of sequencing oligonucleotides via enzymatic polymerization, using radiolabelled primers. In their experimental protocols, they relied on using dideoxy-nucleotides to terminate the extension of the polymer, hence the name: chain termination or dideoxynucleotide method (
