<p>Since then, the principle has remained virtually the same, but improvements and automation have dramatically increased the speed and accuracy in delivering maximum volume of data comparing to dideoxynucleotide sequencing (

Systems available in the market differ mostly in their sequencing or reading techniques. Efficient and accurate clinical diagnosis of viral infections using NGS is increasingly aiming to provide accurate longer read-length in a shortest time and at a lower cost. Bioinformatic platforms are key components of the sequencing process. They allow interpretation of the sequencing output through computational analysis (
