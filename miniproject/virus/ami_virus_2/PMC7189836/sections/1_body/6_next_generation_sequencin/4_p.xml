<p>Pyrosequencing is currently the variant of choice within NGS systems. Based on the detection of pyrophosphate (PPi) after incorporation of a nucleotide in a DNA polymerization process, it uses luciferase to catalyse light-generating processes, and the collected light is then recorded. Although Illumina is considered the most frequently used pyrosequencing platform, 454 FLX; a subsidiary company of Roche, was the first high-throughput analyser in the market and was used to determine human papillomavirus (HPV) types (
