<p>Global pandemics are serious threats to human life. While well-established and characterized viruses such as The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis are still killing millions of people, the emerging viruses are also problematic and have caused several serious outbreaks in the recent years. For example, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002â€“2003, Swine Influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 and Ebola Haemorrhagic fever outbreak in 2014 which has caused thousands of deaths in West Africa.</p>
