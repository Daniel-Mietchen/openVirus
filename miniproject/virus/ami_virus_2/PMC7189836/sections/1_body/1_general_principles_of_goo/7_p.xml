 <italic>Specificity</italic> (also called the true negative rate) is a qualitative assessment, showing the capability of the test to distinguish target from non-target analyte. This measure is expressed as the percentage of infection-free patients who will have a negative result. The closer the values are to the reference, the higher the sensitivity and specificity of the test.
