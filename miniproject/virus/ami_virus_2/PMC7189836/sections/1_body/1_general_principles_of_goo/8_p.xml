<p>On the contrary, operational parameters concern simplicity and ease in performing the test such as the turnaround time (TAT). TAT is a key performance indicator defined as the interval time between sample registration to result reporting. Sample preparation and any other pre-analytical steps are within this interval. Assay completion in less than 60 min is ideal so manufacturers aim to construct diagnosis instruments allowing shorter TAT, which is particularly beneficial for point-of-care settings (
