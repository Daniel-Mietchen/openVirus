<p>Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) is a very small device that integrates laboratory processes within a few square centimetres. It uses very small volume of samples to perform immediate reactions within the chip or in a portable device. The reactions vary from nucleic acid amplification and detection, to cell count and immunoassays; therefore, microfluidic diagnostics compete with large instruments in performing laboratory tests at a lower cost, to benefit low-income settings and remote areas.</p>
