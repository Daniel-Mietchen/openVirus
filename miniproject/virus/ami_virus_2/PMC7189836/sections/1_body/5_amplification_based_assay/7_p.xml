<p>On the contrary, microfluidic technology has also benefited PCR-based systems; and allowed further decrease in the detection time (15 min), with high sensitivity and cost-effectiveness. In the 2009 epidemic, detection of Influenza A virus H1N1 greatly relied on a chip-type real-time PCR instead of the tube-based principle. The portable format of such systems is very convenient during epidemics and outbreaks (
