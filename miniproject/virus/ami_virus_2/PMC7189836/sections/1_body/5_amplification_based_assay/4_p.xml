<p>The most widely used variants of conventional amplification are real-time PCR (quantitative PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Both are nowadays becoming benchmarks in assessing the viral load, and while the first method quantifies DNA throughout the reactions in real time (

 </xref>); the second performs RT of the mRNA (RNA messenger) and amplifies the resulting cDNA (complementary DNA). It also quantifies RNA. The combination of both techniques increases sensitivity in detecting viruses, particularly influenza viruses. The WHO recently approved a newly developed reverse transcriptase-PCR assay after the first death from MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus) infection reported in 2012 (
