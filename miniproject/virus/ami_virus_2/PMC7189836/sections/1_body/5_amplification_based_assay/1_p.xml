The basic PCR assay relies on extraction and purification of the nucleic acid, then exponential amplification of the target sequence, using a thermostable polymerase enzyme and specific primers. The resulting amplicons are then identified using a fluorescence-based detection system, and the result is reported in international units IU/ml.
