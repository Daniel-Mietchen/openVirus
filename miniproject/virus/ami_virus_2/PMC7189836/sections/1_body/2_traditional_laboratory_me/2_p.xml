<p>In developed countries, 
 <italic>electron microscope </italic>(
 <italic>EM</italic>) has for long time been considered an efficient tool for direct detection of viruses through visualization and counting of the viral particles in body fluids, stools or histopathologic samples. The identification is based on morphological characteristics specific to each virus family and requires a certain amount of viral particles (up to 106 particles/ml). However, specimen preparation that must be performed beforehand (
 <xref rid="hzw010C26" ref-type="bibr">Goldsmith and Miller, 2009</xref>) may reduce the virus concentration which makes the analysis harder. In addition, electron microscopy requires substantial technical skills and expertise; the presence of unusual or look-alike structures such as cellular debris and organelles may confuse the electron microscopist with their virus-like shapes (
