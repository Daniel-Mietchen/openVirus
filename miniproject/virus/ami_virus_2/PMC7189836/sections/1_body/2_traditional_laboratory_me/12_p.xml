 <italic>Haemagglutination inhibition</italic> test is generally used for detecting arboviruses, influenza and parainfluenza virus subtypes and provides relative quantitation of the virus particles. The principle relies on the capacity of haemagglutinin (HA); a viral protein present in the envelope, to bind to erythrocytes (RBC) and to form a lattice pattern termed ‘agglutination’. In the assay, serial dilutions of the sample serum are added to a fixed amount of viral HA and agglutinable RBCs. If Influenza antibodies are present in the serum, the agglutination process is prevented. The corresponding dilution rate at which complete haemagglutination is observed and considered.
