<p>Detection of genomic variations or mutations in Influenza A using MALDI-TOF has been a key tool in the management of outbreaks (

 </xref>), through concordant results with the gold standard PCR-based method. This blend of two powerful machineries (PCR-MS) can detect drug resistance to antiviral therapy as well as the presence of multiple viruses within the same sample and diagnose for co-infections, when assays are multiplexed.
