<p>The increasing interest in MALDI-TOF MS in clinical virology has led to research advances in the diagnosis of Hepatitis B. The method was in fact not only able to detect HBV at relatively low viral load levels (100 HBV DNA copies/ml) (

  <italic>et al</italic>., 2004
 </xref>) but it also allowed detection of up to 60 HBV variants and genotypes at a cost lower than $10/sample for all the variants with high throughput (

  <italic>et al</italic>., 2009
 </xref>). The same method was applied for genotyping and successfully detected the eight HBV genotypes accurately (

  <italic>et al</italic>., 2010
 </xref>), and also minor HCV genotypes occurring at very low level (
