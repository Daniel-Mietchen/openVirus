These approaches have extensively been evaluated experimentally and provided excellent results, either used alone or combined with other molecular methods, such as PCR, in order to enhance sensitivity. The combination (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) was able to detect viral pathogens usually undetected by regular testing methods, and provided rapid and detailed data (types and subtypes) within a short time (
