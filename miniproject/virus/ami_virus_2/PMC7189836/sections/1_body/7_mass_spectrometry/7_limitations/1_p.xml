<p>The main limitation of MS is the high cost, particularly in high pandemic areas, which are usually the poorest; not all laboratories can afford a mass analyser for their activities. The second major drawback is within the reference library. The identification is limited by known data from well-identified organisms only; therefore, rare mutations cannot be detected if they do not exist within the reading platform, but there is hope that MS database libraries will rapidly expand.</p>
