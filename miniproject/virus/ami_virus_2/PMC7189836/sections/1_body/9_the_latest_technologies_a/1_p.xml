<p>The methods described above have shown outstanding performance in saving thousands of lives in developed countries. However, accurate diagnosis is still a challenge in resource-limited settings because of the difficulty in acquiring these equipment and technical expertise. While expensive tools such as PCR-based systems or mass analysers are only available in reference laboratories or in military facilities, point-of-care or near-patients clinics that serve more than 80% of the poor population struggle with the testing devices available. As an example, the WHO has established guidelines for monitoring ART efficacy in HIV-1 infected patients in developing countries, by suggesting only CD4+ cell count and ELISA-based assays as alternatives to the expensive tests (
