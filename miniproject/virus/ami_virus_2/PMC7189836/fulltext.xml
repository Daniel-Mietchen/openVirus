with thousands of deaths annually. From serious pandemics and highly contagious infections
to common influenza episodes, clinical prognosis often relies on early detection of the
infectious agent. Thus, effective identification of viral pathogens is needed to help
prevent transmission, set up appropriate therapy, monitor response to treatment and lead
to efficient disease management and control. The aim of this review is to outline some of
the recent technological advances in viral identification, including polymerase chain
reaction, mass spectrometry and next-generation sequencing, and how they are applied in
the diagnosis and management of viral infections. These powerful tools combine rapidity
and efficiency in detecting viral pathogens and have revolutionized the field of clinical
diagnostics. However, a number of drawbacks such as high cost have limited their use in
many laboratories, particularly in resource-limited settings. On the contrary, the advent
of microfluidic technology has attracted increasing interest from biomedical research
groups, and could represent a challenging alternative to diagnose viral infections at
lower cost.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>viral infections</kwd><kwd>laboratory testing</kwd><kwd>immunoassay</kwd><kwd>polymerase chain reaction</kwd><kwd>next-generation sequencing</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="hzw010s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Global pandemics are serious threats to human life. While well-established and
characterized viruses such as The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis are still
killing millions of people, the emerging viruses are also problematic and have caused
several serious outbreaks in the recent years. For example, the Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002&#x02013;2003, Swine Influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 and Ebola
Haemorrhagic fever outbreak in 2014 which has caused thousands of deaths in West Africa.</p><p>Morbidity and mortality rates are significantly high. Thirty-five million people were
infected with HIV in 2013, and 350&#x02013;400 millions chronic carriers of Hepatitis B virus.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) report of 2014 (<xref rid="hzw010C82" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2014</xref>); more than 780 000 people die every year of Hepatitis B
and up to 500 000 die of Hepatitis C-related liver diseases. The high prevalence of these
diseases has raised the efforts for improving clinical diagnostics.</p><p>Effective prevention and clinical management of infectious diseases are intimately linked
to early and accurate screening of pathogens, not only by detecting the infectious particles
in the organism but also by elucidating the aspects that confer resistance to therapy and
immune escape profiles, including mutations and genotype disparity.</p><p>Therefore, rapid diagnosis benefits patients in allowing timely therapy to prevent
complications; and benefits public health by collecting data for epidemiological studies, to
prevent outbreaks and spreading of diseases. In that context, the WHO has established many
surveillance programs for disease control such as the global strategy for control and
assessment of HIV drug resistance, the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System for
the control and monitoring of Influenza and the Global Policy on Viral Hepatitis.</p><p>At a smaller scale, clinical laboratories are a crucial point for diagnosis of viral
diseases by using a range of tools and machineries varying in cost and efficacy.</p><p>In a rapidly growing world of technology, the industry is continuously delivering
up-to-date instruments but many factors are limiting their implementation in healthcare
settings with low income, which unfortunately delays global benefit. This review will
describe some of these advanced testing methods, how their specific characteristics have
revolutionized the field of laboratory diagnosis and what can be done to overcome their
limitations.</p></sec><sec id="hzw010s2"><title>General principles of good laboratory testing</title><p>Rigorous and accurate interpretation of laboratory results guarantees effective clinical
management of a disease and control of its propagation (<xref rid="hzw010C40" ref-type="bibr">Lemon <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). However, erroneous diagnosis
could lead to financial and human loss.</p><p>In clinical testing of infectious diseases, it is crucial to determine precisely the
presence or absence of the infectious agent or its corresponding antibodies, to prove
current or past exposure. Therefore, the ability to say precisely whether the person is
infected or not, and to determine the course of the infection has a positive impact on the
therapeutic strategy.</p><p>The usefulness and reliability of laboratory results depend on the
<italic>performance</italic> and <italic>operational</italic> parameters of the intended
test. The performance parameters directly relate to the results by estimating their
<italic>Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity</italic> and <italic>Specificity</italic> (<xref rid="hzw010C39" ref-type="bibr">Lalkhen and McCluskey, 2008</xref>). While these are
statistical values (percentages), they have different explanations and involve comparison
with the reference method or &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; for the desired test (<xref rid="hzw010C29" ref-type="bibr">Guzman <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>).</p><p><italic>Accuracy</italic> describes how close the obtained results are to those obtained
with the reference method and it is expressed as a percentage of correct results.
<italic>Precision</italic> refers to the reliable reproduction of one test on the same
sample, and obtaining similar results.</p><p>These two parameters must be regularly monitored using local quality control (QC) and
quality assurance (QA) procedures in order to maintain reliability of the test. In perfect
conditions, an ideal test would have 100% accuracy and 100% precision; however, external
factors and methodological differences can cause small variations.</p><p><italic>Sensitivity</italic> (also called the true positive rate) is the percentage of
patients with confirmed infection (by the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; method) who will have positive
results. It is usually measured by the lower limit of detection of the analyte producing a
positive result.</p><p><italic>Specificity</italic> (also called the true negative rate) is a qualitative
assessment, showing the capability of the test to distinguish target from non-target
analyte. This measure is expressed as the percentage of infection-free patients who will
have a negative result. The closer the values are to the reference, the higher the
sensitivity and specificity of the test.</p><p>On the contrary, operational parameters concern simplicity and ease in performing the test
such as the turnaround time (TAT). TAT is a key performance indicator defined as the
interval time between sample registration to result reporting. Sample preparation and any
other pre-analytical steps are within this interval. Assay completion in less than 60 min is
ideal so manufacturers aim to construct diagnosis instruments allowing shorter TAT, which is
particularly beneficial for point-of-care settings (<xref rid="hzw010C31" ref-type="bibr">Hawkins, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The WHO has established ASSURED criteria (<italic>A</italic>ffordable,
<italic>S</italic>ensitive, <italic>S</italic>pecific, <italic>U</italic>ser-friendly,
<italic>R</italic>apid and robust, <italic>E</italic>quipment-free and
<italic>D</italic>eliverable to end users) (<xref rid="hzw010C85" ref-type="bibr">Wu and
Zaman, 2012</xref>) for diagnostics in resources-limited point-of care settings (<xref rid="hzw010C8" ref-type="bibr">Blacksell, 2012</xref>). The aim is to provide better
management of the disease, such as immediate delivery of the results and rapid record of the
disease status, to improve clinical decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="hzw010s3"><title>Traditional laboratory methods for the diagnosis of viral infections</title><p>For long time, clinical laboratories have relied on a diverse range of techniques to
diagnose viral infections.</p><p>In developed countries, <italic>electron microscope </italic>(<italic>EM</italic>) has for
long time been considered an efficient tool for direct detection of viruses through
visualization and counting of the viral particles in body fluids, stools or histopathologic
samples. The identification is based on morphological characteristics specific to each virus
family and requires a certain amount of viral particles (up to 106 particles/ml). However,
specimen preparation that must be performed beforehand (<xref rid="hzw010C26" ref-type="bibr">Goldsmith and Miller, 2009</xref>) may reduce the virus concentration
which makes the analysis harder. In addition, electron microscopy requires substantial
technical skills and expertise; the presence of unusual or look-alike structures such as
cellular debris and organelles may confuse the electron microscopist with their virus-like
shapes (<xref rid="hzw010C21" ref-type="bibr">Fauquet <italic>et al</italic>.,
2005</xref>).</p><p>The combination of EM with culture-based methods has shown great contribution in the
diagnosis of viral infections, along with serology testing for detection of antibodies
targeted against the virus. These conventional methods are still fundamental practices in
many hospital laboratories.</p><p><italic>Cell culture</italic> is one of the most popular methods for isolating viruses
using cell lines. These latter vary according to the targeted viruses (for example; rhesus
monkey kidney cells are used for isolation of Influenza A virus).</p><p>Evidence of virus growth is seen through the cytopathic effect (CPE) exhibiting specific
characteristics and alterations of the cells (<xref rid="hzw010C66" ref-type="bibr">Robbins,
Enders and Weller, 1950</xref>). The virus definitive identification is then performed
using Immunofluorescence (IF) staining. Nevertheless, virus isolation using cell culture is
not ideal in case of viruses not amenable to growth in cell lines (norovirus, hepatitis
virus) or producing CPE (<xref rid="hzw010C58" ref-type="bibr">Papafragkou <italic>et
al</italic>., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition, small volumes of the sample may not allow inoculation of many cell types, and
thus compromise the results. For example, the standard inoculation of a cell culture medium
with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample requires a minimum of 0.2 ml; however, much more is
needed to inoculate a combination of different cell types, which could be invasive to the
patient (<xref rid="hzw010C49" ref-type="bibr">McIntyre, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="hzw010C32" ref-type="bibr">Hematiana <italic>et al</italic>., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The time required for isolating viruses by cell culture is very long (weeks), limiting the
usefulness of this technique when rapid diagnosis is needed. Cell culture needs highly
skilled and experienced personnel for accurate interpretation of the CPE and adequate
facilities for handling mammalian cell lines or highly pathogenic viruses.</p><p>In the <italic>shell vial technique,</italic> one of the <italic>rapid culture
methods</italic>, inoculated cells are subjected to centrifugation, incubation and then IF
staining with monoclonal antibodies, specific to the range of viruses suspected to cause the
infection, such as respiratory viruses, Herpes simplex virus or Varicella zoster virus. The
virus-induced antigens are detected 2&#x02013;4 days later.</p><p>Rapid culture has limited benefits as it does not target a wide range of viruses and has
low sensitivity.</p><p><italic>Complement fixation test </italic>(<italic>CFT</italic>) is one of the oldest
methods in the history of clinical virology (<xref rid="hzw010C11" ref-type="bibr">Casals
and Palacios, 1941</xref>). The complement reacts only with antigen&#x02013;antibody complex in a
non-specific manner. Thus, in the presence of the complex, the complement is not free to
interact with sensitized sheep red blood cells (RBCs) used as an indicator, and which remain
unlysed. The test is said to be &#x02018;positive&#x02019;.</p><p>CFT is supposedly easy to perform, convenient and requires inexpensive material. However,
it is labour intensive and lacks sensitivity. In-house standardization through titration of
the reactants and preparation of controls is crucial for obtaining effective testing.</p><p><italic>Haemagglutination inhibition</italic> test is generally used for detecting
arboviruses, influenza and parainfluenza virus subtypes and provides relative quantitation
of the virus particles. The principle relies on the capacity of haemagglutinin (HA); a viral
protein present in the envelope, to bind to erythrocytes (RBC) and to form a lattice pattern
termed &#x02018;agglutination&#x02019;. In the assay, serial dilutions of the sample serum are added to a
fixed amount of viral HA and agglutinable RBCs. If Influenza antibodies are present in the
serum, the agglutination process is prevented. The corresponding dilution rate at which
complete haemagglutination is observed and considered.</p><p>Variants of the agglutination assay are used for the diagnosis of wider range of viral
diseases other than influenza (<xref rid="hzw010C27" ref-type="bibr">Grandien <italic>et
al</italic>., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="hzw010C68" ref-type="bibr">Sandeep <italic>et
al</italic>., 2002</xref>). However, the test is time consuming, and demanding,
particularly in terms of QC.</p><p>This list of conventional techniques is not exhaustive, and only the most commonly used
were cited. The following sections will discuss more recent developments in the field, which
replaced the conventional practices and allowed screening (qualitative test), surveillance
(quantitative test) and confirmation of diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="hzw010s4"><title>Recent methods in the diagnosis of viral infections</title><p>As stated before, this review will discuss only some of the main developments in diagnostic

infection, reinfection or a reactivation state. Therefore, measuring the level of
immunoglobulins (Ig) is a widely considered approach for the diagnosis of viral
infections.</p><p>Automated immunoassay-based methods are among the most frequently used for testing, and are
effective because of the high specificity and binding affinity between antigen and antibody.
Therefore, the principle of the test relies in the formation of an immuno-complex between
antibody present in the patient sample and synthetic antigen present in the reagent or vice
versa, to generate a measurable signal.</p><p>Immunoassays use labels conjugated to synthetic antibodies or antigens which are linked to
a solid phase, and used to capture corresponding antigens or antibodies present in sera
samples. These labels could be radioactive isotopes, enzymes that cause change in colour or
light-generating substances. Consequently, this principle has generated several
methodologies for the testing.</p><p><italic>Radio-immunoassay </italic>(<italic>RIA</italic>) is probably the initiating method
(1960s); it uses radioisotopes (such as Iodine 125) to label antigen or antibody. The amount
of substance to analyse is determined by the amount of the generated radioactivity. RIA is a
highly sensitive method but the main drawback is the handling and disposal of hazardous
radioactive substances.</p><p>The enzymatic labelling alternative using alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase as
markers is, however, the most widely used and was long considered a reference method (<xref rid="hzw010C20" ref-type="bibr">Engvall and Perlmann, 1972</xref>; <xref rid="hzw010C80" ref-type="bibr">Voller, Bidwell and Bartlett, 1976</xref>). These enzymes induce emission
of signals or change in colour respectively, and allow the amount of analyte of interest to
be measured. This <italic>enzyme-linked immunoassay</italic> (<italic>EIA</italic>) has
numerous variants, including ELISA, and they differ in the enzyme used and the signal

for detection of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers. The up-to-date versions of immunoassay
methods are able to detect the lowest levels of the main marker HBsAg, undetectable by
conventional methods, particularly in sera samples of asymptomatic patients. The latest
screening standard detects as little as 0.05 IU/ml, the equivalent of 0.2 ng/ml viral
antigen (<xref rid="hzw010C16" ref-type="bibr">Deguchi <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>)

the presence of agents with structural similarities to the reagents (<xref rid="hzw010C51" ref-type="bibr">Miller, 2004</xref>), and fluctuate according to
the concentration of the interfering substance and the analyte. Endogenous
antibodies (autoantibodies, hetero-antibodies or human anti-animal antibodies) are
commonly the main culprit in these interferences (<xref rid="hzw010C18" ref-type="bibr">Emerson and Lai, 2013</xref>). Their binding to capture antibodies

nucleic acid amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has revolutionized the field
of molecular diagnosis. The basic PCR assay relies on extraction and purification of the

quantitation of the viral nucleic acid by amplifying the target sequence thousands-fold. In
most cases, they are now considered a reference, or &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; method for diagnostic
practices such as screening donated blood for transfusion-transmitted viruses (CMV, HIV,
HCV, &#x02026;) (<xref rid="hzw010C35" ref-type="bibr">Jackson, 1990</xref>).</p><p>The most widely used variants of conventional amplification are real-time PCR (quantitative
PCR) and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Both are nowadays becoming benchmarks in
assessing the viral load, and while the first method quantifies DNA throughout the reactions
in real time (<xref rid="hzw010C55" ref-type="bibr">Ntziora <italic>et al</italic>.,
2013</xref>); the second performs RT of the mRNA (RNA messenger) and amplifies the
resulting cDNA (complementary DNA). It also quantifies RNA. The combination of both
techniques increases sensitivity in detecting viruses, particularly influenza viruses. The
WHO recently approved a newly developed reverse transcriptase-PCR assay after the first
death from MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus) infection reported in
2012 (<xref rid="hzw010C1" ref-type="bibr">Abd El Wahed <italic>et al</italic>.,
2013</xref>).</p><p>Other amplification-based tests such as nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA)
and transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) are suited for detection of RNA viruses by
amplification of the mRNA instead of conversion to cDNA (<xref rid="hzw010C50" ref-type="bibr">Mercier-Delarue <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="hzw010C84" ref-type="bibr">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Among the latest enhancements in PCR systems, extraction, amplification and detection steps
have been combined within one unit. As an example, BioFire Film Array technology applies two
sequential amplifications and can detect a panel of respiratory viruses with high
sensitivity in 1 h and within a single instrument (<xref rid="hzw010C61" ref-type="bibr">Pierce <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p><p>On the contrary, microfluidic technology has also benefited PCR-based systems; and allowed
further decrease in the detection time (15 min), with high sensitivity and
cost-effectiveness. In the 2009 epidemic, detection of Influenza A virus H1N1 greatly relied
on a chip-type real-time PCR instead of the tube-based principle. The portable format of
such systems is very convenient during epidemics and outbreaks (<xref rid="hzw010C73" ref-type="bibr">Song <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Multiplexed NAAT were designed to detect multiple viruses or subtypes in a single run.
Their detection platforms can comprise up to 20 viruses using diversified panels (<xref rid="hzw010C47" ref-type="bibr">Mahony <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>), for example,
concurrent detection of HAV, HBV and HCV infections, as well as co-infections (<xref rid="hzw010C59" ref-type="bibr">Park <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In Hepatitis B, PCR is considered the gold standard method for assessing the HBV DNA level
with high accuracy, and the assays are standardized according to the WHO International
Standard for Hepatitis B virus (NIBSC), such as the reference Roche Cobas TaqMan HBV test.
The test was the first FDA approved assay, with a detection limit of 10.2 IU/ml. The
combined system with Cobas AmpliPrep has an automated sample extraction process and highly
sensitive detection for all HBV genotypes (<xref rid="hzw010C62" ref-type="bibr">Pyne
<italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In HIV patients taking antiretroviral treatment (ART), ultrasensitive assays permit
quantitation of low copy numbers of HIV subtypes (&#x0003c;50 copies/ml) and long terminal
repeats in latent reservoirs and from cell lysates omitting the nucleic acid extraction step
(<xref rid="hzw010C77" ref-type="bibr">Vandergeeten <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).
Such assays could be valuable tools in large cohort studies or pandemic situations.</p><sec id="hzw010s8"><title>Limitations</title><p>The limitations of PCR are an important parameter to consider, despite the
cost-effectiveness and reliability in the diagnosis of viral infections. The risk of
contamination is very high while handling, especially during the sample preparation step,
in addition, real-time PCR has a longer run-time (2&#x02013;5 h) by comparison to other
techniques.</p><p>In the case of influenza, many PCR-based assays were designed to detect only a particular
subtype of the virus responsible for important pandemics (<xref rid="hzw010C30" ref-type="bibr">Hall <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>), and the need for designing
specific primers for the target requires handling by experienced operators, capable of
detecting errors, particularly that PCR is prone to false-positive results.</p><p>The high mutation rate of some viruses could trigger mutation within PCR primer regions
of the viral genome, which would lead the virus to escape the detection by this assay.</p></sec></sec><sec id="hzw010s9"><title>Next-generation sequencing</title><p>Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is one of the greatest achievements of the modern era.
Beyond genome sequencing from known organisms, it allowed discovery of novel viruses
responsible for unknown human diseases (<xref rid="hzw010C56" ref-type="bibr">Palacios
<italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>), and tracking of outbreaks and pandemics such as
influenza (<xref rid="hzw010C4" ref-type="bibr">Baillie <italic>et al</italic>.,
2012</xref>) to understand their emergence and transmission profiles (<xref rid="hzw010C41" ref-type="bibr">Leung <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="hzw010C34" ref-type="bibr">Isakov <italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The journey began in the 1970s with the works of Sanger and Barrel, followed by Maxam and
Gilbert, who first initiated the principle of sequencing oligonucleotides via enzymatic
polymerization, using radiolabelled primers. In their experimental protocols, they relied on
using dideoxy-nucleotides to terminate the extension of the polymer, hence the name: chain
termination or dideoxynucleotide method (<xref rid="hzw010C69" ref-type="bibr">Sanger,
Nicklen and Coulson, 1977</xref>).</p><p>Since then, the principle has remained virtually the same, but improvements and automation
have dramatically increased the speed and accuracy in delivering maximum volume of data
comparing to dideoxynucleotide sequencing (<xref rid="hzw010C71" ref-type="bibr">Shedure and
Ji, 2008</xref>). Technically, NGS is inclusive of three main steps: sample preparation,
sequencing and data analysis. Systems available in the market differ mostly in their
sequencing or reading techniques. Efficient and accurate clinical diagnosis of viral
infections using NGS is increasingly aiming to provide accurate longer read-length in a
shortest time and at a lower cost. Bioinformatic platforms are key components of the
sequencing process. They allow interpretation of the sequencing output through computational
analysis (<xref rid="hzw010C54" ref-type="bibr">Naccache <italic>et al</italic>.,
2014</xref>), and then convert it into useful information on species, genotypes and the
occurrence of mutations conferring virulence or resistance to antivirals.</p><p>Pyrosequencing is currently the variant of choice within NGS systems. Based on the
detection of pyrophosphate (PPi) after incorporation of a nucleotide in a DNA polymerization
process, it uses luciferase to catalyse light-generating processes, and the collected light
is then recorded. Although Illumina is considered the most frequently used pyrosequencing
platform, 454 FLX; a subsidiary company of Roche, was the first high-throughput analyser in
the market and was used to determine human papillomavirus (HPV) types (<xref rid="hzw010C6" ref-type="bibr">Barzon <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), subtypes and variants,
present in cervical specimens. Other variants detect hydrogen ions that are released
throughout nucleotide incorporation reaction (<xref rid="hzw010C67" ref-type="bibr">Rothberg
<italic>et al</italic>. 2011</xref>).</p><p>Generating high volumes of sequence data has allowed the compilation of viral nucleotide
databases and acquisition of de novo sequences to understand the genetic variability of
viruses (<xref rid="hzw010C74" ref-type="bibr">Szpara, Parsons and Enquist, 2010</xref>).
HIV is by far the most sequenced because of the global priority of AIDS as a serious
endemic, and because of the high mutation rate of the virus.</p><p>So far, only gene sequencing methods have been successful in genotyping tricky HBV, unlike
conventional PCR or serological assays. Therefore, sequencing has allowed better clinical
management of HBV infection and related complications (<xref rid="hzw010C48" ref-type="bibr">Margeridon-Thermet <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In data analysis, recent technical approaches have included adjustment of the software
reading platforms for simultaneous detection of genotypes and mutants of clinical importance
(<xref rid="hzw010C25" ref-type="bibr">Germer <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>), and
partial sequencing of the HBV S gene with high sensitivity (98.64%), considering that
portion as the site of most drug-resistance mutations (<xref rid="hzw010C81" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, implementation of NGS in
clinical settings is increasing, particularly for detecting low-abundance drug-resistance
patterns such as in HIV and HCV (<xref rid="hzw010C57" ref-type="bibr">Palmer <italic>et
al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="hzw010C79" ref-type="bibr">Verbinnen <italic>et
al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Nucleotide sequencing of HCV sub-genomic regions is now the
method of choice for genotyping.</p><sec id="hzw010s10"><title>Limitations</title><p>The principal requirements for NGS are initially access to a sequencer, and considerable
skills in bioinformatics and expertise in data analysis, plus adequate handling systems
for storage of generated data. Adding to that, despite the outstanding results delivered
by prototypes in trials, many are still at the research level, and not yet approved for
use in routine clinical practice (<xref rid="hzw010C36" ref-type="bibr">Jiangqin
<italic>et al</italic>., 2015</xref>).</p><p>NGS is undeniably a key technology in specialized clinical laboratories, but its
implementation is still a challenge in many countries, where not only their
resource-limited settings cannot afford a sequence analyser, sample and library
preparation, but the vast majority of the population cannot afford the cost of the
test.</p></sec></sec><sec id="hzw010s11"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>Mass spectrometry (MS) is nowadays a benchmark of laboratory qualitative and quantitative
investigation, particularly in bacteriology (<xref rid="hzw010C70" ref-type="bibr">Sauer and
Kliem, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The principle of MS relies on converting the sample into charged particles (ions) by
ionization process. These ions are separated according to their mass-to-charge ratio
(<italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic>) and analysed by a detector. The result obtained is
compared to a reference database (library), existing within the system and delivered as an
interpretive spectrum.</p><p>In clinical laboratories, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and
electrospray (ES) are the most used ionization methods because they allow processing of
considerable amounts of analyte (<xref rid="hzw010C19" ref-type="bibr">Emonet <italic>et
al</italic>., 2010</xref>). These approaches have extensively been evaluated
experimentally and provided excellent results, either used alone or combined with other
molecular methods, such as PCR, in order to enhance sensitivity. The combination
(RT-PCR/ESI-MS) was able to detect viral pathogens usually undetected by regular testing
methods, and provided rapid and detailed data (types and subtypes) within a short time
(<xref rid="hzw010C42" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000e9;v&#x000ea;que <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Detection of genomic variations or mutations in Influenza A using MALDI-TOF has been a key
tool in the management of outbreaks (<xref rid="hzw010C13" ref-type="bibr">Chen <italic>et
al</italic>., 2011</xref>). MS application to the structural investigation of
biomolecules showed the efficiency of MALDI-TOF-MS coupled to antibody magnetic
nanoparticles in detecting influenza viruses (<xref rid="hzw010C15" ref-type="bibr">Chou
<italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="hzw010C87" ref-type="bibr">Yea
<italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>), through concordant results with the gold standard
PCR-based method. This blend of two powerful machineries (PCR-MS) can detect drug resistance
to antiviral therapy as well as the presence of multiple viruses within the same sample and
diagnose for co-infections, when assays are multiplexed.</p><p>The increasing interest in MALDI-TOF MS in clinical virology has led to research advances
in the diagnosis of Hepatitis B. The method was in fact not only able to detect HBV at
relatively low viral load levels (100 HBV DNA copies/ml) (<xref rid="hzw010C33" ref-type="bibr">Hong <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) but it also allowed detection
of up to 60 HBV variants and genotypes at a cost lower than $10/sample for all the variants
with high throughput (<xref rid="hzw010C46" ref-type="bibr">Luan <italic>et al</italic>.,
2009</xref>). The same method was applied for genotyping and successfully detected the
eight HBV genotypes accurately (<xref rid="hzw010C23" ref-type="bibr">Ganova-Raeva
<italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), and also minor HCV genotypes occurring at very
low level (<xref rid="hzw010C37" ref-type="bibr">Kim <italic>et al</italic>.,
2005</xref>).</p><p>Mass spectrometric-based methods are versatile, sensitive, rapid and cost-effective, and do
not require interpretation software for data analysis. The automated machinery necessitates
easy sample preparation and fewer operators. The analysis capacity can reach up to 960
specimens/day, which makes it suitable for routine diagnosis in high-volume laboratories and
large-scale studies. Tests can also be performed efficiently on archived specimen.</p><sec id="hzw010s12"><title>Limitations</title><p>The main limitation of MS is the high cost, particularly in high pandemic areas, which
are usually the poorest; not all laboratories can afford a mass analyser for their
activities. The second major drawback is within the reference library. The identification
is limited by known data from well-identified organisms only; therefore, rare mutations
cannot be detected if they do not exist within the reading platform, but there is hope
that MS database libraries will rapidly expand.</p></sec></sec><sec id="hzw010s13"><title>Advantages of the recent methods</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>High sensitivity and specificity assays approaching 100%.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Possibility to combine different methods in one assay enhances detection capability

in developed countries. However, accurate diagnosis is still a challenge in resource-limited
settings because of the difficulty in acquiring these equipment and technical expertise.
While expensive tools such as PCR-based systems or mass analysers are only available in
reference laboratories or in military facilities, point-of-care or near-patients clinics
that serve more than 80% of the poor population struggle with the testing devices available.
As an example, the WHO has established guidelines for monitoring ART efficacy in HIV-1
infected patients in developing countries, by suggesting only CD4+ cell count and
ELISA-based assays as alternatives to the expensive tests (<xref rid="hzw010C83" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2006a</xref>). Ultrasensitive p24 (<xref rid="hzw010C60" ref-type="bibr">Patton <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and the ExaVir assay (<xref rid="hzw010C38" ref-type="bibr">Kokkayil <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>), measure
the level of p24 antigen and the activity of reverse transcriptase, respectively, to replace
viral load monitoring. Unfortunately, their lack of sensitivity has induced failure of
treatment and emergence of resistant strains (<xref rid="hzw010C78" ref-type="bibr">Vekemans, John and Colebunders, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Hepatitis is another expensive burden to manage in poor countries, where accurate
assessment of the epidemiological profile is hard to establish. In the case of HBV, most POC
facilities rely on screening for HBsAg solely using rapid diagnosis tests. These low-cost
devices do not allow determination of the course of the disease to inform whether to
initiate an antiviral treatment or not.</p></sec><sec id="hzw010s15"><title>Automation, microfluidics and future prospects</title><p>Providing high-level epidemiological monitoring of viral diseases is undeniably a global
public health ambition, and despite rapid progress in the development of diagnostic methods
in recent years, improvements are needed for better cost, size (<xref rid="hzw010C44" ref-type="bibr">Loman <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="hzw010C22" ref-type="bibr">Frey <italic>et al</italic>., 2014</xref>) and TAT (<xref rid="hzw010C86" ref-type="bibr">Xu <italic>et al</italic>., 2013</xref>).</p><p>After the Ebola Haemorrhagic fever in 2014, the US governmental Department of Energy has
developed an innovative rapid and portable test to detect specifically Ebola virus within
seconds. The test aims to target other RNA and exotic viruses such as Dengue and West Nile
for effective management of viral outbreaks. Other examples include fully NAAT systems and
small devices to sequence single molecule DNA using nanopore technology (<xref rid="hzw010C17" ref-type="bibr">Eisenstein, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Microfluidic technology is regarded with optimism for the management of infectious diseases
by allowing timely therapy. It provides a key potential solution for remote areas and
near-patients facilities by avoiding turnaround trips of the patients between the clinic and
the laboratory. Their use is also beneficial where time is crucial, or when physical spaces
do not allow setting up of conventional methods.</p><p>Lab-on-a-chip (LOC) is a very small device that integrates laboratory processes within a
few square centimetres. It uses very small volume of samples to perform immediate reactions
within the chip or in a portable device. The reactions vary from nucleic acid amplification
and detection, to cell count and immunoassays; therefore, microfluidic diagnostics compete
with large instruments in performing laboratory tests at a lower cost, to benefit low-income
settings and remote areas.</p><p>A wide range of LOC devices were approved by the FDA in the diagnosis of viral infections
such as Influenza (<xref rid="hzw010C9" ref-type="bibr">Cao <italic>et al</italic>.,
2012</xref>), HIV (<xref rid="hzw010C3" ref-type="bibr">Alyassin <italic>et al</italic>.,
2009</xref>) and HBV (<xref rid="hzw010C88" ref-type="bibr">Zhi <italic>et al</italic>.,
2014</xref>) and further development is in progress. As examples, Daktari Diagnostics use
affinity chromatography for CD4+T-cell count as an alternative to flow cytometry to monitor
HIV in developing countries (<xref rid="hzw010C14" ref-type="bibr">Cheng <italic>et

integrated sample preparation and PCR system for molecular diagnosis of influenza and other
bacterial infections in a light portable format.</p><p>Improvement of QC programs, QA and standardization of assays, kits and reagents are
important to fulfil requirements for accuracy. The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) is continuously implementing laboratory-testing guidelines particularly for HIV,
before further tests will be approved (<xref rid="hzw010C12" ref-type="bibr">CDC,

(FIND) aim to maximize efforts to implement surveillance programs and control of
communicable diseases (<xref rid="hzw010C44" ref-type="bibr">Loman <italic>et al</italic>.,

microbiology, and could contribute to reducing the prevalence of serious infectious
diseases. However, the technical capabilities alone are insufficient if not supported by
health promotion strategies to increase awareness about the importance of early detection
and regular screening of persons at high risk.</p><p>Finally, good quality diagnosis has a cost that only developed countries can afford in
routine practice so far, and this is delaying the implementation of new methods in the
developing world and the endemic areas. However, there is hope that efforts will continue
towards developing new good quality tests affordable in low-income countries, which would
substantially strengthen disease control strategies for their populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Author biography</title><p>Selma obtained an MSc with Honours in Biomedical sciences from Nottingham Trent University.
