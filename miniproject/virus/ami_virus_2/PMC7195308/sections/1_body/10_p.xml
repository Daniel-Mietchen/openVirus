<p id="p0055">The following are just a few examples of contradictory statements by virologists, immunologists, infectious disease specialists and epidemiologists:

   <p id="p0060">the current epidemic is similar to the seasonal flu, or to the Spanish flu, or is very different from flu in terms of threats to public health</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0015">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0065">asymptomatic individuals do not transmit the virus, or rarely transmit, or transmit just like symptomatic individuals</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0020">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0070">the rapid serological test (without knowing its limits, because knowing them requires validation of its sensitivity, specificity and predictive value) is a breakthrough for containing the epidemic, or has only moderate significance (because the result could be negative even in infected subjects, depending on when the test is performed)</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0025">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0075">the molecular tests used to perform the diagnosis are proposed as a screening test, even though they may not have the characteristics required for a screening test</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0030">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0080">the virus inactivation time varies from a few hours to 9 days (forgetting that some data refer to the detection of the viral genome and not to its infectivity)</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0035">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0085">the virus is genetically stable, or is just as variable as expected, or is rapidly mutating, with impact on virulence and eventual vaccine efficacy</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item id="u0040">
   <label>•</label>
   <p id="p0090">the original source of the animal-to-human jump is undoubtedly a bat, or a snake, or a pangolin; some even say it is pets.</p>
