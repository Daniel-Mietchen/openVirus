<p id="p0095">What is indisputable is that currently we do not have sufficiently sound scientific evidence on the biology of the new virus. Most of the information derives from studies of the viral genome without comparable knowledge of the natural history of the infection and of its pathogenic mechanisms; it is therefore difficult to share certainties. In this situation, caution is a ‘must’ and, as in the majority of pandemics, the definitive results (and likewise the real numbers) can be gathered and analysed only ‘when the dust has settled’ and not while the pandemic is under way.</p>
