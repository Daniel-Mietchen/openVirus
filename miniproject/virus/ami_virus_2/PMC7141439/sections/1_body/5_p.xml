<p id="para0006">What is clear to the clinical community of oncologists, while recognizing the differences between the different contexts, is that cancer centers must limit the risks for patients and healthcare professionals. Consequently, specific guidelines have been issued by various scientific societies such as ASCO, ESMO, NCCN, AIOM, etc. The opportunity to keep cancer patients for whom there are no priority clinical needs away from hospitals is unanimously recognized. Outpatient visits are usually rescheduled or shifted to telemedicine. Triage of patients and health workers is critical to reduce exposure to other patients and staff with the aim of keeping the hospital virus free. The policy “stay at home when ill” together with a strategy that tests staff, tracking results for persons under investigation, tracing exposures, and defining return to work is fundamental to limit shortage in terms of workforce.</p>
