<p id="p0030">On March 16, 2020, the ADA stated, it “is deeply concerned for the health and well-being of the public and the dental team. In order for dentistry to do its part to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the ADA recommends dentists nationwide postpone elective procedures for the next three weeks. Concentrating on emergency dental care will allow us to care for our emergency patients and alleviate the burden that dental emergencies would place on hospital emergency departments.” Are dental offices prepared to treat these potentially infected patients? If a patient is suspected of having COVID-19 and emergency dental care is indicated, it has been recommended that the dental treatment be performed in a negative pressure room or airborne infection isolation room.
