<p id="p0015">Pandemics inflict devastating consequences on communities and cause long-term rippling effects in the economy and the health care system. Acute immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first described as “gay-related immunodeficiency syndrome” in 1981. Young gay men had begun falling ill and dying of opportunistic infection, and fear of the “gay plague” spread rapidly, along with the social stigma. Two years later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) documented heterosexual transmission of AIDS.

 </xref> What was originally referred to as a “gay virus” had transformed into one of the greatest ongoing pandemics and scientific challenges of modern medicine. The AIDS pandemic resulted in acceptance of “universal precautions” that revolutionized the standard of care throughout medicine. Before the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and AIDS, dentists did not commonly wear masks or eye protection. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, in an attempt to protect health care workers, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the CDC proposed guidelines to reduce exposure to bloodborne pathogens such as HIV and hepatitis B. Dentistry resisted this change at every step. Dentists argued that “children would be frightened of the masks.” The American Dental Association ADA led a fight against OSHA's universal precautions rule, arguing that no dentists had contracted these pathogens. In an op-ed piece published in the

By its nature, dentistry is an intimate occupation. The dentist works within an inch of a patient's head, probing sensitive, often tender areas of the patient's body. The mouth embodies our ability to smile, kiss, talk, and eat—all very emotional qualities. Patients' need a warm and trusting relationship with their dentist to help overcome fears and make necessary dentistry possible. It will be more difficult to establish this relationship when the dentist is gowned, shielded, and masked. [These barriers] will have a profound effect on the relationship between the dentist and patient.” In 1991, the ADA challenged the rule in the US Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and lost. In 2020, the ADA's resistance to masks and eye protection seems preposterous, especially given the information we have about bloodborne pathogens today.
