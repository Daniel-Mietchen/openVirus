<p id="p0040">Protecting health care workers and patients is of upmost importance, and we must focus on preventing future outbreaks. As a profession, we should explore methods of reducing transmission of all infectious agents. External mouth suctions, which work like the scavenger systems in our nitrous oxide devices, are being tested for effectiveness in Korea. Commercial air purifiers and air exchange devices are also being explored for the dental setting. Creating negative pressure operatories might seem a drastic and expensive approach now. However, in 40Â years, dentists might think we were ludicrous for working without them, just as we judge those before us who did not use gloves. This pandemic will affect the delivery of care; the only questions are when and how. Will dentistry accept the advances or continue our history of fighting change?</p>
