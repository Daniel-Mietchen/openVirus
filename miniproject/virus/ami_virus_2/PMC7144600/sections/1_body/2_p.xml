<p id="p0020">As a species, we are reluctant to change. This is evident, not only by dentistry's resistance to adopt universal precautions, but also throughout history. The technology needed to eradicate smallpox was first described in 1798, but took nearly 180 years to execute. The present strand of coronavirus might be new, but we have seen the same societal reaction to outbreaks countless times. With fear and panic brings blame and bigotry. On March 19, 2020, the President of the United States referred to the coronavirus as the “Chinese virus.” Global threats require unified efforts, which is why terms such as the “Chinese virus” are so detrimental. “Anti-Chinese hostility has been a recurrent problem, whether with plague in San Francisco in 1900, SARS in 2003, or Covid-19 today.”

If we have learned anything from history, it is that we must come together as a species to fight as one or perish as individuals.
