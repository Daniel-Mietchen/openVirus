 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], we have developed and analyzed a mathematical model calibrated to the transmission dynamics of Ebola virus disease in West Africa to evaluate the impact of early diagnosis of pre-symptomatic infections. In the absence of effective treatments and vaccines, our results show the importance of implementing integrated control measures of early diagnosis and isolation. Importantly, our analysis identifies a threshold where early diagnosis of pre-symptomatic individuals, combined with a sufficient level of effective isolation, can lead to an epidemic control of Ebola virus disease. Furthermore, the need to incorporate vital dynamics is justified by our still limited understanding of Ebola infection including whether or not Ebola virus may persist among recovered individuals.
