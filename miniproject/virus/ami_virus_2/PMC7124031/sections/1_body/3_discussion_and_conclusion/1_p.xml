<p id="Par26">The Ebola epidemic has shown us major weaknesses not only in health systems in West Africa, but also in our global capacity to respond early to an outbreak with effective diagnostic capacities. After multiple outbreaks of infectious diseases, from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), we still do not have effective diagnostic tools to rapidly respond to a number of potential epidemics. The main reason why we lack of such diagnostic preparedness against infectious diseases is because of the lack of a financed global strategy that can be implemented ahead, rather than during an epidemic. This strategy must primarily focus on two critical aspects: First, a continuous interaction between the field to detect small outbreaks and collect samples, and reference laboratories with advanced sequencing tools to identify the pathogen. Second, the need of assay development for early diagnosis, their regulatory approval, and a plan of implementation in anticipation of an outbreak.</p>
