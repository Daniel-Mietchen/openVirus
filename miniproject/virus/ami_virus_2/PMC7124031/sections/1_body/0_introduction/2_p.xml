<p id="Par3">The Ebola virus is transmitted as a result of direct contact with bodily fluids containing the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The virus enters via small skin lesions and mucus membranes where it is able to infect macrophages and other phagocytic innate immune cells leading to the production of a large number of viral particles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The macrophages, monocytes, and dendritic cells infected in the early stage of the disease serve to spread the virus throughout the organs, particularly in the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consequently, critically ill patients display intensive viremia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recognizing signs of Ebola viral disease is challenging because it causes common non-specific symptoms such as fever, weakness, diarrhea, and vomiting, and the incubation period typically lasts 5â€“7 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, functioning laboratories and effective point-of-care diagnostic tests are critically needed in order to minimize transmission, allow better allocation of scarce healthcare resources, and increase the likelihood of success of antiviral treatments as they are developed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].
