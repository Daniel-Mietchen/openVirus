<p id="Par2">The Ebola viral strains are re-emerging zoonotic pathogens and members of the Filoviridae family consisting of five distinct species: 
 <italic>Bundibugyo, Cotes dâ€™Ivoire, Reston, Sudan</italic>, and 
 <italic>Zaire</italic> with a high case-fatality rate in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Filoviruses are long filamentous enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded viruses, consisting of a negative-sense RNA genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Each Ebola species genome encodes seven linearly arranged genes: nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase cofactor (VP35), matrix protein (VP40), glycoprotein (GP), replication-transcription protein (VP30), matrix protein (VP24), and RNA-dependent RNA prolymerase (L) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While there are no proven effective vaccines or effective antiviral drugs for Ebola, containing an outbreak relies on contact tracing and on early detection of infected individuals for isolation and care in treatment centers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The most recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which began in December 2013, due to the Zaire strain, demonstrated several weaknesses in the medical infrastructure of the affected countries, including the urgent need of effective diagnostics, which have a fundamental role in both disease control and case management.
