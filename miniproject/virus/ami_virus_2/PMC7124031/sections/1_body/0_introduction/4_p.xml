<p id="Par5">In this chapter, we extend the work presented in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Here, we have developed and analyzed a mathematical model to evaluate the impact of early diagnosis of pre-symptomatic individuals on the transmission dynamics of Ebola virus disease in West Africa, under the assumption that the disease is maintained possibly at very low levels due to the deficiencies in health systems and our incomplete understanding of Ebola infection as illustrated by the case of Pauline Cafferkey. Therefore, eliminating Ebola may require a more sustained and long-term control effort.
