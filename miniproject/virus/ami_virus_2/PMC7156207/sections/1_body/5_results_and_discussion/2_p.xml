<p id="p0040">To evaluate the homology of ACE2s in different species, we built a phylogenetic tree haboring ACE2s of 253 vertebrate species (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Fig. S1</xref>). The tree was branched to two major groups. The first group included the classes of Mammalia, Aves and Reprilia, and the second group included the classes of Amphibian, Chondrichthyes and Teleostomi. This tree indicated that besides mammalia, ACE2s of aves and reprilia were more likely to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 than other vertebrates. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> , among mammals, human ACE2 was clustered with bat, civet and swine ACE2s but not mouse ACE2, matching the previous report about the utilizing capability by SARS-CoV-2 of these ACE2s. Intriguingly, cat, pangolin, cow and goat ACE2s were also clustered with human ACE2. Considering the widespread of stray cats, wildlife markets and stock farms, it was not strange that these animals could serve as potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, it was reported in the local news that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pangolins, though further verification is required.
