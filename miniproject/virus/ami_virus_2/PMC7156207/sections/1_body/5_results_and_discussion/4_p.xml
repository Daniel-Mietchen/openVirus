<p id="p0050">In summary, we combined phylogenetic analysis and critical site marking to predict the utilizing capability of ACE2s from different animal species by SARS-CoV-2. The results from these two analysis matched each other quite well, indicating relative reliability of our prediction. We have shown that, besides currently confirmed ACE2s utilized by SARS-CoV-2, pangolin, cat, cow, buffalo, goat, sheep and pigeon ACE2s might be utilized by SARS-CoV-2, indicating potential interspecies transmission of the virus from bats to these animals and among these animals. Considering the widespread existing of these animals, some of them might serve as intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, which called for the attention in disease control. However, these are still preliminary results predicted by sequence analysis which cannot accurately reflect the infection in the animals, and more laboratory and epidemiological investigation are required to uncover the true intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.</p>
