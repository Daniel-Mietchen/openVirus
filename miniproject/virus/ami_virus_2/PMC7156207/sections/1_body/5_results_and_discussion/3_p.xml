<p id="p0045">We further tried to predict the receptor utilizing capability by SARS-CoV-2 via looking into the critical single aa polymorphism in different ACE2s. We screened the aa sites critical for SARS-CoV-2 utilization by two approaches. First, it has been proved that human, Chinese horseshoe bats, civet and swine ACE2s can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 but mouse ACE2 cannot [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We aligned the aa sequence of these five ACE2s (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">File S2</xref>). Eleven aa residues distinct in mouse ACE2 but conserved in other ACE2s were identified, which were T20, Y83, S218, A246, K353, P426, T593, N636, A714, R716 and A774. However, according to the complex structure of human ACE2 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein (PDB ID: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6VW1" id="intref0010" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6VW1</ext-link>), only three of the eleven sites are located near the interface and potentially mediate the binding, which were T20, Y83 and K353 (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A). Second, SARS-CoV-2 shares an identity of 74.6% with SARS-CoV in the aa sequences of their RBDs, and thus the aa residues critical for the receptor binding of SARS-CoV may be also critical for SARS-CoV-2. According to the previous study, such critical sites include K31, Y41, K68, Y83, K353, D355, R357 and M383 [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Among these sites, K31D, Y41A, Y83F, K353 H/A/D, D355A and R357A abolish or strongly inhibit SARS-CoV binding, while the substitutions on K68 and M383 slightly inhibit SARS-CoV binding [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Combining the two screening, we got nine critical aa sites as shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B. Based on these sites, we established a marking system to evaluate the utilizing capability by SARS-CoV-2 of different ACE2s. In the system, the initial score for every ACE2 was 100 and substitution on the critical sites would result in reduction of 50 marks (for K31D, Y41A, Y83F, K353 H/A/D, D355A and R357A) or 10 marks (for other substitutions). K31T and Y41H would not reduce the scores since these two substitutions exist in civet and Chinese horseshoe bat ACE2s, respectively (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). A final score less than 0 was adjusted to 0. As the result, a final score equal to or less than 50 means that the ACE2 contains either at least one substitution that will abolish the receptor binding or at least five other substitutions that will make it quite different from human ACE2. Therefore, the ACE2s with final scores higher than 50 were considered to be potentially utilized by SARS-CoV-2, while those with scores less or equal to 50 were unlikely to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. The final scores for all ACE2s we analysed were listed in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table S1</xref>. As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> , excluding the animals unlikely contacted by people, pangolin, cat, cow, buffalo, goat and sheep ACE2 were ranked as the top mammals that could be potentially used by SARS-CoV-2, while murine ACE2s, such as mouse and rat ACE2s, got the lowest scores. As for birds, pigeon ACE2 reached the highest score of 70 (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Though birds are not natural reserviors for currently know species of betacoronavirus, the classification of coronaviruses is based on the genome feature not the host range, and thus we could not exclude the possibility that new betacoronavirus may infect birds. Considering pigeons are food in many places around the world, more attention should be paid on the non-mammalian hosts of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 of 
 <italic>Protobothrops mucrosquamatus</italic> (pallas pit viper), a common snake, got a score of 20, indicating that reprilia ACE2s were unlikely to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. To verify the robustness of our ranking system, we labelled the utilizing capability of different ACE2s on the phylogenetic tree, and found that the ACE2s confirmed or potential to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 (labelled with circles) were obviously clustered from those unlikely to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 (labelled with triangles) (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The well matching with the phylogenetic tree elevated the liability of this marking system.
