<p id="p0015">SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped non-segmented positive sense RNA viruses classified into the 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> subgenus of the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> in the subfamily 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic>, together with other severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs), such as SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Occasional interspecies transmission of virus is believed to be a major cause of coronavirus epidemic. SARS-CoV-2 has a high genetic relationship with a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13) with a 96% genomic nucleotide sequence identity. The close phylogenetic relationship to Bat RaTG13 provides evidence for a bat origin of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans is unlikely due to the lack of direct contact between bats and humans. Hence, there are probably intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans. This speculation is supported by the reports about the intermediate hosts of other human coronaviruses. For instance, SARS-CoV, the coronavirus causing SARS epidemic in 2003, was also originated from bats [

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], but it transmitted to human via a variety of intermediate hosts including masked palm civet cats and raccoon dogs [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since native reservoir hosts of viruses usually live far away from human community, intermediate hosts play critical roles in transmitting viruses to human and causing epidemics. A common way to determine the intermediate hosts is to collect all animals in the original epidemic area and detect the virus in them one by one, which is quite time- and labour-consuming and also is easy to be biased by passive contamination of the samples.
