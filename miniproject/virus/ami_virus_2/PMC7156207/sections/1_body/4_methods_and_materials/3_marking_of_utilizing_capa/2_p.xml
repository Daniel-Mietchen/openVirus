<p id="p0035">The critical aa sites for the utilization by SARS-CoV-2 were selected by picking the unique aa residues in mouse ACE2 which distinct from human ACE2 and the sites reported to be critical for the receptor binding of SARS-CoV in the previous study [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The initial mark for every ACE2 was 100 and the substitution on each critical sites resulted in a reduction of its mark of 50 (for substitutions reported to abolish the receptor binding of SARS-CoV) or 10 (for other substitutions). The utilizing capability by SARS-CoV-2 of the ACE2s were ranked by the final scores and ACE2s with scores &gt;50 were considered to be potentially utilized by SARS-CoV-2.
