 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (human), 
 <italic>Rhinolophus sinicus</italic> (Chinese horseshoe bat), 
 <italic>Paguma Larvata</italic> (civet), 
 <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> (swine) and 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mouse) were downloaded from UniProt Knowledgebase; the rest of 248 vertebrate species were downloaded from GenBank (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">File S1</xref>). Multiple sequence alignment was performed for the whole aa sequences of ACEs using MAFFT with a local alignment strategy FFT-NS-2. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by MEGA7 using the neighbour-joining (NJ) method with 1000 bootstrap replicates and visualized using FigTree.
