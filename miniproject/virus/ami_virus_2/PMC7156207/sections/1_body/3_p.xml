<p id="p0025">In this study, we combined the phylogenetic analysis and critical site comparison of ACE2 to predict the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2. First, we collected the aa sequences of ACE2s of 253 species and built a phylogenetic tree to cluster the ACE2s based on their evolutionary distance. In the tree, the ACE2s of species close to Chinese horseshoe bats, civet or swine but far from mouse were more likely to be utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Second, we aligned the aa sequences of ACE2s of Chinese horseshoe bats, civet, swine and mouse to identify the sites critical for SARS-CoV-2 utilization; then we ranked the ACE2s of other species according to their aa substitution on these sites. The top hits were selected to be the candidates potentially utilized by SARS-CoV-2. Combining the results obtained by the two methods and considering the living animals, we predicted pangolin, cat, cow, buffalo, goat, sheep and pigeon as the potential intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2, together with civet or swine. These results may help the screening for the intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, contributing to the study of the viral transmission and disease control.</p>
