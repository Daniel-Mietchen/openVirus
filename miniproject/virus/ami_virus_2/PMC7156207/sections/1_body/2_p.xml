<p id="p0020">Receptor recognition is an important factor determining host range and cross-species infection of viruses. Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been proved to be the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. ACE2 was initially identified as an exopeptidase expressed in vascular endothelial cells in the heart and the kidney that catalyses the conversion of angiotensins [
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Later, ACE2 was well known for its function as the virus receptor of SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Utilization of ACE2 as the receptor by SARS-CoV-2 is an important rationale to classify SARS-CoV-2 to the same subgenus as SARS-CoV. ACE2 is expressed in most vertebrates, but not all ACEs can be utilized by SARS-CoV-2 as the receptor. Currently studies demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is able to use Chinese horseshoe bats, civet, swine but not mouse ACE2 as its entry receptor [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Obviously, the utilizing capability of ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 can be used for quick screening to narrow down the range of the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2. We intended to predict the utilizing capability by SARS-CoV-2 of different ACE2s via amino acid (aa) sequence comparison. Unfortunately, the aa identities between human ACE2 and ACE2s of Chinese horseshoe bats, civet, swine and mouse, are 80.75%, 83.48%, 81.37%, 82.11%, respectively. Mouse ACE2 which cannot be used by SARS-CoV-2 show higher similarity to human ACE2 than those of Chinese horseshoe bats and swine which can be used by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that whole aa sequence identities is not a good marker for predicting utilizing capability by SARS-CoV-2.
