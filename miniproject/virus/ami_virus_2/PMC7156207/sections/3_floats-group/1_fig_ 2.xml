  <p>Critical amino acid sites predicted for the utilization of SARS-CoV-2. (A) The structure of the binding complex of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The structure was adapted from Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 6VW1) and the aa residues distinct in mouse ACE2 (T20, Y83, S218, A246, K353, P426 and T593) are labelled with red. N636, A714, R716 and A774 are not included in the structure, since they are too far away from the interface and were not crystallized in the structure analysis. (B) The aa sequences of 
   <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (Human), 
   <italic>Rhinolophus sinicus</italic> (Bat), 
   <italic>Paguma Larvata</italic> (Civet), 
   <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> (swine) and 
   <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mouse) ACE2s were aligned. The critical sites identified by the alignment were highlighted with yellow background. The critical sites reported in SARS-CoV binding are highlighted with red font.
