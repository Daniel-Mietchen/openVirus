<p id="p0135">COVID-19 and other emerging infectious disease pandemic/epidemics represent a sobering reality of our increasingly connected world. Such events demand adaptation and response from our entire healthcare system. Psychiatrists—particularly psychiatrists working at the interface of medicine and mental health—will be challenged in unprecedented ways as frontline mental health providers. Epidemic CL psychiatry will demand creative new models of advocacy and care delivery, more engagement by CL psychiatry with staff support and social education interventions, and management of heretofore unanticipated risks. The roles we identify for psychiatrists are aspirational. No service, no matter how well staffed, can fill each of these roles. But working as a community of clinicians and researchers, we can strive to meet the needs on the individual, institutional, and societal level. These challenges are also opportunities: opportunities for our field to grow and evolve in its roles, opportunities to push scholarship in mental health in new directions, and, most importantly, opportunities to support our patients and communities in a moment of great need.</p>
