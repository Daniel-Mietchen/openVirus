<p id="p0130">Ensuring that our medical collaborators understand the roles of psychiatry in the context of epidemic response is a particular challenge given our own field only beginning to understand and define this role. Early in our hospital's epidemic response, psychiatrists were excluded from some of the mandates (for instance, the travel ban), suggesting a systemic lack of understanding about the role of psychiatrists in pandemic/epidemic response. Our approach to combating this lack of understanding is twofold: first, to work assiduously as a service to respond to the needs of our patients, institution, and community. Second, to document, operationalize, and share the multifaceted work that we find ourselves called to do at every stage of the pandemic/epidemic response. Sharing our contributions with our institutions and our discipline allows us to identify to ourselves and others how we can best be of use, and also to improve best practices across our entire community.</p>
