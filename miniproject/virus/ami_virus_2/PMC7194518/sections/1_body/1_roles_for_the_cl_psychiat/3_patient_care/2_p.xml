<p id="p0025">In the epidemic/pandemic context, mental health clinicians need to tailor their patient care in several ways. Perhaps most acutely, for patients affected by COVID-19, our ability to control mental health comorbidities and manage behavioral agitation in conditions like delirium may be key for maximizing the number of patients able to receive high quality medical care. Patients in the ICU or hospital ward setting who are behaviorally dysregulated require disproportionately high workforce and resource investments. In epidemic scenarios, poorly managed psychotic or delirious patients may literally preclude stretched-thin staff from caring for other people in need. Aggressive management of behavioral dysregulation and high-quality care of underlying psychiatric disorders even in the setting of comorbid infection is key to improving both individual and communal outcomes. To minimize exposure and mitigate the loss of workforce to quarantines, psychiatric consultation can be done through video platforms as well as in person.</p>
