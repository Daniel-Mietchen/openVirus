<p id="p0020">We identify and comment on five general roles that CL psychiatrists and other mental health clinicians should be filling in epidemic/pandemic situations: patient care, advocacy, scholarship, staff support, and system support/public health. We discuss each below. As a note, many of the roles we discuss below are aspirational, and likely impossible for any individual service to take on. But in delineating the need, our community can respond collectively to fill these roles.</p>
