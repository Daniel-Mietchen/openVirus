<p id="p0085">CL psychiatrists are accustomed to formulating clinical problems in terms of a variety of systems, levels of system organization, and interactions between systems, depending on which formulation will yield the most fruitful intervention. For example, we may focus in one case on metabolic derangements (organ systems), and in another on interpersonal conflicts (social systems) as of etiologic relevance and as targets for intervention. Pandemic infectious disease stresses systems across a variety of domains. Although CL psychiatry has largely focused on individual biological and psychological systems and on interpersonal interactions within medical care systems, the context of the pandemic/epidemic demands that we extend our skills to broader social systems as well. For instance, can psychiatrists assist in devising mass interventions aimed at encouraging the public to participate in prevention strategies like social distancing and voluntary quarantine?</p>
