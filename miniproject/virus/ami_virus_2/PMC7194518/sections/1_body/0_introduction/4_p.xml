<p id="p0015">While much of the early scholarly work on COVID-19 has focused on intensive care, emergency care, and primary care, prior emerging infectious disease epidemics have demonstrated that the role of mental health clinicians is key on multiple levels. This is particularly true of consultation-liaison psychiatrists, who possess expertise at working individually, institutionally, and systemically at the intersection of mental and physical health. Given the unprecedented scope of COVID-19, operationalizing the potential roles of psychiatrists in general, and CL psychiatrists in particular
 <bold>,</bold> is essential for a coordinated response. Here we set out potential key roles of CL psychiatrists in the context of COVID-19 and future epidemic/pandemic scenarios, and use our experience at a COVID-affected medical center to identify and problem-solve challenges in filling those roles.
