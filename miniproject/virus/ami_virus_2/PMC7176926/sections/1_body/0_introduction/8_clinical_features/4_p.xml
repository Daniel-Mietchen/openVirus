<p id="p0080">Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 may have an unfavourable clinical course with the onset of dyspnoea within 5 days, ARDS within 8 days in 30% of cases, and the need for invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in 17% and 4% of cases, respectively [

Although this could be explained by a direct renal cytopathic effect induced by the virus, since DDP4 receptors are largely represented in tubules and glomeruli, it seems more probable that the high percentage of AKI reported is due to multiorgan failure, which occurs more frequently in MERS than in the other coronavirus infections [
