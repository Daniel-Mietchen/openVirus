 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> the main clinical characteristics from the three most significant case series of COVID-19 cases are listed and compared with the most recently available data about SARS and MERS. The median age of the COVID-19 cases ranges from 49 to 57 years (similar to SARS and MERS), higher in those admitted to the ICU; up to 50% of patients reported a chronic comorbid illness in a slightly lower percentage compared to patients diagnosed with MERS. The most common presenting symptom is fever, followed by cough, sore throat and dyspnoea; all of the infected patients had at least one of these symptoms. However, according to the CCDC report, 81% of the cases had mild symptoms and 1.2% were asymptomatic [
