<p id="p0055">The reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) of the novel infection is estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to range between 2 and 2.5, which is higher than that for SARS (1.7–1.9) and MERS (&lt;1), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher pandemic potential [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>]. However, it must be noted that some published studies have estimated an R
 <sub>0</sub> for SARS reaching the value of 4 [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent review by Liu and colleagues has shown that the average reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 3.28, with a median value of 2.79, thus exceeding the WHO estimates [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Nonetheless, in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> we report only the WHO data, since the estimation of R
 <sub>0</sub> depends on the estimation method used, and the current estimate can be biased by insufficient data and the short onset times of the diseases, as Liu and colleagues also state.
