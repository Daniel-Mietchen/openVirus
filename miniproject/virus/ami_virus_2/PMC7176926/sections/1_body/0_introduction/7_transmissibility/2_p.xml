<p id="p0060">According to a recent large descriptive study carried out by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) on 44 672 individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 in China, the fatality rate of the novel coronavirus infection is estimated to be 2.3% [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], lower than that of SARS (9.5%) and much lower than that of MERS (34.4%) [

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Interestingly, according to the CCDC, the case fatality rate in the Hubei province, where the epidemic started, is seven-fold higher than in other provinces [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This could be related to the fact that, among the 44 672 cases reported by the CCDC, 10 567 cases (14.6%) were diagnosed only clinically and exclusively in the Hubei province. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that clinically diagnosed cases presented with a more severe clinical picture, thus increasing the case fatality rate [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. After the change of the case definition, the number of cases increased due to the inclusion of cases cumulated over the previous weeks. The question is: were mild cases registered at all? It is not a minor matter, because including mild cases will reduce the mortality rate. Indeed, the number of infected cases outside of China is currently 24 727, with 484 fatal outcomes, a mortality rate of 1.9% [
