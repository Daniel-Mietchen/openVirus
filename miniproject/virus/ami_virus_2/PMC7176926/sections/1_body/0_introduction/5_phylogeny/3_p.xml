<p id="p0040">Phylogenetic tree analysis of the novel coronavirus showed that SARS-CoV-2 belongs, together with SARS-CoV and Bat SARS-like coronavirus, to a different clade from MERS-CoV, and it is more phylogenetically related to Bat SARS-like coronaviruses (isolated in China from horseshoe bats between 2015 and 2018) than to SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref> ). This suggests a different viral evolution from SARS and MERS, involving bats as a wild reservoir [

Genomic comparison between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 has shown that there are only 380 amino acid substitutions between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like coronaviruses, mostly concentrated in the non-structural protein genes, while 27 mutations have been found in genes encoding the viral spike protein S responsible for receptor binding and cell entry [
