<p id="p0035">SARS-CoV-2 possesses a genomic structure which is typical of other betacoronaviruses. Like other coronaviruses, its genome contains 14 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 27 proteins. The ORF1 and ORF2 at the 5′-terminal region of the genome encode 15 non-structural proteins important for virus replication [
