<p id="p0045">Accumulating evidence based on genomic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 shares with SARS-CoV the same human cell receptor, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while MERS-CoV uses dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter host cells (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is well established that SARS-CoV emerged as a human pathogen thanks to favourable mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein which increased its pathogenicity by strengthening its affinity with the receptor; it is therefore assumed that SARS-CoV-2 has behaved in a similar way [
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, in SARS-CoV-2 no amino acid substitutions were present in the RBD that directly interacts with human receptor ACE2 compared with SARS-CoV, but six mutations occurred in other regions of the RBD [

Analysis of receptor affinity shows that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 more efficiently than the 2003 strain of SARS-CoV, although less efficiently than the 2002 strain [
