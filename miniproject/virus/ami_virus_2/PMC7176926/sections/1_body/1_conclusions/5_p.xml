<p id="p0105">The differences in the intrinsic virulence of the viruses themselves can explain the different capacity for spreading. MERS-CoV has a higher mortality but a lower transmissibility, probably because it causes a more severe clinical picture than COVID-19 and SARS, requiring hospitalization more frequently, thus reducing the community spread of the infection and increasing the nosocomial transmission [

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the other hand, the apparent higher mortality of MERS could be biased by the fact that most of the data available on MERS were derived from hospitalized patients, thus implicating a more severe clinical picture than community-acquired cases [

This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that, when the cohort of patients with MERS was derived from the community and not from hospital outbreaks, the mortality rate decreased to 10%, as was observed in a cohort study carried out in 2015 in Saudi Arabia [
