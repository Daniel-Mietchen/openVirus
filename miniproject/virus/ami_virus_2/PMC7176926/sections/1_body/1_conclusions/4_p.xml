 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, in patients affected by COVID-19, viral load progressively decreases within days, following a different pattern from SARS in which the highest shedding is recorded after 10Â days from symptom onset [

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>]. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may spread more easily in the community than SARS even when initial mild symptoms or no symptoms are present.
