<p id="p0110">Interestingly, despite the high virological similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhoea seem to be much more common in SARS, although the proportion of SARS patients with gastrointestinal symptoms varies among different studies, from 23% to 70% in the Toronto outbreak and in the Hong Kong community outbreak, respectively [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Such a difference could be related to the fact that the Hong Kong outbreak seemed to originate from a faecal contamination of a residential complex due to a faulty sewage system, while the Toronto outbreak was caused mainly by nosocomial hospital droplet transmission [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The gastrointestinal route of transmission has also been hypothesized for MERS-CoV through the consumption of infected camel milk; moreover, gastrointestinal transmission has been demonstrated in the animal model through intestinal DPP4 receptors [
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. From this finding, the reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the loose stools of the first US patient with COVID-19 is not surprising [
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. SARS-CoV replicates in the enteric epithelium by binding to the ACE2 receptor, and it cannot be excluded that SARS-CoV-2 would behave in the same way [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This may contribute to the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted via this route; there is also evidence that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV remain viable in environmental conditions that could facilitate faecal–oral transmission [

 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> we provide a synthesis of what is certain about COVID-19 to date and what needs to be further addressed.
