<p id="p0095">What are the causes of such different abilities to spread among these three viruses? A first hypothesis is a different viral tropism for the respiratory tract, resulting in a milder but highly transmissible disease when the virus replicates in the upper respiratory tract, and a severe pneumonia with lower spreading potential when the viral tropism is higher for the lower respiratory tract. This hypothesis derives from the example of the influenza viruses, namely seasonal influenza viruses H1N1 and H3N2. They preferably bind α-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors of the upper respiratory tract, usually causing a less severe but more transmissible disease than avian influenza H5N1 or H7N9, which preferably bind α-2,3-linked sialic acid in the lung alveoli, causing severe pneumonia [

Moreover, other human coronaviruses, such as NL63-CoV, cause a mild illness even if they bind to the same receptor as SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [

So, in our opinion, it is likely that the different inoculum dose at the time of infection makes the difference in terms of severity of the disease; heavy inoculum exposures seem to be linked to a greater penetration into the lower respiratory tract, causing severe pneumonia, whereas lower inoculum exposures allow viruses to only reach the upper airway, causing a milder infection.
