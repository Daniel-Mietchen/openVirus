<p>Viral culture is the gold standard for diagnosing influenza viral infections. This approach includes inoculation of the corresponding cell lines, such as Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK), A549, and rhesus monkey kidney (LLC MK2), with clinical samples, propagation for seven to 10 days to monitor the development of cytopathic effect (CPE), and final confirmation of influenza virus infection by hemadsorption using erythrocytes, specific antibody staining or immunofluorescence microscopy.

 </xref> IFA has been used since the 1960s. It directly stains respiratory epithelial cells derived from nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs with fluorescently labeled influenza virus‐specific antibodies.

 </xref> Currently, several FDA‐approved enzyme‐linked immunosorbent (ELISA)‐based tests are available for diagnosis of influenza virus infections. However, ELISA‐based tests often show lower sensitivity compared with nucleic acid‐based methods. A novel immunoassay based on europium nanoparticles has been developed to rapidly detect 29 strains of influenza A and 10 strains of influenza B viruses with high sensitivity and specificity.
