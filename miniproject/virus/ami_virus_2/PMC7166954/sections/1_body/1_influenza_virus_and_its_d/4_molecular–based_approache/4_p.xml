<p>In addition to the above approaches, the DNA‐microarray‐based approach has been developed to detect influenza viruses, offering a novel tool for accurate and rapid diagnosis of influenza epidemics or pandemics. This assay uses multiple oligonucleotides specially designed to target conserved sequences encoding HA, NA and M proteins of influenza A and B viruses.

 </xref> For instance, Zhao's research group has developed a gold nanoparticle‐based genomic microarray assay, which is able to differentiate H5N1 viruses from the major seasonal influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2). This can be explained by oligonucleotides which are designed on the basis of consensus sequence of the HA and NA genes of the H5N1 virus and M gene of H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 viruses.

 </xref> The same group has expanded the platform and designed specific oligonucleotides for HA, NA and M genes of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, enabling the detection of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and distinguish it from other influenza A viruses.
