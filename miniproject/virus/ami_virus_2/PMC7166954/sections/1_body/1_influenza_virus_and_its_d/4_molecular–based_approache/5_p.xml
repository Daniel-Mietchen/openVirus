 </xref> Recently, a high‐throughput whole genome sequencing (WGS) method with the MinION portable sequencer was developed to test influenza A and B viruses, as subsequently validated by the Illumina MiSeq platform. The overall accuracy, precision, as well as recall rates, were 99.95%, 97.88%, and 89.41%, respectively, from 1D reads and 99.97%, 99.86%, and 93.28%, respectively, from 1D
 <sup>2</sup> reads.
