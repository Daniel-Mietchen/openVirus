<p>Influenza viruses belong to the family of 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>. This family consists of five genera (influenza A virus, influenza B virus, influenza C virus, Thogotovirus, and Isavirus), which are classified based on internal nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix (M) proteins. Among these genera, only influenza A and influenza B viruses cause clinical diseases. Influenza B viral infections usually cause localized outbreaks, whereas influenza A virus is the primary pathogen for human infections and, thus, the major cause of large influenza epidemics and pandemics.

 </xref> Based on the glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are located on the viral surface, influenza A viruses are divided into various subtypes. Until now, 18 HA (H1‐H18) and 11 NA (N1‐N11) subtypes have been identified.

 </xref> A number of diagnostic approaches, including virus isolation, as well as some emerging molecular‐based approaches, have been used to detect influenza viruses in clinical laboratories.
