<p>Coronaviruses belong to the family of 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>. Bats have been recognized as natural reservoir and vectors of a variety of coronaviruses and the viruses have crossed species barriers to infect humans and many other different kinds of animals, including avians, rodents, and chiropters.

 </xref> So far, six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified, including HCoV‐229E, HCoV‐HKU1, HCoV‐OC43, HCoV‐NL63, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS‐CoV).

 </xref> MERS‐CoV is a human coronavirus first reported in June 2012 that can cause human respiratory diseases.

 </xref> It has been classified as a lineage C β‐coronavirus, and its structure comprises a ~30 kb positive‐sense, single‐stranded RNA genome, which is closely related to the lineage C β‐coronaviruses of

 </xref> By genomic analysis of lineage C β‐coronaviruses, human MERS‐CoV has shown high similarities to MERS‐CoV derived from camels with &gt;99.5% nucleotide identities, suggesting that the human and camel isolates belong to the same coronavirus species.

 </xref> As of September 30, 2019, 2468 laboratory‐confirmed cases of MERS‐CoV infections, including 851 deaths in 27 countries, have been reported to WHO (

Because no commercial vaccines or therapeutic treatments are currently available for MERS, rapid and accurate diagnosis of MERS‐CoV is important for the prevention of its transmission and outbreaks.
