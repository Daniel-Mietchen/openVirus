<p>A duplex RT‐PCR method has been developed based on primers and probes targeting the conserved spike S2 gene of SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV. By using pUC57SARS‐pS2 as a template for SARS‐CoV and pGEM‐MERSS2 as a template for MERS‐CoV, respectively, adequate detection limits of 50 to 100 copies/mL were achieved.

 </xref> The singleplex RT‐iiPCR assays are designed to detect MERS‐CoV envelope gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) genes separately. Compared to the reference singleplex RT‐qPCR assay, the sensitivities of the singleplex MERS‐CoV ORF1a and upE RT‐iiPCR assays are 99.03% and 100%, respectively.
