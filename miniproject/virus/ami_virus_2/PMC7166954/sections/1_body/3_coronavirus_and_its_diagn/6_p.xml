<p>In the RT‐LAMP assay, two primer sets were constructed with one set targeting the N gene and one set targeting the ORF1a gene. Both sets have shown high efficiency in amplifying target sequences derived from different MERS‐CoV strains with no cross‐reactivity observed with other respiratory viruses.

 </xref> Huang's research group has established a nucleic acid visualization technique that combines the RT‐LAMP technique and a vertical flow visualization strip (RT‐LAMP‐VF) to detect the N gene of MERS‐CoV.

 </xref> The RT‐LAMP‐VF assay can detect 2 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μL of synthesized RNA transcript and 1 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies/μL of MERS‐CoV RNA without cross‐reactivity to multiple SARS‐related‐CoVs, including HKU1, HKU4, OC43 and 229E, thus exhibiting high specificity.
