<p>RT‐LAMP and RT‐LAMP‐VF mentioned above are assays for rapid and accurate detection of MERS‐CoV infection. Bonhan Kooa's team designed an arch‐shaped multiple‐target sensor capable of rapid pathogen identification using direct amplification in clinical samples. The method can detect a variety of viruses including MERS‐CoV with high sensitivity and specificity and is able to distinguish MERS‐CoV from HCoV in clinical samples within 20 minutes.

 </xref> The TaqMan probe‐based one‐step rRT‐PCR assays provide rapid and sensitive internal diagnostic detection of MERS‐CoV by detecting the upE and open reading frame (ORF) 1b. This method is reliable, specific and reproducible. In addition, different from the traditional two‐step sample detection method, the one‐step method combines two steps into one step, thus increasing the sensitivity of the measurement, for example, &lt;10 and ≦50 copies of RNA template per reaction for upE and ORF1b, respectively.

 </xref> The MAb‐based rapid NP detection method for MERS‐CoV was used for preliminary rapid screening of MERS‐CoV infection due to its high specificity but moderate sensitivity. The detection limit of this assay is about 10
