<p>Six commercially available MERS‐CoV RNA detection kits based on rRT‐PCR are available, including AccuPower (Bioneer, Korea), Anyplex (Seegene, Korea), DiaPlexQ (SolGent, Korea), LightMix (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Switzerland), UltraFast kits (Nanobiosys, Korea) and PowerChek (Kogene Biotech, Korea). The PowerChek MERS Real‐time PCR, Anyplex II MERS‐CoV (upE) Real‐time Detection and DiaPlexQ MERS Virus Detection kits consist of two steps. A single gene targets the upstream region of the upE region for screening, and multiple genes target both upE and ORF1a regions for final confirmation.

 </xref> The AccuPower MERS‐CoV Real Time RT‐PCR, LightMix Molecular Dx MERS‐CoV upE/ORF1a, and UltraFast LabChip MERSCoV Real‐time PCR kits use two single gene‐targeting reagents to detect the upE and ORF1a genes simultaneously.

 </xref> No cross‐reactivity has been reported with other respiratory viruses. Based on the validation tests, including 28 specificity panels and 9 clinical specimens, the sensitivity and specificity of all these rRT‐PCR kits for detecting upE and ORF1a reach 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60‐1.00) and 100% (95% CI, 0.79‐1.00), respectively. Based on results from the high inhibition panel, AccuPower and PowerChek have lowest sensitivity to the presence of PCR inhibition.

 </xref> Therefore, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the above six rRT‐PCR kits are sufficient for diagnosing MERS‐CoV infection.
