<p>The following novel PCR detection methods have been established by modification of the conventional PCR approach. For example, real‐time quantitative PCR (RT‐qPCR) is a rapid, specific, and sensitive TaqMan PCR method for detection, subgrouping, and quantitation of pathogens. This assay increases the sensitivity of conventional PCR. It needs two sets of primer‐probe pairs, which come from the nucleotide sequence of nucleocapsid (N) gene or Fusion (F) gene targeting RSV‐A and RSV‐B, respectively.

 </xref> A quantitative TaqMan PCR assay was once used to detect 175 nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained from children with respiratory symptoms in Hong Kong, and it detected 36 RSV‐positive samples, including 10 as RSV‐A and 26 as RSV‐B. In contrast, a cell culture‐based assay only identified 21, and an immunofluorescence assay identified 32 RSV‐positive specimens, all of which were among those identified by the TaqMan PCR assay, suggesting the greater accuracy and sensitivity of the TaqMan PCR assay.

 </xref> indicating that OTNRT‐PCR is more sensitive than RT‐qPCR for detection of RSV in clinical samples. Moreover, the rapid reverse‐transcription recombinase‐aided amplification (RT‐RAA) assay was developed as a molecular‐based diagnostic method to detect subgroup RSV A and B genomes in clinical specimens. This method mainly utilizes an enzyme mixture, including single‐strand DNA binding protein (SSB), recombinase UvsX, and DNA polymerase, to detect RNA amplicons of RSV.

 </xref> It is performed at 39°C in less than 30 minutes with high specificity. Furthermore, reverse transcription strand invasion‐based amplification (RT‐SIBA) is reverse transcription isothermal nucleic acid amplification for rapid detection of RSV with good sensitivity since it can detect as few as 10 copies of RSV RNA within 20 minutes.

 </xref> RT‐SIBA does not need highly purified RNA for detection of RSV, which can reduce the complexity of specimen preparation and shorten the total detection cycle in clinical specimens.
