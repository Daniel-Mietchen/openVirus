<p>Semiconductor quantum dots can be used for biological and biomedical applications because of their unique size‐dependent optical and electronic features. The assay detects RSV F protein using thioglycolate (TGA)‐coated cadmium telluride (CdTe) particles, which are bioconjugated with RSV anti‐F protein mAb.

 </xref> It overcomes some of DFA's disadvantage, such as relatively low sensitivity, because of the background staining, and the rapid fading of the dye. Also, this assay is more sensitive than RT‐PCT. By probing F and G proteins with QDs, confocal microscopy could detect the progression of RSV infection in the HEp‐2 cell line, and this method was found to be more sensitive compared to RT‐PCR.
