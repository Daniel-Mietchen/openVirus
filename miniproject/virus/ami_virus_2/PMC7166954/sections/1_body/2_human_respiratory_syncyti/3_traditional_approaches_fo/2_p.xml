<p>ELISA and immunofluorescence assays are traditional assays to identify RSV. However, a modified ELISA method has been developed, targeting RSV F protein and it can detect RSV within 25 minutes at low cost.

 </xref> The immunofluorescence assay can rapidly detect RSV antigens using a fluorescence‐tagged primary or secondary antibody. For example, the direct fluorescent antibody assay (DFA), which requires a certain number of cells in the specimen, with a sensitivity and specificity of 94% and 96.8%, respectively, is widely used for detection of RSV in clinical laboratories because of its simplicity and rapidity. For this reason, this assay has particular use in resource‐limited countries since it can potentially eliminate prolonged hospitalization and unnecessary use of antibiotics.
