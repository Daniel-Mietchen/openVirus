<p>Human RSV is a nonsegmented, negative‐sense and single‐stranded RNA virus of the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family. The genome of RSV includes ten genes that encode eleven proteins. RSV can be classified into subgroups A and B according to the genome sequence and the reactivity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the surface glycoprotein (G) and fusion protein (F).
