<p>Respiratory viruses are a major cause of symptomatic respiratory tract infection in all age groups worldwide. Timely and accurate diagnosis of these viruses enables appropriate treatment of infections. Traditional and modern molecular diagnostic approaches with their advantages, disadvantages and principles, are summarized for several common respiratory viruses, such as influenza virus, human RSV, coronavirus, hAdV, and rhinovirus, as discussed in this review. However, these respiratory viruses are prone to antigenic drift caused by point mutations in viral genes, and new strains with pandemic potential may result from gene reassortment. All of these continue to pose new challenges to rapid and accurate detection of respiratory virus infection in humans. Therefore, the identification of mutations within viral genomes is quite essential. However, efforts to pinpoint genetic mutations in human respiratory viruses have relied on high‐throughput sequencing of single genes or gene families using Sanger sequencing. Although this approach has been fruitful, the cost and throughput of Sanger sequencing generally prohibits systematic sequencing of the ~22 000 genes that make up the exome. The recent development of NGS technologies changed this paradigm by providing the capability to rapidly sequence exomes, transcriptomes, and genomes at relatively low cost. The application of NGS in diagnosis and identification of respiratory pathogens especially for patients with severe pneumonia or those with unknown origin infections becomes more and more popular. NGS exhibited the ability to detect coinfections in severe pneumonia patients and performed well in diagnosing severe pneumonia compared to conventional methods. As an infrequently circulating genotype, genomic characterization of the whole genome of a viral strain will promote further studies on its epidemiology and pathogenicity, and aid the diagnosis of a new emerging respiratory virus. WGS enables better identification of transmission events and outbreaks, which is not always possible with sub‐genomic sequences.</p>
