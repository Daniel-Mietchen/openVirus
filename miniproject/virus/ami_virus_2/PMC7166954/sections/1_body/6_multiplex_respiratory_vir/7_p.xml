<p>A GeXP‐based multiplex RT‐PCR assay (GeXP assay) has been developed to detect 16 different respiratory viruses simultaneously.

  <sup>77</sup>
 </xref> Seventeen sets of chimeric primers were designed to initiate the RT‐PCR, and another pair of universal primers was used for subsequent cycles of RT‐PCR.

 </xref> The GeXP assay achieves a sensitivity of 20 to 200 copies for a single virus, and when all 16 premixed viral targets were present, the sensitivity was 1000 copies, suggesting that this assay is a sensitive and specific method for detecting respiratory viruses.
