<p>The Panther Fusion respiratory assay has been developed to detect multiple respiratory viruses, and it consists of three multiplex real‐time PCR panels: Flu A/B/RSV, Paraflu (Parainfluenza), and hAdV/hMPV/RV.

 </xref> The performance characteristics of this assay for the detection of Flu A/B, RSV, Paraflu 1 to 3, hMPV, RV, and hAdV have been evaluated using 395 nasopharyngeal (NP) and 104 lower respiratory tract (LRT) samples.

 </xref> The Wilson‐126 Score method was used to calculate the 95% CI for positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA). For the NP samples, the Panther Fusion Assay has 100% PPA and 98.4% to 100% NPA for all targets. For the LRT samples, it had 100% PPA for all targets and 100% NPA for all targets, except hMPV (96.1%).
