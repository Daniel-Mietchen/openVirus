<p>The FilmArray multiplex PCR system is a multiplex PCR panel that can be used to detect 17 viruses, including RSV‐A and RSV‐B, and 2 bacteria. This platform requires 2 minutes of hands‐on time for sample preparation and about 1 hour for device running time. The testing platform integrates cell lysis reagents, DNA/RNA extraction reagents, purification reagents, amplification reagents, and also detection reagents into one pouch.
