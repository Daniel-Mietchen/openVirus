 </xref> This assay demonstrates good diagnostic performance on detection of multiplex respiratory pathogens. A total of 284 clinical respiratory specimens, including hAdV and RV, and 3 influenza A/H7N9 viral culture samples have been tested, and the overall diagnostic sensitivity of the NxTAG‐RPP was 98.9% (95% CI, 97.2 to 99.7), while the specificity was 99.0% (95% CI, 98.6 to 99.2). This assay demonstrated 100% sensitivity for detection of hAdV.
