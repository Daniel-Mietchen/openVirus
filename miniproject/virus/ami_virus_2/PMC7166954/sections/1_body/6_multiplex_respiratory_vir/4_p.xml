<p>Recently, Feng's group designed locked nucleic acid LNA‐modified primers and developed a multiplex one‐tube nested real‐time RT‐PCR (mOTNRT‐PCR) assay that could detect RSV, hRV and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) simultaneously with higher sensitivity and lower cost compared to the individual RT‐qPCR.

 </xref> This assay was evaluated using 398 clinical samples, and the sensitivity for RSV, hRV, and hMPV was 5 copies per reaction. No cross‐reactivity was observed among other common respiratory viruses, and the total detection time of this assay was 2.7 hours for 96 samples.
