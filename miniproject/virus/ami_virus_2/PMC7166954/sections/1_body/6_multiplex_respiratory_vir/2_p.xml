<p>Although single respiratory viruses can be detected in patients with symptoms, other respiratory viruses may also exist simultaneously. Children, especially those under 5 years of age, present with a higher frequency of coinfections.

 </xref> Multiplex assays that contain more than one viral gene target in a single tube have the advantage of rapid detection of several potential viral pathogens simultaneously. Multiplex real‐time PCR has allowed simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses in a short time. Compared with the singleplex approach, the multiplex diagnostic approach has higher sample throughput (96 samples per run), shorter turnaround time (5 hours), and a smaller amount of sample requirement.
