<p>Accurate and fast diagnosis of the causative viral pathogens is important to select the appropriate treatment, save people's lives, stop the epidemics, and reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics. All viruses mentioned above can cause both upper and lower respiratory tract infections, as well as overlapping clinical presentations, making it difficult for physicians to distinguish the causative agents without a solid laboratory analysis. Conventional diagnostic methods, such as viral culture and direct/indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), are time‐consuming and labor intensive with limited sensitivity. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of respiratory viruses can help in epidemiologic monitoring, along with taking effective prevention steps and implementing appropriate antiviral therapies. Over the past decades, an evolution in viral diagnostic testing has been seen, all the way from conventional approaches to rapid antigen detection. More recently, highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) and point‐of‐care tests (POCT) have been developed.
