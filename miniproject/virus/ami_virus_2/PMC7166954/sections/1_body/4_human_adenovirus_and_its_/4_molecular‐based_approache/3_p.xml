<p>Specific antigenic determinants on the hexon surface of hAdV can be identified by neutralizing antibodies. The antigenic determinants of hexon proteins have two loops, L1 and L2, which are divided into seven hypervariable regions (HVR), among which HVR 1 to 7 has become the newest method of choice for adenovirus typing. Madisch developed a two‐step diagnostic method that can classify 51 serotypes by amplification and sequencing of the amplification elements on L1 and L2.

 </xref> Shimada studied a more conservative hexon gene on HVR, which can type 44 serotypes, but it is limited to the hAdV serotypes that can lead to corneal conjunctivitis.

 </xref> Real‐time PCR is a sensitive and quantitative technique to diagnose hAdV infections. A real‐time PCR with consensus primer and probe for a conserved region of the hexon gene has been designed to detect 51 prototypes. The sensitivity of the assay is ≤15 copies per run, and the linear range of quantitation was 1.5 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> to 1.5 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> copies/run.

 </xref> The RealStar Adenovirus PCR Kit 1.0 is a real‐time PCR‐based diagnostic test for in vitro detection and quantification of hAdV‐specific DNA. Its sensitivity is 1.09 copies/μL (95%, 0.62‐3.08 copies/μL), and it has no cross‐reactivity against 35 human viral pathogens. Compared with the RealStar Adenovirus PCR Kit, the in‐house qPCR assay is more sensitive and reliable for the detection and quantification of hAdV‐specific DNA. The performance characteristics of this in‐house qPCR have been evaluated against the RealStar Adenovirus PCR Kit, using 122 clinical specimens and 18 proficiency samples.

 </xref> In this study, the in‐house hAdV qPCR assay detected six hAdV species A to F, except species G. Using the RealStar Adenovirus PCR Kit as the reference, the sensitivity and specificity are 98.1% and 100%, respectively, for the in‐house qPCR assay, and the correlation of the two assays is quite good (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.984). Furthermore, the in‐house qPCR assay has a linear range up to 9 log10 copies/m, and the %CV values suggested quite low intra‐/inter‐assay variations.
