<p>The isolation of adenovirus after growth in cell culture and its immunological detection are generally thought to be the “gold standard.”

 </xref> Samples, such as throat swabs and stool specimen, collected from patients are treated overnight with antibiotics, centrifuged, and supernatant inoculated with susceptible cells (Hep‐2, Graham 293, or A549). CPE is observed after cell incubation at 37°C, and then the hAdV is isolated. The serotype of hAdV can be determined by detecting the antigenic determinant of penton proteins by the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test. HAdV can also be typed by detecting the antigenic determinant of hexon proteins by neutralizing test (NT). However, these methods are time‐consuming, require experienced technicians to analyze the results, and the results are still uncertain. Different types of hAdV infection can cause different diseases and different symptoms; thus, detection of antigens and antibodies can make the diagnosis of hAdV more rapid and sensitive. Indirect ELISA can detect the IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies of hAdV in human serum or plasma. Immunofluores (IF), latex agglutination test (LAT) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA) are also common diagnostic methods accepted by most clinical laboratories because of their simple and rapid characteristics.
