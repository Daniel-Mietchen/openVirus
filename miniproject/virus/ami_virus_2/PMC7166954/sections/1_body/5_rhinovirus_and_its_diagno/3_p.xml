<p>Culture isolation of virus combined with acid stabilization test is a classic method for RV diagnosis. However, this assay is time‐consuming and laborious, limiting its value for clinical treatment. Human RV antibodies can be detected by immunological methods, such as the complement fixation test (CFT), HI test, IF, and ELISA. However, owing to the lack of suitable cross‐reactive antigens to cover a large number of RV serotypes, the application of these methods is greatly limited. In contrast, the one‐step, real‐time PCR assay detects RVs by using a sequence detection system. This assay improves workflow, reduces preparation time, and eliminates cross‐contamination that might be introduced during cDNA transfer from the reverse transcription reaction into the PCR reaction step.

 </xref> With the rapid development of WGS technology, more and more laboratories may perform WGS on human RV isolates clinically. With the discovery of hRV‐C, the data volume of whole‐genome hRV sequencing has been increased and improved significantly. This will help researchers and clinicians to understand the evolutionary and recombination of RV,
