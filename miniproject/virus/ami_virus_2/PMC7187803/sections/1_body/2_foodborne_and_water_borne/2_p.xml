<p id="Par12">The most famous water-borne disease is the cholera, a bacterial diarrheal disease caused by 
 <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. The disease is transmitted by drinking contaminated water. Cholera is a highly temperature-dependent disease which increases with the increase in water temperature. Infection due to 
 <italic>Vibrio</italic> spp. is an example of the influence of global warming and ecology on the emergence of pathogens. The increase in water temperature affects the plankton population in water. The symbiotic relationship between vibrio and plankton leads to the increase in abundance of vibrio population. Swimmers who have open wounds and shellfish consumers can easily attract the infection. Similarly, 
 <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> is associated with zooplankton and both V. cholera and zooplankton population will bloom when the water temperature increases (Redshaw et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2000</xref>; Semenza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2012</xref>). The infections spread in warm summers via swimming pools and in coastal cities (Andersson and Ekdahl

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>; Frank et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2006</xref>; Schets et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2006</xref>). The spread of water-borne epidemics as leptospirosis and gastrointestinal infections is usually associated with heavy rainfall and floods (Cann et al.
