<p id="Par13">The increase in temperature will selectively adapt fungi to higher environmental temperatures which resample that of mammals. So that pathogenic fungi, which are at the time not pathogenic for mammals due to their body temperature, will be capable of infecting mammals in the future (Garcia-Solache and Casadevall 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2010</xref>). Climatic factors can also promote the spread of non-infectious diseases (e.g. the increase in humidity, temperature and rainfalls enhance the growth of fungi and the spread of mycotoxin related diseases). In warm summer, many factors interact leading to the increase in cases of food poisoning such as enhanced bacterial survival, the people spend more time outside where they eat and drink, and finally due to the increase in the insect/rodent population and activity (El-Sayed et al.
