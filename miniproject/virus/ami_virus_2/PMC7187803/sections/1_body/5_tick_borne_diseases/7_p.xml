<p id="Par31">A second zoonotic tick-borne emerging viral diseases in Europe is the Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF). The CCHFV represents a great public health concern in Europe due to its high human fatality (Papa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2015</xref>). The virus is transmitted by Hyalomma tick to ruminants, and now it became endemic in Africa, the Middle East, the Balkan Peninsula, Eastern and South Europe and Asia. Warmer climatic conditions allow the ticks to invade and emerge in new areas (Baylis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2017</xref>). Additionally, ticks are responsible for the emergence of Piroplasmorida (such as Babesia and Theileria). Babesiosis is the most important tick-borne protozoal disease to cattle industry. The disease is a global animal health problem responsible for great economic losses in the veterinary sector. The emerging zoonosis represents a great challenge of public health due to the exponential increase of babesiosis worldwide facilitated by the geographic expansion of ticks induced by global warming (Beugnet and Chalvet-Monfray
