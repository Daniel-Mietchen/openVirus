<p id="Par34">The northward expansion of the dog tick 
 <italic>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic> is alarming due to their role in the emergence of the life-threatening pathogens such as 
 <italic>Rickettsia rickettsii</italic> and 
 <italic>R. conorii</italic>, the causative agents of Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Mediterranean spotted fever, respectively (Parola et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2008</xref>). The related tick-borne 
 <italic>Rickettsia and Borrelia</italic> species usually emerge parallel to 
 <italic>Anaplasma and Ehrlichia</italic> as they are also transmitted by a large variety of tick species
 <italic>.</italic> The emergence of 
 <italic>Borrelia</italic> bacteria in addition to TBE virus resulted in huge concern in Europe (Gage et al.
