<p id="Par28">Tick expansion is promoted by the warmer winters in the last decade due to global warming (Porretta et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">2011</xref>). In the last few years, more than 11 bacterial tick-borne human emerged pathogens were detected in Europe which include various Rickettsiae and Borrelia species (Parola and Raoult 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2001</xref>). Ticks transmitted by migrating birds also play an epidemiological role in the spread of the pathogens. In one study, 16 out of 43 migrating bird species were infested with at least one tick. The ticks were positive for

 <italic>Rickettsia</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>R. helvetica</italic> in addition to 
 <italic>Babesia microti</italic>, 
 <italic>B. capreoli</italic> and 
 <italic>B. venatorum</italic> in variable degrees (Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2016</xref>). Beside the birds, the epidemiological role of ticks in the transmission of zoonotic bacteria 
 <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> was recently confirmed (Berthov√° et al.
