 <italic>T. brucei rhodesiense.</italic> Due to the vector expansion in relationship with the global warming, it is predicted that 30,000 people will be infected by the parasite while 70 million persons will be at risk during this century (Moore et al.

 <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> and transmitted by the bites of the bloodsucking 
 <italic>Triatoma infestans</italic> known as the kissing bugs or orally by the consumption of water or food contaminated with the faeces of the infected bugs. The disease expansion to Central and North America was reported. At the time, it is estimated that 300,000 US residents are infected with the disease (Shikanai-Yasuda and Carvalho
