<p id="Par25">The association between global warming and the emergence of tick-borne diseases is well documented in Europe and Euroasia (Andreassen et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2012</xref>). Like mosquitoes, several tick species expanded their habitat to higher elevations and toward the north in Canada and Europe due to global warming which elongated the season of tick activity and enhanced their survival in the environment. This, in turn, was also reflected on the spread of tick-borne diseases such as Anaplasmosis, Babesiosis Powassan viruses and
