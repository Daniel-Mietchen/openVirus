<p id="Par35">The ticks can also transmit various bacterial diseases such as Lyme borreliosis. In the last decade, the prevalence of the disease in Europe increased not only in endemic areas but also expanded to new geographical regions, particularly in Netherlands and Belgium. It is estimated that Lyme borreliosis (bacterial spirochaete disease) infects yearly at least 85,000 people in Europe (Gassner and van Overbeek 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2007</xref>; Hofhuis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2015</xref>). The disease is caused mainly by 
 <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> and 
 <italic>Borrelia mayonii</italic> in Europe. However, other species of 
 <italic>Borrelia</italic> like 
 <italic>Borrelia spielmanii</italic>, 
 <italic>Borrelia bavariensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Borrelia afzelii</italic> and 
 <italic>Borellia garinii</italic> were also reported in North America and Euroasia as potent zoonotic spirochetes transmitted by 
 <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> complex (Kernif et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2005</xref>; Rizzoli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">2011</xref>). In addition ticks, fleas and flies can aid in the expansion of rabbit fever (tularemia), a zoonotic vector-borne disease caused by 
 <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic> (Nakazawa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2007</xref>).
