<p id="Par21">According to the published data, three major emerging mosquito-borne viruses represent a global challenge for public health: (1) West Nile virus (WNV), an insect-borne virus which induces fatal encephalitis in mammals, humans and even birds. The virus is transmitted by 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes. Like other mosquito-borne diseases, the disease expanded its geographic range to emerge in new countries as a result of climatic changes. The disease emerged in South America in 2003 and induced a large outbreak in Europe in 2010 (involved Greece, Romania, Hungary, Spain, Russia, Turkey and Italy) (Paz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2015</xref>). The disease was also detected in other European countries such as France, Portugal and Serbia. The source of the invading viruses was confirmed to be from Israel, Morocco and Turkey. Later on, in 2018, the virus emerged for the first time in Germany (Ziegler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">2019</xref>). In 1999, WNV first emerged in New York (USA), the increase in mosquito population due to the increase rainfalls and the lengthening of the mosquito activity season due to the increase in temperature leads to the increase of the prevalence of the disease. In 2013, 2170 cases of WNF were reported in USA with 88 fatalities (Kilpatrick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2006</xref>; Paz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2015</xref>). (2) Chikungunya virus is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. In the last decade, 
 <italic>Ae. Albopictus</italic> spread in Europe, North and South America, and many countries in Africa; this resulted in the recent emergence of the chikungunya virus to more than 40 countries worldwide (Sanyaolu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2016</xref>). The increase in temperature was found to be linearly related to the increase in disease prevalence (Dhimal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015b</xref>). The epidemiological map of the diseases indicated its confirmed existence in at least in 98 countries (24 in Africa, 20 in Asia, 44 in North and South America, 10 countries in Pacific Islands) (Sanyaolu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2016</xref>). Additionally, the virus emerged in 2007 for the first time in Europe (Italy) where it infected at least 200 persons (Rezza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">2007</xref>). Later on, in 2010, the highly aggressive Asian tiger mosquito (
 <italic>Ae. Albopictus</italic>) spread both chikungunya and dengue viruses to France and Croatia, and in 2012 to Portugal (Sousa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">2012</xref>). However, a part of this ability to widespread is attributed to its genetic mutation which enabled the virus to use Asian tiger mosquito as a vector and not being restricted to yellow fever mosquito alone (CE TKVDM 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>). (3) Zika virus which induced serious public health problems in South America between 2015 and 2016 is expected to emerge in Europe as both of its vectors 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are endemic in Europe (Caminade et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017</xref>).
