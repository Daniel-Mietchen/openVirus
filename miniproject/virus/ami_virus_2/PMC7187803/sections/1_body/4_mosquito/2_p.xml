<p id="Par18">Three genera of mosquitoes (
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>) are the mostly incriminated in transmission of diseases to men and animals. The mosquito-borne diseases may expand either through the emergence of the victor species to a new area or through the adaptation of the introduced mosquito-borne pathogen to native mosquito species which already exist in this location. The best example for that is the chikungunya virus which is usually transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. Following its emergence in Europe, the native European mosquito species such as 
 <italic>Ae. geniculate</italic> were found to be highly susceptible to chikungunya virus infection and can replace 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> in disease epidemiology (Ng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2019</xref>; Prudhomme et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2019</xref>). The best example for the second possibility is seen by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> which is endemic in Africa. The exotic mosquito species emerged in the Netherlands but could not persist due to the unsuitable environmental conditions. In opposite to the case in Portugal where the invader species could establish itself in 2002 and induced dengue fever outbreak a few years later in 2012 (Scholte et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2010</xref>; Sousa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">2012</xref>). Similarly, invasive 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species could be routinely detected between the years 2016 and 2018 in different localities in Canada (June
