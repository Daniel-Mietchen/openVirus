 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2013</xref>), we would notice that one mosquito species (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>) out of 3500 mosquito species is responsible for most serious outbreaks and can transmit most of the mosquito-borne pathogens outside Africa (Powell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2018</xref>). While 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is common in Africa, another species which originates from Asia (tiger mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>) emerged in Europe and North America and was considered as the most invasive mosquito species and one of top 100 invasive insect species worldwide. Tiger mosquitoes are known for being very aggressive diurnal-biting insects. It can transmit more than 20 pathogens to humans alone (Ogden et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2014</xref>). Tiger mosquitoes are responsible for the emergence of several diseases to Europe such as chikungunya fever (Italy in 2007 and France in 2010) (Fischer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2013</xref>). The emergence and expansion of 
 <italic>A. albopictus</italic> in the Western Hemisphere enhanced the emergence and endemicity of 
 <italic>A. albopictus-</italic>borne diseases like chikungunya virus infection and dengue fever in Italy, France and Croatia in Europe, and in Hawaii, Texas and Florida in USA. West Nile virus became now also endemic in North America after its emergence due to migratory birds (Redshaw et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2013</xref>).
