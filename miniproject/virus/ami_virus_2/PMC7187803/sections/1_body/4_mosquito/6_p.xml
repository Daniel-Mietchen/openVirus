<p id="Par22">Other mosquito-borne viruses are also investigated. Repeated horse outbreaks with the mosquito-borne Eastern equine encephalitis virus could be detected in Ontario in 2008, 2009 and 2010. The virus reported its first human infection in 2016 (Chénier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2010</xref>; Ludwig et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2019</xref>). Other mosquito-borne viruses include the following: (1) Usutu virus (flavivirus) was isolated for the first time from human patients in Italy in 2009 and from migrating birds in Germany in 2011 (Vazquez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2011</xref>). At the time, the viruses seem to be circulating in several European countries (Gaibani and Rossini 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2017</xref>). (2) Rift Valley fever virus (Bunyaviridae: Phlebovirus) is a serious emerging zoonotic disease in Africa and the Middle East. The disease has a great economic impact and represents a public health concern. Like other emerging insect-borne diseases, the global warming supports their geographical expansion. The virus was introduced to Europe in 2016 through a French service member in Mali who caught the infection in Mali before travelling to France via Crete, Greece. Fortunately, the disease did not persist there (Tong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">2019</xref>). (3) Yellow fever is a tropical viral disease which started to induce outbreaks in South America (in particular in Brazil and Argentina). Although North America and Europe are free of the virus, the virus emerged in both continents in the past (seventeenth and nineteenth centuries) according to WHO. In the last decades, the virus started to invade new countries in association with mosquito active seasons (Report W 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2015</xref>), and finally, the bluetongue virus emerged in 2006–2007 across 12 European countries in northern Europe and UK. The wind is believed to be responsible for the disease introduction to Europe by spreading the vector (

 <italic>Cu. imicola</italic>), additional native European species (
 <italic>Cu. obsoletus</italic>, 
 <italic>Cu. pulicaris</italic>, 
 <italic>Cu. chiopterus</italic> and 
 <italic>Cu. dewulfi</italic>) shared in the spread of the virus across Europe (Gould and Higgs

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2009</xref>; Purse et al.
