<p id="Par9">Beside the previously mentioned parasitic diseases, NTDs of viral origin are also involved in the list, among them are as follows: (1) rabies, which is one of the most serious re-emerging zoonotic NTDsâ€”the free movement of wild animals represents a great obstacle in disease control (El-Sayed

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2015</xref>); (2) dengue fever, a serious viral disease which has four serotypes. The disease is transmitted by mosquitoes mainly

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2017</xref>). (3) Ebola haemorrhagic fever and the closely related Marburg fever. Both are fatal zoonotic viral diseases virus. Epidemiological studies linked outbreaks with climatic changes specially the rainfall/dryness seasonal patterns. Therefore, it is expected that global warming will affect the geographical distribution of both diseases (Schmidt et al.
