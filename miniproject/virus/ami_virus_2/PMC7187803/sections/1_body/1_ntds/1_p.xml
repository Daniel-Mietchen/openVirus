<p id="Par8">In the last years, the flow of refugees and illegal immigrants seeking asylum, coming from war/famine suffering countries increased the prevalence of many of the NTDs or their re-emergence in western countries. One of the best examples is the human scabies caused by Sarcoptes scabiei mites. Although the parasitic disease has a global distribution, the prevalence in Europe was very low (Chandler and Fuller 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>). Outbreaks of scabies in Europe could be observed in the last decade such as in Kindergarten in Germany in 2013 (Ariza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>) and in German Health Care Centre (Leistner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2017</xref>) and in elderly home in the UK (Cassell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>). Other parasitic diseases are also involved in the NTD list, such as the following: (1) dracunculiosis (or guinea worm disease), dracunculiasis a parasitic water-borne disease caused by 
 <italic>Dracunculus medinensis</italic> and occurs following drinking contaminated water (Biswas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>); (2) lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis), a parasitic disease which obstructs the lymph vessels of the lower extremities and is transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes, but the main vector is 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (Control CfD, Prevention 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2013</xref>); (3) onchocerciasis (or river blindness), a parasitic disease caused by the nematode 
 <italic>Onchocerca volvulus</italic> and transmitted by blackflies (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017b</xref>); and (4) internal parasites including GIT nematodes and other trematodes such as 
 <italic>Fasciola</italic> spp. and 
 <italic>Schistosoma</italic> spp. They are very sensitive for climatic conditions which control their expansion pattern. For instance, floods, rainfalls, and the increased climatic temperature and humidity enable the survival of the free-living stages of the parasites (larva/metacercaria) and therefore increases disease prevalence. Schistosomiasis, Swimmerâ€™s itch or bilharzia are five species of trematodes belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Schistosoma</italic> which require snails as intermediate hosts. The flocks invade the body through the skin (Mas-Coma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2008</xref>) (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017a</xref>). The global warming expanded the habitat of the snail to a new land so that the disease is increasingly recorded in Europe (De Gentile et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1996</xref>; Kolarova 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2007</xref>; Larsen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2004</xref>). Recently, in 2015, an outbreak of urogenital schistosomiasis occurred in France. The victims were from France, Germany and Italy (Boissier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). The snail vector of Schistosoma was also recorded in East Europe (Majoros et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2008</xref>; Pointier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2005</xref>). Other snail mediated trematode parasites such as 
 <italic>Fasciola</italic>, 
 <italic>Clonorchis</italic>, 
 <italic>Opisthorchis</italic> and 
 <italic>Paragonimus</italic> also expand in a similar manner in association with the expansion of host to new geographical locations (Morgan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2001</xref>). 
 <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> is a zoonotic re-emerging neglected tropical parasite which infects mainly grazing sheep and cattle. The global warming increases the survival and expansion of the free-living cercaria and snail vector and at the same time, the increase of grazing season increases the exposure of the grazing animals to the parasite. Therefore and as expected, the prevalence of Fascioliasis increased in the last decade in endemic countries (Beesley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2018</xref>).
