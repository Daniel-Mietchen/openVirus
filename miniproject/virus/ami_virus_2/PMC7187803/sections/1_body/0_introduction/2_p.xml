<p id="Par3">Climatic changes can result in change of human socio-demographics (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and massive migration of humans and domestic livestock from dry hot areas to new geographic districts where the life circumstances are better (El-Sayed and Awad 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2018</xref>). This is accompanied with changes in the classical geographical distribution of wild animals, insects, rodents, and their population worldwide (Mor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2018</xref>). The interaction and the epidemiological relationship between climatic changes, environmental and ecosystem disturbance, exposure to vector insects and spread of infectious disease is well documented (Greer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2008</xref>; Organization WH 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2005</xref>; Teklehaimanot et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2004</xref>). Understanding this link enables the prediction of the expected effects of climatic changes in the near future on the ecology of infectious agents, the spread of pathogens, vectors (intermediate hosts), reservoir animals, and final hosts (Medone et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2015</xref>).
