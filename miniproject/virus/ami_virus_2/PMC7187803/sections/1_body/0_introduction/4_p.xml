<p id="Par5">The WHO listed the health hazards on human health due to climatic changes into the following item (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>): (1) direct and indirect effects of global warming, (2) stratospheric ozone depletion, (3) disturbance in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, (4) loss of biodiversity, (5) changes in the hydrological systems and freshwater supply, (6) Land degradation and loss of river deltas and coastal cities, (7) urbanization, deforestation and population dislocation/immigration, and finally (8) limited food production (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2017</xref>). These direct and indirect effects of the climatic shift on human/animal health and welfare include: (1). The direct influences result from physio-psychological effects from the increased number and duration of heat waves leading to stress, respiratory, circulatory collapse, heat strokes, and the long-term effects include squamous-cell carcinoma. The direct effects also include the negative effects of floods, droughts and storms on the wildlife and forests. The global warming directly influences the abundance, survival, and distribution of pathogens and their vectors. Meanwhile, (2) the indirect effects include famines and the negative effects of massive migratory waves of human/animal populations (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2017</xref>) and the resulting ecological shift is predicted—using an optimistic scenario—to induce at least 250,000 additional deaths annually between 2030 and 2050. Out of these, 48,000 are expected to die due to diarrhoea, 60,000 due to malaria and the rest due to malnutrition and heat strokes. Unfortunately, the poor developing countries are the most vulnerable countries although they are the least responsible for the CO
 <sub>2</sub> emission and greenhouse effect (Dhimal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2015a</xref>). It is alarming to know that more than 60% of human infectious diseases which emerged between 1940 and 2004 were zoonotic diseases of animal origin. This has a great impact on public health and world economy. Out of these, 22.8% are arthropod-borne diseases, and 71.8% originated from wildlife (Dantas-Torres 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>). It was unexpected that Nepal became endemic for many major vector-borne diseases (VBDs), although the land lies at high altitude due to Himalaya mountains. The diseases include malaria, leishmaniasis, filariasis, Japanese encephalitis and dengue fever (Dhimal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2015a</xref>).
