<p id="Par14">Global warming influences both vector host dimensions in a way which controls their spatiotemporal expansion and the emergence of the diseases in a complex but balanced way (Morgan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2001</xref>; Renn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2011</xref>). Vector-borne pathogens are usually geographically restricted to certain areas where their vectors exist. However, the emergence of the transmitting vectors to new districts as a result of global warming is logically associated with the emergence of these vector-borne pathogens (Cann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>). In the last years, several diseases could emerge in Europe in relation to their vector expansion such as dengue fever, West Nile fever, chikungunya fever, malaria, leishmaniasis, Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis (Baylis
