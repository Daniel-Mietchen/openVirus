<p id="par0115">Detection of CoVs has most often been made by electron microscopy, cell culture, serological assays, or molecular methods. Microscopy requires expensive equipment and technical expertise. Although cell culture has been considered the gold standard for CoV detection with high specificity [

 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], molecular assays target previously recognized CoVs and may miss the detection of a novel CoV [
