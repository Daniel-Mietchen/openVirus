<p id="par0120">Our pan-CoV assay overcomes these problems. It employs a semi-nested RT-PCR approach using two pairs of degenerate primers that universally amplify CoVs within four genera. We recognize that semi-nested RT-PCR methods are more complex and offer additional risk of assay contamination. However, we argue that effective management of the laboratory environment can reduce such risk.</p>
