<p id="par0140">It should be noted that Î´-CoVs in particular have an affinity to jump species. A recent study demonstrated that poultry are susceptible to infection with PDCoV [

 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. So, we should be particularly concerned when a novel CoV is detected at the human-animal interface.
