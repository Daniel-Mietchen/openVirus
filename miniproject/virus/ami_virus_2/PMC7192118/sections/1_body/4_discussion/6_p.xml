<p id="par0135">Novel CoVs also have caused tremendous morbidity among livestock. Currently, six CoVs have caused significant morbidity in pigs [

These include four α-CoVs [porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and the recently emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV)], one β-CoV [porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV)], and a δ-CoV [porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)]. Among them, SADS-CoV may have originated from bat CoVs and PDCoV from a sparrow CoV [
