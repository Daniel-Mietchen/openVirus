<p id="par0125">As the COVID-19 pandemic is currently surging, pathogen discovery of novel CoVs now seems even more important than before. All HCoVs come from two main genera (α-CoV and β-CoV) and are thought to have come from animals, specifically bats [

 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>]. It seems clear that large-scale surveillance is needed to fully understand the role played by γ-CoVs and δ-CoVs in the emergence of human CoVs. Hence, this assay might be especially useful in detecting CoVs that are potentially pathogenic to humans from all four genera. Interestingly, we found viruses that are genetically similar to canine-CoV in four human pneumonia samples. We are in the process of further investigating these findings with attempts at culture and next generation sequencing (NGS).
