<p id="par0130">With the advent of NGS technology [
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], numerous CoV strains of four genera have been identified via the increased surveillance of wild animal species. NGS has helped elucidate the evolutionary history of CoVs using a large amount of data generated by unbiased sequencing. However, some disadvantages limit the number of samples that can be sequenced. Although it becomes less expensive each consecutive year, the cost is still very high and the procedure includes time-consuming complicated library preparations and data processing. Hence, we posit that combined screening strategies are the most cost-effective way to identify new CoVs. We recommend employing novel coronavirus surveillance among people whose occupations or recreation cause them to have prolonged or frequent exposure to animals. We recommend screening them periodically, when healthy, for novel CoV nasal carriage and whenever they develop an acute respiratory illness. This surveillance might first include employing our pan-CoV assay and other pan-viral assays. When a novel virus is detected, the surveillance team might look for that same virus among the workersâ€™ animals. Having confirmed a novel virus in both an animal worker and his or her animals, further investigations might be employed through cell culture, full genome sequencing, and if indicated, seroepidemiology of both the worker and the animals.
