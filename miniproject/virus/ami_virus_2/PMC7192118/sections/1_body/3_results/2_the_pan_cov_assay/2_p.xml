<p id="par0075">Through alignment of 38 RdRp gene sequences from human and animal CoVs, the region containing the most conserved sequences was identified (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). Two degenerate primer pairs were constructed (Table S2) with binding sites within this region and a semi-nested PCR protocol was developed. Amplicons obtained by the RT-PCR assay were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. No primer dimers were detected and no false positive results were observed in the CoV negative control samples. Amplicons of expected size were obtained by the optimized semi-nested RT-PCR protocol with all CoV-positive samples tested.
