<p id="par0080">To validate the specificity of the pan-CoV assay, a wide range of different CoVs were prepared for templates. The assay specificity was further determined by attempting to amplify nucleic acid from non-specific pathogens like common respiratory viruses. Our assay yielded an amplicon of the expected size (599â€“602 bp) from the well-characterized control and reference CoV strains (
