<p id="par0085">To determine the limits of detection (LOD) of this assay, 10-fold dilution series of templates (plasmids and RNA) were tested, each performed in triplicate. The LOD was defined as the lowest concentration that was detected in all triplicate reactions. Under general semi-nested RT-PCR conditions, our results revealed that the assay was able to detect bands in gels at dilutions ranging from 4 to 4 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/reaction for corresponding plasmids (SARS-CoV with 4 and MERS-CoV with 4 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> copies/reaction). In addition, RNA extracted from SARS-CoV-2 (USA-WA1 isolate) infected cells with known concentration (with a pre-determined titer of 4.8 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> genome copies/mL, data not shown) was used to determine the LOD of this assay. These data revealed that the pan-CoV assay could detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 4 × 10
 <sup>1</sup> copies per reaction (
