<p id="par0105">To determine whether the assay could be used to identify naturally occurring CoVs from the environment, we blindly screened 31 bioaerosol samples collected from a poultry market in Hanoi, Vietnam. Among the 31 bioaerosol samples tested, three (9.7 %) were positive for duck CoV, two (6.5 %) were positive for infectious bronchitis virus and one (3.2 %) was positive for avian CoV (Table S4). Negative control samples were negative in all tests, ruling out amplicon contamination as a source of the positive results.</p>
