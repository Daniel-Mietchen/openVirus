<p id="par0030">While the other zoonotic CoV outbreaks have been largely controlled, attempts at containing SARS-CoV-2 have not been successful. Most experts would agree that this has been due, in part, to the sparse availability of diagnostic assays. Hence, currently, there is a massive, worldwide effort to provide diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infections. According to the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics website [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], as of April 9, 2020 there were more than 470 molecular and immunological assays in the development pipeline. However, few diagnostics are available or being developed to detect other animal CoVs that may jump species to man. Hence, in this study we sought to design and evaluate develop a new molecular diagnostic tool to detect most CoVs, including those that have been previously identified and those that may be discovered in the future.
