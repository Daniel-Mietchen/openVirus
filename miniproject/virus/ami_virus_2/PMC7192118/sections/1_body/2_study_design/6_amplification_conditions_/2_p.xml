<p id="par0065">The protocol consisted of a semi-nested RT-PCR strategy with two amplification steps. A first RT-PCR amplification round was conducted using SuperScript™ III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum™ 
 <italic>Taq</italic> DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Each 25
 <italic>μ</italic>L first step reaction mixture contained 4
 <italic>μ</italic>L RNA samples, 12.5
 <italic>μ</italic>L 2X Reaction Mix (containing 0.4 mM of each dNTP, 3.2 mM MgSO
 <sub>4</sub>), 0.4
 <italic>μ</italic>M of each primer (pan-CoV_outF and pan-CoV_R), a 0.4
 <italic>μ</italic>L volume SuperScript™ III RT/Platinum™ 
 <italic>Taq</italic> Mix, and nuclease-free water to obtain a final volume of 25
 <italic>μ</italic>L. The thermal profile included incubation at 55 °C for 30 min for reserve transcription, followed by incubation at 94 °C for 2 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Following the reverse transcription, amplification was performed in the CFX PCR System (Bio-Rad, USA) according to the following program: 30 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 53.4 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 1 min; a final extension at 68 °C for 5 min; and holding at 4 °C. The conventional PCR for second step was carried out in 25
 <italic>μ</italic>L volume containing 1
 <italic>μ</italic>L of first RT-PCR product, 2.5
 <italic>μ</italic>L 10X PCR Buffer (no magnesium chloride), 0.75
 <italic>μ</italic>L 50 mM magnesium chloride, 0.5
 <italic>μ</italic>L dNTP mix (dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dTTP), 1
 <italic>μ</italic>L of each primer (pan-CoV_inF and pan-CoV_R), 0.25
 <italic>μ</italic>L Platinum™ 
 <italic>Taq</italic> DNA Polymerase, and enough nuclease-free water for a final volume of 25
 <italic>μ</italic>L for each reaction. Finally, 599–602 bp RdRp amplicons were obtained by thermocycling using the following parameters: 94 °C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 54.5 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. To avoid possible contamination, positive and negative controls were contained in each run of the assay. The PCR products were kept at 4 °C until analysis by gel electrophoresis. Amplification products were electrophoresed and visualized on a 2 % agarose gel together with a 100 bp DNA ladder at 120 V for 30 min. Sanger sequencing for positive samples was performed by Eton Bioscience Inc (Eton Bioscience, Raleigh, NC, USA).
