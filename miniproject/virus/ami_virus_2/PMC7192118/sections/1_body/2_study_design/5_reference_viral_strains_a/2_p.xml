<p id="par0055">A panel of 25 viral isolates and positive clinical specimens harboring a total of 23 unique respiratory viruses were selected (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). The 25 samples were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and from previously studied clinical or field collection specimens at our One Health Laboratories at Duke University (Durham, NC, USA) and Duke-NUS Medical School (Singapore). Fourteen human and animal CoV reference strains or molecularly-positive samples that were archived at Duke University, served as positive controls.
