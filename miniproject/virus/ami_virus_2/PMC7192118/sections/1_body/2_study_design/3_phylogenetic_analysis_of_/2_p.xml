<p id="par0045">Since the RdRP is the most conserved region among the 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic>, this region was chosen for designing RT-PCR primers to all members of this subfamily. As a first step, RdRp sequences were extracted from NCBI and multiple alignments were prepared using the Clustal W program with default parameters implemented in MEGA 7 (

Phylogenetic trees of the RdRp genes were then constructed using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap replicates also using MEGA 7 (
