<p id="par0050">The 38 CoV RdRp gene sequences from GenBank were next aligned using Geneious software (Biomatters Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand). Highly conserved regions were visually identified and three degenerate primers were then designed using Geneious software to be broadly reactive across all 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic>. All primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA, USA). For first round RT-PCR, the external primers (pan-CoV_outF and pan-CoV_R) were used to amplify a 670–673 bp product; for the second round semi-nested PCR, an internal primer (pan-CoV_inF) was used with pan-CoV_R for amplification of an internal 599–602 bp product. The primer sequences used for each amplification are shown in Table S2.
