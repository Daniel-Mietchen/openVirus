<p>The analysis of hospitalizations with an influenza diagnosis using the national hospital database provides important information on the burden of influenza epidemics. Analyses of these data annually would be valuable in order to document the severity of influenza hospitalizations by age‚Äêgroup and according to the circulating influenza viruses.
