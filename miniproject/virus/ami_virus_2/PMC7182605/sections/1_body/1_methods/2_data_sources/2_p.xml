<p>Data were extracted from the French national hospital discharge database (PMSI), which contains all records of hospitalizations in all public and private hospitals in France. Diagnoses are coded using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD‐10). We extracted all hospital stays that occurred between 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2017 in metropolitan France with at least one ICD‐10 code related to influenza (J09, J10, J11) as a principal, related or associated diagnosis. The information collected for each hospitalization was as follows: the unique patient identification number, the admission hospital identifier, the patient age, the diagnosis‐related group (DRG), the week of admission at hospital, the length of stay, whether or not an admission to intensive care unit (ICU) occurred, and the issue at hospital discharge.</p>
