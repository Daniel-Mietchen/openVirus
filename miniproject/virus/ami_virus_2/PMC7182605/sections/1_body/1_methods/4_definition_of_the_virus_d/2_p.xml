<p>Virological data are not available in the hospital discharge database. In order to characterize the burden of influenza hospitalizations by dominant circulating virus each season, we used virological data from primary care settings. Data were obtained from the national reference laboratory for influenza viruses. A virus type or subtype was defined as a dominant virus if (a) it accounted for 70% or more of all isolates during the season or (b) if it accounted between 40% and 70% of all isolates and the second most common virus accounted for less than 30%. Two types or subtypes were considered as co‚Äêdominant if the main virus accounted from 40% to 70% of all isolates and the second most common accounted for 30% or more of all isolates.
