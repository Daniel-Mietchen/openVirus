<p>A quarter of the hospitalizations belonged to a DRG not related to “influenza” or “respiratory diseases”, categorized as “other DRGs”. The composition of this category greatly varied by age‐group. In young people aged 20‐39 years, a significant proportion was DRG related to pregnancy issues. In the ≥40 years, a significant proportion were cardio‐vascular conditions. We also observed the risk of influenza responsible for neurological symptoms (seizure) in the youngest. These results highlight the potentially large spectrum of influenza‐related health consequences.</p>
