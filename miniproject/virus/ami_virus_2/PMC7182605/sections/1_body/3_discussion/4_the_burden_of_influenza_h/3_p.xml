<p>Noteworthy, the proportions of ICU admission in the ≥80 years each season were much lower than the proportions observed in the 60‐79 years. Also, most of deaths in the very elderly occurred outside ICU (81%). Consequently, the current seasonal routine monitoring of influenza cases admitted to ICU is less likely to capture the severity of influenza in the very elderly and underestimates the impact of seasonal influenza in this age‐group. Hence, additional data sources should be identified to monitor the impact of influenza in the very elderly in the real‐time surveillance systems.</p>
