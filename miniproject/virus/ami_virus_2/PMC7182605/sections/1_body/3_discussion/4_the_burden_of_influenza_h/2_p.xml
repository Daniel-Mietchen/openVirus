Indeed, being aged 80 years and older was the paramount factor associated with the highest hospitalization rate, proportion of death, number of hospitalization days, the longest length of stay, and the highest proportion of a severe influenza diagnosis‐related group (DRG) during the study period. The impact was even more important during A(H3N2) circulating seasons in 2014/2015 and 2016/2017.
