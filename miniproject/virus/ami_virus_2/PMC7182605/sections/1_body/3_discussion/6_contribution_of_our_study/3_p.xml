<p>Our results suggest that routine surveillance of influenza does not allow a complete assessment of the burden of influenza epidemics. Hospitalizations after admission to emergency departments totalized only 24% of the influenza hospitalizations captured in the PMSI in 2016‚Äê2017. The monitoring of influenza cases admitted to ICU does not reflect the real burden of severe disease in the very elderly who are less admitted to ICU and who mostly died outside ICU. In that sense, our analysis is of interest to describe the burden of influenza hospitalizations each season and should be repeated annually.</p>
