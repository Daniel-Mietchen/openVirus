<p>This study described the characteristics and severity of hospitalizations recorded with an influenza ICD‐10 code in the French national hospital database across five influenza seasons. Our results showed that influenza hospitalization rates by age‐group each season were highly dependent on the circulating virus. Besides, the criteria of severity (ICU admission, lethality, and length of stay) were strongly dependent on the age of the influenza cases and were quite stable within each age‐group across seasons.</p>
