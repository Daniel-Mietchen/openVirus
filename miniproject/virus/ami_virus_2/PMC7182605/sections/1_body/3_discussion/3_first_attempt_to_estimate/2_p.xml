<p>Restricting influenza hospitalizations to hospitalizations with a diagnosis of influenza, we estimated that influenza epidemics caused 28.5 hospitalizations per 100 000 inhabitants per season between 2012 and 2017. This rate was in the lower range of figures recently published by other countries with different case definitions and data sources. Based on the analysis of national hospital discharge database, the hospitalization rate was estimated at 49/100 000 in England between 1997 and 2009,
