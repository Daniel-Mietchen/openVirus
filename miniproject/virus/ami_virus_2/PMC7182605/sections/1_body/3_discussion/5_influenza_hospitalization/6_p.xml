<p>The analysis of hospitalization rates stratified by age‐group illustrates the highly age‐specific impact of influenza by subtype of circulating virus. An analysis of the overall impact of influenza, without age stratification, would have masked important age‐related differences depending on the dominating influenza virus. Previous studies have shown the importance of age‐stratified analyses to assess intensity and severity of influenza.
