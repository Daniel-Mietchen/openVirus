<p>Compared with A(H1N1) subtype, A(H3N2) subtype usually affects all age‐groups.
 <xref rid="irv12719-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> During the A(H3N2) dominating seasons in 2014‐2015 and 2016‐2017, our results showed that elderly were highly affected, as observed in other countries.

 <xref rid="irv12719-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> In 2014‐2015, the circulation of a drifted A(H3N2) strain genetically different from the northern hemisphere vaccine component was responsible for a reduced vaccine effectiveness in the population targeted by the influenza vaccine recommendations.
 <xref rid="irv12719-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> In 2016‐2017, the global burden of influenza was even higher compared with 2014‐2015. Genetic data from virological surveillance showed that the circulating A(H3N2) viruses had undergone considerable genetic diversification responsible for high incidence and a suboptimal vaccine effectiveness in those targeted by the vaccine recommendations.
