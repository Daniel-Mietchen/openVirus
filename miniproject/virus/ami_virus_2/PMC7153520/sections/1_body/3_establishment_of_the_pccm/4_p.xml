<p id="p0040">In line with the development of a PCCM fellowship program, a detailed standard for creation of a PCCM department was established by the CTS and the Chinese Association of Chest Physicians in 2018, consisting of six components: organization of the department, scope of practice, essential space and equipment, faculty and staff, administration body, and culture. Inclusion of medical and respiratory ICUs was emphasized as a main component of a PCCM department. By September 2019, more than 1,600 hospitals in China had participated and become compliant with requirements set forth by the PCCM Department Standardized Construction Program.
