<p>In general, all the 21 sequences obtained from the 2015 outbreak grouped together as a monophyletic lineage and belonged to genotype I, including those derived from mosquito macerates and human specimens (

No phylogenetic difference was detected between mosquito and human host sequences. Two 2015 sequences grouped separately: sequence US/DB207/2015 grouped together with a 2013 Australian (Cairns) sequence and sequence US/DB203/2014 grouped with a cluster of sequences that circulated in Australia and Papua New Guinea between 2008 and 2014. Time of the most recent common ancestor suggests that the Hawaiian 2015 lineage emerged in the region by 2013 (1.4â€“3.36 years 95% highest posterior density) and is closely related to sequences from New Caledonia with contemporary circulation. However, all eight sequences from 2001 grouped separately and belonged to genotype IV.
