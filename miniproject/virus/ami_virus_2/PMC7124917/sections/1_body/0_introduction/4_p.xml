<p>Dengue epidemics vectored by 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are less common than those vectored by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> because presumably 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is better adapted to urban environments, exploits artificial containers for oviposition, and is highly anthropophagic, preferring to feed almost exclusively on humans.

 </sup> By contrast, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> will opportunistically feed on numerous mammals, including humans, dogs, cattle, and swine.

 </sup>
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is more common in forested or rural areas, and it will oviposit in artificial or natural (tree holes) containers when available.

 </sup> The objectives of this investigation were to determine the respective roles of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the 2015–16 dengue outbreak and document the spatial distribution of these species on Hawaii Island.
