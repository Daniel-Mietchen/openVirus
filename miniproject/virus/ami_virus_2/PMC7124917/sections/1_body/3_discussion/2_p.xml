<p>We are unable to discount the possibility that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was involved at some foci. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> was found at six sites where dengue case-patients resided, three of which were clustered near the town of Milolii. Most mosquitoes collected at those locations (94%) were 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (
 <italic>N</italic> = 747; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). It is significant that 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was dominant in communities that relied on water storage for domestic use and for drinking. Furthermore, entomological investigations collected adult 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in Hookena Beach Park, which was identified as a possible site of exposure during the early phases of the outbreak.

 </sup> Not all mosquito specimens were tested for viral RNA, as those collected in neighborhoods where no recent DENV cases were reported would have been less likely to be infected with DENV. Consequently, we may have not detected some virus-positive specimens because of timing of the investigation. Furthermore, sampling at Rock Bottom was conducted in December, concurrent with active transmission in humans, whereas in Kealakehe and Wonderview, specimens were collected in January, 1â€“2 weeks after the case-patients were reported to the HDOH. Finally, not all our investigations could be completed before vector control activities were conducted in Milolii, Telephone Exchange, and Hookena, which might have affected our findings.
