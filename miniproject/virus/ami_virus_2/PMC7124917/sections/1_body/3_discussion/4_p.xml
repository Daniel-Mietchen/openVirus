<p>In preparation for future arbovirus introductions, we recommend that Hawaii implement standardized surveillance programs and continue to build vector control infrastructure targeting 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
 </sup> Special attention should be given to targeting aquatic habitats of immature 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, which are often cryptic, and the fine-scale mapping of the occurrence and abundances of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, including their relative abundance. Local vector populations should be screened for resistance to first line of defense insecticides, and we suggest that the suitability and acceptability of novel vector control interventions in Hawaii be assessed.
