<p>During the 2015–16 DENV outbreak on Hawaii Island, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was found at all sampled sites where laboratory-confirmed case-patients resided, and RNA of DENV-1 was detected by RT-PCR from pools of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> collected at Rock Bottom. Phylogenetic analysis showed the virus identified from 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and human specimens belonged to genotype I and were monophyletic. In addition, extensive mosquito trapping near clusters of DENV-confirmed case-patients in Wonderview, Kealakehe, and Hilo detected 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, but no 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. These results indicated that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was the primary vector responsible for transmitting DENV on Hawaii Island during the 2015–16 outbreak. This is the first entomological investigation to detect DENV in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in the state of Hawaii, confirming its importance in DENV transmission on the islands of Hawaii.
