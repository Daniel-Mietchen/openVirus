 <p>A dengue outbreak occurred on Hawaii Island between September 2015 and March 2016. Entomological investigations were undertaken between December 2015 and February 2016 to determine which 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito species were responsible for the outbreak. A total of 3,259 mosquitoes were collected using a combination of CDC autocidal gravid ovitraps, Biogents BG-Sentinel traps, and hand-nets; immature mosquitoes were collected during environmental surveys. The composition of species was 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> (58%), 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (25%), 
  <italic>Wyeomyia mitchelli</italic> (7%), 
  <italic>Aedes vexans</italic> (5%), 
  <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> (4%), and 
  <italic>Aedes japonicus</italic> (1%). Adult mosquitoes were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of dengue virus (DENV) RNA. Of the 185 pools of female mosquitoes tested, 15 containing 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were positive for the presence of DENV type 1 RNA. No virus was detected in pools of the remaining species. Phylogenetic analysis showed the virus strain belonged to genotype I and was closely related to strains that were circulating in the Pacific between 2008 and 2014. This is the first report of detection of DENV in 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from Hawaii.
