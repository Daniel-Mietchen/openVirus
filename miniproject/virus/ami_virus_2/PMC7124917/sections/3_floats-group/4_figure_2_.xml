  <p>Genetic relatedness of Hawaii dengue virus (DENV-1) strains. Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction using a maximum clade credibility tree that includes 71 DENV-1 E gene (1,485 bp) sequences and corresponds to the complete gene sequence. Posterior probabilities of major tree nodes are shown. (*) next to taxon label indicates the sequence obtained during the 2015â€“2016 dengue outbreak on Hawaii Island. Sequences without (*) were obtained from GenBank. Mosquito icon next to taxa label indicates sequences derived from 
   <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> hosts. Sequences without the mosquito icon were derived from human hosts.
