   <sup>5</sup>, 12-well plates, triplicates) infected at low multiplicity of infection (MOI, 0.001) with WT A/AA/6/60 or MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV at 33 °C, 37 °C, and 39 °C were analyzed at the indicated h p.i. (24, 48, 72, and 96) by immunofocus assay using an anti-NP mAb (HB-65). Data represent the means and SDs of the results determined from triplicate wells. The dashed line indicates the limit of detection (200 fluorescent forming units, FFU/mL). (
