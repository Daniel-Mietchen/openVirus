 <sup>+</sup>) in vivo (

 <sup>5</sup> FFU of the indicated viruses and evaluated morbidity (body weight) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f005">Figure 5</xref>A) and mortality (survival) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f005">Figure 5</xref>B) for 14 days. We also examined viral titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates of C57BL/6-infected mice at 2 and 4 days p.i. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D, respectively). C57BL/6 mice are a validated animal model of influenza infection, which has been used previously to evaluate IAV virulence, attenuation, and/or protection efficacy of new influenza vaccines [
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="B41-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. None of the viruses caused weight loss, with all groups gaining weight over the course of the experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f005">Figure 5</xref>A), although the weight variation was not directly compared to mock-infected animals. Moreover, as expected, all infected mice survived viral infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f005">Figure 5</xref>B). Notably, the WT MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV, containing a mutated PA and a functional NS1 (PA
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>/NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>) had undetectable viral titers in both the lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f005">Figure 5</xref>C) and nasal turbinates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f005">Figure 5</xref>D) at Day 4. These data, along with the previous results, suggest that removing PA-X results in a vaccine that is attenuated as compared to the WT MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV, suggesting that a mutant MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV lacking PA-X has a better safety profile than the currently MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV.
