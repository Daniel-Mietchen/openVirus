<p>Recently, we have shown that IAV PA-X and NS1 proteins can affect viral pathogenicity and the safety and immunogenicity of a pH1N1 LAIV candidate [
 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, we wanted to examine how PA-X and NS1 of the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV affected host gene expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>). To this end, we used a well-established approach to evaluate the ability of NS1 and PA-X proteins to block host gene expression [
 <xref rid="B26-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Human 293T cells were co-transfected with pCAGGS plasmids expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or Gaussia luciferase (Gluc), along with pDZ plasmids that were either empty (E), contained the WT PA from the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV (PA
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>), or a mutant PA that has an altered frameshift (PA
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>). At 24 h post-transfection (p.t.), cells were imaged under a fluorescent microscope for GFP expression while tissue culture supernatants (TCS) were collected to quantify Gluc using a luminometer. The PA-X of the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV had a strong inhibitory activity showing almost complete knock down of GFP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) and a large decrease in Gluc (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>B) expression. In comparison, the mutant 
 <italic>PA</italic> gene that contained an altered frameshift motif, which is unable to express PA-X, showed no inhibition of GFP or Gluc protein synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>A,B, respectively). Together these results indicate that the WT PA from the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV expresses a functional PA-X that inhibits host gene expression, and that disruption of the frameshift prevents the inhibitory effect mediated by PA-X. To verify that the PA protein was being expressed we also performed Western blot analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). We were able to detect similar expression levels of both WT and mutant PA proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). We were unable to detect directly PA-X expression in these assays, as the frameshift efficiency is only 1.3% for the WT 
 <italic>PA</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Next, we examined the ability of MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV NS1 to inhibit protein synthesis. Similar to PA-X, we co-transfected the two plasmids expressing the GFP and Gluc reporter genes with either empty (E), WT NS1 (NS1
 <sub>WT</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>), or mutant NS1 (NS1
 <sub>MT</sub>
 <sup>−</sup>) pDZ plasmids. The WT MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV NS1 protein was able to effectively inhibit expression of both GFP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>D) and Gluc (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>E) reporter proteins while the NS1 containing the mutations F103S and M106I in the CPSF30 binding domain showed no inhibitory effect in GFP or Gluc expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>D,E, respectively). We also analyzed NS1 protein expression by Western blot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>F). While both WT and mutant NS1 proteins were expressed from their respective plasmids, the mutant NS1 showed higher expression levels as compared to the WT NS1, because of the ability of WT NS1 to inhibit its own synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00086-f001">Figure 1</xref>F) [
 <xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These results demonstrate that WT NS1 from the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV inhibits protein expression and that mutations F103S and M106I, previously described to affect binding to CPSF30 [
 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], remove its inhibitory effect on host gene expression.
