<p>Mouse sera were collected by submandibular bleeding at 21 days p.i. and evaluated for the presence of influenza virus-specific antibodies by ELISA [

 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Briefly, 96-well plates were coated for 16 h at 4 °C with lysates from mock- or pH1N1 WT virus-infected MDCK cells. Alternatively, plates were coated with pH1N1 HA (200 ng/well) (FR-180, International Reagent Resource) recombinant protein. After washing with PBS, coated wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% BSA and then incubated with 1:2 dilutions (starting dilution of 1:100) of mouse serum at 37 °C. After 1 h incubation, wells were washed with PBS and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were developed with tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (BioLegend) for 10 min at room temperature, quenched with 2 N H
