<p>To generate the recombinant WT A/AA/6/60, MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV, and mutant MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIVs, recombinant PB2 LAIV, PB1 LAIV, PA, and NP viral segments were synthesized de novo (Geneart) into a pMK plasmid. The recombinant M and NS segments were synthetized using Strings DNA Fragments technology (Geneart) and cloned into a pGEM-T plasmid (Promega). All the viral genes were synthetized with appropriate restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends for subcloning into the ambisense plasmid pDZ [

 <italic>ts</italic> mutations in PB2 (S265N), PB1 (E391K, G581E, and T661A) and NP (G34D) were introduced [

 <xref rid="B35-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] were introduced into the viral NS segment to mutate the NS1 protein. All the mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in the pMK or pGEM-T plasmids before subcloning into the ambisense pDZ plasmid. All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing (ACGT Inc.). Primers for the generation of the different plasmid constructs are available upon request.
