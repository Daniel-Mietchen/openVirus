<p>Transfected cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) and proteins were separated by denaturing electrophoresis using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% dried skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (T-PBS) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies (pAb) against NS1 [

A mouse mAb against actin (A1978; Sigma) was used as an internal loading control. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) against either mouse or rabbit immunoglobulins (Ig) were used to detect bound primary antibodies. Protein expression was detected with a SuperSignal West Femto maximum-sensitivity chemiluminescent substrate kit (Thermo Scientific) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Protein bands were normalized to the level of beta-actin expression, and then the level of expression of the WT protein was considered 100%. In the case of
