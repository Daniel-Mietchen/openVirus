<p>Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells (10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well, 6-well plate format) were infected for 1 h at room temperature, and after virus adsorption, cells were overlaid with agar and incubated at 33 °C. At 3 days p.i., cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After the overlays were removed, cells were permeabilized (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 15 min at room temperature and prepared for immunostaining as previously described [
