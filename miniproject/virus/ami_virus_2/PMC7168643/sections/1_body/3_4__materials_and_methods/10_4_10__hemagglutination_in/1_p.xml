<p>HAI assays were used to assess the presence of HA inhibition antibodies [
 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To that end, mouse sera were treated with receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) (Denka Seiken) and heat inactivated for 30 min at 56 Â°C. Sera were then serially 2-fold diluted (starting dilution of 1:20) in 96-well V-bottom plates and mixed 1:1 with 4 hemagglutinating units (HAU) of pH1N1 WT for 60 min at room temperature. The HAI titers were determined by adding 0.5% turkey red blood cells (RBCs) to the virus-antibody mixtures for 30 min on ice.
