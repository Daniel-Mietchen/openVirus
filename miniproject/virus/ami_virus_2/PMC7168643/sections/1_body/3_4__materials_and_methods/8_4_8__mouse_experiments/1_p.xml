<p>Female 6-to-8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and maintained in the animal care facility at the University of Rochester under specific-pathogen-free conditions. All animal protocols were approved by the University of Rochester Committee of Animal Resources and complied with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council. Mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11/group) were anesthetized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (Avertin; 240 mg/kg of body weight) and then infected intranasally (i.n.) with 30 Î¼L of the indicated LAIVs. For challenge experiments mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11/group) were anesthetized i.p. and infected i.n. with 1000X the Median Lethal Dose (MLD
 <sub>50</sub>) of pH1N1. Mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5/group) were monitored daily for morbidity (body weight loss) and mortality (survival) as previously described [

Mice showing 25% loss of their initial body weight were considered to have reached the experimental endpoint and were humanely euthanized. Virus replication was evaluated by determining viral titers in the lungs or nasal turbinates at 2 and 4 days p.i. To that end, three mice in each group were sacrificed, and lungs or nasal turbinates were extracted and homogenized. Virus titers were determined by immunofocus assay (FFU/mL) as indicated above.
