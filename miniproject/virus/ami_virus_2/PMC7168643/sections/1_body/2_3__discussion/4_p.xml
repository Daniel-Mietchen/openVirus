<p>Taken together our results show that removal of PA-X by modifying the frameshift sequence results in a vaccine that is fully protective but is further attenuated, suggesting that in a clinical setting this vaccine would be safer than the current MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV in use. Thus, this new MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV with reduced PA-X levels could be used for parts of the population where current LAIVs are not recommended, such as children under the age of two, immunocompromised individuals, the elderly, and pregnant adults. Furthermore, one of the major drawbacks for the current LAIV is that it can have adverse effects in children younger than two years of age, a cohort that would benefit greatly from an LAIV over the traditional chemically IIV. In addition, this safer MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV lacking a functional PA-X will have another attenuation marker outside the current PB2, PB1, and NP segments, leading to less concerns of reversion to a WT virulent phenotype.</p>
