<p>The current MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV has mutations mainly located in areas of the polymerase complex. There is always a concern that, with enough pressure, the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV could introduce mutations to compensate and revert back to a pathogenic strain [
 <xref rid="B47-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. By introducing mutations into additional viral genes (
 <italic>PA</italic> and 
 <italic>NS1</italic>), the probability of reversion to a more virulent strain is decreased even further, adding to the increased safety profile desired for an MDV LAIV. However, the stability of the generated viruses should be tested using validated systems for IAV vaccine production. Additionally, by having another attenuation marker outside of the current PB2, PB1 and NP viral segments, there is less concern about the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV reassorting with a circulating strain.
