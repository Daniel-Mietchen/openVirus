<p>The influenza A virus (IAV) belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family of enveloped viruses, which contain an eight-segmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA genome [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. According to the antigenic properties of the hemagglutinin (HA; H1–H18) and neuraminidase (NA; N1–N11) viral surface glycoproteins, IAVs are classified in subtypes with 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes currently circulating [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In humans, IAV is responsible for seasonal epidemics that cause mild to severe respiratory illness or even death, representing a threat worldwide to public health. Vaccination is considered the most effective approach to protect against seasonal influenza infections. However, despite worldwide vaccination plans, seasonal influenza is still responsible for 1 billion infections, causing 3–5 million cases of severe disease, and between 290,000 and 650,000 deaths annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) [
 <xref rid="B3-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Currently, seasonal IAVs circulating in humans include the H3N2 and the H1N1 subtypes [
 <xref rid="B4-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However due to constant antigenic drift, vaccines have to be reformulated yearly to ensure that the HA and NA proteins included in the vaccine match those present in the seasonally circulating virus.
