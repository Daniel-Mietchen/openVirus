<p>We have postulated that the ability of IAV NS1 and/or PA-X to inhibit innate immune responses might be modulated to generate more effective and/or safer LAIV approaches. In fact, we have generated LAIV-encoding PA-X and NS1 proteins with different abilities to inhibit host gene expression, using the backbone of an A/California/04/09 pandemic (p)H1N1 LAIV, demonstrating the feasibility of implementing this approach, alone or in combination with other methodologies, for the development of a novel LAIVs [
 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Here, we have evaluated whether the current MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV used for the preparation of the seasonal human LAIV could be improved either in safety and/or immunogenicity by modulating the ability of NS1 and/or PA-X proteins to block host gene expression. To this end, first we evaluated if the NS1 and PA-X proteins of the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV have the ability to inhibit host gene expression. Next, we engineered a set of MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIVs encoding PA-X and NS1 proteins with different abilities to inhibit host gene expression, alone or in combination, and the HA and NA of pH1N1. The replication capability of these viruses was evaluated in vitro and their safety, immunogenicity, and protection efficacy against a homologous pH1N1 challenge were assessed in vivo using a mouse model of IAV infection. Our studies indicate that removing PA-X expression by altering the frameshift site, the MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV can be further attenuated while still retaining a similar immunogenic and protective profile. The implementation of this approach could help to develop safer LAIVs than the currently commercially available IAV LAIV.
