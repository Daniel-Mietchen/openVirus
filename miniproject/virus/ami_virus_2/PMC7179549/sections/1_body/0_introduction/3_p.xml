 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since the beginning of the epidemic in late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has now spread to all continents, and as of March 18, 2020, the WHO communicated 179,111 confirmed cases and 7,426 deaths globally (Situation Report-57). In this review, we try to summarize the most recent knowledge about some epidemiological parameters including clinical symptoms, transmissibility of the virus, and the incubation period. Furthermore, the molecular diagnostics, protein modeling of the spike glycoprotein, and phylogenesis of the virus will be discussed.
