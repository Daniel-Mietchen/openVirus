<p>Coronaviruses belong to the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> and are positive single-stranded RNA viruses surrounded by an envelope. They are divided into four genera: 
 <italic>Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-</italic>, and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic>. To date, seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified, which fall within the 
 <italic>Alpha-</italic> and 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genera. The 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> genus includes 
 <italic>HCoV-NL63</italic> and 
 <italic>HCoV-229E</italic>, while the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus comprises 
 <italic>HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV</italic> (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus), 
 <italic>MERS-CoV</italic> (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus), and the novel 
 <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) [

 <italic>HCoV-229E</italic> and the betacoronaviruses 
 <italic>HCoV-OC43</italic> and 
 <italic>HCoV-HKU1</italic> usually cause common colds, but also severe lower respiratory tract infections, especially in the elderly and children [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. HCoV-NL63 infection has also been significantly associated with croup (laryngotracheitis) [
