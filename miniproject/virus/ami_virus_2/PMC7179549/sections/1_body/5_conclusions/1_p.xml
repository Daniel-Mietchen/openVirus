<p>This study is a picture of the current research on molecular evolution, epidemiology, and diagnostics in response to the outbreak of COVID-19. Many studies have been published within different scientific disciplines with the intent to control and prevent this pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis and homology modeling add new knowledge together with epidemiological and diagnostic methods. Studies exploring the genome and the structure of the viral proteins are essential in order to define prevention and control measures to minimize the impact of the outbreak. All this knowledge will pave the way for the development of a vaccine and antiviral therapy.</p>
