<p>Regarding the sites under positive selective pressure found on the Spike glycoprotein, the results have shown that amino acid position 536 in COVID-19 has an Asn residue, while the Bat SARS-like coronavirus has a Gln residue; the SARS virus, instead, has an Asp residue. In amino acid position 644 of the COVID-19 sequence there is a Thr residue, while the Bat SARS-like virus has a Ser residue; instead, the SARS virus has an Ala residue. Another study highlighted that several key residues responsible for binding of the SARS-CoV receptor-binding domain to the ACE2 receptor were variable in the COVID-19 receptor-binding domain (including Asn439, Asn501, Gln493, Gly485, and Phe486; COVID-19 numbering), and a number of deletion events in amino acid positions 455-457, 463-464, and 485-497 occurred in the bat-derived strains [
