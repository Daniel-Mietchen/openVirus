<p>The availability of protein structural information is an essential prerequisite for the interpretation of biological phenomena. In this case, knowledge of the virus's protein structure would greatly enhance the possibility of understanding the biological meaning of the observed mutations. Now, only the X-ray structure of COVID-19 nsp5 protease (PBD code 6LU7) is available, although it is expected that many other structures will become available soon. In the meantime, homology modeling could provide preliminary structural clues. Homology modeling needs structural templates sharing sufficient sequence similarity to the targets. In Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, a list of potential templates for homology modeling of the proteins coded by the COVID-19 genome is displayed. The structures with the largest coverage and the greatest sequence identity have been incorporated into Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. According to this list, it is evident that most of the viral proteins are at modeling distance from PDB structures. This information should be exploited as soon as possible.
