<p>Regarding the amino acid position 1,010 (corresponding to position 192 of the nsp3 protein), the homologous region of the Bat SARS-like coronavirus and SARS virus has a polar and an apolar amino acid, respectively, while COVID-19 has a Pro residue. In this case, it may be speculated that due to the steric bulge and stiffness of Pro, the molecular structure of COVID-19 may undergo a local conformational perturbation compared to the proteins of the other two viruses. In nsp3, the mutation falls near the polyprotein domain similar to a phosphatase present also in the SARS coronavirus (PDB code 2ACF) playing a key role in the replication process of the virus in infected cells [
