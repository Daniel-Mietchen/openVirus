<p>The structural similarity of the region in which the positive selective pressure occurs, and the stabilizing mutation falling in the endosome-associated protein-like domain of the nsp2 protein, should be probable reasons why this virus is more contagious than SARS. Instead, the destabilizing mutation located near the phosphatase domain of the nsp3 protein may explain why viral replication is slower than in SARS with a longer incubation period. Anyway, further studies are needed on this aspect [
