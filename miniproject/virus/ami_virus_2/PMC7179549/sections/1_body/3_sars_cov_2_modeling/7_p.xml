<p>As for the residue in position 723 (543 in the nsp3 protein), the COVID-19 sequence displays a Ser, replacing for Gly in the Bat SARS-like and SARS coronaviruses. In this case, it may be argued that this substitution could increase local stiffness of the polypeptide chain both for a steric effect (in contrast to Ser, Gly has no side chain) and for the ability of the Ser side chain to form H-bonds. Moreover, Ser can act as a nucleophile in determined structural environments, such as those of enzymes' active sites, and can be a phosphorylation site. However, within the I-TASSER model, this position is predicted to have low solvent accessibility.</p>
