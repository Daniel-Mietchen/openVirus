<p>Coronavirus entry into the host cell is mediated by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein that forms homotrimers that protrude from the viral surface [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The S protein is composed of the two subunits S1 and S2 responsible for binding to the host cell receptor and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, respectively. Different coronaviruses use different domains within the S1 subunit to enter the cell. These domains are named S
 <sup>A</sup> and S
 <sup>B</sup>. SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via domain S
 <sup>B</sup> to enter target cells [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It has recently been shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds the ACE2 receptor via the S
 <sup>B</sup> domain similarly to SARS-CoV, and that murine polyclonal antibodies inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell mediated by S. These data suggest that cross-neutralizing antibodies targeting conserved S epitopes elicited by vaccination could be used against SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and SARS-related coronaviruses [
