<p>The sites under positive selective pressure in this protein may suggest a possible interpretation of some clinical features of this virus compared to SARS and Bat SARS-like coronavirus. This analysis should find which are probably the most common sites undergoing an amino acid change, providing insight into some important proteins of COVID-19 that are involved in the mechanism of viral entry and viral replication. These data should contribute to improving our understanding of how this virus acts in its pathogenicity. Furthermore, to identify a potential molecular target is fundamental to follow the molecular evolution of the virus, which can suggest some interesting sites for a potential therapy or vaccine.</p>
