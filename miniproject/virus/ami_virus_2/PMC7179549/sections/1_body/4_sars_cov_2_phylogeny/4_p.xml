<p>Previous research on related coronaviruses suggests that these viruses accumulate between 1 and 3 changes in their genome per month (rates of 3 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 1 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> per site per year). Molecular clock calibration estimated the evolutionary rate of the 
 <italic>SARS-CoV-2</italic> whole genome sequences at 6.58 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions per site per year (95% HPD: 5.2 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> to 8.1 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>).
