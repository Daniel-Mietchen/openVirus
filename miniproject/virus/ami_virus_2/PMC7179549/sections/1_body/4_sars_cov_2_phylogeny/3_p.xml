<p>Using 74 publicly shared novel coronavirus (nCoV) genomes, we examined genetic diversity to infer the date of the common ancestor and the rate of spread. The high similarity of the genomes suggests they share a recent common ancestor. Otherwise, we would expect a greater number of differences between the samples. The jump from bats to humans most likely occurred in late November or early December 2019 (November 25, 2019; 95% HPD: September 28, 2019; December 21, 2019) [
