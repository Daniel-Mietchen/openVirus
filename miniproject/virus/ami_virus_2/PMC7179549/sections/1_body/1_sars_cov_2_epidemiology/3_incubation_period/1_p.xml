<p>To know the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 infection is key for implementing control measures and surveillance. It has been estimated that the median incubation period is 5.1 days (95% CI, 4.5-5.8), and 97.5% of the infected subjects will develop symptoms within 11.5 days (95% CI, 8.2-15.6) of infection. Based on these estimates, it can be assumed that 101 out of 10,000 cases will develop symptoms after 14 days of observation or quarantine [

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1-7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, 14-day monitoring is advised following contact with a probable or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case [
