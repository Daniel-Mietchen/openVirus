<p>Another route of possible viral transmission is the oral-fecal route. The scientific literature showed that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are viable in environmental conditions that facilitate oral-fecal transmission. SARS-CoV has been detected in sewage water of two Chinese hospitals in which patients with SARS were treated, and MERS-CoV was found to be viable on different surfaces at low temperature and low humidity [
