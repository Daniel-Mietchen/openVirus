<p>Confirmation of cases with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection is performed by detection of unique viral sequences with nucleic acid amplification tests such as reverse real-time PCR (rRT-PCR). As soon as on January 7, 2020, the Chinese health authorities had declared that a novel coronavirus was responsible for this outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, a European network of academic and public laboratories designed an rRT-PCR protocol based on the comparison and alignment of previously available SARS-CoV and bat-related coronavirus genome sequences as well as five sequences derived from the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 made available by the Chinese authorities [

 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> subgenus, while the second specific assay targets the RdRp gene encoding for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This assay contains two probes: one probe, which reacts with the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gene, and a second probe (RdRP_SARSr-P2) which is specific to SARS-CoV-2. Finally, the third additional confirmatory assay targets the nucleocapsid (N) gene. This last assay was not further validated because it is slightly less sensitive [
