<p id="para40">Case fatality rate (CFR) is one of the important unknowns of COVID-19. Leung and colleagues estimated the confirmed CFR (cCFR) outside Hubei was 0·98% (95% CI 0·82–1·16), which was consistent with the report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

 </xref> Since the epidemics in the studied locations did not overwhelm the health-care capacities, the data on the number of confirmed cases are believed to be reliable. Leung and colleagues also found the cCFR was correlated with provincial per capita gross domestic product and the availability of hospital beds per 10 000. In Wuhan, the CFR was up to 5·08% by March 28, 2020.

 </xref> The remarkable difference in the CFRa between these locations and Wuhan might be attributed to the difference in the degrees of health-care capacity. Therefore, consideration should be given to the variations in health-care capacity when implementing interventions. While the epidemic is growing exponentially, the health-care system will face severe burdens. Governments should act and prepare immediately to ensure that the health-care system has adequate labour, resources, and facilities to minimise the mortality risk of COVID-19.
