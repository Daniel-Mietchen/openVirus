<p>This study provides a first comprehensive summary and phylogeographic analysis on the WNV epidemic in Germany in 2018 and 2019 and highlights the risk of human WNV infections causing considerable risks for transfusion and organ transplantation safety. Therefore, intensive surveillance of mosquitoes, birds, horses and humans should remain a public health priority, e.g., to monitor the occurrence and subsequent spread of WNV or to develop targeted control mechanisms. Our study also highlights the need for international cooperation in the area of WNV surveillance and monitoring, especially across national borders and as a “one-health” approach for an improved risk analysis. This should also include the generation of higher numbers of whole-genome sequences, allowing for a more precise molecular epidemiology and strain characterization.</p>
