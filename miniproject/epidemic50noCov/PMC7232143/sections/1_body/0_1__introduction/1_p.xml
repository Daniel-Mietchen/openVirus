<p>West Nile virus (WNV, family

 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Spillover events have significant public health and veterinary relevance [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A total of 25% of the infected people develop West Nile fever (WNF) and become symptomatic (e.g., headache or muscle pain) [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Severe disease progressions manifesting as WNV neuroinvasive disease (WNND) are rare (&lt;1%) [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These include syndromes of meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid paralysis/poliomyelitis. Case-fatality rate of WNND is approximately 10% [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Age is the most important risk factor for WNND and a fatal disease outcome [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, WNV circulation poses considerable risk for transfusion and organ transplantation safety [
