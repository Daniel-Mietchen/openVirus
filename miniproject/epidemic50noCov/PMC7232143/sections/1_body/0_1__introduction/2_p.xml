<p>WNV is distributed in wide areas of Europe. The main focus of WNV circulation is in south-eastern Europe and Italy [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, low WNV activity is also observed in the neighboring countries of Germany (France, Austria, and Czech Republic). Therefore, over the last decade, different monitoring programs were implemented in Germany to screen for WNV RNA and antibodies in birds, horses, mosquitoes and chicken eggs [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In 2018, an epizootic emergence of WNV was observed in Germany for the first time [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. All WNV-positive birds and horses were infected with the same WNV lineage 2 strain of the central European subclade II. WNV activity was detected in eastern Germany over a distance of almost 900 km (Munich to Rostock). At the same time, a large WNV outbreak was observed in south-eastern and southern Europe [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, phylogenetic analysis in combination with the wide distribution in Germany indicates that WNV may have been introduced from the Czech Republic to Germany already before 2018 [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The emergence of WNV in Germany and the focus in the central part of eastern Germany was correlated with outstandingly high summer temperatures. As demonstrated for other European countries, WNV is probably predominantly transmitted by different native
