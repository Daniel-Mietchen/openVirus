<p>In this study, we report a WNV epidemic in Germany, 2019, triggered by an epizootic emergence among birds with spillover to horses and humans. Human and animal cases were located in the same area, showing a high WNV activity also in 2018. In both years, the region was characterized by suitable temperature conditions allowing a short extrinsic incubation period (EIP). Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analysis showed that Germany experienced several WNV introduction events. Several virus variants circulate in the affected German regions with Austria and Czech Republic as possible origins. The majority of the WNV strains involved in the German outbreak clustered together into a distinct and dominating group (Eastern German WNV clade) comprising of mosquito, bird, horse and human-related virus variants.</p>
