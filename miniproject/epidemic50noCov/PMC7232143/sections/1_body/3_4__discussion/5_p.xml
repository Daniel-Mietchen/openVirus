<p>The ongoing circulation and dominance of the EGC detected in 2019 indicates successful overwintering of WNV in Germany, e.g., through WNV persistence in hibernating mosquitoes throughout the winter season [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The virus variants of the EGC at multiple sites detected in the epidemic in 2019 are descendants of a common ancestor in the wider central European environment which dates back to the time span 2010â€“2012. Where and when the subsequent virus evolution to the current variants took place and how descendants were eventually transferred to Germany remains elusive. However, such a translocation and subsequent virus amplification may have been fostered by the extremely favorable climatic conditions for mosquitos in Germany in spring/summer 2018, and the short distance transmission with infected birds from neighboring countries.
