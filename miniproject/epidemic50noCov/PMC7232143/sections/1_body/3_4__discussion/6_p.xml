<p>There has been a comprehensive USUV/WNV monitoring system in place in Germany for over a decade which involves ornithologists, zoological gardens and bird clinics supplying thousands of zoo and wild bird samples for WNV antibody and genome analysis. Moreover, there has been an exhaustive mosquito surveillance in place in Germany since 2009. By both surveillance approaches a variety of viruses were found, such as Sindbis virus, Batai virus and USUV, but not WNV [

Although any such monitoring scheme has its predictive limitations due to sampling size constraints, all the negative WNV monitoring results from birds, horses and mosquitos before 2018 and the proximity to a larger region with active WNV circulation supports a recent introduction of multiple WNV descendants e.g., from Czech Republic to Germany. However, sequencing a larger number of more current WNV strains from e.g., Austria or the Czech Republic would help to answer the circumstances of when and what in regard to the development of the East German Clade variants. Overall, the number of recent whole genome sequences is limited and should be markedly increased using NGS-based approaches.
