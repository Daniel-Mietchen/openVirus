<p>We found evidence that the phylogenetic structure of EGC and virus genetic population growth is shaped by the geographic location and average extrinsic incubation period, which likely facilitated rapid short-distance virus dispersal in 2018/2019. This demonstrates that local ecological factors (e.g., average temperature profile during the vector season) could predict the local and regional dispersal patterns of WNV in our data sets. </p>
