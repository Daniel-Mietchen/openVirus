<p>Globalization and climate change enhance or can lead the migration of exotic pathogens and their hosts to new environments promoting the contacts with na√Øve and vulnerable hosts. Thus, understanding the local ecological factors and evolutionary processes which navigate the emergence, establishment and spread of newly introduced viral diseases is critical for developing and implementing surveillance strategies for disease control. The present study aimed to elucidate the possible origins, spatiotemporal spread pattern tendencies and eco-epidemiological factors that facilitate WNV becoming an established pathogen in Germany causing neuroinvasive disease in multiple vertebrate species, including humans.</p>
