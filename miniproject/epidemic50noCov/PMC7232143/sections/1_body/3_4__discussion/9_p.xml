<p>The purifying and negative selections observed for WNV in Germany were expected given the transmission and infection modes of arboviruses, leading to the accumulation of synonymous mutations [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Mutation observed at amino acid position Lys2114Arg has been found to be involved in the formation of EGC, while Val1493Ile (NS2b), Pro1754His (NS3), Ser2287Gly and Ala2322Thr (NS4b), Ala2827Thr and Lys3056Arg (NS5) are specific for the CEC (convergent evolution). Similar patterns of parallel or convergent evolution have been observed for WNV. This suggests that a limited number of residue changes are permitted due to functional constraints [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Viral adaptation in vector and vertebrate hosts by local overwintering or reintroduction of the virus and local ecological conditions (e.g., high average EIP) could be considered key determinants in the spatial dispersal and establishment of WNV. It is interesting to note that the Lys2114Arg mutation is specific for the newly described EGC. The impact of this mutation is unclear; a similar change in the WNV NS3 helicase (Thr1754Pro) generated a highly virulent phenotype to American crows [
