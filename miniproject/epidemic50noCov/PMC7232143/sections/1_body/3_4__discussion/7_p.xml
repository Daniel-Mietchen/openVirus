<p>Most of the singleton WNV variants in Germany do not contain the monophyletic Lys2114Arg mutation located in the C terminus of the NS3 gene, even if these strains circulate in the central-eastern part of the country with very high WNV activity and rapid expansion of the EGC. Although these singletons have circulated and evolved under the same ecological conditions as members of EGC, it seems that these variants were not able to perpetuate and establish a stable enzootic cycle leading to a similar epizootic/epidemic scenario as for the EGC group. In case of the EGC, the adaptation to na√Øve vector and host populations leads to the emergence of local virus variants. The most likely scenario for EGC might be enzootic maintenance similar to that observed for WNV in the United States [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that EGC form a star-like structure (population expansion after a single viral introduction) in which the variant viral strains accumulate changes during the rapid adaptation to the local ecological conditions (adaptation of the virus to the host populations and its enzootic maintenance), as observed for Usutu virus [
