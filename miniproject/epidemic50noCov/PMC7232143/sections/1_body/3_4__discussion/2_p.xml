<p>One year after the first observed autochthonous WNV transmission to birds and horses in Germany [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], an epizootic emergence of WNV was again observed in 2019. The number of infected birds and horses was considerably higher (76 birds and 36 horses) compared to 2018 (12 birds and two horses). In contrast to the USA, WNV-associated mass mortality in birds had not been observed in Europe before [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Previous hypotheses for this difference have been refuted by several research studies, e.g., demonstrating that European birds are susceptible to WNV infections and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes in Europe are competent to transmit WNV. An alternative explanation might by that the bird mortality is so low that it is not detected with current European surveillance programs. A comprehensive USUV/WNV monitoring system is in place, but we also only see the tip of the iceberg of WNV infected birds in Germany. In addition, a huge number of positive specimens were obtained from captive animals (e.g., birds kept in zoos), which have a higher probability of detection compared to wild animals. Furthermore, from these birds, a considerable proportion were birds of prey, which must be considered to have a higher susceptibility to WNV infection [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This in combination with a widespread enzootic circulation of WNV and large number of equine cases—36 in 2019 in contrast to 2 in 2018—indicates an increased risk of WNV spillover into the human population.
