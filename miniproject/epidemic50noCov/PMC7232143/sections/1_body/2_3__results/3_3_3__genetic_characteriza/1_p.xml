<p>The genetic variations across the viral genome were low and homogenous (0.1%â€“0.7%) indicating that the analyzed WNV has maintained genetically stable since its first detection in 2018. The identity matrices for the genome and for individual genes were greater than 99.2%. The greatest variation was observed in the nonstructural genes coding for the NS1, NS2A, NS3 and NS5.</p>
