EGC population dynamics showed a slightly increased growth phase from the beginning of emergence when the virus effective population size (Ne) remained constant until 2015. From that year, a constant increasing tendency for the Ne values was observed, which is in line with the strong population expansion started in 2015–2016 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00448-f002">Figure 2</xref>a,b). The monophyletic LysArg mutation located in the C terminus of the NS3 gene appeared only in Eastern German clade strains, while the paraphyletic Lys
 <sub>3056</sub>Arg mutation from the NS5 gene was found to be common for EGC strains and some WNV from Austria (MF984341), Czech Republic (KM203862) and Germany (LR743437 and LR743434). There are several non-synonymous mutations in the nonstructural genes, which exhibit geographical structures specific of the members of the CEC (

 <sub>S</sub> ratios in the polyprotein of EGC, CEC and SEEC were 0.118, 0.136 and 0.154, respectively, indicating that most sites are subject to strong purifying or negative selection. There was no evidence for positive or episodic diversifying selection in the WNV strains from Germany.
