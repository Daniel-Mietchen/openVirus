<p>In order to investigate the evolutionary relationship and origin of WNV in Germany, a Bayesian MCMC sampling method and ML method were implemented. Similar topologies inferred by ML (not shown) and Bayesian MCC phylogenies of the European WNV lineage 2 data set revealed that all European strains fell into two distinct highly supported groups designated as Southeastern European clade (SEEC) and Central and Eastern European clade (CEC). All WNV strains from Germany fell into the CEC (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00448-f002">Figure 2</xref>) of which four consisted of singleton strains (WNV strains ED-I-155_19/ LR743422, ED-I-177_19/ LR743431, ED-I-201_19/ LR743448 and ED-I-205_19/ LR743454) associated with Austrian relatives (

However, the majority of the WNV strains from Germany clustered into a well defined monophyletic group designated as Eastern German clade (EGC). The EGC is also notable for a star-like structure in which several subclades connect viruses sampled from multiple locations and time points (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00448-f003">Figure 3</xref>). These and other findings revealed that the genetic diversity of WNV in Europe is shaped primarily by in situ evolution rather than by extensive migration. No specific phylogenetic clustering and differences between the WNV strains from birds, horses, mosquitoes and humans in Germany were observed. The genetic variations of WNV combined with sample collection dates and locations can help to identify the possible source and the evolutionary history of the newly emerging viral variants. In order to assess viral migration and explore the origin of the WNV outbreaks in Germany, a discrete-trait phylogeography analysis was used to reconstruct the WNV movements between European countries and within Germany. Both data sets (European and German strains only, EGC) exhibited strong temporal signals (R

The coefficient of rate variation supports the use of a strict clock model for European data set and a relaxed clock for the data set “German strains only” (data not shown). The Bayesian MCC tree showed that although the WNV diversity in the “German strains only” group appears to have emerged in the last four years, the phylogeny of CEC which includes EGC suggests relative long-term circulation and evolution in Central Europe (
