<p>In further detail, the phylogeographic analysis suggests at least six distinct introductions of WNV into Germany from neighboring countries. It is predicted that all viral clade evolution events occurred during the last 16 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00448-f002">Figure 2</xref>a). It should be noted that unlike its designation may suggest, the EGC can have developed in the wider southeastern and central European hemisphere and may have been translocated only later to Eastern Germany. Sequencing a larger number of more current WNV strains from e.g., Austria, the Czech Republic, and Poland would help to answer the circumstances of when and what in regard to the development of the East German Clade variants. Overall, the number of recent whole genome sequences is limited and should be markedly increased using NGS-based approaches.
