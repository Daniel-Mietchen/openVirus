<p>Based on the albeit only limited Central European strain data, the tMRCA of the EGC group indicates a very recent emergence which was most likely introduced into Germany as a single introduction event. The progenitor of this Eastern European clade dates back to 2011, most probably circulating in Czech Republic (95% HPD 2010–2012; posterior probability, pp = 0.88) (

Except for the members of the EGC, all other WNV strains found most recently in Germany seem to be descendants of ancestors from Austria (95% HPD for 2000 to 2015; pp = 0.83−0.97). The spatial diffusion pattern of WNV within Germany and between Germany and neighboring countries has been reconstructed using a Bayes Factor (BF) test under Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection analysis (BSSVS). The strongest epidemiological links based on the BF estimates have been detected between Austria–Germany and Czech Republic–Germany, while the links within Germany have been detected between Halle–Berlin, Berlin–Halle, Berlin–Hamburg, Berlin–Dresden and Halle with neighboring localities (
