<p>In September 2018, a 31-year-old male veterinarian developed flu-like symptoms after necropsy of a WNV-positive owl (

The laboratory confirmation was based on detection of an IgM response against WNV and a cross-reactive IgG response against WNV, which might be also the result of past vaccinations against TBE and yellow fever virus. The first mosquito-borne, autochthonous infection for Germany was confirmed in Leipzig, Federal State of Saxony on 20 September 2019. The 69-year-old male patient presented with WNND, received supportive treatment at the Infectious Diseases (ID) intensive care unit (ICU) between September 3rd and September 20th and was released with restitutio ad integrum. The laboratory confirmation was based on detection of WNV RNA in an early CSF, serum and urine sample and the detection of WNV IgM and IgG in serum samples. A second autochthonous case in Leipzig, an 81-year old male, was admitted to the ICU with presumptive diagnosis of pneumonia, then transferred to the ID-ICU and was found to have WNND confirmed by WNV IgM and IgG in serum samples as well as WNV RNA in CSF samples as early as from 19 September. He also recovered after 12 days of supportive care including mechanical ventilation without neurological sequelae. Both patients reported no history of travel to WNV-endemic countries and routes of non-vector borne transmission were excluded. While one patient had direct contact with the corpse of a Blue Tit (
 <italic>Parus caeruleus</italic>) five days before onset of fever, the other one reported no obvious contact with animals. Both patients had experienced multiple mosquito bites in the weeks before onset of illness. The third WNV infection was diagnosed on 24 September in a 46-year-old female patient from Berlin, Federal State of Berlin, who presented with West Nile Fever (WNF). The patient did not receive any treatment and recovered within two weeks. The laboratory confirmation was based on detection of WNV RNA in an early serum sample and seroconversion of WNV IgM and IgG in later serum samples. The fourth WNV infection was diagnosed retrospectively based on IgM and IgG detection in a serum sample on 16 October in a 44-year-old female patient from the district Wittenberg Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt. The patient was initially admitted to a local hospital with WNND-like symptoms on 10 September. After receiving supportive care, she was discharged on 17 September with restitutio ad integrum. The serological diagnosis was confirmed on 23 October by the detection of WNV RNA in a serum sample from the acute phase of infection. The fifth WNV infection was diagnosed on 23 October in a 24-year-old female patient from the district Leipzig, Federal State of Saxony, who presented with WNF (onset of symptoms 6 of October) and did not receive any treatment and recovered within one week. The laboratory confirmation was based on detection of WNV-specific IgM and IgG in a serum sample. As of 20 December, no further cases have been reported.
