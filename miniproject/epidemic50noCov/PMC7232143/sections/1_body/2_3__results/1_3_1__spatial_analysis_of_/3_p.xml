<p>Especially in 2019, a large number of different bird species was affected (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00448-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). A total of 52 birds (59.1% of all WNV-positive birds in 2018/2019) were held in captivity. From the total of 88 infected birds only four goshawks in private aviaries survived the infection. Of the 38 infected horses, 29 animals showed typical clinical symptoms, of which five horses died or were euthanized. Most of the other sick horses recovered in a very short time. Another nine horses were asymptomatic and were detected in the framework of additional investigations of holdings in relation to the clinical outbreaks. All 38 infected horses were positive in the IgM-ELISA and were therefore notified.
