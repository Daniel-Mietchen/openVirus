<p>The area with highest activity of WNV circulation was similar in 2018 and 2019, i.e., central-eastern Germany with most WNV-positive samples (mosquitoes, birds and horses) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00448-f001">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, all mosquito-borne, autochthonous human WNV cases were observed in this region. This matches the risk analysis based on the temperature conditions during summer, which indicates short EIP
 <sub>ave</sub> (&lt;15 days) for this area. The region along the Upper Rhine Valley (south-western Germany) was also characterized by low EIP
 <sub>ave</sub> values, but no WNV circulation was detected in either year. Re-emergence of WNV was not observed for the most northern (Rostock) and southern (Poing) foci of WNV from 2018. This correlates with higher EIP
 <sub>ave</sub> values for 2019 (&gt;25 d; Poing: 28.4, Rostock: 26.2) compared to 2018 (&lt;25 d; Poing: 21.6, Rostock: 19.6) for these areas, i.e., lower risk of WNV transmission.
