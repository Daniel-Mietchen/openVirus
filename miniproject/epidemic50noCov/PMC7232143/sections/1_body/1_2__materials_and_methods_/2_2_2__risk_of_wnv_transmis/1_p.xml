<p>The extrinsic incubation period (EIP) gives the time between ingestion of a pathogen via blood meals and the vectors’ ability to retransmit the pathogen. In contrast to other indices for transmission risk (e.g., field-measured infection rates of vectors), this approach is a theoretical risk assessment using information on the temperature-dependent EIP from the literature. However, EIP values give an approximation of virus transmission risk through the mosquito vector under local temperature conditions. Therefore, daily EIP values (EIP
 <sub>d</sub>) of WNV were calculated with the formula −0.132 + 0.0092 × temperature [

 <sub>d</sub> values for the subsequent days were summed up until the virus development was completed (=EIP). For each grid cell and year, EIP values were averaged for the period from 15th July to 14th August (=EIP
