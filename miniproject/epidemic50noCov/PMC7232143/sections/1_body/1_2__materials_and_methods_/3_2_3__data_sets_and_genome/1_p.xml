<p>A total of 39 WNV genomes from birds, humans, mosquitoes and horses were newly acquired as part of this study (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00448-f001">Figure 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00448">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The extracted viral RNA of WNV positive specimens was subjected to a next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflow [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], or to random RT-PCR amplification followed by library preparation by using the QIAseq FX DNA Library Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). They were normalized, sampled and sequenced using 150-cycle NextSeq550 Reagent Kits v2.5 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) on a NextSeq550 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) or the Ion Torrent S5 chemistry (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on an Ion Torrent S5 XL platform (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All whole genome sequences of WNV with known sampling time (year) and geographical origin (country) from Europe were retrieved from GenBank (n = 98) and combined with those sequenced in this study. Two data sets have been created: one containing all genomes from Europe incl. Germany, and a second one comprising the “Eastern German clade only.” Sequences were aligned using the MAFFT algorithm and then visually inspected in Geneious v2020.0.2 (

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The obtained full-length recovered genome sequences of the WNV were submitted to GenBank or the European Nucleotide Archive (accession no. MN794935-MN794939, LR743421-LR743437, and LR743442-LR743458).
