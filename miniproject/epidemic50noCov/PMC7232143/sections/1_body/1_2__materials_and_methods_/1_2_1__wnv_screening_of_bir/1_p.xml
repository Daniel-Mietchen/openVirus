<p>Since the first outbreak of Usutu virus (USUV) in Germany (2011/12), a nationwide bird surveillance network (living and dead birds) was set up to monitor for zoonotic arboviruses with a focus on WNV and USUV. In this context, a variety of dead birds and organ samples were submitted to the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine and the national reference laboratory for WNV at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI) by the regional veterinary laboratories of the federal states of Germany, by the German Mosquito Control Association (KABS), the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU), citizens and independent bird clinics and zoological gardens. WNV infection in birds and horses is a notifiable disease in Germany if a recent infection is detected by a WNV-specific RT-qPCR result and/or a positive result of horses by IgM-ELISA, i.e., the detection of a fresh WNV infection. A previous vaccination of horses must be excluded. A positive IgG or neutralizing antibody detection is not notifiable in Germany.</p>
