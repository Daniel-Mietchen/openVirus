<p>Following the first confirmed avian WNV case in the Tierpark Berlin (Wildlife Park) in 2019, mosquitoes were collected in that park by EVS (Heavy Duty Encephalitis Vector Survey) traps (BioQuip Products, Rancho Dominguez, CA, USA) equipped with dry ice as an attractant. Traps were continuously operated from mid-September to early October and emptied daily. Captured mosquitoes were morphologically identified to species or complex using the determination key by Becker et al. [

Positive samples were inoculated on C6/36 cells (L 1299, Collection of Cell Lines in Veterinary Medicine (CCLV), Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald â€“ Insel Riems, Germany). Six days after inoculation, the supernatant of infected cultures was tested again with WNV RT-qPCR and the two samples with the lowest Ct-value were used for NGS analysis [
