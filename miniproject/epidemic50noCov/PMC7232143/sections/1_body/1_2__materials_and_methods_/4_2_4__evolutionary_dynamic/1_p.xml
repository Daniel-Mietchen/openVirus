<p>Genomes obtained for the German WNV strains were compared with all European complete or near complete genomes sequences publicly available. For molecular clock phylogenetics, maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were inferred using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach available in BEAST v1.10 [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Analyses were performed under the best fit nucleotide substitution model identified as GTR +Γ for the complete genome data set including “all European” genomes and TN93+Γ for the data set for “Germany only” using jModelTest 2 [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To search among maximum likelihood (ML) trees, we employed both nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) and subtree pruning and regrafting (SPR) branch swapping. To assess the robustness of each node, a bootstrap resampling process was performed (1000 replicates) again using the NNI branch-swapping method available in PhyML [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] (data not shown). We have employed the TempEst tool for an interactive regression approach to explore the association between genetic divergence through time and sampling dates [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In order to assess the spatiotemporal dynamics of WNV, the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA), evolutionary rate and the effective population dynamics of WNV was employed with a relaxed uncorrelated log normal and a strict molecular clock under a flexible demographic model (the coalescent Gaussian Markov Random field (GMRF) Bayesian Skyride) as the best demographic scenario detected. In all cases, each of the MCMC chain lengths was run for 5 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> generations (with 10% burn-in) with subsampling every 10
 <sup>4</sup> iterations to achieve convergence as assessed using Tracer v1.5 [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The MCC trees were visualized using FigTree v1.4.1 (

To test the hypothesis that WNV was periodically introduced to Germany, a phylogeographic analysis was conducted using a discrete model attributing state characters represented by the detection locality of each strain and the Bayesian stochastic search variable (BSSV) algorithm implemented in BEAST v1.10 [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00448" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. An MCC tree was summarized using TreeAnnotator v1.10. and visualized in FigTree v1.4.3. SpreadD3 v. 0.9.7.1 (

The potential transmission networks within and between countries for NS5 WNV were inferred in PopART package v1.7.2 using median joining tree method with an epsilon of zero [
