  <p>Spatial dynamics of the European clade of WNV lineage 2 including the origin of the German WNV reconstructed from the Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree, a flexible demographic prior with location states and a Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS); (
   <bold>a</bold>) the directed lines between locations connect the sources and target countries. Circles represent discrete geographical locations of viral strains and represent branches in the MCC tree along with where the relevant location transition occurs. All introductions for Germany are shown. Circle diameters of locations are proportional to square root of the number of MCC branches maintaining a particular location state at each time-point. Discrete locations are geographic coordinates for each European country; (
   <bold>b</bold>) the directed lines between the source of viral strains (Czech Republic and Austria) and target locations in Germany. Location circle diameters are proportional to square root of the number of MCC branches maintaining a particular location state at each time-point; (
   <bold>c</bold>) migration pattern of WNV between Czech Republic–Germany and Austria–Germany based on Bayes factor (BF) test for significant non-zero rates. Viral migration patterns are indicated between the different regions of Germany and neighboring countries and are proportional to the strength of the transmission rate. The color of the connections indicates the origin and the direction of migration and are proportional with the strength of connections. Only well supported paths between locations are shown.
