  <p>Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree; (
   <bold>a</bold>) representing the time scale phylogeny; (
   <bold>b</bold>) effective population size; and (
   <bold>c</bold>) evolutionary rate of the European and German WNV lineage 2. The colored branches of MCC trees represent the most probable geographic location of their descendant nodes (see color codes); (
   <bold>a</bold>) the main clades are indicated to the right of the tree (SEEC, South Eastern European clade; CEC, Central and Eastern European clade), including the newly proposed German clade (EGC, Eastern German clade). Time is reported in the axis below the tree and represents the year before the last sampling time (2019). The German WNV strains sequenced in this study are highlighted. The estimated tMRCA of German WNV strains of EGC clade is shown with 95% posterior time intervals in parentheses. Bayesian posterior probabilities (≥90%) and 1000 parallel maximum likelihood bootstrap replicates (≥70%) are indicated at the nodes (asterisks); (
   <bold>b</bold>) temporal variation in the effective population size of the European WNV lineage 2; (
   <bold>b1</bold>) and EGC; (
   <bold>b2</bold>) estimated using the coalescent Gaussian Markov Random field (GMRF) Bayesian Skyride model of polyprotein sequences. The Bayesian Skyride plot represents temporal variation in the virus effective population size (Ne) through time. The blue line represents the median Ne estimate and the shaded area corresponds to the 95% high-probability density (HDP) intervals; (
   <bold>c</bold>) evolutionary rate estimates with 95% credible intervals for the distribution of evolutionary rates observed for the whole European WNV lineage 2 and for WNV from the 2018–2019 German epidemic.
