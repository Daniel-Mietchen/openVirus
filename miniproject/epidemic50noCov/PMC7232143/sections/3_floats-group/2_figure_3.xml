 <caption>
  <p>A median-joining haplotype network constructed from complete WNV NS5 gene alignment of the Central European WNV clade (CEC). Each colored vertex represents a sampled viral haplotype, with different colors indicating the different country of origin. The size of each vertex is relative to the number of sampled viral strains and the dashes on branches show the number of mutations between nodes. The Eastern German clade (EGC) is highlighted.</p>
