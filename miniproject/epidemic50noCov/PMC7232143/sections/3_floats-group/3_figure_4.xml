 <caption>
  <p>Temporally framed snapshots of the dispersal patterns (2018â€“2019) among regions in Germany for the Eastern German WNV clade. Lines between locations represent branches in the Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree along which the relevant location transition occurs. Circle diameters are proportional to the square root of the number of MCC branches maintaining a particular location state at each time point.</p>
