  <p>Schematic representation of the WNV genome and the positions of amino acid mutations. The position of the unique amino acid mutation of the Eastern German clade (colored in red/blue) in the NS3 gene is highlighted. The specific non-synonymous amino acid mutations for the CEC are shown in black, while the mutation in the NS5 specific for the subclade including the Eastern German group, one Austrian, one Czech and two German strains is presented in green.</p>
