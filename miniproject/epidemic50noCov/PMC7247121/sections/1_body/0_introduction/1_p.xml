<p id="Par7">There are 1.8 million children (&lt; 15 years of age) living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) globally—many of these children were infected perinatally, and nearly 2000 of these children living with HIV reside in the United States [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. When an infant is born with HIV, a guardian must inform the child that they are living with HIV and explain what that means. This discussion may include topics on the infectious nature of HIV, that the child contracted HIV from the biological mother, and the need for the child to stay adherent to antiretroviral medications to ensure continued viral suppression—all of which require the child or youth living with HIV (YLWH) to intellectually comprehend the content of these discussions, and hopefully, to not internalize HIV-related stigma or act out against a guardian who obfuscated a diagnosis for years. Considering the importance of knowing one’s HIV-status, the World Health Organization recommends disclosing HIV-status to perinatal infected children between 6 and 12 years; American Academy of Pediatrics recommends YLWH are informed at “school age,” but neither organization suggests an optimal age when YLWH should learn of their HIV-status to promote well-being [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Considering the importance of viral suppression to stopping HIV transmission, the objective of this retrospective, preliminary study of administrative records is to explore if there is potential to narrow the recommended age range at which perinatal infected YLWH should learn of their HIV status to promote long-term viral suppression.
