<p id="Par9">Age of HIV-status disclosure was extracted from administrative clinical records as a continuous variable. Age of HIV-status disclosure was collected through self-report from the patient or the patient’s guardian typically in the presence of the patient. We collapsed age at which YLWH learned of their status into three categories based on the developmental stages of children and adolescents: learned of HIV-status younger than 10 years (children), between 10 and 12 (pre-adolescents), and those 13 and older (adolescents). For patients who were unaware of their HIV-status at the time of this analysis, age of disclosure was marked as “missing.”</p>
