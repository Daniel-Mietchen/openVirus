<p id="Par8">We examined records of perinatal infected YLWH who received care over a 10-year period (2008–2018) at a pediatric HIV clinic in the southern United States (n = 61). Although records were extracted from the clinic’s electronic medical records database, older records existed as scanned files within the system, requiring hand extraction of study data. Behaviorally-infected patients were excluded. At the time these data were extracted (2019), the age range of study participants was 14 to 32 years; however, records were only evaluated for the time during which these individuals were active patients at our study site aged 0 to 24 years (historically, YLWH aged out of HIV pediatric care at 25). Because this study is a retrospective analysis of administrative data, there were no control conditions, and there was no study population monitoring process. Perinatal infected YLWH treated at this clinic over the defined 10-year period, who were aware of their HIV status, were included in this study. Patients were excluded from this analysis under two conditions: patient was unaware of HIV status (not yet disclosed) and/or if the patient did not have a Ryan White consent form on record.</p>
