<p id="Par15">Our preliminary findings suggest that disclosing HIV-status between 10 and 12 may promote viral suppression through medication adherence. This period of pre-adolescence, between 10 and 12, is when youth have developed greater intellectual capacity and emotional resilience compared to younger peers. Youth at this age are more likely to comprehend medical explanations and healthcare considerations related to living with HIV and how HIV-status may influence social relationships compared to younger peers; youth in this age range are potentially less likely, due to lower levels of autonomy and independence, to rebel against caregivers who have obfuscated their HIV-status for years [

Considering the potential relationship between living arrangement and viral suppression, we reviewed our data to see if adopted children were over-represented in the 10 to 12 age group. We did not find that these rates differed in a substantive way between those who learned of their status under the age of 10 and those who learned of their status between 10 and 12Â years.
