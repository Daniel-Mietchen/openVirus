<p id="Par14">We present the results of our analyses in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Longitudinal suppression was low across all groups when benchmarked against the UNAIDS 90% global target [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. See Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Of the fifty-nine patients with at least one viral load on record, 51% were longitudinally suppressed; 30% of black YLWH compared to 75% of white YLWH were longitudinally suppressed. Overall, black YLWH were less likely to achieve 80% + longitudinal suppression compared with the rest of the group (41% vs. 71%, 
 <italic>p </italic>= 0.02) or compared with white YLWH (41% vs. 75%, 
 <italic>p </italic>= 0.04). Internationally-adopted children had a greater than 90% rate of longitudinal suppression. Domestically adopted YLWH, YLWH living with extended family, and YLWH living with a biological parent had suppression rates ranging between 42 and 46% (46%, 42%, and 43% respectively). Among patients with known age of HIV-status disclosure (n = 53), adopted children were statistically more likely to achieve 80% + longitudinal suppression compared to children living with biological parent(s) or extended family members (71% vs. 44%, 
 <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.05). Children who learned that they were living with HIV prior to age 10 were longitudinally suppressed at a rate of 56%. The rate of longitudinal suppression climbed to a notable 65% in YLWH who learned of their status between 10 and 12. The lowest rate of suppression (38%) was in adolescents who learned of their HIV-status at 13 or older. Although substantively important, we did not find that these differences were statistically significant (likely due to small sample size).
