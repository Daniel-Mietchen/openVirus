<p id="Par11">We then used these annual categorical measures of viral suppression to construct a single binary measure of multi-year longitudinal viral suppression. If 80% or more of the annual viral loads were 1 = suppressed, then the longitudinal viral load measure was coded as 1 = yes. If a patient had less than an 80% suppression rate, the measure was coded 0 = no, for not longitudinally suppressed. For example, if records indicated that the patient’s viral loads were suppressed across four of five annual laboratory results (80%), then this constructed measure was coded as 1 = suppressed. We identified 80% as our threshold, because—assuming the maximum of five viral loads on record—this allowed patients to be classified as longitudinally suppressed with one unsuppressed annual viral load on file.</p>
