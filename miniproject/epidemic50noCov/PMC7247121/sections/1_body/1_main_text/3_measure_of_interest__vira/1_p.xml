<p id="Par10">Viral load is a key indicator along the HIV continuum of care and was assessed by quantitative HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that was conducted through laboratory assays. For YLWH, viral loads may be assessed multiple times a year. We evaluated the annual viral load that was closest to the patient’s birthday, beginning at 14 years and concluding at 18 years (one viral load annually). Viral suppression was indicated when the plasma HIV RNA laboratory result was under 200 copies/mL, as recommended by the Health Resources and Services Administration [

For each annual numeric viral load, we constructed an associated, binary measure to indicate if the patient was suppressed or not suppressed. These measures were populated as 1 = suppressed if laboratory results indicated viral load &lt; 200 (HIV RNA PCR), and for viral loads equal to or above 200, 0 = unsuppressed. Missing viral loads were coded as 9 = missing. This data management process produced five independent categorical variables indicating if the patient was suppressed at five sequential time points.
