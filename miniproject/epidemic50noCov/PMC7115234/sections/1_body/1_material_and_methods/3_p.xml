<p>We simulate a population that is subject to seasonal UIV vaccination, and subsequently exposed to a 2012/13-like season (a severe season in the USA). Having prepared a ‘test population’ in this way through combined immunization events (the routine UIV programme and the seasonal epidemic), we then assess the vulnerability of this test population to different types of subsequent immune escape.</p>
