<p>We focus on the USA, which currently has the world's largest population (all-age) coverage of seasonal influenza vaccination [
 <xref rid="RSIF20190879C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Building on earlier work [
 <xref rid="RSIF20190879C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we develop a simple model of influenza immunity and transmission dynamics in the USA (see electronic supplementary information for technical details). The model incorporates two types of immunity, as follows. (i) HA-specific immunity, which reduces susceptibility to infection and is acquired either through past infection or through effective strain-matched vaccination. This immunity is strain-specific and does not protect against novel pandemic viruses. (ii) Cross-protective immunity, which is assumed to be independent of HA-specific immunity and is likewise acquired either through past infection or through a UIV. This immunity is heterosubtypic: that is, it offers protection across different subtypes. Moreover, we assume that cross-protective immunity does not affect susceptibility to infection, but rather limits viral load during the course of infection, thus reducing infectiousness. This would be consistent, for example, with a UIV targeting T-cell antigens [
