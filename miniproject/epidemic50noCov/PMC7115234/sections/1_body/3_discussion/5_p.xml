<p>These risks could be mitigated to some extent by adequate planning of a future vaccination programme: for example,

 <italic>b</italic> suggests a minimum coverage of 75%, a substantially higher threshold than the standard ‘critical vaccination threshold’ required to interrupt transmission of seasonal influenza (roughly 66% needing to be effectively vaccinated for a virus with

Likewise in the case of compromising strain-specific immunity, an approach that deploys conventional, strain-matched vaccines in parallel with UIVs, together with multiple UIV targets, could mitigate strongly against the risk of vaccine escape.
