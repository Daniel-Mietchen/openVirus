<p>We next examine population vulnerability to a 
 <italic>UIV escape variant</italic>: that is, a virus showing vaccine escape to all UIV antigenic targets but remaining susceptible to existing HA-specific immunity. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20190879F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the scenario where the test population is exposed to such a UIV escape variant. The figure shows two scenarios: where routine vaccination is conducted using strain-matched vaccines (

 <italic>a</italic>) and where it is instead conducted using a UIV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20190879F2">figure 2</xref>
 <italic>b</italic>). Under the first scenario, the two epidemics are of comparable size. Under the second scenario, although the UIV succeeds in controlling the initial epidemic, it does so at the expense of strain-specific immunity. As a result the subsequent season, associated with a UIV escape mutant, is considerably larger than it otherwise would have been (the latter indicated by the dashed horizontal lines for comparison). As discussed below, such risks could be mitigated by a combined vaccination strategy.
