<p>We begin by examining population vulnerability to

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSIF20190879F1">Figure 1</xref> shows one illustrative scenario, where the test population is exposed to a pandemic virus (to begin, we assume there is no supplementary UIV programme mounted in direct response to the pandemic). At low levels of UIV coverage, a seasonal UIV programme may in fact increase the pandemic size.

 <italic>b</italic> illustrates reasons for this behaviour. By bringing down seasonal incidence, the UIV programme reduces opportunities for individuals to acquire infection-induced immunity. As a result, there is an expanded pool of individuals who have been neither vaccinated nor infected, and who are thus vulnerable to the emergence of a pandemic virus. However, the figure also illustrates that it is possible to overcome this population effect if a seasonal UIV programme has sufficient coverage. In particular, a UIV with 80% efficacy and 75% coverage would not only interrupt transmission for the 2012/13-like season, but would also result in a mitigated pandemic, relative to the absence of vaccination. Electronic supplementary material, figure S2 shows results disaggregated by age, illustrating similar dynamics in each of the age groups.
