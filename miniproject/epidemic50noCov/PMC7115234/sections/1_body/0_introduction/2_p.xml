<p>Current vaccines against influenza have had considerable impact [
 <xref rid="RSIF20190879C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], but their efficacy depends on a close match between the vaccine and the circulating influenza virus, in particular to the immunodominant ‘head’ region of the viral surface protein haemagglutinin (HA). Current vaccines therefore have to be updated regularly to remain effective in the face of viral evolution; they also cannot be used for pandemic mitigation, owing to the unpredictability of pandemic viruses and the long (six month) development time of current vaccines.
