<p>Previous evidence from disease-dynamic models illustrated the possible benefits of mass deployment of UIVs [

However, population immunity to influenza is complex and incompletely understood, raising the possibility of unintended consequences from UIVs. It is important to anticipate these effects and determine how they might be mitigated. Here, using a simple mathematical model capturing some essential features of influenza transmission and immunity, we present two theoretical examples of how a UIV programme could exacerbate a population's vulnerability to influenza. In the face of uncertainties surrounding influenza immunity, we discuss key areas that future work should address in order to develop robust quantitative estimates for the impact of future vaccines.
