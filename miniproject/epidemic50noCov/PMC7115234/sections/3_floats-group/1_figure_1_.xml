  <p>Implications of routine seasonal UIV for a population's vulnerability to pandemic influenza. Here and throughout, we define the ‘efficacy’ of a UIV as the percentage drop in transmission potential arising from vaccination. (
   <italic>a</italic>) Pandemic size under a range of values for seasonal UIV coverage and efficacy (assuming no vaccination response against the pandemic). The rising edge marked (i) illustrates that low seasonal UIV coverage, especially for an efficacious vaccine, can inadvertently increase pandemic attack rates. (
   <italic>b</italic>) How cross-protective immunity in the test population is affected by seasonal UIV coverage, at 80% UIV efficacy (i.e. the edge marked (i) in (
   <italic>a</italic>)). Vaccination brings down the amount of infection-acquired immunity in the test population (blue curve). At low coverage, the vaccination programme fails to compensate for this loss of immunity (yellow curve, initial decline). The dashed grey line indicates the level of cross-protective immunity in the absence of the UIV programme; this is only exceeded by a UIV coverage of at least 75%. (
   <italic>c</italic>) Relaxing the assumption of no pre-pandemic vaccination, again taking the cross-section corresponding to a UIV efficacy of 80%. As in (
   <italic>b</italic>), the horizontal grey line indicates the pandemic size in the absence of vaccination.
