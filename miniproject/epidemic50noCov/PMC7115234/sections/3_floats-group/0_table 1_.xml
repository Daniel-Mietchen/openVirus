  <p>Summary of different immune targets for influenza vaccines. Among current influenza vaccines, ‘inactivated’ vaccines focus on HA1 immunity (top row), while ‘live attenuated’ vaccines could raise both HA-specific and T-cell immunity. However, their heterosubtypic protection is unclear. The last two rows correspond to strategies being pursued for the development of new, ‘universal’ vaccines (we adopt the scenario in the bottom row for the purpose of the current work).</p>
