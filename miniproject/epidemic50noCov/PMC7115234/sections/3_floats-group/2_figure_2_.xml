  <p>Potential impact of UIV vaccine failure. Here, ‘epidemic 1’ denotes the 2012/13-like season used to prepare the test population, and we assume escape to cross-protective immunity occurs immediately after this epidemic. (
   <italic>a</italic>) With routine seasonal vaccination using a conventional (strain-matched) vaccine, epidemic sizes are unchanged by UIV immune escape. (
   <italic>b</italic>) With routine seasonal vaccination using a UIV, successful control of epidemic 1 can have the unintended effect of permitting a larger epidemic 2. For comparison, dashed lines show the epidemic peaks reached under a conventional vaccine (
   <italic>a</italic>). (
   <italic>c</italic>) How epidemic sizes in (
   <italic>b</italic>) change with UIV efficacy in epidemic 1 (we assume throughout that this efficacy declines to 25% in epidemic 2, as a result of vaccine escape).
