<p id="Par10">In 1962, the professional team of vaccine production returned to their original organizations after completing the expansion of trial production. In 1963, Dexiang Dong was dispatched back to the Institute of Medical Biology to be responsible for vaccine production. In 1964, Professor Fangzhou Gu was appointed to the deputy director of the Institute of Medical Biology, and his family moved to Kunming. With the growing demand for vaccines, the task of vaccine production continued to increase year by year, from an initial 5 million to 6â€“70 million per year, up to more than 100 million. The more experience was obtained, the greater improvement on vaccine quality was reached through the revision on production and quality-control instruction every one or two year.</p>
