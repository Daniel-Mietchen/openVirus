<p id="Par9">After the decision on choosing the route of live vaccine immunization in 1959, due to the strict requirements for low temperature of the live vaccine, it is necessary to improve the dosage form to ensure the quality of the vaccine. In 1960, Professor Fangzhou Gu proposed to develop a “sugar pill” vaccine, and Dexiang Dong was responsible for the implementation of this project specifically. Qizhen Shen, vice President of the Academy of Medical Sciences, selected Shanghai Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory to collaborate with Institute of Medical Biology in person, and they used the preparation technology of traditional Chinese medicine pill to wrap the viral liquid in the sugar pill to make a “sugar pill” vaccine. After hundreds of repeated experiments in three years, the “sugar pill” formula and the preparation technology were continuously improved. Finally, the “sugar pill” vaccine which can prolong the shelf life at room temperature and 4–8 °C was successfully produced in 1963 (Dong et al.
