<p id="Par5">After the epidemic of polio in Nantong in 1953, the Ministry of Health listed the disease as a legally reported infectious disease. Since then, the epidemic reports have been increasing and the infected area of the disease has been expanding, severely affecting children’s health. In March 1959, the four-member group (Fangzhou Gu, Dexiang Dong (董德祥), Zhongquan Wen (闻仲权), and Jingwu Jiang (蒋竞武)) led by Professor Fangzhou Gu was sent to the Soviet Union to investigate the vaccine production. Professor Fangzhou Gu learned from the academic conference that the United States and the Soviet Union are cooperating to develop a live vaccine for polio (Fig.
