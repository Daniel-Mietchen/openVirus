<p id="Par7">Therefore, Professor Fangzhou Gu immediately returned to China and started the development of a live vaccine for polio. In December 1959, the Ministry of Health called for a collaborative team of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the Beijing Institute and Chengdu Institute of Biological Products to conduct trial production. The collaborative team was again chaired by Professor Fangzhou Gu and conducted at the Beijing Institute of Biological Products. In the early 1960s, the collaborative team used the original attenuated strains, Sabin I, II and III, to produce the very first I, II and III attenuated vaccines for 5 million people in China (Gu et al.

Professor Fangzhou Gu took the lead role to use the test vaccine on his newborn son, which inspired the other colleagues in the laboratory to participate in the clinical trial. Thus the safety of the vaccine has been successfully verified. The phase III of the clinical trial was mainly for testing the epidemiological effect. In cooperation with the health and epidemic prevention stations in 11 cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Qingdao, nearly 4 million children under the age of 7 were tested for vaccines. The results significantly reduced the incidence and flattened the season peaks. The results of phase III clinical trials demonstrated that live vaccines were safe and effective, with good immunological and epidemiological effects.
