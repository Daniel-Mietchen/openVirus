<p id="Par11">Under supervision of Professor Fangzhou Gu, the Institute of Medical Biology has always adhered to the principle of integration of research, development and utilization, and prompt live vaccines to control and eliminate polio indeed. Every year, scientists and technicians were organized to conduct investigations of virology, serology and epidemics all over the country. They were timely informed of the dynamics of viral transmission, immunological efficacy and existing problems in order to provide scientific basis for continuous improvement of immunization methods, revision of immunization strategies, and implementation of planned immunization. To improve the immune efficacy of each type of vaccines and reduce the number of inoculations, after years of repeated trials and adjustment of the dosage ratio of the types, the trivalent vaccine in sugar pill was successfully developed. In order to encourage the epidemic prevention stations in various provinces, cities and municipalities to actively participate in the investigations on immune effect and epidemiology, with the support of the Ministry of Health, “Experience Exchange Conference of National Prevention and Control of Polio” were organized in 1971, 1975, and 1978. The experience of Polio prevention was spread and planned immunization was promoted; also, a few training courses on polio and other enterovirus experimental technologies were provided to promote virology and serology surveillance.</p>
