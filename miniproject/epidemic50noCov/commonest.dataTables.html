        <span class="abst" title="AbstractBackgroundKentucky sits at the epicenter of the HIV epidemic in the United States and harbors 54 of the top 220 HIV/HCV outbreak vulnerable counties in the United States; 44 of which are served by the Bluegrass Care Clinic at the University of Kentucky. Understanding the barriers to care at the frontlines of the epidemic is of critical importance in the work toward the eventual elimination of HIV in the United States and elsewhere.MethodsThe Bluegrass Care Clinic has achieved viral suppression in 90% of the HIV-positive patients enrolled in care. Given the catchment area served by this clinic, however, the unsuppressed 10% of patients likely represent the tip of an iceberg of undiagnosed patients or those lost to care from remote and at-risk communities. We developed a quality improvement project to specifically review the barriers to achieving viral suppression in this subset of patients in our clinic. Additionally, we developed an outreach algorithm for patients identified as having comorbid mental health issues to increase engagement in both HIV and mental healthcare.ResultsWe found that nearly 45% of virally unsuppressed patients in our clinic had comorbid mental health disease and 30% had substance use disorders. Female sex was associated with being unsuppressed (P = 0.003); however, age and race were not predictive. Of the patients identified as having mental health barriers to care, 58% were able to be contacted using our outreach algorithm and 58% of these patients accepted referral into a mental health service. In this first 12 months of this program 26% of these patients achieved viral suppression and an additional 18% had substantial decreases in their viral loads.ConclusionThis preliminary report highlights the importance of identifying and addressing barriers to care. Comorbid mental disorders have consistently been associated with greater difficulties in achieving viral suppression. We present an effective and successful program for engaging patients in mental healthcare using an interdisciplinary outreach program that is designed to be generalizable. These data set the stage for reaching the missing subset of patients who are not currently engaged in HIV care, a critical next step for universal test and treat and 90/90/90 strategies.

        <span class="abst" title="AbstractBackgroundParechovirus-A3 (PeV-A3) causes severe disease, including sepsis and meningoencephalitis in young infants. The first case of PeV-A3 was reported in Japan in 1999 and, although epidemics have been reported every 2 to 3 years in more than 20 countries, no major epidemic has occurred in Japan since 2014.MethodsThis prospective study included febrile infants (&lt;4 months of age) admitted at Niigata University and its affiliated hospitals, which serve about 2.5 million people, during the period from 2014 to 2018. Neonates and infants younger than 4 months presenting with fever and suspected of having viral sepsis underwent serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing by real-time PCR for parechovirus-A (PeV-A) and enteroviruses (EVs), and for herpes simplex viruses, if suspected. Bacterial infection was excluded on the basis of the results of bacterial culture of blood, urine, and/or CSF. PeV-A genotype was identified by examining the viral protein 1 (VP1) sequence, and the phylogenetic tree of the VP1 sequence was constructed.ResultsOf the 277 patients evaluated, 135 (49%) were positive for PeV-A (n = 74, 27%) or EVs (n = 61, 22%). Among PeV-A patients, most had PeV-A3 (n = 69; 93%), followed by PeV-A4 (n = 4; 5%). There was a PeV-A3 epidemic in 2014 (n = 43); however, no cases were reported in 2015. In 2016–2018, small numbers of PeV-A3 cases were reported: 10 in 2016, 7 in 2017, and 9 in 2018. In contrast, EV cases were reported throughout this period: 8 in 2014, 22 in 2015, 10 in 2016, 5 in 2017, and 16 in 2018. When data were analyzed by season, the PeV-A3 detection rate in summer (June-August) was 93% (40/43) in 2014 and 65% (17/26) during 2016–2018, indicating an increase in the number of PeV-A3 cases in seasons other than summer. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PeV-A3 strains during 2016–2018 were part of a cluster of epidemics in 2011 and differed from those in 2014.ConclusionAfter the major PeV-A3 epidemics in 2014, we observed changes in the PeV-A3 epidemic profile, namely, a small, but constant, number of cases every year in Niigata, Japan. A future study should investigate if this trend has continued in Japan and other countries and identify the causes of this change in epidemic profile.

        <span class="abst" title="AbstractBackgroundSeasonally-adjusted linear models (‘Serfling’ models) serve as an important surveillance measure to estimate influenza (flu) attributable deaths for resource allocation to public health programs (e.g., vaccination campaigns). We compared performance of traditional time-series and viral activity-based models to a novel open-source R-package ‘Prophet’ for estimating the number of deaths attributable to influenza per season.MethodsWe evaluated deaths from the 122-Cities Mortality Reporting System which reports the total number of death certificates where pneumonia or flu was listed as a contributing cause of death. Models were fitted to 2010–2015 influenza seasons. The first Serfling model (M1) used baseline periods of low-endemicity (summer months) to estimate attributable deaths during a flu season (OCT-MAY), the second Serfling model (M2) incorporated both baseline and virology data (count laboratory proven flu cases in a given period). The Prophet model (M3) uses generalized additive models incorporating annual, seasonal terms and viral activity data. The difference between observed deaths, and those predicted by each model in the absence of flu were ‘attributable death.” Epidemic weeks exceeded the 95% upper prediction interval. Model performance was assessed by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).ResultsFrom 2010 to 2015, the average deaths due to pneumonia and influenza per season numbered 824 per week (total 198,692). Compared with the traditional Serfling model (M1), the Prophet model estimated 52% more influenza-attributable deaths (13,443 vs. 8,800) and more epidemic weeks (25 vs. 10) with lower RMSE (75.9 vs. 95.3 [lower is better]). Compared with the viral activity-based model (M2), the Prophet model estimated 6% fewer attributable deaths (13,443 vs. 14,326), with more epidemic weeks (25 vs. 19) and lower RMSE (RMSE 75.9 vs. 92.6).ConclusionGeneralized additive models, implemented through the R-package Prophet, are superior in terms of reducing model prediction error for influenza mortality vs. traditional models. Based on superior model performance, the attributable mortality estimated by these novel models may be preferred over traditional regression models.

        <span class="abst" title="The question of how Zika virus (ZIKV) changed from a seemingly mild virus to a human pathogen capable of microcephaly and sexual transmission remains unanswered. The unexpected emergence of ZIKV's pathogenicity and capacity for sexual transmission may be due to genetic changes, and future changes in phenotype may continue to occur as the virus expands its geographic range. Alternatively, the sheer size of the 2015-16 epidemic may have brought attention to a pre-existing virulent ZIKV phenotype in a highly susceptible population. Thus, it is important to identify patterns of genetic change that may yield a better understanding of ZIKV emergence and evolution. However, because ZIKV has an RNA genome and a polymerase incapable of proofreading, it undergoes rapid mutation which makes it difficult to identify combinations of mutations associated with viral emergence. As next generation sequencing technology has allowed whole genome consensus and variant sequence data to be generated for numerous virus samples, the task of analyzing these genomes for patterns of mutation has become more complex. However, understanding which combinations of mutations spread widely and become established in new geographic regions versus those that disappear relatively quickly is essential for defining the trajectory of an ongoing epidemic. In this study, multiscale analysis of the wealth of genomic data generated over the course of the epidemic combined with in vivo laboratory data allowed trends in mutations and outbreak trajectory to be assessed. Mutations were detected throughout the genome via deep sequencing, and many variants appeared in multiple samples and in some cases become consensus. Similarly, amino acids that were previously consensus in pre-outbreak samples were detected as low frequency variants in epidemic strains. Protein structural models indicate that most of the mutations associated with the epidemic transmission occur on the exposed surface of viral proteins. At the macroscale level, consensus data was organized into large and interactive databases to allow the spread of individual mutations and combinations of mutations to be visualized and assessed for temporal and geographical patterns. Thus, the use of multiscale modeling for identifying mutations or combinations of mutations that impact epidemic transmission and phenotypic impact can aid the formation of hypotheses which can then be tested using reverse genetics.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Emerging and re-emerging diseases with pandemic potential continue to challenge fragile health systems in Africa, creating enormous human and economic toll. To provide evidence for the investment case for public health emergency preparedness, we analysed the spatial and temporal distribution of epidemics, disasters and other potential public health emergencies in the WHO African region between 2016 and 2018. METHODS:We abstracted data from several sources, including: the WHO African Region's weekly bulletins on epidemics and emergencies, the WHO-Disease Outbreak News (DON) and the Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED). Other sources were: the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) and the Global Infectious Disease and Epidemiology Network (GIDEON). We included information on the time and location of the event, the number of cases and deaths and counter-checked the different data sources. DATA ANALYSIS:We used bubble plots for temporal analysis and generated graphs and maps showing the frequency and distribution of each event. Based on the frequency of events, we categorised countries into three: Tier 1, 10 or more events, Tier 2, 5-9 events, and Tier 3, less than 5 or no event. Finally, we compared the event frequencies to a summary International Health Regulations (IHR) index generated from the IHR technical area scores of the 2018 annual reports. RESULTS:Over 260 events were identified between 2016 and 2018. Forty-one countries (87%) had at least one epidemic between 2016 and 2018, and 21 of them (45%) had at least one epidemic annually. Twenty-two countries (47%) had disasters/humanitarian crises. Seven countries (the epicentres) experienced over 10 events and all of them had limited or developing IHR capacities. The top five causes of epidemics were: Cholera, Measles, Viral Haemorrhagic Diseases, Malaria and Meningitis. CONCLUSIONS:The frequent and widespread occurrence of epidemics and disasters in Africa is a clarion call for investing in preparedness. While strengthening preparedness should be guided by global frameworks, it is the responsibility of each government to finance country specific needs. We call upon all African countries to establish governance and predictable financing mechanisms for IHR implementation and to build resilient health systems everywhere.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Dengue hemorrhagic fever is an acute viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes. In the 2017, a dengue epidemic occurred in Hanoi in a short time interval and many cases were serious with associated mortality. This was the largest and unusual dengue fever outbreak in the North of Vietnam over the past 20 years. The objective of the present study was to understand the genetic characteristics of the DENV-1 strain in the 2017 epidemic and its relationship with previous viruses in Vietnam and the rest of the world. METHODS:Complete genomes of 72 DENV-1 from patients in the 2017 epidemic were sequenced using NGS. The full genome sequences were then analyzed to find out the genetic variants in the groups of 72 strains, followed by their comparison with other strains that caused disease in Vietnam previously and several other regions of the world, revealing a genetic relationship between them. RESULTS:The complete genome sequence of 72 DENV-1 strains comprised 10,697 nucleotides with an open reading frame coding for 3392 amino acids. The genomic analysis revealed different amino acid substitutions in all genes, especially varying at position S75 (Capsid), M125 (PrM), D54 (E), T147, V180 (NS1), G45, Y126, I154 (NS2A), A94 (NS2B), M298 (NS3), K47, V68 (NS4A), I29 (NS4B), and R166, E536, G614, T821 (NS5). The genetic analysis suggested that the viruses were most closely related to the causative virus of the dengue outbreak in Vietnam and Cambodia from 2006 to 2008. These results indicated that DENV-1 from the dengue epidemic 2017 in Northern Vietnam originated from the virus that caused the dengue outbreak during the 2007 to 2008 period in Vietnam. CONCLUSION:The present study is the first of its kind to describe complete genome sequence as well as genetic variants and phylogenetic analysis of DENV-1 associated with the unusual dengue epidemic of 2017 in northern Vietnam. These results provide detailed evidence to elucidate the origin, circulation, and genetic evolution of DENV in Vietnam.">

We analyzed the pathogenic characteristics of HFMD in Shaanxi province, China, during 2010-2016. Clinical samples were collected from HFMD cases. Real-time PCR and RT-PCR were used to identify the enterovirus(EVs) serotypes. Viral RNA sequences were amplified using RT-PCR and compared by phylogenetic analysis. Descriptive epidemiological methods were used to analyze. A total of 16,832 HFMD positive cases were confirmed in the laboratory. EV-A71 and CV-A16 were the main pathogens in 2010. EV-A71 was the dominant pathogen in the periods of 2011 to 2012 and 2014, 2016. In 2013 and 2015, other EVs increased greatly, in which CV-A6 was the predominant pathogen. EV-A71 was more frequently detected in deaths and severe cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that EV-A71 belonged to the C4a evolution branch of C4 sub-genotype and CV-A16 belonged to the B1a or B1b evolution branch of B1 sub-genotype, whereas CV-A6 strains were assigned to D2 or D3 sub-genotype. The pathogen spectrum of HFMD has changed in 7 years, and the major serotypes EV-A71, CV- A16 and CV- A6 alternated or co-circulated. Long-term surveillance and research of EVs should be strengthened for the prevention and control of HFMD.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:Influenza is a highly contagious viral respiratory infection caused by influenza viruses whose epidemic and pandemic have resulted in significant morbidity and mortality. The annual epidemic of influenza results in an estimated 3-5 million cases of severe illness and about 290000-650000 deaths globally. The vaccination program has been successful to control the epidemic however, it further needs improvement. This study was aimed to investigate the types of influenza viruses prevailing in Nepal during 2016 and, to match the recommended vaccine for use during the same season. Methods:A descriptive cross sectional study was carried out at National Public Health Laboratory, Kathmandu, Nepal for the period of one year (Jan-Dec 2016). A total of 1683 throat swab specimen was collected from patients of different age group referred to NPHL for influenza testing. The specimen was primarily stored at 4 °C and processed using ABI 7500 RT PCR system for the identification of influenza viruses. Results:Of the total 1683 patients suspected of having influenza infection, influenza viruses were isolated from 614 (36.5%) patients with male predominance. The highest number of infection was caused by influenza A/H3 strain (51.0%) followed by influenza B (40.4%) and influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 (8.6%). Two peaks of infection were observed during the year 2016. The widely available trivalent vaccine during the season did not match the prevailing strain because of the dominance of B/Yamagata lineage over B/Victoria lineage. Conclusion:We concluded that Nepal experiences semiannual cycle of influenza infection, firstly during the month of January-February and secondly during the month of July-August. The vaccine to be introduced in Nepal need to be decided by national authority based on prevailing influenza types to confer effective immunization.">

METHODS:Study included 37 patients diagnosed with acute conjunctivitis and distributed by three groups: A (1% prednisolone acetate + ciprofloxacin (0.3%); B (Sodium diclofenac (0.1%) + ciprofloxacin (0.3%) and C (artificial tears + ciprofloxacin (0.3%). Patients received medication 6/6 hours daily. Signs and symptoms (e.g. lacrimation, burning, photophobia, etc.) were scored at baseline and on the first, third, fifth and seventh days and in the end of treatment using a standardized questionnaire and slit lamp anterior segment examination. RESULTS:All three groups demonstrated an improvement in the signs and symptoms of conjunctivitis in their follow-up visits. There was no significant difference in symptom and sign scores between Group A and B and B and C in the study visits ( p &gt;0.05). However, the comparison between groups A and C showed a clinical trend (p=0.05) on third evaluation suggesting better clinical action using the corticosteroids. CONCLUSION:The prednisolone acetate was not superior to the use of sodium diclofenac or artificial tears in relieving the signs and symptoms of viral conjunctivitis.">

Simultaneous circulation of the four viral serotypes (DENV1, 2, 3 and 4) has been occurring since 2010 and determines a scenario of hyperendemicity of the disease in the country. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological situation of dengue in Brazil in the last three decades. This is a descriptive, observational study that used data of dengue notifications of the National Surveillance System from 1990 to 2017, available in the Epidemiological Bulletins and publications of the Ministry of Health. Dengue incidence increased in all Brazilian regions and the interepidemic periods are distinct in the different regions. The greatest epidemics was recorded in 2015 (1,688,688 cases), with an incidence of 826.0 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, which illustrates the occurrence of dengue in the last decade with increasingly higher epidemic peaks and shortening of the interepidemic periods. The incidence and mortality indices point to the need to improve the organization of response to dengue epidemics. This study provides information on the epidemiology of dengue in the country and can be used in the formulation of public health policies to reduce the impacts of viral transmission.">

However, despite such efforts, HIV continues to persist in populations with a global incidence rate of 1.8 million in 2017 alone. The introduction of new infections into susceptible regional populations promotes the spread of HIV, indicating a crucial need to study the impact of migration and mobility on regional and global efforts to prevent HIV transmission. Here we reviewed studies that assess the impact of human mobility on HIV transmission and spread. We found an important role for both travel and migration in driving the spread of HIV across regional and national borders. Combined, our results indicate that even in the presence of control and preventive efforts, if migration and travel are occurring, public health efforts will need to remain persistent to ensure that new infections do not grow into outbreaks.">

        <span class="abst" title="INTRODUCTION:Achieving HIV epidemic control globally will require new strategies to accelerate reductions in HIV incidence and mortality. Universal test and treat (UTT) was evaluated in four randomized population-based trials (BCPP/Ya Tsie, HPTN 071/PopART, SEARCH, ANRS 12249/TasP) conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) during expanded antiretroviral treatment (ART) eligibility by World Health Organization guidelines and the UNAIDS 90-90-90 campaign. DISCUSSION:These three-year studies were conducted in Botswana, Zambia, Uganda, Kenya and South Africa in settings with baseline HIV prevalence from 4% to 30%. Key observations across studies were: (1) Universal testing (implemented via a variety of home and community-based testing approaches) achieved &gt;90% coverage in all studies. (2) When coupled with robust linkage to HIV care, rapid ART start and patient-centred care, UTT achieved among the highest reported population levels of viral suppression in SSA. Significant gains in population-level viral suppression were made in regions with both low and high baseline population viral load; however, viral suppression gains were not uniform across all sub-populations and were lower among youth. (3) UTT resulted in marked reductions in community HIV incidence when universal testing and robust linkage were present. However, HIV elimination targets were not reached. In BCPP and HPTN 071, annualized HIV incidence was approximately 20% to 30% lower in the intervention (which included universal testing) compared to control arms (no universal testing). In SEARCH (where both arms had universal testing), incidence declined 32% over three years. (4) UTT reduced HIV associated mortality by 23% in the intervention versus control communities in SEARCH, a study in which mortality was comprehensively measured. CONCLUSIONS:These trials provide strong evidence that UTT inclusive of universal testing increases population-level viral suppression and decreases HIV incidence and mortality faster than the status quo in SSA and should be adapted at a sub-country level as a public health strategy. However, more is needed, including integration of new prevention interventions into UTT, in order to reach UNAIDS HIV elimination targets.">

        <span class="abst" title="The newly emerged pseudorabies virus (PRV) novel variants can escape from the immunity induced by the classical vaccine Bartha-K61. Here we investigated the underlying mechanisms by constructing chimeric mutants between epidemic strain HB1201 and the Bartha-K61 vaccine. Our analyses focused on three viral envelope glycoproteins, namely gB, gC, and gD, as they exhibit remarkable genetic variations and are also involved in induction of protective immunity. The corresponding genes were swapped reciprocally either individually or in combination by using CRISPR/Cas9 technology and homologous recombination. The rescued chimeric viruses exhibited differential sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies in vitro, and gC was found to be the major contributor to inefficient neutralization against HB1201 by anti-Bartha-K61 serum. When tested in the 4-week-piglet model, substitution with HB1201 gC enabled Bartha-K61 to induce a protective immunity against HB1201 at a high challenge dose of 107 TCID50. Interestingly, despite a relatively lower cross-neutralization ability, the gD exchange also enabled Bartha-K61 to protect piglets from lethal challenge. In both cases, clinical signs and microscopic lesions were eased, and so was the viral tissue load with the exception of brain. A better protection could be achieved when both gC and gD were swapped in terms of reducing viral load in brain and virus-induced microscopic lesions. Thus, our studies not only revealed individual roles of gC and gD variations in the immune escape and also suggested a synergistic effect of both proteins on induction of protective immunity. These findings have important implications in novel vaccine development for PRV control in China.">

Using a dataset of tweets posted from the affected region from 2011 to 2014, we obtain alerts in December 2013, which is three months prior to the official announcement of the epidemic. Among the two variations, the second, which produces a restricted but useful set of alerts, can potentially be applied to other infectious disease surveillance and alert systems.">

        <span class="abst" title="Understanding the transition of epidemic to endemic dengue transmission remains a challenge in regions where serotypes co-circulate and there is extensive human mobility. French Polynesia, an isolated group of 117 islands of which 72 are inhabited, distributed among five geographically separated subdivisions, has recorded mono-serotype epidemics since 1944, with long inter-epidemic periods of circulation. Laboratory confirmed cases have been recorded since 1978, enabling exploration of dengue epidemiology under monotypic conditions in an isolated, spatially structured geographical location. A database was constructed of confirmed dengue cases, geolocated to island for a 35-year period. Statistical analyses of viral establishment, persistence and fade-out as well as synchrony among subdivisions were performed. Seven monotypic and one heterotypic dengue epidemic occurred, followed by low-level viral circulation with a recrudescent epidemic occurring on one occasion. Incidence was asynchronous among the subdivisions. Complete viral die-out occurred on several occasions with invasion of a new serotype. Competitive serotype replacement has been observed previously and seems to be characteristic of the South Pacific. Island population size had a strong impact on the establishment, persistence and fade-out of dengue cases and endemicity was estimated achievable only at a population size in excess of 175 000. Despite island remoteness and low population size, dengue cases were observed somewhere in French Polynesia almost constantly, in part due to the spatial structuration generating asynchrony among subdivisions. Long-term persistence of dengue virus in this group of island populations may be enabled by island hopping, although could equally be explained by a reservoir of sub-clinical infections on the most populated island, Tahiti.">

Although the findings from the BBS survey highlighted the specific needs of young PWID, the proposed Harm Reduction Plan does not explicitly focus on reducing high-risk behaviors of young PWID. We outline the importance of the inclusion of age-specific interventions focused on the needs of young PWID in Mozambique, and how a comprehensive Harm Reduction Plan can reduce the HIV epidemic in this population.

The use of phylogenetics and phylodynamics approaches has provided important insights to track the founder events that resulted in the spread of HIV-1 strains across vast geographic areas, specific countries and within geographically restricted communities. In the recent years, the use of phylogenetic analysis combined with the huge availability of HIV sequences has become an increasingly important approach to reconstruct HIV transmission networks and understand transmission dynamics in concentrated and generalised epidemics. Significant efforts to obtain viral sequences from newly HIV-infected individuals could certainly contribute to detect rapidly expanding HIV-1 lineages, identify key populations at high-risk and understand what public health interventions should be prioritised in different scenarios.">

        <span class="abst" title="The HIV-1 epidemic in Brazil has been growing in northeast and north regions, particularly an increase in AIDS cases among the younger male population has been observed. This study aims to characterize the HIV-1 genetic diversity and to evaluate its antiretroviral resistance profile among individuals presenting virological failure in the state of Maranhão-Brazil. HIV-1 pol gene sequences from 633 patients on antiretroviral therapy were obtained from the Department of Surveillance, Prevention and Control of Sexually Transmitted Infections, HIV/AIDS and Viral Hepatitis of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Phylogenetic and recombination analyses were performed to characterize viral genetic diversity. The presence of antiretroviral resistance mutations was assessed using the HIV Drug Resistance Database online platform of Stanford University. A predominance of subtype B (84.5%) was observed, followed by recombinant BF (9.5%), where more than half of the sequences were dispersed in 3 clusters. Antiretroviral resistance was detected in 74.1% of the sequences, and it was significantly higher for nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) than for non-nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs). Inference of putative transmissions clusters identified 11 clusters with 22 query sequences (22/633, 3.5%). Thus, we conclude that continuous monitoring of the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 is essential for prevention strategies, epidemic control, and treatment adequacy.">

While the existing literature discusses the potential epidemiological benefits of UIVs, it is also important to anticipate their potential unintended population consequences. Using mathematical modelling, we illustrate two such types of adverse consequences. First, by reducing the amount of infection-induced immunity in a population without fully replacing it, a seasonal UIV programme may permit larger pandemics than in the absence of vaccination. Second, the more successful a future UIV programme is in reducing transmission of seasonal influenza, the more vulnerable the population could become to the emergence of a vaccine escape variant. These risks could be mitigated by optimal deployment of any future UIV vaccine: namely, the use of a combined vaccine formulation (incorporating conventional as well as multiple universal antigenic targets) and achieving sufficient population coverage to compensate for any reductions in infection-induced immunity. In the absence of large-scale trials of UIVs, disease-dynamic models can provide helpful, early insights into their potential impact. In future, data from continuing vaccine development will be invaluable in developing robustly predictive modelling approaches.">

We report a case of Kaposi's disease which occurred 10 years after a local trauma in an HIV-positive patient from Central Africa. A 38-year-old female, from and living in Central Africa, consulted for angiomatous papulo-nodules associated with purple-colored macules and painful lymphoedema of the right leg and foot that had been developing for 6 months. She reported a history of posttraumatic lymphoedema of the affected limb as a result of a road accident that occurred ten years earlier. The mucous were healthy. There was no sign of systemic lesions. The diagnosis of Kaposi's disease was evoked with, in differential, a Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome-type of pseudo-Kaposi and an epidemic Kaposi disease. Retroviral serology was positive to HIV1 with a CD4 count of 600 cells/mm3. Histopathology of the lesions and duplex ultrasonography could not be performed. The rest of the biological assessment was without particularity. The diagnosis of epidemic Kaposi's disease associated with cofactors involved in endemic Kaposi's disease and Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome was retained. An antiretroviral treatment (emtricitabine, tenofovir, and efavirenz) allowed to obtain after 6 months a noticeable improvement of the lesions and a disappearance of the pain with however the persistence of a residual lymphoedema. This is a special case of Kaposi's disease that seems to involve several factors. The role of cofactors in Kaposi's disease remains to be elucidated.">

        <span class="abst" title="Ebola epidemics constitute serious public health emergencies. Multiple vaccines are under development to prevent these epidemics and avoid the associated morbidity and mortality. Assessing the potential impact of these vaccines on morbidity and mortality of Ebola is essential for devising prevention strategies. A mean-field compartmental stochastic model was developed for this purpose and validated by simulating the 2014 Sierra Leone epidemic. We assessed the impacts of prophylactic vaccination of healthcare workers (HCW) both alone and in combination with the vaccination of the general population (entire susceptible population other than HCW). The model simulated 8,706 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 478-21,942) cases and 3,575 (95%CI: 179-9,031) deaths in Sierra Leone, in line with WHO-reported statistics for the 2014 epidemic (8,704 cases and 3,587 deaths). Relative to this base case, the model then estimated that prophylactic vaccination of only 10% of HCW will avert 12% (95% CI: 6%-14%) of overall cases and deaths, while vaccination of 30% of HCW will avert 34% of overall cases (95% CI: 30%-64%) and deaths (95% CI: 30%-65%). Prophylactic vaccination of 1% and 5% of the general population in addition to vaccinating 30% of HCW was estimated to result in reduction in cases by 44% (95% CI: 39%-61%) and 72% (95% CI: 68%-84%) respectively, and deaths by 45% (95% CI: 40%-61%) and 74% (95% CI: 70%-85%) respectively. Prophylactic vaccination of even small proportions of HCW is estimated to significantly reduce incidence of Ebola and associated mortality. The effect is greatly enhanced by the additional vaccination even of small percentages of the general population. These findings could be used to inform the planning of prevention strategies.">

        <span class="abst" title="Understanding the dynamics of pathogen transfer in aquaculture systems is essential to manage and mitigate disease outbreaks. The goal of this study was to understand recent transmission dynamics of salmonid alphavirus (SAV) in Norway. SAV causes significant economic impacts on farmed salmonids in European aquaculture. SAV is classified into six subtypes, with Norway having ongoing epidemics of SAV subtypes 2 and 3. These two viral subtypes are present in largely distinct geographic regions of Norway, with SAV2 present in Trondelag, SAV3 in Rogaland, Sogn og Fjordane, and Hordaland, and Møre og Romsdal having outbreaks of both subtypes. To determine likely transmission routes of Norwegian SAV an established Nanopore amplicon sequencing approach was used in the current study. After confirming the accuracy of this approach for distinguishing subtype level co-infections of SAV2 and SAV3, a hypothetical possibility in regions of neighboring epidemics, twenty-four SAV3 genomes were sequenced to characterize the current genetic diversity of SAV3 in Norwegian aquaculture. Sequencing was performed on naturally infected heart tissues originating from a range of geographic locations sampled between 2016 and 2019. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the currently active SAV3 strains sampled comprise several distinct lineages sharing an ancestor that existed ∼15 years ago (95% HPD, 12.51-17.7 years) and likely in Hordaland. At least five of these lineages have not shared a common ancestor for 7.85 years (95% HPD, 5.39-10.96 years) or more. Furthermore, the ancestor of the strains that were sampled outside of Hordaland (Sogn of Fjordane and Rogaland) existed less than 8 years ago, indicating a lack of long-term viral reservoirs in these counties. This evident lack of geographically distinct subclades is compatible with a source-sink transmission dynamic explaining the long-term movements of SAV around Norway. Such anthropogenic transport of the virus indicates that at least for sink counties, biosecurity strategies might be effective in mitigating the ongoing SAV epidemic. Finally, genomic analyses of SAV sequences were performed, offering novel insights into the prevalence of SAV genomes containing defective deletions. Overall, this study improves our understanding of the recent transmission dynamics and biology of the SAV epidemic affecting Norwegian aquaculture.">

        <span class="abst" title="A retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the frequency of human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infected individuals, viral loads and immunity among blood donors from Argentina, in a post-epidemic outbreak period. B19V DNA and specific IgG were tested in minimum study samples of donors attending a blood bank at Córdoba, Argentina, in 2014. Anti-B19V IgM and viral loads were determined in B19V-positive plasma samples. Seven of 731 samples (0.96%) resulted positive, corresponding to individuals aged 32-53 years, four of them repeat donnors and three first-time donors. Viral loads were &lt;103 IU/mL. None had IgM and 6/7 had IgG, one of them at a high level (in the range of 100-200 IU/ml, and the remaining 5 at low to medium level, 5-50 IU/ml). Thus one case was classified as acute infection (DNA+/IgM-/IgG-) and six as potentially persistent infections (DNA+/IgM-/IgG+). No coinfections with other pathogens of mandatory control in the pre-transfusion screening were detected. Prevalence of IgG was 77.9% (279/358). This study provides the first data of B19V prevalence in blood donors in Argentina, demonstrating high rates of acute and persistent B19V infections and high prevalence of anti-B19V IgG in a post-epidemic period. Further research is needed to elucidate mechanisms/factors for B19V persistence as well as follow-up of recipients in the context of haemo-surveillance programs, contributing to the knowledge of B19V and blood transfusion safety.">

        <span class="abst" title="Dengue, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the dengue viruses, is present in many parts of the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. All four serotypes of dengue viruses are endemic in Singapore, an equatorial city-state. Frequent outbreaks occur, sometimes leading to national epidemics. However, few studies have attempted to characterize breakpoints which precede large rises in dengue case counts. In this paper, Bayesian regime switching (BRS) models were employed to infer epidemic and endemic regimes of dengue transmissions, each containing regime specific autoregressive processes which drive the growth and decline of dengue cases, estimated using a custom built multi-move Gibbs sampling algorithm. Posterior predictive checks indicate that BRS replicates temporal trends in Dengue transmissions well and nowcast accuracy assessed using a post-hoc classification scheme showed that BRS classification accuracy is robust even under limited data with the AUC-ROC at 0.935. LASSO-based regression and bootstrapping was used to account for plausibly high dimensions of climatic factors affecting Dengue transmissions, which was then estimated using cross-validation to conduct statistical inference on long-run climatic effects on the estimated regimes. BRS estimates epidemic and endemic regimes of dengue in Singapore which are characterized by persistence across time, lasting an average of 20 weeks and 66 weeks respectively, with a low probability of transitioning away from their regimes. Climate analysis with LASSO indicates that long-run climatic effects up to 20 weeks ago do not differentiate epidemic and endemic regimes. Lastly, by fitting BRS to simulated disease data generated from a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, mechanistic links between infectivity and regimes classified using BRS were provided. The model proposed could be applied to other localities and diseases under minimal data requirements where transmission counts over time are collected.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:We aimed at investigating the prevalence and associated factors of patient delay in hospital visiting and weekend effect of disease surveillance on hand-foot-and-mouth disease and epidemic parotitis/mumps. Methods:Daily report data on hand-foot-and-mouth disease and epidemic parotitis cases between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017, in Hanzhong, Shaanxi, China, were collected. The patient delay in hospital visiting was defined by the date difference between disease onset and patient's visit to hospital. Differences of delayed durations and percentages were compared by using nonparametric or χ 2 tests across gender, age, occupation, disease classification, epidemic and nonepidemic seasons, and years of disease onset. Additionally, to determine whether there existed a weekend effect of disease surveillance, the mean cases reported on weekdays and weekends were also compared. Results:A total of 14,814 patients with hand-foot-and-mouth disease and 4013 with epidemic parotitis were recorded, respectively. We found that 43.1% of the hand-foot-and-mouth disease and 36.5% of the epidemic parotitis patients had delayed visiting to hospital. All patients were reported through the online surveillance system on the day of visiting hospital. The percentage of delayed visiting to hospital differed significantly by years and epidemic and nonepidemic seasons and between children in and not in childcare center (all p values &lt;0.05). In addition, the reported numbers of both diseases fluctuated on weekdays but obviously decreased on weekends regardless of the epidemic or nonepidemic seasons. Conclusions:The reported cases of HFMD and epidemic parotitis had an obvious weekend effect, with an increasing tendency of cases delaying in hospital visiting over the recent years in Hanzhong, China. Parents and caregivers rather than health systems should be primarily targeted for the prevention and control of infectious diseases and their local outbreaks such as community-based education on the second-dose vaccination of mumps and/or hand hygiene.">

        <span class="abst" title="One year after the first autochthonous transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) to birds and horses in Germany, an epizootic emergence of WNV was again observed in 2019. The number of infected birds and horses was considerably higher compared to 2018 (12 birds, two horses), resulting in the observation of the first WNV epidemy in Germany: 76 cases in birds, 36 in horses and five confirmed mosquito-borne, autochthonous human cases. We demonstrated that Germany experienced several WNV introduction events and that strains of a distinct group (Eastern German WNV clade), which was introduced to Germany as a single introduction event, dominated mosquito, birds, horse and human-related virus variants in 2018 and 2019. Virus strains in this clade are characterized by a specific-Lys2114Arg mutation, which might lead to an increase in viral fitness. Extraordinary high temperatures in 2018/2019 allowed a low extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which drove the epizootic emergence and, in the end, most likely triggered the 2019 epidemic. Spatiotemporal EIP values correlated with the geographical WNV incidence. This study highlights the risk of a further spread in Germany in the next years with additional human WNV infections. Thus, surveillance of birds is essential to provide an early epidemic warning and thus, initiate targeted control measures.">

In both, these infections are characterized by high viremia, rash, fever, encephalitis and death. VEEV encephalitis is similar, clinically, to other arboviral diseases, such as dengue, Zika or chikungunya. Most of the alphaviruses are transmitted between vertebrates and mosquitoes. They are able to replicate in a wide number of hosts, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibian and arthropods. The VEEV has enzootic and epizootic transmission cycles. At the enzootic one, enzootic strains (subtype I, serotypes D-F and serotypes II-VI) are continuously circulating between mosquitoes and wild rodents in tropical forests and mangroves of the Americas. The main reseroivrs are wild rodent species of the subfamily Sigmodontinae. However, bats can be also accidental reservoirs of VEEV.

PEDV as an emerging and re-emerging epizootic virus of swine causes substantial economic losses to the pig industry in China and other countries. In China, the occurrence of PED shows significant seasonal variations, usually outbreak during the winter season. The epidemic characteristics of PED may be highly correlated with the changes of ambient temperature. However, molecular mechanism on the seasonal occurrence of PED still remains unclear. It has been widely observed that low ambient temperature up-regulates the expression of host heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). Here, we showed that nucleotide and protein levels of Hsp70 were up-regulated in the intestinal of cold exposed pig and cold exposed Vero E6 cells. We found that overexpression of Hsp70 could increase PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression in Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells, while the siRNAs mediated knockdown of Hsp70 and VER155008 mediated inhibition of Hsp70 resulted in inhibition of viral mRNA synthesis and protein expression in Vero E6 cells. These data suggested that Hsp70 positively regulated PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression, which being helpful for understanding the seasonality of PED epidemics and development of novel antiviral therapies in the future.">

        <span class="abst" title="Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease with increasing spread. Currently SFTS transmission has expanded beyond Asian countries, however, with definitive global extents and risk patterns remained obscure. Here we established an exhaustive database that included globally reported locations of human SFTS cases and the competent vector, Haemaphysalis longicornis (H. longicornis), as well as the explanatory environmental variables, based on which, the potential geographic range of H. longicornis and risk areas for SFTS were mapped by applying two machine learning methods. Ten predictors were identified contributing to global distribution for H. longicornis with relative contribution ≥1%. Outside contemporary known distribution, we predict high receptivity to H. longicornis across two continents, including northeastern USA, New Zealand, parts of Australia, and several Pacific islands. Eight key drivers of SFTS cases occurrence were identified, including elevation, predicted probability of H. longicornis presence, two temperature-related factors, two precipitation-related factors, the richness of mammals and percentage coverage of water bodies. The globally model-predicted risk map of human SFTS occurrence was created and validated effective for discriminating the actual affected and unaffected areas (median predictive probability 0.74 vs. 0.04, P &lt; 0.001) in three countries with reported cases outside China. The high-risk areas (probability ≥50%) were predicted mainly in east-central China, most parts of the Korean peninsula and southern Japan, and northern New Zealand. Our findings highlight areas where an intensive vigilance for potential SFTS spread or invasion events should be advocated, owing to their high receptibility to H. longicornis distribution.">

        <span class="abst" title="Dengue virus (DENV) is a global health threat, causing repeated epidemics throughout the tropical world. While low herd immunity levels to any one of the four antigenic types of DENV predispose populations to outbreaks, viral genetic determinants that confer greater fitness for epidemic spread is an important but poorly understood contributor of dengue outbreaks. Here we report that positive epistasis between the coding and noncoding regions of the viral genome combined to elicit an epidemiologic fitness phenotype associated with the 1994 DENV2 outbreak in Puerto Rico. We found that five amino acid substitutions in the NS5 protein reduced viral genomic RNA (gRNA) replication rate to achieve a more favorable and relatively more abundant subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), a byproduct of host 5'-3' exoribonuclease activity. The resulting increase in sfRNA relative to gRNA levels not only inhibited type I interferon (IFN) expression in infected cells through a previously described mechanism, but also enabled sfRNA to compete with gRNA for packaging into infectious particles. We suggest that delivery of sfRNA to new susceptible cells to inhibit type I IFN induction before gRNA replication and without the need for further de novo sfRNA synthesis could form a &quot;preemptive strike&quot; strategy against DENV.">

Considering that virally suppressed people do not transmit HIV and that interrupting the transmission cycle is critical to ending the HIV epidemic, our objective is to examine the relationship between age of disclosure and viral load suppression by evaluating data from a pediatric HIV clinic in the southern United States. Records from perinatal infected patients seen between 2008 and 2018 were analyzed (N = 61). RESULTS:Longitudinal suppression was low across all groups when benchmarked against the UNAIDS 90% global target; black patients were less likely to achieve suppression compared to white patients (41% vs. 75%, p = 0.04). Adopted children were more likely to achieve suppression than children living with biological family (71% vs. 44%, p &lt; 0.05). Children who learned of their status between 10 and 12 had the highest rate of suppression (65%) compared to peers who learned of their status younger (56%) or older (38%). Our preliminary study is designed to spark research on refining the current recommendations on HIV-status disclosure to perinatal infected children.">

Fortunately, to date there has been no known autochthonous transmission of Zika virus in New Orleans. No studies of the vector competence of local populations of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus for Zika virus transmission have been conducted. To determine if New Orleans Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes are competent for Zika virus, mosquitoes were reared to generation F3 from eggs collected in New Orleans during the 2018 mosquito season. Adults were fed an infectious blood meal and kept for 15 days in an environmental chamber. Transmission assays were conducted at 4, 10, and 15 days post exposure and RT-PCR was run on bodies and saliva to detect the presence of Zika virus RNA. We observed remarkably low susceptibility of both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus from New Orleans to a Zika strain from Panama after oral challenge. These results suggest a limited risk of Zika virus transmission should it be introduced to the New Orleans area, and may partially explain why no transmission was detected in Louisiana during the 2016 epidemic in the Americas, despite multiple known travel associated introductions to New Orleans. Despite these results these mosquito populations are known to be competent vectors for some other mosquito-borne viruses and control measures should not be relaxed.">

The initial expansion of both VRD_521_2016 and RIVM-HAV16-090 clusters dated back to 2012 (95% HPD:2006-2015). During the2016-2017outbreak in Lazio region, the Re peaked around mid-2016, with a value of 1.73 (95% HPD: 1.03-2.37), consistent with incidence trend of AHA cases in Lazio between 2016 and mid-2017. This study showed the magnitude of HAV outbreak in Lazio during 2016-2017, demonstrating the epidemic continuity to MSM-specific outbreak in Europe.

METHODS:We implemented a series of comprehensive preventive and control measures. We analyzed the incubation period and generation time by using the maximum likelihood method, assessed the symptom period and hospitalization duration using the Kaplan-Meier method, and estimated the basic reproductive number and dormitory transmission rate by using established methods. RESULTS:The epidemic lasted for 30 days, and 375 individuals were affected. Overall, 109 patients were hospitalized, and 266 individuals were isolated and treated. The median incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.0 to 5.4 days). The median generation time was 7.3 days (95% CI: 7.1 to 7.6 days). The median symptom period was 6 days (95% CI: 6 to 7 days). The median hospitalization duration was 9 days (95% CI: 9 to 11 days). The basic reproductive number was 5.1 (95% CI: 4.6 to 5.6), and the dormitory transmission rate was 0.15 (95% CI: 0.12 to 0.18). CONCLUSION:Patients in the early stage of the epidemic were treated as having a regular cold and were not isolated; therefore, the virus continued to be transmitted to other susceptible individuals.">

We found that 9.5% (26/273) and 1.8% (5/273) of healthy persons were positive to ZIKV total antibody (IgG and/or IgM) IgM antibody, respectively. All ZIKV positive plasma samples were negative to Dengue virus and West Nile virus. Among the ZIKV antibody positive plasma samples, 65.4% (17/26) exhibited neutralizing activity to ZIKV. Followed up studies showed that none had clinical symptoms of ZIKV infection and oversea experience. Together, our study indicates that endemic ZIKV infections emerge in China, which not only suggested that ZIKV posed a potential threat to public health in China, but also expand the ZIKV epidemic areas in East and Southeast Asia.">

To evaluate this hypothesis, we introduce a spatially explicit metapopulation model for rabies diffusion in Central African Republic. Calibrated on epidemiological data for the capital city, Bangui, the model predicts that long-range movements are essential for continuous re-introductions of rabies-exposed dogs across settlements, eased by the large fluctuations of the incubation period. Bangui's neighborhood, instead, would not be enough to self-sustain the epidemic, contrary to previous expectations. Our findings suggest that restricting long-range travels may be very efficient in limiting rabies persistence in a large and fragmented dog population. Our framework can be applied to other geographical contexts where dog rabies is endemic.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Foot and mouth disease (FMD) is an economically important trans-boundary viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals. It is caused by FMD virus, which belongs to the genus Aphthovirus and family Picornaviridae. FMD is a well-established endemic disease in Ethiopia since it was first detected in 1957. This retrospective study was carried out to identify the spatial and temporal distribution of FMD outbreaks in Amhara region of Ethiopia using 18 years (January 1999-December 2016) reported outbreak data. RESULTS:A total of 636 FMD outbreaks were reported in Amhara region of Ethiopia between 1999 and 2016 with an average and median of 35 and 13 outbreaks per year respectively. In this period, FMD was reported at least once in 58.5% of the districts (n = 79) and in all administrative zones of the region (n = 10). The average district level incidence of FMD outbreaks was 4.68 per 18 years (0.26 per district year). It recurs in a district as epidemic, on average in 5.86 years period. The incidence differed between administrative zones, being the lowest in East Gojjam and highest in North Shewa. The occurrence of FMD outbreaks was found to be seasonal with peak outbreaks in March and a low in August. The long-term trend of FMD outbreaks indicates a slight, but statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001) decrease over the study period. CONCLUSION:FMD occurred in all zones of the region and showed statistically significant decrease in the long-term trend. Numbers of outbreaks were relatively higher during dry season. The spatial and temporal distribution identified in this study should be considered in controlling the disease. As unregulated and frequent animal movements are the likely causes of high outbreak occurrence during the dry season, animal movement regulations should be considered for the long-term control of FMD.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The 2013-2016 West African Ebola epidemic has been the largest to date with &gt;11 000 deaths in the affected countries. The data collected have provided more insight into the case fatality ratio (CFR) and how it varies with age and other characteristics. However, the accuracy and precision of the naive CFR remain limited because 44% of survival outcomes were unreported. METHODS:Using a boosted regression tree model, we imputed survival outcomes (ie, survival or death) when unreported, corrected for model imperfection to estimate the CFR without imputation, with imputation, and adjusted with imputation. The method allowed us to further identify and explore relevant clinical and demographic predictors of the CFR. RESULTS:The out-of-sample performance (95% confidence interval [CI]) of our model was good: sensitivity, 69.7% (52.5-75.6%); specificity, 69.8% (54.1-75.6%); percentage correctly classified, 69.9% (53.7-75.5%); and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 76.0% (56.8-82.1%). The adjusted CFR estimates (95% CI) for the 2013-2016 West African epidemic were 82.8% (45.6-85.6%) overall and 89.1% (40.8-91.6%), 65.6% (61.3-69.6%), and 79.2% (45.4-84.1%) for Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, respectively. We found that district, hospitalisation status, age, case classification, and quarter (date of case reporting aggregated at three-month intervals) explained 93.6% of the variance in the naive CFR. CONCLUSIONS:The adjusted CFR estimates improved the naive CFR estimates obtained without imputation and were more representative. Used in conjunction with other resources, adjusted estimates will inform public health contingency planning for future Ebola epidemics, and help better allocate resources and evaluate the effectiveness of future inventions.">
