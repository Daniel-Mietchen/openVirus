<p>A 38-year-old woman who is from and lives in Central Africa consulted for solid lesions and purple-colored patches on her right leg and foot that had been evolving for six months. The patient's interview revealed a notion of pain of the affected limb, an antecedent of trauma of the same limb in a road accident that had occurred ten years before and that resulted in a leg lymphoedema. The physical examination found the patient in good general condition, without fever. Locally, there were infiltrated purple macula associated with angiomatous papulo-nodules and lymphoedema of the right leg. The external part of the lower third of the same leg is the seat of an unsightly and atrophic scar and erosion of the external malleolus (

There was no sign of impairment of other organs. So, the diagnosis of endemic KD was evoked in view of the geographical origin of the patient, with a pseudo-Kaposi of Stewart–Bluefarb and an epidemic KD being differentially diagnosed. Hemogram revealed nothing particular. C-reactive protein was positive at 35  mg/L. The histopathology of the lesions and the ultrasonography of the affected limb have not been performed. HIV serology was positive to HIV1. The CD4 count was 600 cells/mm3. The diagnosis of epidemic KD on an anteriorly traumatized leg in a patient from Central Africa was retained.
