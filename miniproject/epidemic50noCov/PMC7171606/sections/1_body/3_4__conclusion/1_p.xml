<p>Our observation poses a diagnostic problem of a unilateral localized form of KD in an HIV seropositive patient living in a HHV8 seroprevalence zone. It has allowed us to draw attention to the fact that KD can be multifactorial and can lead to an intricate clinical picture. It could also involve for a given clinical form the combination of genetic, immunological, environmental, and local cofactors. Could KD, then, be a continuum in which the weight of one of the factors involved could predispose to a particular clinical form?</p>
