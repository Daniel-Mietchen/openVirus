<p>Stewartâ€“Bluefarb pseudo-Kaposi is a rare condition that affects young adults between 20 and 30 years, with predominance in males. It is secondary to a reactive angiodysplasia affecting the blood vessels. Its pathogenesis is not clearly elucidated, but it suggests that any condition favoring the increase of venous pressure produces a retrograde blood flow that can stimulate, especially in fragile anatomical areas, the proliferation of endothelial and fibroblastic cells under the action of the vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF). The contributing factors may be trauma, as is the case in our patient, an arteriovenous fistula during hemodialysis, vascular surgery, or a significant hormonal period such as puberty or pregnancy [
