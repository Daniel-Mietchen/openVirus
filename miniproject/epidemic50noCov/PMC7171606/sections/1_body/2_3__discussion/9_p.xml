<p>The diagnosis of the Stewart–Bluefarb syndrome with Kaposi's disease is clinically and histologically difficult. The labeling of perivascular cells by CD34 antigen, the detection of HHV8 viral DNA, the presence of crystalloid intracytoplasmic inclusions, or the positivity of factor VIII R antigen were put forward as elements that enable the distinction between a pseudo-Kaposi and a KD [

Sometimes, it is purple-colored nodules associated with brown spots and localized oedema as is the case in our patient. The lesions are unilateral acral or hanging, of sudden appearance. The duplex ultrasound of the limb associated with arteriography reveals the arteriovenous fistula [
