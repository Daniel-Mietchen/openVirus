<p>The treatment of epidemic KD is different from that of other forms. In other forms, immunosuppressive chemotherapy or radiotherapy is often used for the treatment of diffuse forms. In epidemic KD, combined ARV treatment is recommended [

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The action of ARVs is very probably indirect. By inhibiting the replication of HIV, they induce the restoration of the immune system, which results in the decrease of the HHV8 viral load and thus the partial or total regression of KD, thus confirming the opportunistic nature of this tumor [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, it is shown that early ARV treatment and limited forms of epidemic KD allow remission in at least 80% of patients [
