<p>The responsibility of the HHV8 is no longer to be demonstrated in the occurrence of the KD. Anti-HHV8 antibodies are found in at least 95% of all forms of KD cases. However, prevalence and clinical forms differ according to geographic areas and underlying terrain [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The presence of HHV8 therefore appears to be necessary but not a sufficient condition for the onset of KD. Genetic, immune, and environmental cofactors were referred to [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. With the case of our patient, we also suggest local cofactors such as microtrauma or tissue remodeling in the stimulation of the virus and the proliferation of fusiform cells.
