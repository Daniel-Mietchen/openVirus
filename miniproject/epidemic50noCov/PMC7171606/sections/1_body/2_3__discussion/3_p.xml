<p>With the influence of the environment, endemic KD occurs in several forms: indolent cutaneous, acral aggressive, disseminated, and generalized lymphadenopathy in children with bad prognosis. The regions of high endemicity are Latin America, South Africa, and West and Central Africa, the region of origin of our patient. Seroprevalence to HHV8 is around 40–90% compared to 3–5% in the countries of Europe (north, south, and west), Asia, and North America [
