<p>KD associated with epidemic HIV is particularly aggressive with bilateral or profuse cutaneous involvement, mucosal, and systemic involvement all in the context of severe immunosuppression [

Indeed, the Th1-type cytokines secreted during HIV infection potentiate the activation of HHV8 resulting in an increase of viral load and higher risk of occurrence of KD. Also, the activating protein “Tat” which intervenes during the replication of HIV type 1 stimulates the secretion of proangiogenic chemokines, which will in turn induce the development of KD through the release of fibroblastic growth factors. This latter mechanism may account for the fact that KD is more common with HIV1 than with HIV2 infection [
