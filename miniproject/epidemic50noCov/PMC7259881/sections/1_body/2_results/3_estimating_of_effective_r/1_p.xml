<p>As the dataset of HAV VP1X2A junction sequences from Lazio set up for this study closely represented the incidence trends of AHA cases in Lazio between 2013 and 2018 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], it was a good chance to estimate the effective reproduction number (R
 <sub>e</sub>) through the birth-death skyline (BDSKY) model [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. For BDSKY it was necessary to choose prior epidemic parameters, both constant and changing across intervals through time in order to reflect natural trend of an outbreak [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. BDSKY prior parameters for HAV outbreak were followed: one interval for the become uninfectious rate was set with a prior distribution to Uni (5, 120), corresponding to time period, in which AHA patient is infectious, or 3 daysâ€”73 days [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]; one interval for the sampling probability was set with the prior distribution to Beta (1, 9999), the sampling probability before the first sample was set to 0; for effective reproduction number (R
 <sub>e</sub>) ten equidistant intervals between the root and the last sample was chosen with LN (2, 1.25) prior distribution, 0 as the lower and 50 as the upper bound; for the origin parameter in years, the prior was set in Uni (7,8), because the outbreak starting was well-know.
