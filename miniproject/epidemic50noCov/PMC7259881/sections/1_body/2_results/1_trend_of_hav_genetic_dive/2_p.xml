<p>Preliminary phylogenetic analysis of all HAV sequences database from Lazio underwent an exploratory ML phylogenetic analysis. The analysis allowed to split the main genotypes, underlined by names in green. In genotype IA (light green background), two large clusters associated with strains VRD_521_2016 and RIVM-HAV16-090 were shown (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234010.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The unique variant sequences were highlighted in red. The VRD_521_2016 cluster, firstly identified in Lazio at the end of August 2016, is the largest cluster of entire tree, with 165 sequence and 11 unique variant sequences and a statistically significant node (93% bootstrap value). RIVM-HAV16-090 cluster included 28 sequences (six unique) found between 2017 and 2018, with a statistically significant node (98% bootstrap value).
