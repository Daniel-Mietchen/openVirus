<p>To determine the population genetic features of HAV and highlight epidemic trend in Lazio between 2013 and 2018, we estimated viral genetic diversity indices on the entire database of HAV VP1X2A junction sequences from Lazio, using summary statistics indices (
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The molecular diversity values were computed considering four time intervals (2013–2015; 2016; 2017 and 2018); the genetic variability parameters included were number of variant sequences (K), number of polymorphic sites in the alignment (S) and gene diversity (H), which indicate the degree of diversity among sequences in viral population. The expansion of viral population was tested by Tajima's D.The results indicated a decrease of all three parameters of genetic variability between 2016 and 2017, followed by restoration of initial values in 2018. This trend was in keeping with the circulation of epidemic HAV strains between January 2016 and March 2017, as suggested by surveillance data and by previous molecular investigation [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Moreover, Tajima's D values for viral populations in 2016 (D = −1.76585) and 2017 (D = -1.57359) were significantly less than zero (p &lt; 0.030), suggesting the viral population was involved in an expansion event in these years. Average overall dN/dS ratio resulted&lt;1 for all periods, indicating absence of positive selection, at least in the 459 bp VP1X2A junction region. Moreover a recombination analysis among all sequences, including reference strains, highlighted no evidence of recombination event. To quantify genetic similarity among HAV viral populations over time and determine the extent of genetic variability, Fst pairwise distance was evaluated (
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The lowest Fst value was observed for 2016 vs 2017 (0.02322, p = 0.030), confirming a unique large epidemic event with genetic continuity in these years. This was in line with the low gene diversity values in 2016 and 2017 (
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), and with the presence of a largely dominant strain, i.e. VRD_521_2016, accounting for 80% and 69% of all sequences in 2016 and 2017, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234010.s004">S1 Table</xref>). The second dominant strain was RIVM-HAV16-090, accounting for 22% and 8% of all sequences in 2016 and 2017.
