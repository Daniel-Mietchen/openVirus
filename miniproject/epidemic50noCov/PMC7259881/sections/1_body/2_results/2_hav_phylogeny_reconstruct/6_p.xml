<p>Clade B contain 19 sequences with common node dated back to 1972 (95% HPD:1960–1983): 14 from Lazio region, sampled between 2015–2017, three sequences from North America, one from Russia and two strains associated with MSM outbreak, VRD_521_2016 and RIVM-HAV16-069. Cluster VRD_521_2016 contains 12 sequences sampled in 2016–2017, with an expansion in 2012 (95% HPD:2006–2015), probably due to the outbreak in MSM. Clade C has 18 sequences, 14 from Italy (eight from Lazio), two from Algeria, one from Germany and one from Argentina, in which main node was dated back to 1969 (95% HPD:1956–1976). In this clade, a cluster of sequences sampled in 2015 in Lazio was already associated with food consumption in this region and it was arose in 2007 (95% HPD:2000–2012) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. At last, the Cluster D was the smallest group (only 5 sequences sampled in 2013), which would be separated from main group of genotype IA in 1918 (95% HPD:1887–1942) and expanded in 2008 (95% HPD:2000–2012).
