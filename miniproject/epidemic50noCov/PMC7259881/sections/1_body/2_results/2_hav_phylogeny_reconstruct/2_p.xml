<p>To describe phylogeny of VRD_521_2016 and RIVM-HAV16-090 clusters more thoroughly, ML tree was built using only genotype IA sequences, using IB reference M14707.1 as an outgroup. Phylogenetic relationships were defined through&gt; 0.8 bootstrap values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0234010.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and the clock signal in genotype IA data was also tested using root-to-tip regression approach, which allow to explore the association between genetic divergence through time and sampling dates [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In this data set a positive correlation between root-to-tip divergence and sampling time was showed, with clock rate estimated of 1.66*10
 <sup>-4</sup>subst/site/year.
