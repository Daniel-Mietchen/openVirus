<p>Bayesian phylogenetic approach was applied to genotype IA clade to allow dating of VRD_521_2016 and RIVM-HAV16-090 clusters more specifically. The Bayesian skyline demographic model with a strict molecular clock was selected as the most appropriate to describe the evolutionary history of enter HAV phylogeny (2lnBF &gt; 10 for every comparison). The presence of both clusters was showed by Bayesian phylogenetic tree (Bayesian MCC), where was also confirmed by posterior probability &gt; 0.80 (
