<p>To identify the geographical origin and reconstruct the phylogeny of HAV on time scale, 48 unique variant VP1X2A junction sequences from Lazio were selected from initial database of 246 HAV VP1-2A sequences. The new HAV database was enriched by RIVM-HAV16-069 strain and 101 HAV sequences available on GenBank. At first, an explorative analysis of temporal and phylogenetic relationship was done using the web-based Nextstrain tool (
