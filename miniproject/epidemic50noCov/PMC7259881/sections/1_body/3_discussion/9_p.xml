<p>The present study deeply explored the phylogenetic dynamics of the HAV outbreak occurred in a restricted geographical region of Italy during 2016â€“2017, mainly affecting MSM, where two monophyletic strains strongly predominated. The analysis HAV dataset in Lazio showed an epidemic continuity with the continental outbreak in MSM population across Europe. In addition, the origin of the strains was dated back to 2012, a date consistent with a silent circulation of these strains for a while, followed by explosive expansion, likely begun by the 2016 EuroPride held in Amsterdam, and an exportation across Europe and to other more distant countries.</p>
