<p>Starting from real epidemiological data, we applied phylodynamic methods to assess the behavior of HAV during a large outbreak of AHA, which occurred in Lazio between 2016 and 2017, mainly affecting the MSM population as a model of special risk group. The observed low genetic diversity among HAV variants during the outbreak, along with the significant prevalence two strains only (VRD_521_2016and RIVM-HAV16-090) suggested that the trigger of the expansion was mainly associated with host dependent factors (e.g. super spreading behaviours among a largely susceptible population) rather than virus dependent factors (e.g. positive selection of hyper-infective strain).</p>
