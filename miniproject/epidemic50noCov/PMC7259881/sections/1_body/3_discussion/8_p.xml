<p>In the Lazio AHA epidemic dynamics, the R
 <sub>e</sub> distribution was featured by values constantly higher than 1 (1.23–1.17) in 2013–2014 and a peak around mid-2016 with R
 <sub>e</sub> 1.73 (95% HPD:1.03–2.37). Both signals were consistent with the incidence trends of AHA cases in Lazio in mid-2013 with 30 AHA cases, which represented more than 2 times the total of AHA in whole year 2012 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], and between 2016 and mid-2017, where the incidence of AHA increased from less than 2 (January-August 2016) to 46.9 (March 2017) cases per 100,000 resident-years in Rome [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The R
 <sub>e</sub> estimated for AHA outbreak among MSM in Lazio is consistent with R
 <sub>e</sub> estimated by a different bayesian model for household transmission events during the same epidemic, where the resulting R
 <sub>e</sub> was 1.63 (95% CI: 1.35–1.94) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Moreover, many epidemic studies about AHA reported epidemic dynamics similar to this outbreak: in MSM population in Sydney between 1991 and 1992 R
 <sub>0</sub>was 3.3 (95% PI: 1.71–3.67) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]; in England in 1986–1987 the R
 <sub>0</sub> estimated by AHA average annual incidence in children was 1.6–2.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref078" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]; in AHA outbreak at an elementary school in China in 2011 R
 <sub>0</sub> was estimated between 2.1 and 2.8 (95% CI: 1.8–4.5) [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref079" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. It is noteworthy that the reproduction number of HAV is of the same order of magnitude of the R
 <sub>e</sub> values of sexually transmissible infection, such as HIV and HSV-2, in MSM population with long-term partnerships (1–2 years) [
