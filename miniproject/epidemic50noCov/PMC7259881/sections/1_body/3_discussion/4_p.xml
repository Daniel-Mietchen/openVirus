<p>The topology of VRD_521_2016 and RIVM-HAV16-090 clusters, obtained in all of phylogenetic analyses, showed a “‘star-like” shape, with external branches longer than the internal ones, and is typical of rapid expansion of a virus in a target population [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The analysis of coalescent events from Bayesian MCC tree suggests for both clusters an origin dating back to 2012 (95% HPD: 2006–2015), which was consistent with Nextstrain dating. This dating could indicate a latency period, in which outbreak strains could silently circulate in MSM community, showing a range only after EuroPride 2016, which took place in Amsterdam in July/August 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The explosive expansion of these strains involved many distant countries worldwide, where similar contemporary outbreaks have been described. Early AHA cases linked to MSM outbreaks were found between 2016 in England, Netherland and Germany [

 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Two HAV strains VRD_521_2016 and RIVM-HAV16–090 were found in 1400 cases between June 2016 and May 2017 in Europe, with 56% and 35% respectively, becoming strain markers of this epidemic event [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. AHA outbreak was not enclosed in Europe: cases with epidemic strain markers were found in other extra-EU countries, such as Israel, Brazil and Japan [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], while in some cases new local outbreaks among MSM were there [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In this epidemic event Italy was no exception: since September 2016 Lazio Regional Service for the Epidemiology and Control for Infectious Diseases (SERESMI) has noticed an unexpected increase of AHA cases in Lazio (central Italy), finding a molecular linkage with this AHA outbreak [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], while 15 AHA cases with genotype IA strains linked to same epidemic event were reported in southern Italy [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
