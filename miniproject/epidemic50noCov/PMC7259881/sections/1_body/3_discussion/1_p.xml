<p>The WHO calls for elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Though HAV is not associated with chronic infections, the large number of incident cases and the propensity of this virus to produce long-lasting epidemic may significantly impact on individual well being, producing relevant direct and indirect costs at local level. Strategy for optimizing the control of HAV should be tailored on local epidemic profile: in settings where HAV is low and very low endemic, a prompt identification of outbreak within special risk groups is a critical step for scaling up interventions to stop the transmission and avoiding large outbreak. Indeed, special groups at risk living in low endemic settings, represent the ideal setting for explosive outbreak due to the significant prevalence of behavior facilitating HAV transmission and low level of immunity.
