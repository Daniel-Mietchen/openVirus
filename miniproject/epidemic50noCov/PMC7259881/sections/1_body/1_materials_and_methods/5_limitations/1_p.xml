<p>The main limitation of our study is the use of a short HAV genome region (VP1X2A junction, 459bp fragment) to study HAV phylodynamics. Although this trait provides more limited genetic information than larger sub-genomic regions or even full-length HAV genome,it was adopted becauseVP1-2A region is the most commonly used to investigate the outbreaks and a large number of VP1-2A sequences are available for comparison in public databases. On the other hand longer sequences linked to recent HAV outbreaks in Europe are generally missing, and this would have represented an even greater limitation for the present phylodynamic study.</p>
