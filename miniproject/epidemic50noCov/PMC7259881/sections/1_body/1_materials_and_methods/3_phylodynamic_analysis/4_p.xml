<p>To estimate demographic history of HAV genotype IA infections, the best fitting nucleotide substitution model was identified as the GTR+G by all model selection methods (best model GTR+G: max logLik = -3138.714 and AIC = 6561.428), through 
 <italic>modelTest</italic> function of R packages 
 <italic>ape</italic> and 
 <italic>phangorn</italic> [

 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Bayesian phylogenetic trees were inferred using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, available in BEAST v1.10.4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Independent MCMC runs were carried out for strict and relaxed clock models, along with the following coalescent priors: constant population size, exponential growth and nonparametric Bayesian Skyline plot (BSP) [

 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. By BEASTv1.10.4 function, marginal likelihoods estimates for each demographic model were obtained through path sampling and stepping stone analyses, and the best-fitting model for the dataset was determined by calculating the Bayes factors (BF) [

 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. By this approach, a pair wise comparison of models can be carried out, in which Bayes factor between two models is a ratio of two marginal likelihoods obtained for the two models, M
 <sub>0</sub> and M
 <sub>1</sub>: 2lnBF&lt;0: negative evidence for M
 <sub>0</sub> (supports M
 <sub>1</sub>); 0.0–2.2: not worth more than a base mention; 2.2–6.0: positive evidence; 6–10: strong evidence; &gt;10 very strong evidence [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Chains were conducted for at least 100x10
 <sup>6</sup>generations, and sampled every 10,000 steps for each molecular clock model. The MCMC convergence was assessed by calculating the ESS for each parameter, accepting values &gt;250. Maximum Clade Credibility trees were obtained from the trees’ posterior distributions with Tree-Annotator software v 1.10.4 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Statistical support for specific monophyletic clades was assessed by calculating the posterior probability (pp). Bayesian skyline plot (BSP) was inferred by BEAST v1.10.4 and plotted by Tracer 1.7.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. BSP shows virus effective population size (Ne) trend, i.e. the effective number of viral genomes contributing to new infections, respect to time (years), assuming that the coalescent events on a small random sample can be an approximation of the large population dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The variation of the transmissibility of HAV strains spreading in Lazio region along the study period was estimated on the basis of the effective reproduction number (R
 <sub>e</sub>), calculated with the birth–death skyline (BDSKY) approach. The birth–death model allow to quantify an epidemiological parameter to estimate the transmissibility of infectious disease, namely the effective reproduction number (R
 <sub>e</sub>), which is given by this ratio: R = λ/δ, in which each infected individual may transmit with a rate λ and eventually becomes uninfectious with a rate δ, which is sum of rates of death/recovery and sampling, μ and ψ, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. R
 <sub>e</sub> is defined as the average number of potential secondary infections from an infected individual in the presence of herd-immunity at each time point during the outbreak [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. R
 <sub>e</sub>&gt;1 indicates increasing number of cases, and a potential epidemic, while R
 <sub>e</sub>&lt;1 indicates that the number of cases decreases with each generation, and if the decrease is maintained the epidemic will be eliminated. The method is implemented as an add-on BDSKY to the BEAST v2.5.2 software framework [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Chains were conducted for at least 100x10
 <sup>6</sup> generations, and sampled every 10,000 steps and General Time Reversible model plus Gamma distributed rates among sites (GTR+G) was used under strict clock model.
