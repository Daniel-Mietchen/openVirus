<p>At first, this dataset was analyzed through web-based Nextstrain tool, which uses a augur pipeline [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], for reconstruction of viral phylogeny [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The augur pipeline was run using the aligner MAFFT [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], the tree-builder [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and the phylodynamic package TreeTime [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The repository detailing the analysis pipeline is available at

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/community/INMIbioinfo/HAV_VP1-2A" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://nextstrain.org/community/INMIbioinfo/HAV_VP1-2A</ext-link>. AY644670.1 sequences (reference for IIB genotype) were excluded from the phylodynamic analysis because it deviated more than 4 interquartile ranges from the molecular clock regression.
