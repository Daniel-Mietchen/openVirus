<p>To determine the population genetic features of recent HAV outbreak in Lazio, the entire dataset was split by year in four viral populations (2013–2015; 2016; 2017; 2018). Standard diversity and molecular indices, i.e. number of unique variant sequences (K), number of polymorphic sites (S) and gene diversity (H), were calculated for viral populations of each year. Gene diversity (H) is defined as H =

It indicates the degree of diversity among sequences into viral population and its values is between 0 and 1, where 0 is absent of diversity among sequences and 1 is absent of equality among sequences. Finally, Tajima's D was used to determine the effect of selection pressure of each viral population per each year. It is defined as D =

 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For each year, the genetic diversity indices of viral populations were estimated using the software Arlequin 3.5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The significance was tested through 10,000 permutations, and unique variant sequences for each viral population were used as analysis dataset, accounting for 48 sequences overall and including genotypes IIIA, IB and IA. This approach determines differences in genetic diversity among the four viral populations, arising from variation in effective population size. The synonymous mutations per synonymous site (dS), the non-synonymous mutations per non-synonymous site (dN) and the overall average dN/dS ratio of all viral sequences from each viral population per year were calculated using MEGAX, using Nei and Gojobori method [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. dN/dS&gt;1 means the trait is not under positive selection, while dN/dS&lt;1 is under strong positive selection. If dN/dS = 1, it was selective neutrality condition [
