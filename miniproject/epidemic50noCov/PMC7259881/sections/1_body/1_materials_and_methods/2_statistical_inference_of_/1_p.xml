<p>The 459 nt sequences encompassing the VP1X2A junction region of HAV genome was aligned by CLUSTALW program for multiple sequence alignment [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which at first was used to build a maximum-likelihood method phylogenetic tree, implemented in MEGAX software [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To assess the significance of the nodes, bootstrap analysis with 10,000 replicates was performed (&gt;80% considered significant). In the phylogenetic tree, all the HAV sequences obtained from cases referred to the Laboratory since 2013 were included. Reference sequences, retrieved from GenBank, were included as well. In addition, the sequences of four strains, reported to be associated with current MSM-linked epidemic clusters in other European countries, were included in the phylogenetic analysis: VRD_521_2016, first described in United Kingdom, RIVM-HAV16-090 and RIVM-HAV16-069 first described in Netherlands, and V16_25801, first reported in Germany [

 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For this dataset, the best fitting nucleotide substitution model was selected by

 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. By this tool, the General time reversible model plus Gamma distributed rates among sites [
 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] (GTR+G with shape parameter = 0.25) was selected by the highest values of loglikelihood (logLik) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (best model GTR+G: max logLik = -3111.83 and AIC = 7287.667).
