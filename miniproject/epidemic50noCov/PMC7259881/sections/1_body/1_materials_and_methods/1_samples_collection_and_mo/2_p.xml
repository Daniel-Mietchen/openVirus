<p>The samples from all AHA cases are submitted for confirmatory testing to the regional reference laboratory, established at the Laboratory of Virology of INMI. Confirmatory testing includes HAV-specific antibody evaluation and HAV RNA detection on all submitted samples. A representative sample of either serum or stool specimens with detectable HAV RNA are sequenced for molecular epidemiology assessment. Anti-HAV IgG and IgM detection was performed with Architect system (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA). RNA was extracted from serum or stool samples, depending on available material, using QIASYMPHONY automated instrument (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). RNA was eluted in 60 microliters elution buffer, 5 microliters of them was reverse transcribed, and cDNA was amplified using specific primers for VP1X2A junction [

Particularly, reverse transcription and first–round PCR were conducted using OneStep RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN, Hilen, Germany), in 50 μL reaction mixture containing 5 μL of extracted RNA, 10 μL of 5xBuffer, 2 μL of dNTPs (10mM) and 2 μL of OneStep enzyme. Final concentrations of primers (labelled HAV6.1_codehop and HAV10_codehop) were 0.6 μM. Reverse transcription was performed at 50°C for 30’ followed by the PCR reaction. Thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 15 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 42°C, and 45 s at 72°C, with a final step of 7’ at 72°C. The second round PCR was conducted using AmpliTaq Gold™ DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA, USA), in 50 μL reaction mixture containing 1 μL of first round of PCR, 5 μL of 10xBuffer, 4 μL of MgCl2, 1 μL of dNTPs (10mM) and 0.3 μL of enzyme. Final concentrations of primers (labelled HAV8.2_codehop and HAV11_codehop) were 0.5 μM. Thermal cycling conditions of second round of PCR reaction were as follows: 5 min at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 20 s at 60°C, and 15 s at 72°C, with a final step of 7’ at 72°C. Positive and negative controls, which contained standardized viral RNA extracts and nuclease-free water, respectively, were included in each RT-PCR assay. The resulting amplicons (of 518 nt) were sequenced by automated Sanger sequencing with Prism BigDye (Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA, USA) in an ABI3100 DNA Sequencer. HAV database with 246 sequences obtained at the regional reference laboratory, including 222 sequences from January 2016 to December 2018 and 24 sequences from the 2013–2015 years, was established for the present analysis.
