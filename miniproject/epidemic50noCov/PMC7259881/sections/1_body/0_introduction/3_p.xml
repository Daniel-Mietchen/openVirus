<p>In low and very low endemic settings,such as Italy, HAV infections generally occur as sporadic cases in travelers from endemic areas and clusters within either among close (semi-close communities) or among people within special at risk groups [

 <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As other enteric pathogens, HAV transmission can be facilitated by oro-anal sex either in homo- or heterosexual partners. However, the oro-anal sex is likely to be more common in the Men-Who-Have-Sex-With-Men (MSM) group. Indeed, since late 1980’s, several large and transnational AHA outbreaks have been associated with same sex intercourse between men [

Molecular investigations carried out in different countries suggested that most of the cases where associated with two different HAV genotype IA strains RIVM-HAV16-090 and VRD_521_2016, both associated with outbreaks affecting European MSM communities [

In this paper we used the molecular characterization, phylogenetic reconstruction and phylodynamic analysis of the recent genotype IA HAV strains circulating in Lazio as a tool for modelingtransmission pathways and improve outbreak surveillance.
