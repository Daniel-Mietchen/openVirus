  <title>Phylogenetic analysis of HAV genotypes strains.</title>
  <p>The panel A shows a phylogenetic tree as obtained by Nextstrain, containing VP1X2A junction sequences of HAV genome from Lazio region, Europe and worldwide. All information about geographic origin and year of isolation for each strain is reported in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234010.s005">S2 Table</xref>. In this tree the sequences were labelled by HAV genotype.
