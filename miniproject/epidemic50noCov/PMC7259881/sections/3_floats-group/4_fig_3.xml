  <title>Maximum likelihood tree of genotype IA dataset.</title>
  <p>The evolutionary history of HAV was inferred on VP1X2A junction region of HAV genome, using the Maximum Likelihood method with GTR+G mutation model. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA X [
   <xref rid="pone.0234010.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Bootstrap values are greater than 80% (â—‹) and the nodes are marked by coloured braches. Branches in grey represent VRD_521_2016 and RIVM-HAV16-090 clusters. All unique sequences, collected until October 2018 from Lazio region and classified as genotype IA, are included and sample names are underlined in the tree.
