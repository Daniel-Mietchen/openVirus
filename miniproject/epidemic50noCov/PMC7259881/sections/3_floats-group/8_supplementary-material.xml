  <title>Bayesian skyline plot of HAV genotype IA database.</title>
  <p>The demographic history of genotype IA, based on unique VP1X2A junction sequences of HAV genome, was inferred by a Bayesian skyline plot (BSP). The y-axis reports virus effective population size (Ne), the effective number of viral genomes contributing to new infections, while the x-axis is time in calendar years. Blue line is median estimated, while light blue area is 95% highest posterior density intervals (HPD).</p>
