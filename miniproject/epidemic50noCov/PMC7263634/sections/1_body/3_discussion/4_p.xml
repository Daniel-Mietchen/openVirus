<p>All plasma samples from healthy individuals were collected in the suburb of Nanning City, which is located in Southeast China. Our followed-up study showed that all ZIKA positive individuals are native to Nanning City and none of them had oversea experience, indicating that they're massively more likely that the ZIKV detected in China is endemic. Additionally, Nanning City is located in the south of Guizhou Province [

We then analyzed the records of locations of ZIKV occurrences in parts of Southeast Asian countries. We noticed that no ZIKA infection cases were ever reported in territories of Southeast Asian countries that are located up to 800 km to the south and west of Nanning. In other words, the ZIKV infection cases in Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand mainly concentrated on these countriesâ€™ southern regions and no ZIKV cases were ever reported in their northern regions.
