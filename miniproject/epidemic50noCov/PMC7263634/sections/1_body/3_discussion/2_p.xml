<p>Previous studies have reported isolation of ZIKV from mosquitoes and travelers in Guizhou Province, China [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008300.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the existence of endemic ZIKV infection in China was not reported up to date. In this study, we demonstrated that healthy individuals were serological positive to ZIKV NS1 IgG and/or IgM by ELISA. We also demonstrated that 17 plasma samples of the 26 persons have micro-neutralization (MNT) antibodies [

Considering the cross-reaction may exists among flaviviruses, detection of DENV and WNV was analyzed by ELISA and the results was negative in all 26 ZIKV positive plasma samples. Additionally, previous report has showed that NS1 of flaviviruses is highly specific and there is no cross-reaction between ZIKV-NS1 and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) NS1 proteins [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008300.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We have also analyzed the sequence homology of NS1 proteins among flaviviruses and we found that the amino acid sequence of the NS1 proteins similarity was very low among flaviviruses. The sequence homology between ZIKV and JEV, WNV or DENV was 57%, 56% and 54%, respectively. The conserved sequences of ZIKV and JEV are consistent with the conserved sequences of ZIKV and WNV or DENV. Therefore if the ZIKV positive sera react with JEV, it should also react with WNV and DNEV. Hence, our data suggest that the ZIKV reaction antibodies in human plasma were induced by ZIKV infections. We were unable to detect ZIKV RNA or isolate ZIKV from IgM positive healthy individuals. We hypothesized that the viral load might be very low or viremia period is very short in these people.
