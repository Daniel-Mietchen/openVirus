<p>In all, we demonstrated endemic ZIKV infections in China. Our study expanded our knowledge of ZIKV epidemic regions in East and Southeast Asia. From our report in this study and sporadic reports of ZIKV infections in humans in Southeast Asian countries including Southern Vietnam, Western Laos, Southern Thailand, Cambodia, and Southern Myanmar, we deduced that ZIKV infection in humans may distribute broadly from Guangxi Province, China to Southeast Asian countries. Further study is also necessary to detect whether other parts of China, especially in Southern China, exhibit ZIKV positive. People living in these areas are at high risks of ZIKV infection. This information will alert government officials, physicians and public health workers in China and Southeastern Asian countries to pay attention to ZIKV infection cases; and physicians around the world to pay attention to ZIKV infections for travelers who have returned from Southern China and Southeast Asia.</p>
