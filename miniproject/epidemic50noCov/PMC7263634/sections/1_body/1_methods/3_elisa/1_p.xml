<p>Human plasmas were measured using a ZIKV-NS1-IgM ELISA Kit (Wending Biotech, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China), total ZIKV NS1 antibody ELISA Kit (Wending Biotech, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China), Dengue virus (DENV)-IgG ELISA Kit (Zhongshan Biotech, Zhongshan, Guangdong, China) or West Nile Virus (WNS) IgG DxSelect (FOCUS Diagnostics, CA). Briefly, to detect the ZIKV-NS1-IgM or ZIKV NS1 total antibody, ZIKV NS1 or anti-human IgM monoclonal antibody pre-coated polystyrene plates were incubated with 50 μl sample dilution buffer combined with 50 μl negative control, positive control, or plasma samples. After 30min incubation at 37°C, plates were washed with wash buffer for 5 times. HRP-conjugated-ZIKV NS1 antigen (100 μl) was coated with plates for 30min at 37°C followed by 5 times wash with wash buffer. In the end, plates were incubated with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine substrate for 5min and the reaction was stopped with stop solution. Optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm in an absorbance microplate reader. The mean value OD of negative control is less than 0.1. Cut off = 0.748* mean value OD of negative control+0.146.</p>
