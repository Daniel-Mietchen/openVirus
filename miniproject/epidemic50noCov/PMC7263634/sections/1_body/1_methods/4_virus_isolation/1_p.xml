<p>Plasma samples were centrifuged at 13,523 g for 10min with a microcentrifuge and sterilized using 0.45 μm microfilters. The plasma samples were then diluted by a factor of 10 and inoculated with Vero cells. Vero cells were incubated at 37°C in 5% carbon dioxide and observed daily for cytopathic effects (CPE). At the same time, RNA was also isolated to detect ZIKV using nested-PCR.</p>
