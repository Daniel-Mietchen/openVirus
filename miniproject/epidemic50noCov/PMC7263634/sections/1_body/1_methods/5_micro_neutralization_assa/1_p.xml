<p>Micro-neutralization assays were then used to detect neutralizing antibodies against ZIKV. ZIKV was kindly provided by Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Prevention and Control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008300.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, the negative plasma control and ZIKV positive plasma samples were pre-treated at 56°C for 30min. Plasma samples were diluted serially from 1:2 to 1:64 and mixed with an equal volume of 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of ZIKV. The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 2 hours and then added into Vero cells in triplicate in 96-well tissue culture microplates. Vero cells were checked for 10 days to evaluate CPE in 2% FBS DMEM medium. Crystalline Violet staining was then used to monitor the CPE of different dilution ratios [
