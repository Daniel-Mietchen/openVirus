<p>A total of 273 healthy individuals were surveyed in the suburb of Nanning City, Guangxi Province, China. All plasma samples were analyzed for ZIKV antibodies with antigen sandwich-ELISA. ELISA results showed that 9.5% (26 /273) of healthy human plasma samples were positive to total ZIKV antibodies (IgG and IgM) and 1.8% (5/273) of healthy individuals were ZIKV IgM positive

 </bold>. In addition, ELISA results showed that all 26 ZIKV positive plasma samples were negative to DENV and WNV. ZIKV RNA fragments were not detected by nested-PCR and ZIKV was not isolated in the 5 ZIKV IgM positive plasma samples

 </bold>. Among those ZIKV positive individuals, 15 were male and 11 were female, with a sex ratio of 1.36. Most of them were between 30 and 50 years of age

 </bold>. Micro-neutralization assays were then used to detect the neutralization antibodies in ZIKV positive plasma samples. We found that 17 ZIKV antibody positive plasma samples showed neutralizing activity up to 1/22

 </bold>. Twenty-six individuals with ZIKV antibody were then followed up one by one for 2 months after they were tested positive, and they all lacked clinical symptoms of ZIKV infection. In addition, none of them had oversea experience.
