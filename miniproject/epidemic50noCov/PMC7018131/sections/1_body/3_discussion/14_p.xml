<p>The weaknesses/limitations of this study are related to epidemiological studies using secondary information sources. The possibility of underreporting of dengue cases cannot be ruled out. National surveillance systems may not capture all dengue infections, for epidemiological reasons or for sociodemographic factors. For example, individuals who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms that do not seek care or treatment. Also, symptomatic individuals who choose to self-medicate or seek treatment at a health facility and who are misdiagnosed as another febrile illness. Another factor is incorrect records, with incomplete data and lack of reporting by private clinics [
