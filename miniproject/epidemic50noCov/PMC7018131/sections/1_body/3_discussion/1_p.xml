<p>Dengue has become one of the greatest public health challenges in Brazil in the last two decades. The epidemiology of the disease presented important changes, with the highest number of cases and hospitalizations, with epidemics of great magnitude, the worsening of the process of dissemination of the transmission and the occurrence of severe cases affecting people at extreme ages (children and the elderly) [

Epidemics have shown a cyclical pattern in the occurrence from 1990 to 2017, with interepidemic periods of 3 or 4 years that have decreased over the years. The epidemic peak of 2015 illustrates the characteristics of dengue occurrence in the country in the last decade, with the trend of increasingly intense epidemic peaks, parallel to the shortening of the interepidemic periods. However, analysis by regions of the country shows that these intervals differ from region to region. A recent study carried out in Fortaleza (state of Cear√°) addresses the cyclical, seasonal nature (peaks during the summer) and is dependent on the context of dengue transmission [
