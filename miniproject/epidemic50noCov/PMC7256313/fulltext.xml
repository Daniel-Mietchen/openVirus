The spectrum of disease varies and can range from a febrile upper respiratory disease to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the latter often requiring mechanical ventilation. Current guidelines recommend that patients requiring hospitalization for influenza-related illness should receive oseltamivir, regardless the time of symptoms onset. Duration of treatment should be decided on a case-by-case basis [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The recommendations are based on the available evidence that neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) have been shown to decrease mortality, length of stay and complications. However, a new family of influenza drugs has been approved for use, namely endonuclease inhibitors (EI), represented by baloxavir marboxil.</p><p id="par0025">Currently, there are ongoing trials regarding the use of both NAIs and EIs concomitantly in patients with severe influenza, but they exclude patients with renal disease [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The case described below represents a patient with severe renal impairment and severe influenza related illness in which both medications were utilized.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><title>Case</title><p id="par0030">The patient is a 22-year-old female, with a past medical history of asthma, insulin-dependent diabetes and recently diagnosed IgG4 tubulointerstitial nephritis (IgG4 TIN), who presented with cough and congestion of 3 days duration. She tested positive for influenza B, her chest x-ray on admission showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A), and she was started on renally-adjusted oseltamivir (CrCl 14 mL/min). Over the next 48 h, due to increasing oxygen demand and impending respiratory failure the patient was placed on mechanical ventilation (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B) and the oseltamivir dose was doubled. Echocardiography showed normal left side pressures. Due to the continuous decline of her respiratory condition, the patient was started on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on the fourth day of hospitalization (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). Baloxavir was then added at a dose of 40 mg every 72 h for three doses, methylprednisolone was given for 4 days with a cumulative dose of 1125 mg, started on the fourth day of hospitalization. Further work up for bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections, including bronchoalveolar lavage, was negative. Chest x rays taken 48 h post initiation of baloxavir showed significant improvement of the bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and after another 48 h the patient was taken off ECMO and was extubated three days afterwards (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> D). Subsequently, she was discharged home.<fig id="fig0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>(A) Admission chest x-ray with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates mainly on bases, (B) Progression of bilateral infiltrates at the time of intubation, (C) Extra corporeal oxygenation instauration, (D)Extubated and decannulated patient 7 days after initial imaging.</p></caption><alt-text id="at0005">Fig. 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec0015"><title>Discussion</title><p id="par0035">Influenza B is an Orthomyxovirus that only infects humans. The virus enters the epithelial lining using its hemagglutinin and subsequently new viral particles are assembled and released through the action of neuraminidase. The virus replicates along the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract, where it induces an inflammatory response, resulting in cellular death and congestion of the local vasculature. Altogether, these changes correlate with the clinical manifestations of tracheobronchitis and pharyngitis [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Once it affects the lungs, further changes such as alveolar necrosis, edema and the formation of hyaline membranes can occur. If the latter compromises a significant amount of pulmonary parenchyma, ARDS ensues [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="par0040">Guidelines for hospitalized patients with influenza recommend the use of NAIs, which target neuraminidase, halting viral replication and decreasing the length of symptoms and mortality. Oseltamivir, zanamivir and peramivir are the NAIs approved for influenza treatment in the US and clinical efficacy seems comparable between them but previous attempts to use them in combination have not shown additional benefit [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>]. Immunocompromised patients seem to be at increased risk of infection with NAI-resistant strains and also to develop severe disease [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Our diabetic patient was on chronic oral prednisone for her autoimmune nephropathy developed ARDS within 72 h from admission and required maximal ventilator settings, despite being on oseltamivir for three days. The use of zanamivir, was contraindicated because of the underlying asthma and IV peramivir was not available.</p><p id="par0045">Baloxavir is a new antiviral medication with a mechanism of action of inhibiting the endonuclease activity of the polymerase acidic (PA) protein, part of the viral RNA polymerase complex required for viral gene transcription [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A recent study comparing the use of baloxavir to oseltamivir in hospitalized patients with influenza, showed increased resolution of hypoxemia as well as a shorter duration of hypoxia in the baloxavir [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, this study did not specify the severity of the disease. Currently, there is an ongoing trial comparing the efficacy of baloxavir and oseltamivir to baloxavir and placebo in patients with severe disease [ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02954354]. Our patient was not eligible due prior exposure to oseltamivir and chronic kidney disease.</p><p id="par0050">ARDS is a clinical entity characterized by progressive bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that cannot be fully explained by cardiac disease or volume overload. Despite advances on the understanding of this condition, mortality remains significant [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Management involves lung-protective ventilation, prone positioning, corticosteroids, paralytics and ECMO. The use of corticosteroids is controversial, with data showing that high dose of steroids fails to improve mortality and might cause harm [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. On the other hand, the CESAR trial showed improved survival on ECMO compared to conservative management with medium duration of cannulation of 9 days [<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our patient was started on high dose methylprednisolone along with ECMO support, given the improvement on her respiratory status she was decannulated after 4 days.</p><p id="par0055">This is a case that depicts a rapidly developing ARDS caused by influenza, requiring invasive ventilation and the use of ECMO as supportive measurements. Baloxavir was added to oseltamivir with prompt imaging improvement and an overall short period of intubation and cannulation. While steroid use could be argued to play a role in her improvement, evidence shows that high dose steroids do not benefit this population. Given the acceptable safety profile of both medication and the lack of interaction between them, it could be considered when treating patients at risk for resistant strains and severe disease. After reviewing the literature, this is the first case of dual therapy with these drug families in a patient with poor renal function.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><title>Author statement</title><p id="par0060">All the authors from this manuscript are in agreement and have no further declarations.
