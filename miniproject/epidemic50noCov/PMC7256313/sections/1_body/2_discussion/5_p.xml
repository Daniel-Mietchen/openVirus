<p id="par0055">This is a case that depicts a rapidly developing ARDS caused by influenza, requiring invasive ventilation and the use of ECMO as supportive measurements. Baloxavir was added to oseltamivir with prompt imaging improvement and an overall short period of intubation and cannulation. While steroid use could be argued to play a role in her improvement, evidence shows that high dose steroids do not benefit this population. Given the acceptable safety profile of both medication and the lack of interaction between them, it could be considered when treating patients at risk for resistant strains and severe disease. After reviewing the literature, this is the first case of dual therapy with these drug families in a patient with poor renal function.</p>
