<p id="par0035">Influenza B is an Orthomyxovirus that only infects humans. The virus enters the epithelial lining using its hemagglutinin and subsequently new viral particles are assembled and released through the action of neuraminidase. The virus replicates along the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract, where it induces an inflammatory response, resulting in cellular death and congestion of the local vasculature. Altogether, these changes correlate with the clinical manifestations of tracheobronchitis and pharyngitis [
