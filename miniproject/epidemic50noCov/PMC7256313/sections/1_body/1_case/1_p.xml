<p id="par0030">The patient is a 22-year-old female, with a past medical history of asthma, insulin-dependent diabetes and recently diagnosed IgG4 tubulointerstitial nephritis (IgG4 TIN), who presented with cough and congestion of 3 days duration. She tested positive for influenza B, her chest x-ray on admission showed bilateral interstitial infiltrates (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A), and she was started on renally-adjusted oseltamivir (CrCl 14 mL/min). Over the next 48 h, due to increasing oxygen demand and impending respiratory failure the patient was placed on mechanical ventilation (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> B) and the oseltamivir dose was doubled. Echocardiography showed normal left side pressures. Due to the continuous decline of her respiratory condition, the patient was started on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on the fourth day of hospitalization (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> C). Baloxavir was then added at a dose of 40 mg every 72 h for three doses, methylprednisolone was given for 4 days with a cumulative dose of 1125 mg, started on the fourth day of hospitalization. Further work up for bacterial and fungal pulmonary infections, including bronchoalveolar lavage, was negative. Chest x rays taken 48 h post initiation of baloxavir showed significant improvement of the bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and after another 48 h the patient was taken off ECMO and was extubated three days afterwards (
