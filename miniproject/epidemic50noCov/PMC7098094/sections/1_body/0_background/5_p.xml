<p id="Par6">After the implementation of the first PWID BBS in Mozambique, the Ministry of Health (MoH) started the development of a National Harm Reduction Plan, under the umbrella of the National Strategy for Mental Health (2016–2026). The main objective of the plan is to address public health problems caused by drug use, reduce risks, and prevent disease. However, thus far, the discussions around the plan’s development have not considered the unique needs of adolescents and young people nor expanded on how the plan could be adapted to ensure that public health services reach this age group.</p>
