<p id="Par10">Young people, who make up 32.5% of the Mozambican population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], are a vulnerable sub-population of the country’s HIV epidemic. Data from the population-based 2015 National AIDS Indicator Survey (IMASIDA) results show relatively low levels of knowledge about HIV in young people with 7 in every ten not having a comprehensive knowledge of HIV. Among young men, comprehensive HIV knowledge decreased by 22% since the last household survey conducted in 2011. The HIV prevalence among young people aged 15–24 was 6.9%, where it was higher in young women (9.8% vs. 3.2%). Also, 3% of young women and 18% of young men report having had two or more partners in the last 12 months, and less than 50% of youth reported condom use during their last sexual intercourse. Among participants 15–24 years of age who had sex in the last 12 months, only 38% of women and 18% of men were tested in the last 12 months and received the result of the last test [
