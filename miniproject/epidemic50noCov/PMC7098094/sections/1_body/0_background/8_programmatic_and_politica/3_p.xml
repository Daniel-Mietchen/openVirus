<p id="Par14">In 2018, the MoH developed the 
 <italic>Integrated Guidelines for Prevention, Care and Treatment services of the HIV and AIDS for Key Populations in the Health Sector</italic> to ensure that key populations had access to high-quality, evidence-based services. The strategy was gradually implemented in 22 health facilities with plans to expand to all antiretroviral treatment (ART) sites in 2020. These guidelines provide an orientation to the HIV-related program managers and health providers on the integration of health services to serve key populations, including PWID; however, they do not include additional guidance for the focus on youth PWID.
