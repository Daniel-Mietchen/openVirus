<p>Investigators used a four-story vacant dormitory building in the camp as an isolated treatment area to treat patients with a fever below 39°C and relatively mild symptoms. Patients whose body temperature exceeded 39°C or who had severe complications were immediately transferred to the hospital for treatment. A fever clinic was established on the first floor of the isolated treatment area, and all new fever patients were sent to this clinic for initial diagnosis. Patients’ body temperature was measured four times a day. Meals were delivered to patients by special personnel, disposable tableware was used, and the drinking water provided was purchased mineral water. Fresh fruits and milk were provided daily. Psychologists provided psychological counseling for patients. The air was disinfected once daily with chorine-containing solutions. Domestic garbage was collected and burned by special personnel. Because patients might remain infectious after recovery, another four-story vacant dormitory building in the camp was used as an isolation area for recovered patients. Patients from the isolated treatment area and those who were hospitalized were sent to this area after recovery and continued to be isolated and monitored for 7 days.</p>
