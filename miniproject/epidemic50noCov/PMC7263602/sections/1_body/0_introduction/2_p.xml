<p>Many countries in the world have experienced adenovirus epidemics [

 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], especially outbreaks of adenovirus type 7, in densely populated settings, such as schools and military installations. These epidemics spread rapidly and affect a substantial portion of the population. Respiratory failure and even death may occur in severe cases [

 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In China, there have been numerous reports of adenovirus type 7 outbreaks in the military, especially among new recruits [
 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0232948.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These reports have mainly discussed clinical symptoms and etiology, thereby improving the understanding of the genetic characteristics of pathogens. However, studies describing the characteristics of adenovirus epidemics from the perspective of field and theoretical epidemiology are still lacking. Herein, we clearly describe the measures taken to control an adenovirus type 7 outbreak and quantitatively analyze indicators, such as incubation period, generation time, and basic reproduction number. This study not only accurately describes the epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak but also provides a valuable reference for people dealing with such outbreaks in the future.
