<p>For the first time, we have strived to be exhaustive in the assembly of contemporary data on SFTS occurrence, the eco-climatic and environmental factors. On top of that, we have applied new modelling approaches to maximize the predictive power of these data. In comparison with previous efforts to map the distribution of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the current modelling efforts had been remarkably improved by fitting with the most recent occurrence data and with the given complex covariates, e.g. the density of livestock and richness of mammals. These advantages enabled a better identification of at-risk areas by using environmental correlations that were determined in areas with intensive SFTS surveillance efforts.
