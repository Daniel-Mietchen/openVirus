<p>In recent years, tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPVs) have attracted much attention because of their increasing incidence. In addition to SFTSV and HRTV which had severely threatened human health, other novel TBPV continued to be identified and isolated from ticks, such as Guertu virus (GTV) from 
 <italic>Dermacentor nuttalli</italic> ticks in Xinjiang Province, China [
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and Hunter island group virus (HIGV) isolated from ticks in Australia [
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In addition to SFTSV, 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> also transmits 
 <italic>Bartonella</italic>, 
 <italic>Ehrlichia</italic>, 
 <italic>Anaplasma</italic>, 
 <italic>Borrelia</italic> spp., which cause human infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The current model developed for 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> and SFTS prediction could lend useful strategy for other TBPVs and other tick borne agents with similar ecological niche.
