<p>When two models were considered together, eight significant variables overlapped for predicting both the distribution of the 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> and SFTS cases, including elevation, precipitation of warmest quarter, annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range of temperature, livestock density, mammalian richness, population density and rainfed croplands, although different relative contributions of them were found in restraining their distributions. These factors are generally reflective of the environments where wild and/or domestic animal hosts exist and enable tick survival, virus circulation and adequate exposure of human hosts to the virus [
