<p>Limitations of this study are needed to be recognized that are relevant to the interpretation of the results. First, because of the inaccuracies in human case report data, especially in the low-risk region, the lack of valid diagnosis methods and low vigilance to the disease of the local public health were responsible for the underestimation of the human cases, which might lead to the misclassification of the regions with or without risk of SFTS occurrence. Second, some potential determinants of the human SFTSV infections were not included in our BRT model due to the lacking of data. This included but not limited to density of the main vector tick (
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic>), the infection rate of SFTSV in 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> and animal hosts, which would inevitably result in a bias in the risk evaluation. All these limitations called for a further systematic epidemiological study that fully consider the complex interaction between SFTSV, the competent transmission tick species, their hosts, and the habitat environment after obtaining a continuous and evenly sampling and detection of SFTSV by field researches. Still, this study represented the first mapping of the potential-risk areas of SFTS occurrence at the global level. The high resolution risk maps provided an evidence base to prioritize areas for targeting risk zones, where public health authorities should be most vigilant for potential spread or importation events, and advocate intensive surveillance on 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> population and the situation of SFTSV infection.
