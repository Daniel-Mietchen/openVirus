<p>The predictive map for occurrence of SFTS was created, demonstrating the highest-risk areas located in the east-central China, in most parts of the Korean peninsula and southern Japan, additionally at the coastal areas in northern and limited region in the southern New Zealand (

 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). The overall predictive performance is satisfactory with AUCs of 0.976, 95% CI: 0.975–0.977 for the training datasets and 0.893, 95% CI: 0.889–0.897 for the testing datasets respectively. The goodness of fit of the BRT models was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, showing a decent risk discrimination between counties with and without SFTS cases (median of

To avoid overconfidence in the model, we also performed a sensitivity analysis by using sampling at the county level, namely the controls were set as the no-case-reporting-counties within 25 provinces that reported SFTS cases in China. The ROC and the AUC’s are similar to our current model that samples the whole country (the estimated AUC value of 0.971, 95%CI: 0.965–0.978). The model-predicted risk probability of SFTS presence was further validated by using the reported data in three SFTS-affected countries, Japan, South Korea and Vietnam. The results showed effective for discriminating the actual affected and unaffected areas (
