<p>According to the BRT models created by using the distribution of SFTS cases in China, 8 significant variables with RCs greater than 5% were shown to be important drivers for the presence of SFTS cases, including elevation, predicted probability of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> presence, annual mean temperature, precipitation of warmest quarter, percentage of water bodies, mammalian richness, precipitation of coldest quarter, mean diurnal range of temperature, with descending order for their effect size (
 <xref rid="T0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Among the significant contributors, elevation had the highest RC of about 17.3%, with a negative effect on the SFTS presence, for example, a higher risk of the disease presence was seen in regions where the average elevation was less than 1000 m (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). Higher risk of SFTS presence was positively associated with the model-predicted probability of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> occurrence, with RC as high as 11.8%. Two temperature-related factors contributed to the risk of SFTS presence with quadratic effect, for example, a higher risk was related to the annual mean temperature between 5°C and 15°C and the mean diurnal range between 8°C and 11°C. Two precipitation-related factors were positively associated with higher risk of SFTS presence, including precipitation in the warmest quarter and driest month. The richness of mammals was positively related to the risk of SFTS presence in regions hosting &lt;20 mammals species, while negatively related to the SFTS risk in regions hosting ≥20 mammals species. The percentage coverage of water bodies had a quadratic effect on the risk of SFTS presence. There were other seven variables which contributed to the presence of SFTS cases with moderate effects, including the percentage coverage of irrigated croplands, other forests, needleleaved forests and broadleaved forests, together with precipitation of driest month, livestock density and population density with all their RCs ranging from 2% to 5% (
