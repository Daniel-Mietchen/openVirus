<p>A thematic map was created to display the geographic dispersion dynamics of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> on the global range (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). The 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> tick was first reported in central China and eastern Russia in 1891, subsequently recorded from New Zealand and Japan in 1910s, from South Korea, and Australia in 1960s, with the most recent report in 2010s that was observed in the USA. Based on the data of all observed locations of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> presence, the global environmental suitability for 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> was determined by 10 global variables, with each of their relative contribution (RC) ≥1% to the established ENM model. Among which the precipitation of warmest quarter was the leading factor that contributed to the probability of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> presence, with the greatest RC of nearly 33%, followed by annual mean temperature, density of population, and density of livestock, with all their RCs exceeding 5% (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Other six variables, including mammalian richness, herbaceous vegetation of closed to open type, mean diurnal range of temperature, rainfed croplands, elevation, broadleaved deciduous forest of closed type, contributed moderately to the probability of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> presence with their RCs ranging between 1 and 3 (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The model has shown decent predictive power, yielding a mean area under curve (AUC) being 0.967 ± 0.001 (Supplementary Figure S1). The exact associations between the probability of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> presence and the four main drivers with RC ≥5% were shown in Supplementary Figure S2.
