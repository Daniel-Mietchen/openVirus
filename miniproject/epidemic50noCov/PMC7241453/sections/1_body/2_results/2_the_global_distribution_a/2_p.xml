<p>Based on the ENM-predicted probability, global distribution of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> presence was mapped (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B). The potential habitat suitable for this vector tick were significantly wider than the already reported areas, mainly distributed in the eastern and central China, the southeast Russia that bordered China and North Korea, the whole country of North Korea, South Korea and Japan, the eastern coastal areas of Australia, the southwestern coastal and northern regions of New Zealand and several Oceania countries/regions. It is notable that a range of areas in the eastern and central USA were also highly suitable for the 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> ticks propagation, significantly wider than the already reported areas. In addition, the southeastern and southwestern coastal areas of South America, southern Europe, the southeastern coastal areas of Africa and Madagascar, and the northern area of western Asia also showed a high environmentally suitability for 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> tick.
