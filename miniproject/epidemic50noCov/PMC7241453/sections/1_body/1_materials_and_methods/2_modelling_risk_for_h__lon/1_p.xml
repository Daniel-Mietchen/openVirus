<p>Each occurrence record of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> was geo-referenced and linked to the digital world map according to its coordinates using Geographic Information System (GIS) technologies. Machine learning method with ecological niche (EN) model was applied at the 0.1° × 0.1°grid level to correlate the global observed locations of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> and 51 selected eco-geographical and climatic variables (Supplementary Table S1). The grid locations with the occurrence of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> were used in the model. Ten thousand grids were randomly selected from all grids without the presence of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> as control points for the model. The variables were first grouped according to the subject (e.g. eco-climatic, land cover), and then multicollinearity was screened for each group and only one variable was chosen as the proxy of highly correlated variables (correlation coefficient ≥0.7) to be used for model-fitting (Supplementary Tables S2–S4). The variables whose contribution was less than 1% were removed from the ecological niche (EN) model (Supplementary Table S5). Ultimately, 10 variables were identified for the EN model after the variable selection, including elevation, three eco-climatic variables, three land cover types, population density, livestock density, and mammalian richness. In this study, the maximum entropy method (Maxent) was used [

 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and the model-predicted probabilities of the 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> presence were mapped to display the potential habitat suitable for this vector tick around the world [
