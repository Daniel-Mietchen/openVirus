<p>A boosted regression tree (BRT) approach was used to establish a multivariate empirical relationship between the probability of SFTS presence and the eco-geographic and environmental conditions at the county level (GADM database, version 2.8) as had been widely used for assessing risk of infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37–39</xref>]. The “case–control” design at the county level was used for the analysis, briefly, all counties with SFTS cases were used as “case units,” and a three-fold sampling of 1116 counties without SFTS cases were randomly chosen as “control units,” where all units were limited to China. When considering the inclusion of variable types, we simplified and integrated the specific land cover types, and the other variables included bio-climatic, population and livestock density, mammalian richness and elevation, predicted probability of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> presence (Supplementary Table S1). We adopted the same variable selection method as the EN model, accounting for non-linear association and interactions between covariates (Supplementary Table S2, Table S4 and Table S6), the variables whose contribution was less than 1% were eliminated to screen out the high-efficiency predictive variables (Supplementary Table S7). Finally, for each county, altogether 18 independent variables were considered in the model, which included 5 bioclimatic variables determined from 1950 to 2000, density of population, elevation, percentage coverages of land cover (irrigated croplands, rainfed croplands, needleleaved forests, broadleaved forests, other forests, grassland, build-up land and water bodies), the density of livestock, mammalian richness, predicted probability of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> presence which was extracted from the ecological niche model. A bootstrapping procedure was conducted for the BRT models to generate robust estimates of predicted probability, based on which the mean transmission risk of SFTS around the world was predicted (Supplementary Methods). The BRT models were also validated to be effective for discriminating the actual affected and unaffected areas by using the data in three SFTS-reporting countries outside China, i.e. Japan, South Korea and Vietnam.
