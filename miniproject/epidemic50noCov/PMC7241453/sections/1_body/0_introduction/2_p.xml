<p>In this study, we adopted a two-step strategy to predict the potential distribution of SFTS. For the first modelling step, the global distribution of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> was predicted based on data regarding the known locations of its occurrences by using the ecological niche (EN) modelling approach, which has been widely used in modelling species distribution when only presence data is available for prediction [

 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. At second step, potential hotspots of human SFTS occurrence in the world were predicted, by establishing a decent boosted regression tree (BRT) model that used SFTS infection data in China and a range of environmental, climate and biological covariates. BRT model has been widely applied in modelling risk for infectious disease, e.g. avian influenza A (H7N9) and ZIKV disease etc., because it performs well in predicting distributions of organisms while accounting for non-linear relationships and interactions between the risk and covariates [

This information might offer epidemiologists, parasitologists and veterinaries about potential spread of SFTSV, thus to attain a targeted surveillance in predicted risk areas, and lay foundation for understanding other tick-borne pathogens dispersion across continents.
