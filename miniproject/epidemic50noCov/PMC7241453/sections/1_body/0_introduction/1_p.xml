<p>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by a novel bunyavirus (SFTSV), with a wide clinical spectrum, ranging from mild febrile disease accompanied by thrombocytopenia and/or leukocytopenia to severe hemorrhagic fever, clinical encephalitis or multiple organ failure, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 12‒50% [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The disease was first identified in China in 2009 but retrospectively traced back to human cases in 2007 [
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. South Korea and Japan both reported their first cases in 2013, and were traced retrospectively to 2010 in South Korea [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>]. Tick-to-human transmission is the primary route by which people are infected with SFTSV, and 
 <italic>Haemaphysalis longicornis</italic> (
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic>) ticks act as the main transmission vector [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8–10</xref>]. 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic> is native to East Asia and has established populations in the Australasian and Western Pacific Regions [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11–13</xref>]. Very recently, this tick species has been reported in the United States, first observed to infest the sheep in New Jersey and then identified in seven states and the suburb of New York City [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The recent disease reports in wider Asia range [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], together with the trans-regional dispersion of the competent vector further warned a high possibility of increasing epidemic of SFTS in the future. The most recent efforts to identify populations at risk have been proposed based on the distribution of 
 <italic>H. longicornis</italic>, however lacking model-based prediction and not at international level, thus the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of the disease in the worldwide range warranted intense investigation.
