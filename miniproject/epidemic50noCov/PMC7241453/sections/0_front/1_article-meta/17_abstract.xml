 <p>Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease with increasing spread. Currently SFTS transmission has expanded beyond Asian countries, however, with definitive global extents and risk patterns remained obscure. Here we established an exhaustive database that included globally reported locations of human SFTS cases and the competent vector, 
  <italic>Haemaphysalis longicornis</italic> (
  <italic>H. longicornis</italic>), as well as the explanatory environmental variables, based on which, the potential geographic range of 
  <italic>H. longicornis</italic> and risk areas for SFTS were mapped by applying two machine learning methods. Ten predictors were identified contributing to global distribution for 
  <italic>H. longicornis</italic> with relative contribution ≥1%. Outside contemporary known distribution, we predict high receptivity to 
  <italic>H. longicornis</italic> across two continents, including northeastern USA, New Zealand, parts of Australia, and several Pacific islands. Eight key drivers of SFTS cases occurrence were identified, including elevation, predicted probability of 
  <italic>H. longicornis</italic> presence, two temperature-related factors, two precipitation-related factors, the richness of mammals and percentage coverage of water bodies. The globally model-predicted risk map of human SFTS occurrence was created and validated effective for discriminating the actual affected and unaffected areas (median predictive probability 0.74 vs. 0.04, 
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in three countries with reported cases outside China. The high-risk areas (probability ≥50%) were predicted mainly in east-central China, most parts of the Korean peninsula and southern Japan, and northern New Zealand. Our findings highlight areas where an intensive vigilance for potential SFTS spread or invasion events should be advocated, owing to their high receptibility to 
  <italic>H. longicornis</italic> distribution.
