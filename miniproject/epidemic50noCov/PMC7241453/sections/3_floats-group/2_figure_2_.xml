  <p>Global recorded locations and model-predicted distribution probability of 
   <italic>H. longicornis</italic>. (A) Each occurrence record of 
   <italic>H. longicornis</italic> was geo-referenced and linked to the digital world map. The recording time of the 
   <italic>H. longicornis</italic> presence was marked by colour gradients from red to green. (B) The potential geographic range of 
   <italic>H. longicornis</italic> was predicted and mapped by using a maximum entropy method based on eco-geographical and climatic variables.
