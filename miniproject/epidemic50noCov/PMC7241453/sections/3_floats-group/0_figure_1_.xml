  <p>The globally spatial and seasonal distributions of SFTS during 2010–2018. (A) The average annual incidence and the number of SFTS cases were indicated at the provincial level. (B) The seasonality is presented as a radar diagram for each of three mainly affected countries by SFTS, including China, Japan and South Korea.
