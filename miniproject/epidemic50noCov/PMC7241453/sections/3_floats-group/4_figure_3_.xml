  <p>ROC curves for the risk probability of SFTS transmission based on climatic, eco-geographical and social variables by using BRT models. (A) The red curves are average predicted lines for risk factors by 100 repeats (grey lines) based on the bootstrapping procedure. (B) The grey lines are the ROC curve for 100 repeats, and the red, blue and black lines indicate the average ROC curves of 100 repeats based on the bootstrapping procedure for the train set, test set and prediction, respectively.</p>
