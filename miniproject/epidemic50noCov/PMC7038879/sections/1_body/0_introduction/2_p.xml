<p>HIV “treatment as prevention” captivated the HIV field over a decade ago. When antiretroviral therapy (ART) was shown to be associated with the secondary benefit of HIV transmission reduction between sexual partners in observational studies, treatment as prevention emerged as a new and unchartered strategy

In 2009, Granich and colleagues modelled reductions in HIV incidence, reductions in death, and cost savings over the long‐term under a variety of conditions of HIV testing and treatment using South Africa epidemiological and demographic parameters

Their model predicted that annual population testing coupled with expanded eligibility for ART would dramatically reduce new HIV infections within ten years compared to the current country standard. Proponents applauded this model as a novel and very promising approach to HIV epidemic control. Critics challenged the relevance of the model, doubting in particular the feasibility and cost of universal and repeated HIV testing and overly optimistic assumptions about linkage to care and universal treatment uptake and its effect on HIV transmission

At that time, the momentum to study population‐level treatment as prevention grew and four large population‐based randomized trials of universal test and treat (UTT) were launched in sub‐Saharan Africa (SSA). The primary outcomes of these four trials (BCPP/YaTsie, HPTN 071/PopART, SEARCH and ANRS 12249/TasP) have now been published
