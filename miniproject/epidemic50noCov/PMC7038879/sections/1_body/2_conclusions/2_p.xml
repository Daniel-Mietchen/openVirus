<p>These trials demonstrate that UTT with universal testing, robust linkage and access to ART care can rapidly achieve high population‐level viral suppression leading to significant reductions in HIV incidence and mortality, and can do so more effectively than contemporary approaches in SSA. Universal testing is not current policy, even in SSA countries with generalized epidemics, and HIV testing remains focused on more targeted strategies aiming to reach key populations. We propose that a UTT package tailored to epidemic context be implemented at a sub‐country level in geographic areas where there is high HIV prevalence and a substantive proportion of people living with HIV with unsuppressed levels of HIV RNA. Design and delivery of the UTT package can draw insights from these UTT studies, and we suggest additional evidence‐based prevention measures should be integrated to further accelerate the path to ending the HIV epidemic.</p>
