<p>In all four UTT studies, over 90% of persons living with HIV were aware of their status by study end, illustrating that rapidly achieving the UNAIDS “first 90” target is achievable (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225455-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Baseline knowledge of HIV status spanned from 57% (HPTN 071) to 87% (BCPP). Large absolute increases in the “first 90” were achieved in HPTN 071 and SEARCH. Increases in the BCPP and TasP studies were smaller but equally impressive, as in these communities, HIV testing sites were well established when trials began—and population‐level gains thus required reaching persons less engaged in existing health services, such as men and youth.
