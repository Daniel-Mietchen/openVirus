<p>At baseline in all studies, high percentages of persons who were in care on ART had viral suppression (UNAIDS “third 90”), (Figure

One of the concerns raised by critics of the UTT intervention when the studies were initiated was that persons with high CD4+ cell count who were asymptomatic would have poor retention and hence poor viral suppression – resulting in an overall lower “third 90”

However, this concern was not realized: by the end of the studies, viral suppression rates for ART‐treated individuals were ≥87% across the studies. In the BCPP trial, 97% of persons in the measurement cohort in the intervention arm had viral suppression at study end, reflecting highly successful engagement in HIV care
