<p>An underlying premise of the UTT studies was that the intervention package needed to encompass all steps in the HIV care cascade in order to increase population‐level viral suppression sufficiently to impact HIV transmission and mortality. Population‐level viral suppression ranged from 23% (TasP) to 70% (BCPP) at study start. Population‐level suppression increased in the intervention arms during all of the studies and at study close, exceeded the UNAIDS 2020 target of 73% in three of the four studies (Figure
