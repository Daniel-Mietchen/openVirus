<p>The extraordinary increases in population‐level viral suppression were achieved over a very short period of time. Testing and linkage were critical to this success because viral suppression among those already on ART was high at baseline. Population‐level viral suppression increases were attained both from baselines of less than 57% (SEARCH and HPTN 071) and above 70% (BCPP). Consistent with other African cohort studies, viral suppression among youth was lower than among older adults

Prior cohort studies report a marked disparity in men's engagement in HIV testing and care in Africa due to a wide range of individual, structural and societal barriers. The UTT approach reached and quite successfully engaged men
