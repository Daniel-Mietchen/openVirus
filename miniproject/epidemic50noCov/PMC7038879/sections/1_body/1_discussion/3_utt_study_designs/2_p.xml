<p>These “first generation” UTT trials all randomized communities and evaluated multiple interventions that integrated HIV testing, prevention and treatment. The studies were conducted in southern and eastern Africa across a broad range of settings from rural to urban. Study follow‐up was relatively short – approximately three years in all studies. The studies took place during a dynamic period of UNAIDS global campaigns and changes in World Health Organization (WHO) ART guidelines. In 2014, UNAIDS launched the 90‐90‐90 campaign, calling for countries to reach targets of 90% for knowledge of HIV status, ART start and viral suppression

All UTT control communities promptly adopted expanded ART eligibility (2013 WHO guidelines); universal ART eligibility (2015 WHO guidelines) was initiated in the control arms in all studies but TasP, as South Africa guidelines did not change until the very end of the study. These changes meant that the anticipated differences between ART uptake in control and intervention arms were diminished, although arguably, the amended control arm with broadened ART eligibility was the relevant comparison.
