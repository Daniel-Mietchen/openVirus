<p>As universal treatment is now the global standard, arguments against UTT are mainly that the upfront cost of population‐level universal testing is too high, and that the yield of testing will be low. The yield of HIV testing will be indeed higher and testing costs will be lower with targeted testing approaches (at‐risk groups, partner notification) versus universal testing. However, models for HIV epidemic control show that limiting HIV testing exclusively to high‐risk groups is neither the fastest nor most effective strategy, particularly in generalized epidemics, because this approach misses the majority of persons with unknown HIV status 
 <xref rid="jia225455-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>. For example, in Zimbabwe, over 70% of persons with unknown status are men and women not classified into “high risk” groups. Moreover the “costs” of testing need to be considered in the context of the opportunity to offer multi‐disease prevention and treatment services on a path to universal health coverage.
