<p>We now have solid evidence that in SSA, UTT is feasible in a variety of public health–funded settings and can rapidly achieve high levels of viral suppression and reduce HIV incidence and deaths faster than the status quo. Importantly, all UTT trials evaluated testing strategies designed to be feasible for implementation at scale; while some cost effectiveness analyses are currently underway, those published shows costs in line with alternative approaches, and support the cost effectiveness of a UTT approach

The full potential of UTT is likely to be even greater with widespread implementation (hence blunting of migration effects) and with the addition of pre‐exposure prophylaxis and other up and coming prevention modalities that also require HIV testing. Finally, as more and more countries move towards an integrated universal health approach, a multi‐disease UTT approach could increase efficiencies and enhance gains for broader health outcomes
