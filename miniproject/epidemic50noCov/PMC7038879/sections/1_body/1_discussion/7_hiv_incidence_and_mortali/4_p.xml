<p>HIV‐associated mortality must be assessed by comprehensive vital status assessment and only one trial has released such information so far. Mortality was reduced by 23% in the intervention versus control communities in SEARCH. The mortality difference in SEARCH was most prominent in men HIV+ at study baseline with CD4+ cells &lt;350/mm

Mobilization of men and rapid ART start via multi‐disease community testing of those who were asymptomatic but had low CD4 and were at high risk for disease progression and death is one explanation consistent with these data. The opportunity of finding persons living with HIV with low CD4 before they develop clinical symptoms and appear at health facilities as “late presenters” is an overlooked benefit of universal testing coupled with rapid ART start. Indeed, a 23% reduction in mortality in such a short time period could have positive profound effects on mortality in the path to HIV epidemic control.
