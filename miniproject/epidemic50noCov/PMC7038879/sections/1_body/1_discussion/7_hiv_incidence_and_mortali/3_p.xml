<p>The estimates of the effect of UTT on incidence were likely underestimated across the four studies for several reasons. First, in randomized comparisons of HIV incidence within each study, ART eligibility expanded in control arms early in all studies. Second, the intervention effect was likely diluted by in‐and‐out migrations, which would have less of an effect if UTT were implemented in broader geographic regions, although mobile populations face unique challenges for HIV testing and long‐term care

Third, even for interventions with profound impacts on HIV incidence over the longer term, one expects only modest reductions during the first three years the intervention is delivered, considering that increasing viral suppression requires HIV testing, ART start and months to achieve viral suppression. HPTN 071 modelling work illustrates increasing gains in incidence reduction over time with UTT
