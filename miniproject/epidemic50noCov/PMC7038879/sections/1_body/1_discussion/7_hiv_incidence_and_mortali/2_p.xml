<p>In BCPP and HPTN 071 (when the two intervention arms were combined in a post hoc analysis), annual HIV incidence was 20% to 31% lower in the intervention versus control communities after three years (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225455-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The dissonant finding that HIV incidence in one of the HPTN 071 intervention arms did not differ significantly from the control is unexplained, but may be a result of individual community characteristics. The SEARCH study, which conducted universal testing in both arms and rapid ART eligibility expansion in control communities, did not detect a difference in the primary endpoint of cumulative three‐year HIV incidence between intervention and control arms. Annual HIV incidence in SEARCH did decrease by 32% between the first and third years of the study in the intervention arm; further, cumulative HIV incidence was approximately 27% lower than a modelled control arm that did not have universal baseline testing

No difference in cumulative HIV incidence was detected between the two arms of TasP, where universal testing was done in both arms and population‐level suppression increased similarly in both arms over an average of two‐year follow‐up. Annual incidence was not measured. Putting these trial results together –HIV incidence decreased over a very short time when universal testing, robust linkage, and ART start were deployed.
