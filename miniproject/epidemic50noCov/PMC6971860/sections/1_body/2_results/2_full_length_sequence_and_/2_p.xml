<p id="Par26">Amino acid analysis of 72 viruses revealed considerable amino acid alterations throughout the complete coding region. Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S2 lists the amino acid replacements found in 10 regions. The analysis results indicated 157 amino acid substitutions between 72 DENV-1 strains and 8 reference strains (as shown by the genetic variant analysis). Of these mutations, the comparison result reported that 72 DENV-1 viruses showed several amino acid replacements appearing in all coding regions, in which the majority of mutations appeared in a small number of population (1–6 of 72 viruses). However, several amino acid alterations were found in a large number of strains such as the position 48 (11A/61 T), 125 (25 M/47I) of PrM region, position 54 (16 N/56D) of E region, position 147 (13 T/59A) of NS1, position 45 (9 T/63A), 67 (32G/40G), 126 (33Y/39H), 154 (12I/60 V) of NS2A, position 94 (32A/40 T) of NS2B, position 298 (13 M/59 V) of NS3, position 16 (11 L/61 M), 47 (16R/56 K), 68 (21 V/51 M) of NS4A, position 166 (13R/59 K), 167 (16Y/56H), 337 (4A/19 V/49I), 609 (12A/60 V), 614 (13G/59E), 821 (32 T/40A) of NS5. In addition, the results showed that some DENV-1 strains possessed multiple amino acid substitutions. The comparison results indicated that the amino acid sequences of 72 strains differed significantly from the DENV1 strain that caused epidemics in Vietnam in 2005, but were very similar to the pandemic strains in the year 2007 and 2008. The similarities also disappeared with the strains that circulated in Cambodia and Thailand.
