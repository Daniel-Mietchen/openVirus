<p id="Par33">Studies on the genetic evolution of DENV shows that the average mutation rate of DENV is approximately 7.5 × 10
 <sup>− 4</sup> mutations/position/year, this mutation speed compared to the other RNA viruses is relatively high, it is only slower than the HIV and influenza viruses. In nature, DENV exists in two forms, sylvatic and urban. Studies on the genetic evolution of these two forms show that the mutation rate during the urban cycle (dengue causes disease in humans) is faster than sylvatic cycle, and this is also consistent with the level of circulation and virus replication rate in dengue outbreaks worldwide. Not surprisingly, there were many mutations that occurred in the genome of the DENV that caused outbreak in 2017.
