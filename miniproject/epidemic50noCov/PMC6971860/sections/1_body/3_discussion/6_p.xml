<p id="Par35">Analysis of the genetic evolution of DENV1 viruses in Vietnam in 2017 with DENV1 strains causing outbreak in Vietnam and around the world previously showed complicated genetic variations. This is probably one of the main causes leading to the unusual dengue outbreak in Vietnam and other countries in the dengue endemic area.. Therefore, in order to clarify the impact of the amino acid mutation in the viral genome related to clinical severity in humans, further studies are needed to determine their role.</p>
