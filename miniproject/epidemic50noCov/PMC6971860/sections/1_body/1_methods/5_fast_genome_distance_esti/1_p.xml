<p id="Par22">Genetic similarities between 72 DENV-1 sequences and 47 reference sequences (the references selection were based on close geographical distance and far geographical distance from Vietnam) were calculated using the MASH 2.0 method in the following two steps: The first step was to create a sketch. For group 1 that consisted of 72 samples of this study, each sequence was cut into short sequences (k-mer) of 20 bp and assigned a random identifier (also known as a hash). Subsequently, MASH selected a set of 1000 k-mer groups (equivalent to 1000 hash groups) that represented the entire genetic sequence of each virus. Thus, the first sketch file included 72 k-mer sets. The above procedure was repeated with group 2 of 47 reference samples to create a second sketch file. The second step included calculating the distance between gene sequences. Once two sketch files were generated, the software compared the set of 1000 hash groups of each sample in group 1 with a set of 1000 hash groups of each sample in group 2. The distance ≤0.5 correlates to average nucleotide identity (ANI) ≥ 95%, whereas the ANI is an indicator of genome similarity at the nucleotide level between the coding regions of two genomes.</p>
