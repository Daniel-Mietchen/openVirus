<p>BRT models rely on decision trees and gradient boosting. With regression trees, a recursive binary split of data is carried out until a stopping criterion is reached [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Used alone for analysis, regression trees are susceptible to bias and inaccuracy. The gradient boosting applies randomness into the stage-wise fitting, which by introducing stochasticity helps to avoid overfitting of the model to the data (Supplementary Methods).
