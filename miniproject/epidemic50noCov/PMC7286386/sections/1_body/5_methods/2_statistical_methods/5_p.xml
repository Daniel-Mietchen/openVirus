<p>We simplified the BRT model by excluding noninformative predictors with minimal effect on prediction [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The relative influence (RI) of a predictor is the number of times the predictor is selected to discriminate outcomes (death/survival) and the improvement in the model for each selection, which is based on the amount of residuals explained at each selection [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These RIs are scaled to sum to 100, and higher influences indicate greater effects on survival outcome. The model was repeatedly refitted, each time removing the predictor with the lowest RI. We applied a default rule that continued to remove predictors with the lowest RIs until the average change in predictive deviance exceeded the standard error of the full model (ie, model using all candidate predictors) [
