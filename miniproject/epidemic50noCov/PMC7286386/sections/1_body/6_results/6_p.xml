<p>Fever, anorexia, difficult breathing, and fatigue are the clinical predictors in the minimal model (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The unadjusted CFR estimates were 69.3% (95% CI, 50.7–78.2%) and 82.1% (95% CI, 67.1–88.7%) for cases with fever and cases without fever, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The CFR estimates without imputation were 70.7% (95% CI, 68.6–72.7%) and 87.5% (95% CI, 84.6–90.3%) for cases with fever and cases without fever, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Fever, anorexia, difficult breathing, and fatigue together accounted for 4.7% of the RI of the minimal model, defined as the model using the 10 most influential predictors (district, hospitalization status, reporting delay, age, quarter, case classification, anorexia, difficult breathing, fatigue, and fever; see 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
