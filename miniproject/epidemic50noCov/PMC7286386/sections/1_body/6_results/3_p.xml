<p>District, hospitalization status, age, case classification, and date of case reporting aggregated at three-month intervals (thereafter defined as quarter) were the most important predictors, with average RIs of 41.7%, 28.9%, 10.7%, 10.1%, and 2.2%, respectively (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Unadjusted CFR estimates (ie, CFR estimates obtained with imputation not corrected for imperfect sensitivity and specificity) and CFR estimates without imputation initially decreased with age, with the lowest CFR estimates found in the 15- to 19-year age group, with CFRs of 57.3% (95% CI, 39.4–68.2%) and 57.2% (95% CI, 48.6–65.4%) unadjusted and without imputation, respectively (
