<p>Machine learning (ML) techniques are powerful alternatives to conventional statistical regression models [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In ML, less restrictive algorithms are used to learn the relationship between outcome and proposed predictors [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because of this flexibility, ML techniques are generally very effective in predicting outcomes at the individual level. Boosted regression trees (BRTs), a well-characterized ML technique, have been used in infectious disease modeling for data imputation [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The predictive performance of a BRT, its ability to identify influential predictors and interactions, and its ability to model nonlinear relationships make it an ideal technique to answer key questions in infectious disease epidemiology. For instance, Bhatt and colleagues [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] used BRTs to map the global distribution and burden of the dengue virus. Similarly, Dorigatti and colleagues [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] used BRTs to refine the efficacy estimate of the Sanofi Pasteur dengue vaccine CYDâ€“TDV (chimeric yellow fever virus-DENV tetravalent dengue vaccine), illustrating the effectiveness of BRTs in estimating the uncertainty around missing or unrecorded data. However, despite these attempts, ML models are still seldomly used in the analysis and modeling of infectious diseases.
