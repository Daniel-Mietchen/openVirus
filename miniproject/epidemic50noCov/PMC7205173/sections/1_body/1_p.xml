<p>Eye health workers are commonly faced with adenoviral infection of the eye as a cause of bilateral conjunctivitis. Adenoviral infection presents with sudden onset of red eye(s) with a watery discharge often associated with a sore throat. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial (including chlamydial) conjunctivitis, other viral causes of conjunctivitis and, possibly, allergic conjunctivitis. The virus is easily transmitted and there is no specific treatment.</p>
