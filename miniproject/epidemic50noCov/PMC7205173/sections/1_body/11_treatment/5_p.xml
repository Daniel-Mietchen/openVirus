<p>If there is sub-epithelial adenoviral keratitis, topical steroids can rapidly reduce or eliminate the subepithelial opacities, resulting in improved visual acuity. However, on cessation of the topical steroids the opacities usually recur; it is only with time that they will fade.

 </xref> The established side-effects of topical steroids – raised intraocular pressure and cataract formation – should be considered. However, it is reasonable to treat patients with significant pseudo-membranes or membranes with topical steroids, to reduce the chance of symblephara formation. In addition, patients with significantly reduced vision due to sub-epithelial opacities in the cornea, especially where it is limiting their daily activities, may benefit from treatment – provided they are counselled regarding the side-effects and the potential return of opacities when treatment is stopped.
