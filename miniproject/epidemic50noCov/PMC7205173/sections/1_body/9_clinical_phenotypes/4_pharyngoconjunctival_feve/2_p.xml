 </xref> An acute follicular conjunctivitis develops a few days into the symptomatic illness, with initial symptoms of irritation, burning and lacrimation. The conjunctivitis is usually worse in the lower fornix and can lead to a tender, swollen lower eyelid, occasionally with bruising that can mimic orbital trauma. Both eyes are usually involved, although there may be a delay of 1–3 days before the fellow eye becomes symptomatic (
