<p>This form of adenoviral conjunctivitis is caused by numerous adenovirus serotypes. However, it is a mild, self-limiting conjunctivitis commonly seen in children and young adults, which resolves within 7â€“10 days of symptom onset. Adenoviral conjunctivitis is characterised by soreness and lacrimation, with red conjunctiva and tarsal follicles; the cornea is not involved. The differential diagnosis includes chlamydial or herpes simplex acute follicular conjunctivitis.</p>
