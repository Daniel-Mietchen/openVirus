 </xref> Clinically, it presents as a relapsing and remitting prolonged course of intermittent conjunctival redness, lacrimation and photophobia. There will be a history of previous viral conjunctivitis within the last 6–9 months. It can be a challenge to diagnose as unlike the other types of adenoviral conjunctivitis, conjunctival papillae rather than follicles predominate. Diagnosis can be confirmed through laboratory investigations as discussed below.
