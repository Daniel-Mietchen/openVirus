  <p>Adenoviral conjunctivitis with conjunctival hyperaemia and significant pseudomembranes. Pseudomembranes can be distinguished from true membranes as they do not bleed when removed. Both forms of membranes must be gently removed by everting the eyelids and using either a cotton-tipped applicator or some sterile forceps to help prevent tarsal scarring and relieve discomfort.</p>
