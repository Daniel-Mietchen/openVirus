<p id="Par22">In the period of January 1999 to December 2016, high number of FMD outbreaks were reported in 1999 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 173 outbreaks), 2001 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 102), 2004 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 76) and 2012 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 85) while the lowest number of outbreaks were reported in 2006 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S2). The highest number of outbreaks were reported in the month of March (
 <italic>n</italic> = 109 across all years), which accounted for 17.14% of all reported outbreaks and the lowest in November (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21), accounting for 3.3% of all reported outbreaks (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). The monthly distribution of FMD outbreaks is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1. The decomposed FMD outbreak occurrence pattern shows a slight decrease in the number of monthly outbreaks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), which was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). The seasonality in the numbers of outbreaks was apparent as it can be seen in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Runs test for test of randomness indicates that the temporal distribution of FMD outbreaks was not random. Moreover, plotting of monthly indices of number of outbreaks shows higher frequency of outbreaks in the dry season months compared to other seasons, which demonstrates statistically significant seasonality of FMD outbreaks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The largest incidence was reported for March (about 1.63) and the lowest for August (about − 1.2), indicating that the number of FMD outbreaks peaked in March and became low in August (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Fig. S2). Generally, the number of FMD outbreaks was far above average from December to March and far below average from August to November (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).
