<p id="Par30">The trend of FMD outbreaks from January 1999 to December 2016 indicates a slight but statistically significant decrease over the period
 <bold>.</bold> The observed decrease in FMD outbreak occurrence in Amhara region in the recent years could be due to the effort made to ban unrestricted livestock grazing in the region that resulted in decreased free movement of animals. The possibility of decreasing outbreak reporting rate by the districts cannot also be ruled out. Therefore, it requires further study to conclude that the long-term trend of the disease is decreasing and to know the reason of the decreasing trend.
