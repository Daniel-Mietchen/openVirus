<p id="Par24">Unlike several previous FMD studies in the Amhara region, which were cross-sectional sero-prevalence studies, this is the first longitudinal study to report the spatial and temporal distribution of FMD outbreaks in the region. This study indicated that frequent FMD outbreaks occurred in Amhara region every year with 636 total outbreaks in 18 years. During this period, on average 35 FMD outbreaks were reported annually across the region demonstrating that FMD is endemic in the region. The highest outbreaks were reported in 1999 (n = 173) which is in agreement with Asfaw and Sintaro [
