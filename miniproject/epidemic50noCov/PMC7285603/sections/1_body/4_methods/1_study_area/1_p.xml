<p id="Par33">The study was conducted in Amhara region of Ethiopia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The Amhara region is located in the north western part of Ethiopia between 9°20′ and 14°20′ North latitude and 36° 20′ and 40° 20′ East longitude. The region covers approximately 161,828.4 km
 <sup>2</sup> area and is moderately compact in shape. It consists of three major agro-ecological zones. These are highlands (above 2300 m above sea level (masl)), mid-highlands (1500 to 2300 masl) and lowlands (below 1500 masl) accounting for 20, 44 and 28% of the land area respectively. A little over 50% of the total area of the region is considered potentially arable for agricultural production activities [
