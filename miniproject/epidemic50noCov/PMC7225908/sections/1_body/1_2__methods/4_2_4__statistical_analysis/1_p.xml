<p>The durations of patient delay in hospital visiting, i.e., 0-1 day, 2-3 days, 4–7 days, and &gt;7 days, were described as frequencies and percentages, and the differences across factors were further compared using nonparametric tests. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of these factors with the binary delayed hospital visiting were also estimated using multivariable logistic regression. The average number of daily disease onsets and reported cases on workdays and weekends were represented as the mean ± standard deviation, respectively.</p>
