<p>We documented the earliest date of occurrence of relevant symptoms based on patient self-reporting as date of disease onset. Date of patient visiting hospital was the date when the patient firstly visited the hospital. Report date referred to the date when diseases were reported through the online disease surveillance/prevention and control system. Delayed hospital visiting was defined by the durations between the patient visiting date and the disease onset date over one day. Epidemic season of HFMD was defined from April to July and from November to December of each year [

Similarly, the epidemic season for epidemic parotitis included April to July of each year and November to January of the following year, and the nonepidemic seasons included February to March and August to October of each year [

In addition, in the present study, the term “weekend” referred to both “natural weekend” and “nonnatural weekend” days, i.e., official festival or holiday break due to New Year's Day, Spring Festival, Qingming Festival, Labor Day, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and National Day in China. The holiday information was obtained from the “Notice on part of holiday arrangements” issued by the General Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China each year. The day before the statutory holiday was defined as “Friday,” and the first return work day after each holiday was defined as “Monday.” The daily average numbers of cases reported on weekend referred to days of Saturday and Sunday defined above.
