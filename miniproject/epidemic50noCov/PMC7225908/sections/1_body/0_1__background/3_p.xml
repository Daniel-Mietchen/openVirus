<p>Because the two infectious diseases discussed above mainly target on infants and school-aged children, the surveillance quality, timeliness, and completeness of routine surveillance have great implications for follow-up managements of cases and health departments to prevent the incidence and even outbreaks of these infectious diseases. Along with the improvement of the direct online reporting system, the time difference between the disease diagnosis and recording formation in the online report system, i.e., diagnosis to report, usually is within one day in China. However, the time difference between disease onset and diagnosis at hospitals, i.e., onset to diagnosis, is an emerging issue that compromised the timely report of infectious diseases on the online reporting system [

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Given that these two infectious diseases easily developed into outbreaks, we hypothesized the time difference between disease onset and diagnosis and the potential weekend effect of epidemic reporting are probably the primary issues that affect the quality of infectious disease surveillance.
