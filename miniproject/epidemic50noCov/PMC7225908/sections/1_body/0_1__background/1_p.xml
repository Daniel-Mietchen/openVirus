<p>Epidemic parotitis/mumps is an acute infectious disease of the respiratory tract and characterized by a highly recessive infection rate and long infectious durations [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Patients in the early stage or recessively infected individuals are not easily identified resulting in a source of infection and may easily cause outbreaks or epidemic in collective units, such as schools and childcare centers [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. China has included it in the disease surveillance information report management system since 2004 [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The reported incidence of epidemic parotitis between 2004 and 2010 in China fluctuated around 20/100,000 [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, in 2008 and 2009, epidemic parotitis outbreaks accounted for approximately 21% of all outburst epidemics of infectious diseases in China, which increased to 34% in 2010 and 2012 [

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, students and children are the targeted populations of epidemic parotitis [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], accounting for approximately 93% of all cases each year. Epidemic parotitis outbreaks in schools took up approximately 99% of all epidemic parotitis outbreaks. Since 2004, the incidence of epidemic parotitis in China has been highest among children &lt;15 years, which accounted for approximately 85% to 92% of all cases [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Among these children cases, the incidence was highest in children between 5 and 9 years, accounting for approximately 43% to 49% of all cases [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Key factors causing the constant epidemic include an insensitive surveillance system, improper implementation of relevant policies, and an inability to provide a timely diagnosis and reporting and effective quarantine for patients at the beginning of the disease onset [
