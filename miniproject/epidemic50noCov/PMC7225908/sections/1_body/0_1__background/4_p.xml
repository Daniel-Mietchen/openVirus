<p>Based on daily report data for HFMD and epidemic parotitis cases between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017, in Hanzhong, Shaanxi, China, we aimed at investigating the prevalence and influencing factors of patient delay in hospital visiting and the possibility of a weekend effect of disease surveillance. We also aimed at comparing the durations of delay in hospital visiting for these two diseases between epidemic and nonepidemic seasons, which would provide evidence for the improvement of the surveillance quality and the control of the spread of these two diseases among young children.</p>
