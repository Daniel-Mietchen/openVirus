<p>In the multivariable logistic models (
 <xref rid="tab4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), we found that the risks of delayed hospital visiting for HFMD in 2015, 2016, or 2017 were significantly higher as compared with that in 2014. The adjusted OR was 1.35 (95% CI: 1.23, 1.48), 1.16 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.27), and 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.27), respectively. Compared to children in childcare center, the risk of delayed hospital visiting increased by 41.2% (95% CI: 30.2%, 53.2%) and 32.2% (95% CI: 6.8%, 63.7%) among children who were not in childcare center and school students, respectively. We also found that the risk of occurring delayed hospital visiting in epidemic season was significantly lower than that in nonepidemic season with an adjusted OR of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.85).
