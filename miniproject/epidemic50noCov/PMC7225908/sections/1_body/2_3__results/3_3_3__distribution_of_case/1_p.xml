<p>No obvious pattern of disease onset time was identified for HFMD or epidemic parotitis, and no weekend effect was detected. In contrast, the reported numbers of HFMD and epidemic parotitis cases both showed weekly patterns either in the epidemic or in the nonepidemic season, which decreased from Monday to the weekend with uniformly lower numbers on weekends than that on Monday (Figures

Besides, the statistical tests to determine the difference of difference (DID) of reported and actual cases between weekend and weekday showed that the number of reported cases on weekends was uniformly and significantly lower than that of actual cases during weekdays. The mean (SD) of DID was 0.79 (3.27) for epidemic parotitis and 1.44 (3.31) for hand-foot-and-mouth disease on weekends, with corresponding
