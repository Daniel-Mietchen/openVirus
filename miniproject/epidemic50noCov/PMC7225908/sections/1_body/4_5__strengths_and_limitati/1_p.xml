<p>The surveillance data used in this study ensured the data quality and convincing results. However, this study has some limitations. First, we focused on the timing of the surveillance system but were unable to evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the surveillance data. As a result, the quality assessment of the entire surveillance system was not sufficiently thorough. Second, the data source did not allow us to examine the causes and/or consequences of the weekend effect that warrants further studies. Finally, we were unable to determine whether the disease was on outbreak that also may affect the quality assessment of the surveillance system.</p>
