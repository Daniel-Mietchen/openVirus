<p>Both the HFMD and epidemic parotitis were infectious diseases and included in Chinese statutory management. We found that the absolute number of mumps cases consistently increased along with years from 2014 to 2017, but we were not able to report the incidence rate. Su and the coauthors reported a steady incidence of mumps in China between 2004 and 2013 [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], surrounding around the rate of 22/100,000, and no national report after 2013 was identified. In the present study, 52.7% and 34.3% of the mumps cases were identified as school students and aged 5 to 10 and above 10 years old, respectively, which was similar to the national report [

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], suggesting the sound and reliable quality of data used. Of note, this epidemiological characteristic of age peak is different from that in other developed countries [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], where two-dose mumps vaccine has been routinely applied among children, which is usually outbreak among young adults. However, in China, the coverage of the second dose was relatively low, only 78.8% reported in some studies [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Besides, Liu and colleagues reported that waning immunity to mumps among infants who received one-dose vaccine during 18–24 months of age occurred with increasing age [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], resulting in the higher incidence rate in primary schools identified in the present study. These results suggest that improving the coverage of the second dose of vaccine should be prioritized to prevent mumps epidemics in China. Besides, the third dose may be also necessary given the reemergence among adults in developed countries [
