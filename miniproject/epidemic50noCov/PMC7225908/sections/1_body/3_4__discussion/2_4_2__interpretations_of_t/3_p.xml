<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to report that a fairly high percentage of patients had delays in hospital visiting for HFMD and mumps in China, as high as 43.1% for HFMD and 36.5% for epidemic parotitis, respectively. This delay in hospital visiting fails to make the timely notification to a local Center for Disease Control and Prevention, with extremely high probabilities of resulting in rapidly spreading within facilities and local outbreaks, even though majority of the cases had delayed durations of 2 to 3 days. Besides, the delay in hospital visiting and care at home might increase the risk of developing severe symptoms [

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In addition, we found that patients occurred in nonepidemic seasons were more likely to experience the delay in hospital visiting, which implied that caregivers were less alert and might ignore the mild symptoms at the early stage of these diseases during nonepidemic seasons. We also found that children taken care at home were more likely to have delays in hospital visiting as compared with those in childcare center, where the morning and noon infectious disease inspection system was implemented and the staff were trained for screening and identifying the early signs, which suggested the necessities of improving related knowledge among caregivers. In the present study, it was also worthy to note that the risks of delay in hospital visiting for epidemic parotitis increased by years, which might be due to the decreasing of cases with typical clinical manifestations in recent years, especially among vaccinated populations [

In contrast, the incidence of HFMD kept at a much higher level that caused high concerns of all parties and strengthened the knowledge on prevention and treatment. This hypothesis was also supported by the finding that the risk of occurring delays in hospital visiting for HFMD kept steady in recent years. Taken together, given the fact that majority of cases have mild symptoms and that caregivers lack necessary knowledge on signs and symptoms at the early stage of these diseases, these results suggest the emphasis on community surveillance, prevention, and control especially in nonepidemic seasons [
