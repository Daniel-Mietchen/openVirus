<p>Due to no routine vaccine for preventing HFMD [
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], much more HFMD cases than mumps were reported in the present study. The incidence of HMFD showed an increasing tendency in China from 2008 to 2017 [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but no corresponding increment of absolute case numbers was found in the present study. Again, we were not able to report the incidence rate which warranted further study and explanations. As was reported in the national report [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], the HFMD patients targeted on young infants aged less than 4â€‰years old, accounting for 88% of the total cases. This population characteristic also explained that majority of the cases were found among children not in childcare center. In China, the childcare center usually accepts the infants aged 3 years above. Consequently, the development of strategies and programs for preventing and controlling such diseases should target on parents and caregivers.
