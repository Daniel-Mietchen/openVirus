<p>In addition, we found that the online reports but not disease onset of cases showed a significant weekend effect for both HFMD and epidemic parotitis. Weekend effect is well noted in the context of hospital admissions of noncommunicable diseases such as emergency surgery and stroke, where patient has worse outcomes on weekend hospital admissions as compared with those on weekdays [
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Nevertheless, the weekend effect is less studied in the infectious disease area, with a slightly different meaning in the present study, which indicates that the number of cases not reported on weekends is significantly higher than that on weekdays. As discussed in the delaying of hospital visiting above, these cases miss to report may lead to the local outbreak and severe symptoms, which warrants notice of related organizations. In terms of causes of weekend effect, two primary domains were investigated and discussed in the literature studies [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], patients themselves (parents and caregivers in the context of our study) and health system. Amirov and colleagues also reported that Mondays and Fridays had the highest occurrence of outbreak reporting in healthcare facilities from Toronto, Canada [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and the authors concluded the health staff differences between weekend and weekdays as one of the causes. Although we were not able to determine the causes in the present study, health system might not be the factor in the causal link because we found that all cases were reported through the online disease surveillance system on the same day when patient visiting the hospital. Actually, to reduce deaths associated with the weekend effect, National Health Service in the UK implemented four priority clinical standards for a balanced seven-day hospital care. However, Meacock and Sutton did not find any significant changes in weekend mortality after three years' adoption of these clinical standards [

Besides, based on the data of unselected emergency admissions to four large Oxford hospitals between January 2006 and December 2014, Walker and colleagues adjusted for 15 common hematology and biochemistry test results not considered in other studies and found that these routine test results of patients substantially reduced excess mortality associated with emergency admission at weekends and public holidays [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Our finding that patients had delaying presenting to hospital visiting also indirectly supported this assumption. That said, a similar seven-day hospitalist program implemented in Taiwan showed potential for equaling the patient outcomes between weekday and weekend general medicine admissions, with a fairly smaller sample size of 861 [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Notwithstanding, from the perspective of health economy, Meacock and colleagues found that these programs were not cost-effective, i.e., the planned cost of implementing 7-day services substantially exceeding the maximum amount that the National Health Service in the UK expected to eradicate the weekend effect [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Arguably, given the current evidence, patient-level differences rather than reduced health system and/or staffing levels play the key role in the context of weekend effect and are worthy to further examine the underlying mechanisms. For example, children playing activities not at home may increase the chances of contacts and being infected over the weekends, which consequently leads to the disease onset and more cases at the beginning of the week, resulting in the data artefact, i.e., fewer cases reported on weekends.
