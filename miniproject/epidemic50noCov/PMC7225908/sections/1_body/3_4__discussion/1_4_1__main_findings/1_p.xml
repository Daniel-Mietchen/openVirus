<p>We found that 88.0% of HFMD cases were children younger than 5 years of age between 2014 and 2017. In contrast, the majority of the patients with epidemic parotitis were school students (63.8%), with children aged 5â€“10 years accounting for 52.7%. We also found that 43.1% of patients with HFMD and 36.5% of patients with epidemic parotitis had delays in hospital visiting in nonepidemic seasons, which was slightly reduced, but similar issue still identified in epidemic seasons. Majority of the durations of delaying hospital visiting lied within two to three days after disease onset. Besides, the risk of delays in hospital visiting for epidemic parotitis showed an increasing trend with the years. We did not identify the weekend effect on the time of disease onset for both the diseases above. However, we found an obvious weekend effect on the time of online reporting with the significantly lowest number of cases reported over the weekend and the highest reported on Monday, which resulted in a phenomenon of Monday jump in case reports.</p>
