  <result pre="Chinese statutory management. We found that the absolute number of" exact="mumps" post="cases consistently increased along with years from 2014 to"/>
  <result pre="rate. Su and the coauthors reported a steady incidence of" exact="mumps" post="in China between 2004 and 2013 [19], surrounding around"/>
  <result pre="identified. In the present study, 52.7% and 34.3% of the" exact="mumps" post="cases were identified as school students and aged 5"/>
  <result pre="different from that in other developed countries [21–24], where two-dose" exact="mumps" post="vaccine has been routinely applied among children, which is"/>
  <result pre="[25]. Besides, Liu and colleagues reported that waning immunity to" exact="mumps" post="among infants who received one-dose vaccine during 18–24 months"/>
  <result pre="the second dose of vaccine should be prioritized to prevent" exact="mumps" post="epidemics in China. Besides, the third dose may be"/>
  <result pre="vaccine for preventing HFMD [27], much more HFMD cases than" exact="mumps" post="were reported in the present study. The incidence of"/>
  <result pre="of patients had delays in hospital visiting for HFMD and" exact="mumps" post="in China, as high as 43.1% for HFMD and"/>
  <result pre="similar situation was also reported in other infectious diseases like" exact="tuberculosis" post="[29, 30]. In addition, we found that patients occurred"/>
  <result pre="with those in childcare center, where the morning and noon" exact="infectious disease" post="inspection system was implemented and the staff were trained"/>
  <result pre="that the risks of delay in hospital visiting for epidemic" exact="parotitis" post="increased by years, which might be due to the"/>
  <result pre="[34]. Nevertheless, the weekend effect is less studied in the" exact="infectious disease" post="area, with a slightly different meaning in the present"/>
  <result pre="system. 6. Conclusions The reported cases of HFMD and epidemic" exact="parotitis" post="had an obvious weekend effect, with an increasing tendency"/>
