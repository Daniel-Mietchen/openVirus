<p>In a rabbit ocular model to evaluate antiviral activity, neither 0.5% ketorolac nor 0.1% diclofenac demonstrated inhibitory activity on viral replication or the formation of subepithelial immune infiltrates. In contrast, 1% prednisolone acetate prolonged viral shedding. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the administration of prednisolone against sodium diclofenac both associated with ciprofloxacin compared to artificial tears on the symptoms and signs of acute viral conjunctivitis.</p>
