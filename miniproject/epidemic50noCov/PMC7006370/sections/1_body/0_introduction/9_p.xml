 </sup> . Ketorolac and indomethacin were more effective in decreasing conjunctival hyperemia, but burning, foreign--body sensations, and photophobia were unaffected. In a different randomized study of 117 patients, topical ketorolac 0.5% used four times daily was no better than artificial tears in relieving signs (conjunctival injection, chemosis, mucus, and lid edema) and symptoms (itching, foreign body sensation, tearing, redness, lid swelling, and overall discomfort) of viral conjunctivitis
