<p>Our study is affected by some limitations. First, model inputs of host population size and mobility are inferred from human data and mobility models, similarly to [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Lack of data characterizing hostsâ€™ spatial distribution and mobility is a central issue for epidemic models, especially in African countries, where also data on human movements are typically scarce [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. For this reason, well-established models of human mobility, such as e.g. the gravity model [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], are largely used in spatially explicit epidemic models for human diseases. Here, we use the same approach to model human-mediated movements of dogs from one settlement to another. Additional refinements to the gravity model can be made in future work (e.g. a refined dependence on the distance between settlements), if surveillance data from multiple locations (and not only from the capital city) become available. Although a direct comparison is limited by the differences in contexts, we find that our parsimonious choice of the gravity model provide projections for canine population moving daily on short, medium, and long-range movements that are close to the upper estimates resulting from a 2013 survey on human-mediated dog movements in the Philippines [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While lack of data remains a limitation, our modeling approach offers the theoretical framework where to evaluate the role that spatial fragmentation of human settlements in a particular geographical area may have on rabies persistence, based on expected human mobility flows. As such, it can be readily applied to other countries and different landscapes. This may additionally provide numerical evidence for context-specific elements favoring rabies dispersal (e.g. geography, natural barriers, etc.). Second, we did not consider rabies virus transmission from wildlife to domestic dogs, as dogs are recognized to be the main reservoir for rabies in sub-saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and dog-to-dog transmission is estimated to be approximately eight times as common as transmission between dogs and other carnivores [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Moreover, domestic dogs live mostly in human settlements where interactions with wildlife are sporadic. Indeed epidemiological cycles of the virus in non-flying wildlife mammals are geographically limited in Africa and, to our knowledge, not present in Central African Republic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Third, like other studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>], our model did not consider the role of density transmission of RABV and assume a homogeneously mixing dog population within each patch. Therefore, it neither accounts for the fine scale heterogeneities in dog densities nor for the network structure of dog-to-dog contacts within the patches [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref084" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The study of the role of contact patterns between dogs is still at its infancy, and additional empirical data are needed to infer synthetic models that can be applicable in space. Fourth, we did not consider possible importation events across the country borders. This may occur for instance in the north along the border with Chad, separating densely populated areas in both countries. Future work may further extend our framework to a larger region including several countries where rabies disease is endemic in the domestic dog population. Increasing evidence calls indeed for prolonged and sustained efforts that are concerted across different key stakeholders and countries in the region [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. By parameterizing the model to national contexts, including the spatial fragmentation of the host population and implemented interventions, and fitting it to available surveillance data, it would be possible to numerically investigate the impact of different degrees of cross-border mobility on rabies persistence, and provide novel fundamental understanding to guide the successful elimination of rabies in the region.
