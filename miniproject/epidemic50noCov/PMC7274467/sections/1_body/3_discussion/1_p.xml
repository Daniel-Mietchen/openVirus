<p>Controlling and eliminating rabies in domestic dogs through the implementation of strict control measures including dog mass vaccination campaigns is now considered as the most cost-effective measure to prevent rabies in humans [

Thousands of people however continue to die every year from rabies disease transmitted by infected dogs, and rabies remains endemic throughout the African continent. In most African countries rabies surveillance is possible only in capital cities, where external re-introductions of the disease are suggested to sustain persistence [

On the other hand, very little is generally known about how the transmission in rural and periurban areas can affect the epidemic in the cities. Understanding the key drivers for the endemic circulation of the virus on a large geographical area is thus essential to design improved interventions for a sustainable elimination of dog rabies. Focusing on Central African Republic where the virus has been endemic in the domestic dog population for more than 20 years [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], we introduce a spatially explicit model to simulate rabies transmission within both villages and urban areas and the spatial diffusion of the epidemic throughout the country led by human-mediated movements. Through numerical simulations, we can investigate the role of the various components acting on the infection dynamics at the population level.
