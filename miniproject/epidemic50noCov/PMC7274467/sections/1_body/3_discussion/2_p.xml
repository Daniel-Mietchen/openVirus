<p>First, we find that rabies would go extinct not only in the capital city alone, but also considering continuous re-introductions from the neighborhood of the city. This is in sharp contrast with previous expectations of the pattern of viral circulation proposed for Bangui [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which suggested that importations might occur from the peri-urban areas adjacent to the city [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our model predicts that longer range movements, connecting far-away settlements, are essential for rabies persistence. They allow occasional reintroductions of the disease sustaining its spatial spread.
