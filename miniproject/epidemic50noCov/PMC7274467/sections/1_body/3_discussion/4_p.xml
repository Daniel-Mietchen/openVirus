<p>Our model also allows to address the respective role of urban and rural areas and shows that both are important for disease persistence, but extinction is more likely in a network of connected rural patches (as if, for example, urban areas undergo massive vaccination). This seems to be unrelated to the density of dogs–as it is rather similar in urban and rural patches with few exceptions, leading to a predicted spatial epidemic not showing a marked degree of urbanization–and it is more likely associated with the overall larger dog population size localized in urban patches.</p>
