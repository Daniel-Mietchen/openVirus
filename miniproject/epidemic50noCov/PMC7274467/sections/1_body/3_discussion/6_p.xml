<p>Our modeling findings have significant implications for the control of canine rabies in Central African Republic. The predictions indicate that sustainable elimination of the disease will indeed require a substantial effort targeting a much larger geographical area than focusing exclusively on the capital city and its surrounding peri-urban settlements. To be effective, mass vaccination campaigns would require targeting the entire set of urban areas in the country (42% of the settlements), which may result to be unfeasible. Banning movements on the long range (associated to the smallest fluxes of dogs moved) may be very effective in supporting sustained and prolonged vaccination campaigns in the country.</p>
