<p>Finally, numerically obtained periodic patterns of infected dogs in time are compatible with observations in Bangui [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and in other African countries [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While we find a continuum spectrum of possible period durations that were not captured by surveillance data, this is likely due to the size effects of the limited observations (20 years) compared to the numerical extension of our simulations (&gt;300 years). Analysis of longer historical data, when available, can further validate our predictions.
