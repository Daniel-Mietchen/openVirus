<p>Settlements are mainly gathered in the center and western regions of the country, with very few urban areas in the eastern region where national parks and natural reserves are located. Most rural settlements (&gt;70%) have an estimated population size of less than 100 dogs, whereas the number of dogs in urban patches is rather heterogeneous, ranging from few tens up to the largest size constituted by the population in Bangui (almost 40,000 dogs,

While dog population sizes change considerably between rural and urban settlements, their density per squared km are predicted to be rather similar, except for few urban patches with an estimated density of &gt;150 dogs/km
