<p>Multiple scales of connectivity are predicted by the mobility model for human-mediated movements of dogs (

While long-range links are estimated to ensure the overall connectivity of the metapopulation, medium-range transports characterize mobility in the prefectures of Bangui and Ouham-Pend√© in the north-west. Short-range transports move the largest number of dogs (estimated average of 0.035% of the dog population per day,
