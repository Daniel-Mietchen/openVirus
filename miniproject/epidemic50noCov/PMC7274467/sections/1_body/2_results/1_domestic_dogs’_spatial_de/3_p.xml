<p>Given the country’s geography and population distribution, estimated human-mediated transport of dogs range from few kilometers for neighboring settlements to more than 1,000 km connecting far away locations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008317.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The most probable distance traveled is predicted to be approximately 300 km for long-range movements connecting two urban patches or urban and rural patches, and it is slightly bigger (~350 km) for connections between two rural settlements. The latter type of movements displays in addition two marked peaks. The first is estimated at around 100 km and corresponds to a high spatial concentration of close rural habitats such as around the capital city or in the Ouham-Pendé prefecture in the northwest of the country (
