<p>Rabies virus is predicted to remain endemic with high probability (≥80%) in Central African Republic for

 <sub>0</sub>. Birth rates smaller than ≈1 dog/year lead to considerably rare maintenance of the virus, and a rapid transition toward high probability is predicted for increasing birth rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008317.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). These findings are obtained parameterizing the infection dynamics with empirically estimated distributions of incubation and infectious periods. If instead we assume exponentially distributed disease stages, rabies virus would not be maintained in the domestic dog population, unless for higher values of the basic reproductive number (
