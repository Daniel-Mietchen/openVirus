<p>The map of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008317.g005">Fig 5A</xref> provides a spatial visualization of the simulated endemic situation for canine rabies in the country. Most of the prefectures are predicted to have an average prevalence in the 5–20% range, with the exception of the most eastern prefecture of Haut-Mbomou at lower prevalence, and the prefectures of Bangui, Ombella-M’Poko and Lobaye at higher prevalence. These last prefectures also contain the settlement with the highest proportion of rabid dogs, in both rural and urban patches. Prevalence is predicted to vary depending on the settlement type (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,
