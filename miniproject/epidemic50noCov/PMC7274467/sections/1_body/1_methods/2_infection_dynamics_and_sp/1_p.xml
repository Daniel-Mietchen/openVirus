<p>We model rabies virus transmission through mixing between individual hosts within the patches, and spatial dissemination through the explicit movements of discrete infected dogs between patches. Viral infection dynamics in dogs is described with a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) compartmental model [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], where hosts can be in one of the following states: susceptible (
 <italic>S</italic>), i.e. healthy individuals who may acquire the infection; exposed (
 <italic>E</italic>) hosts who have contracted the infection but do not shed the virus during an average incubation period 
 <italic>ε</italic>
 <sup>−1</sup>; infectious (
 <italic>I</italic>) hosts who can transmit the virus for an average infectious period 
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sup>−1</sup> following incubation; hosts removed (
 <italic>R</italic>) from the population as rabies is fatal once clinical symptoms appear [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008317.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Accounting for the behavioral changes induced by the disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], rabid dogs are assumed to be restricted to the patch in which they are located at symptoms onset, whereas exposed dogs can migrate to different locations while incubating the virus according to the defined mobility model. The metapopulation model is parameterized with the empirical distributions for the duration of the incubation and infectious periods obtained for rabies virus in African domestic dog population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To assess the role of the large fluctuations reported for the incubation period, we also consider another version of the compartmental model where disease progression occurs with constant rates, i.e. with exponentially distributed disease stages with the same average duration of incubation and infection, as done in [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We explore a range of values of the basic reproductive number (1.01≤
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>≤1.16) consistent with previous estimates [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Vital dynamics is considered in the model to account for dogs’ high fecundity rate leading to a renewal of susceptibles and their relatively short average life span. Birth rate is found to vary drastically across different geographical areas [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], therefore we considered it as an unknown parameter of the model to be explored. Average life expectancy is parameterized with available estimates for domestic dogs in Africa (see
