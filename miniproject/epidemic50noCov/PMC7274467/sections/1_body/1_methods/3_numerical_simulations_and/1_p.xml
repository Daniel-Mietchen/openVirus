<p>We perform numerical simulations of rabies virus transmission in the modelled dog population. Simulations are discrete and stochastic to account for the discrete nature of hosts and for stochastic extinction events that may be favored by small host population sizes. Time is considered to be discrete with a daily timescale. Since the disease is endemic in the country [
