<p>Simulations provide at each time step the number of domestic dogs in each compartment in each patch, and of those moving from one patch to another. We compute the persistence probability of rabies virus in the domestic dog population as the fraction of stochastic simulations reaching the endemic condition (i.e. pathogen survival in the dog population). Endemic prevalence per patch is computed as the average prevalence in time, excluding the initial transient period (~10 years), over each simulation run where rabies virus continued circulating in the dog population.</p>
