<p>Spatially distributed dog populations in the country are inferred from georeferenced high-resolution human demographic data [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], similarly to [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We used a publicly available high-resolution dataset of human population distribution in space [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] to map the georeferenced human settlements in the country and the associated population size, population density, and spatial extension. Population data is validated on Bangui population size provided by national census. The resulting human settlements in space correspond to the dog habitats considered in the metapopulation model, i.e. patches. They are classified as 
 <italic>urban</italic> or 
 <italic>rural</italic>, depending on the density of the corresponding human settlements. We follow the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) definition using a threshold of 1,000 individuals/km
 <sup>2</sup> to define a urban settlement [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Dog population size in each patch is computed from the human-to-dog ratio for 
 <italic>urban</italic> (&gt;1,000 individuals/km
 <sup>2</sup>, ratio = 21.20) or 
 <italic>rural</italic> (&lt;1,000 individuals/km
 <sup>2</sup>, ratio = 7.40) settings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].
