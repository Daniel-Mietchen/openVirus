<p>Human-mediated movements of dogs from one patch to another are modeled with a geographical distance model consistent with known patterns of human movements [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] and compatible with the spatial spread of canine rabies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Similarly to [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], we define the number of dogs transported from one settlement to another to be proportional to 1/
 <italic>d</italic>, where 
 <italic>d</italic> is the great circle distance between the centroids of the two patches. Movements are divided into three different ranges, similarly to [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]: 
 <italic>short-range</italic> movements (
 <italic>d</italic>&lt;20 km) correspond to the average distance within a municipality, 
 <italic>medium-range</italic> movements (20≤
 <italic>d</italic>≤100 km) correspond to the average distance traveled to connect two municipalities within the same region, and 
 <italic>long-range</italic> movements (
 <italic>d</italic>&gt;100 km) correspond to the remaining ones.
