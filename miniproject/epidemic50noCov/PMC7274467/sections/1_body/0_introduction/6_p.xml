<p>Here we investigate the factors underlying the observed rabies epidemiology in Bangui through a spatially explicit stochastic metapopulation model parameterized on the geography of Central African Republic and calibrated on 20 years epidemiological data from Bangui. We consider empirical distributions of incubation and infectious periods coupled with mapping of dog population in the country and models of human-mediated movements to study the local vs. long-range spatial transmission, accounting for both urban and rural settlements.</p>
