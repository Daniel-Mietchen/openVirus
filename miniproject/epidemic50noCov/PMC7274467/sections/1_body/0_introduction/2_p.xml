<p>As rabid dogs constitute the main source of transmission to humans, understanding the dynamics of rabies in domestic dog populations is thus essential to identify the key drivers for pathogen maintenance and develop improved control measures to reduce spillover opportunities and, consequently, the number of human fatalities. An important indicator of the transmission potential of a disease is the basic reproductive number,

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This high coverage is required to prevent the rapid decline of population herd immunity below its critical value between two consecutive campaigns, induced by the large renewal of the naive domestic dog population due to dogs’ short life-span and high fecundity rate [
