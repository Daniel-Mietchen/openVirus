<p>Several models were introduced to address the role of rabies reintroduction in disease-free areas through importations of rabies-exposed dogs [

Their findings are however specific to the characteristics of the public health and veterinary health interventions adopted (e.g. frequency of mass vaccination, coverage, movement bans, etc.). An endemic setting where no intervention has been introduced yet offers an ideal scenario to characterize the endemic disease dynamics at the spatial level, being it isolated from the effects resulting from disease control. It may thus provide the opportunity to better understand the underlying key mechanisms to guide the implementation of elimination measures. Central African Republic reported an endemic circulation of canine rabies for at least the last 20 years [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], with no mass vaccination campaign of domestic dog population implemented during the period. Long-term surveillance data on rabid-dog and exposed-human cases are available for the capital city of Bangui and showed that almost all exposed individuals (93%) are from Bangui or its immediate neighborhood in the suburban areas of Bimbo and Bégoua [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Analyses of epidemiological time series and viral sequence data indicated that the epidemiology of rabies virus in Bangui’s dog population is shaped by a sequence of successive waves characterized by periods of 53 and 89 months and long intervals (&gt;1 year) of absence of cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This was associated to local extinction coupled with the introduction of new viral subtypes. Therefore, while canine rabies does not appear to self-sustain in the city of Bangui, its persistence was suggested to be related to frequent introductions of rabies-exposed dogs in the capital city from its neighboring area [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], a transmission pattern similar to those reported also in other African settings [
