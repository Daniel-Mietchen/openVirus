<p>Transmission of rabies occurs mainly through the bite of an infected animal, with inoculation of viral-loaded saliva in the subcutaneous or muscular tissue of a susceptible host [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The incubation period is highly variable, with a median close to one month, and a range that can extend from 10 days to more than one year [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This is likely related to the process of dissemination of the virus in the infected body, migrating from the site of inoculation to the central nervous system [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The infectious period is instead rather short, with a median around 3 days and fluctuations typically not exceeding 4 days. While dog movements are extremely restricted during the infective phase because of its duration and of disease symptoms, infected dogs may move across distant locations while incubating the virus, potentially carrying the disease over large distances, as suggested by phylogeographic data [
