<p>However, the planning of intervention is made difficult by the geographical dissemination of the disease that may cause rabies reemergence in disease-free areas [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Rabies spatial dispersal is mainly ascribed to human-mediated transport of dogs [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Free-roaming movements of domestic dogs are indeed limited to very short distances of few kilometers per day [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], or less for rabid dogs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Human-mediated movements were previously recognized to be an important vector for spatial dispersal of diseases in wildlife [

For canine rabies, available evidence from household survey data indicates the rather common practice of transporting dogs with frequent movements (daily, monthly, and annual scales) even over large distances (e.g. between different provinces of a country) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This may compromise vaccination campaigns unable to maintain high coverage over the entire region [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The key role played by humans in the dispersal of rabies is also evident from the observed relation between rabies virus spatial spread and the geographic location of human settlements, administrative borders, roads and bridges overcoming natural barriers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008317.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
