<p>From the prescribers’ point of view, ensuring that adherence has been sufficiently strengthened seems a major concern in the absence of an objective measure of adherence and this especially since patients in virological failure suffer from negative representation such as ‘liars’ or ‘delinquent’. Viral load seems often considered as a measure of nonadherence, which should therefore be sufficiently strengthened before proposing second line. Moreover, even if the viral load algorithm is well known, its interpretation is difficult: the 1000 copies/ml threshold is poorly respected in practice. Even a modest decrease in viral load after adherence strengthening is considered as a success, which often leads to further adherence interventions to ‘give a chance to the first line’ to reach a viral load less than 1000 copies/ml, leading to repeated adherence interventions and viral load control with very low and delayed switch to second line, with deleterious effects to the patients and to the epidemic.</p>
