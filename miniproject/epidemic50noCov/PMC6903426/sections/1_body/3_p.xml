<p>Second, even if a simplified algorithm could be applied for efavirenz-based treatment, this strategy is unlikely to be adapted to the higher genetic barrier of the dolutegravir, used as first-line regimen, for which adherence strengthening is more likely to be effective, as shown with boosted protease inhibitors-based second-line strategies [
