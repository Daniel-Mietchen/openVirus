 </sup>. The phylogenetic tree showed that CV-A6 could be divided into 4 genotypes A to D, and D genotype could be further divided into 3 sub-genotypes D1-D3. D1 was composed of strains isolated in Japan in 1999 and in France and Spain from 2008 to 2010, D2 was composed of strains isolated in Japan and mainland of China from 2008 to 2011, while D3 was composed of strains isolated in Finland, Spain, France, Japan, and China from 2011 to 2016. Most of the CV-A6 isolates epidemic in China after 2012 belonged to the D3 sub-genotype, and clustered with the international isolates, the results revealed that D3 was the predominant sub-genotype circulated and spread in Europe and Asia during recent years. D3 sub-genotype may have strong transmission ability and virulence in the process of continuous circulating

 </sup>, which lead to the outbreaks of HFMD in Europe, Southeast Asia and mainland of China. Shaanxi CV-A6 isolates clustered with the D3 sub-genotype, and formed at least 3 small transmission chains, which co-evolved with the strains from Henan, Gansu, Sichuan, Shandong and Guangdong provinces of China.
