<p id="Par21">Enterovirus (EVs) has many serotypes, and there is no cross-immunization between different EVs serotypes, so when the immune barrier is established by one serotype of EVs, the epidemic of this EVs will be weakened. EV-A71 and CV-A16 were the main epidemic serotypes of HFMD in Shaanxi provinces from 2010 to 2012 and 2014, the susceptible population obtained protective antibodies through contact or cross-infection in the epidemic period, which blocked the transmission chain of the virus and declined the transmission power of EV-A71 and CV-A16. Very coincidentally, the prevalence of CV-A6 associated HFMD in on the rise in mainland of China in the same period. In recent years, CV-A6 outbreaks have been reported in many countries around the world. Since the outbreak of HFMD caused by CV-A6 in Finland in 2008, HFMD with CV-A6 as the main pathogen has also occurred in many other countries in the world. From 2009 to 2011, CV-A6 was widely spread in France, Spain and other European countries. And since 2009, CV-A6 has become one of the most important pathogens of HFMD in Asian countries, including Singapore, Japan, Thailand and mainland of China. In phylogenetic tree, the epidemic CV-A6 strains in China after 2012 were clustered together with the isolates of Japan, Thailand, Finland, Spain and France countries, and the strains were closely related to each other. This finding suggested that the emerging strains of CV-A6 might have a common origin and circulated and transmitted in Europe, Southeast Asia and mainland of China. Therefore, we have reason to believe that CV-A6 has been popular and became the dominant pathogen causing HFMD in Shaanxi provinces in 2013 and 2015 due to the importation of European CV-A6.</p>
