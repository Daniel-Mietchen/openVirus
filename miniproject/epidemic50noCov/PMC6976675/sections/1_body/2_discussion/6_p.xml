<p id="Par19">Based on the phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences in the VP1 region, CV-A16 was divided into two genotypes A and B. A genotype was only the prototype strain and was isolated in South Africa in 1951. B genotype was divided into two sub-genotypes (B1~B2), and B1 sub-genotype was further divided into three branches B1a, B1b and B1c

 </sup>. The change of epidemic genotype of CV-A16 is closely related to epidemic time, but there is no difference in epidemic region. A genotype was no longer popular after the 1990s. B2 sub-genotype has not been reported since 2000

 </sup>. At present, B1 sub-genotype was the dominant genotypes circulating in the Asia-Pacific region, with the alternation of B1a and B1b branches. B1c only occurred in Malaysia during 2005â€“2007 and HFMD outbreak in France in 2010

 </sup>. The epidemic CV-A16 in mainland of China belongs to the B1a and B1b branches of B1, which is closely related to the strains in Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan, indicating that CV-A16 in China co-evolved with the strains in the surrounding areas. All of Shaanxi CV-A16 isolates clustered with B1 sub-genotype, and two evolutionary branches of B1a and B1b were alternately epidemic. The strains between 2010 and 2011 were located on the B1a branch, while all of strains isolated after 2012 were belonged to the B1b branch. It indicated that the B1b branch of CV-A16 strains was dominant and had gradually replaced B1a as endemic epidemic virus in Shaanxi Province.
