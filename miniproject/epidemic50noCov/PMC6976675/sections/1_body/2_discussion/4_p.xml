<p id="Par17">According to the analysis of the pathogenic proportion of different types of HFMD cases, it can be seen that the positive rates of EV-A71 in severe and dead cases were 65.70% and 98.43%, respectively. EV-A71 was the major pathogen causing severe and dead cases of HFMD. It has been reported that the positive rate of EV-A71 is closely related to the occurrence of severe and dead cases

 </sup>. When EV-A71 was the dominant pathogen in a certain year, the severe and dead cases were higher than those in the other year. EV-A71 is a neurotropic virus that causes aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, neurogenic pulmonary edema, other central nervous system diseases, and even causes death

 </sup>. There were 64 laboratory-confirmed deaths in this study, 63 of the 64 deaths died of neurological complications (such as brain stem encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, encephalomyelitis) or cardiopulmonary complications (neurogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage or cardiopulmonary failure) caused by EV-A71 infection. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the epidemic of EV-A71 in HFMD. When the positive rate of EV-A71 appears a high level, it is necessary to predict and warn the occurrence of severe and dead cases in time.
