<p id="Par5">A total of 392,400 HFMD cases were reported in Shaanxi Province during 2010–2016, including 5469 severe cases and 137 deaths. The average annual incidence rate was 148.5319 per 100,000. The average annual mortality rate and fatality rate were 0.04806 per 100,000 and 2.32%, respectively. A total of 16,832 HFMD positive cases were confirmed in the laboratory, of which 7042 (44.84%) were positive for EV-A71 infection, 3473 (20.63%) were positive for CV-A16 infection and 6317 (37.53%) were other EVs. The proportion of pathogens detected in 7 years was differenced (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In 2010, EV-A71 and CV-A16 were the main pathogens causing HFMD, and the positive rates of EV-A71 and CV-A16 were 44.62% and 37.01%, respectively. In 2011 and 2012, EV-A71 was the dominant pathogen which the positive rates were 64.42% and 57.17%, respectively. In 2013, the pathogen spectrum of HFMD changed greatly, and the proportion of other EVs increased significantly as high as 61.17%. In 2014, the dominant position of EV-A71 was recovered to 50.91%. In 2015, HFMD was still mainly caused by other EVs, accounting for 57.38%, and in 2016, EV-A71 became the dominant pathogen again, accounting for 46.68%.
