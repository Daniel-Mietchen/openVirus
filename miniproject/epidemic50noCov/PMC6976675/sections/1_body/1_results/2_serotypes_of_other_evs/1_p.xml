<p id="Par10">In this study, a total of 709 other EVs were identified during 2010â€“2016, including 19 serotypes, belonging to species A and B of EVs. Among the other EVs, the most frequently detected was CV-A6, accounting for 41.47%, followed by CV-A10 (26.66%), CV-A2 (2.54%), CV-A4 (1.55%), Echo6 (1.16%) and CV-B1 (1.13%), respectively. The remaining 13 serotypes were CV-A5, CV-A12, CV-A14, CV-B3, CV-B4, CV-B5, Echo3, Echo7, Echo8, Echo9, Echo11, Echo16, Echo18, respectively, less than 1%. In 2013 and 2015, CV-A6 was the main serotype accounting for 40.85% and 39.49%, respectively, which exceeded the level of EV-A71 in the same year and became the dominant pathogen of HFMD in that year.</p>
