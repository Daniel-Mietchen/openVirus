<p id="Par12">The nucleotide and amino acid homologies of 36 isolates of CV-A16 from Shaanxi province were 89.2–99.9% and 98.3–100%, respectively. The nucleotide and amino acid homologies with CV-A16 prototype strain (G-10) were 80.6–82.7% and 92.3–94.9%, respectively. The phylogenetic tree was constructed between Shaanxi CV-A16 isolates and reference genotypic strains from GenBank. It can be seen that Shaanxi isolates clustered with the B1 sub-genotype of B genotype, and B1 sub-genotype was divided into two major evolutionary branches B1a and B1b. There were some differences in nucleotide level between the two evolutionary branches. The B1a evolutionary branch contained isolates from Shaanxi province during 2010–2011. Most of CV-A16 isolates belonged to B1b evolutionary branch since 2012 (Fig.
