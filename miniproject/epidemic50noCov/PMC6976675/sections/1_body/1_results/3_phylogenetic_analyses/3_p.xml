<p id="Par13">Homology comparison and phylogenetic analysis of CV-A6 isolates in Shaanxi Province and reference CV-A6 strains from GenBank were carried out. The nucleotide and amino acid sequence homologies of Shaanxi CV-A6 isolates were 93.6–99.9% and 95.4–100%, respectively. The nucleotide and amino acid homologies with CV-A6 prototype strain (Gdula) were 81.6–83.7% and 93.1–95.7%, respectively. The phylogenetic tree showed that CV-A6 could be divided into 4 genotypes A to D, and genotype D could be further divided into 3 sub-genotypes D1-D3. Most of CV-A6 isolates in mainland of China belonged to the D2 and D3 sub-genotypes of D genotype. Shaanxi CV-A6 isolates clustered with the D3 sub-genotype, except for 1 strain (XY09/SaX/CHN/2011) in 2011, which located on the D2 sub-genotype. Shaanxi CV-A6 strains formed at least 3 small transmission chains, which were closely related to strains isolated from Henan, Sichuan, Gansu, Shandong and Guangdong provinces of China in recent years (Fig.
