<p id="Par11">The entire VP1 genes of EV-A71, CV-A16 and CV-A6 which the major serotypes of HFMD were sequenced and analyzed. According to the type of cases and different years, 37 strains of EV-A71, 36 strains of CV-A16 and 29 strains of CV-A6 were selected. The results showed that the nucleotide homology of 37 EV-A71 isolates from Shaanxi province was 94.2–99.7%, and the amino acid homology was 98.0–100%. The nucleotide and amino acid homology with EV-A71 prototype strain (BrCr) were 80.6–82.7% and 92.3–94.9%, respectively. The nucleotide and amino acid homology with the representative strain of C4 sub-genotype (SHZH98) were 90.8–92.6% and 96.3–97.6%, respectively. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by selecting the genotypes and sub-genotypes of EV-A71 from GenBank. The isolated strains of Shaanxi EV-A71 gathered into clusters. All of them were located on the C4a evolutionary branch of C4 sub-genotype and belonged to the same transmission chain (Fig.
