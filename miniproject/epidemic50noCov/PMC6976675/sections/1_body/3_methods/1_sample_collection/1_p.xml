All the patients were diagnosed by the Ministry of Health diagnostic criteria. Generally, children who had fever or one of the following features: maculopapular or vesicular rash on the palms and/or soles, or vesicles and ulcers around the uvula, were diagnosed as HFMD-positive. Severe manifestations of the disease included encephalitis, meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis or even death. According to the guidelines for prevention and control of HFMD issued by the Ministry of health in China in 2009, the selection criteria for cases in this study are as follows: at least 5 mild cases were collected each month in counties (districts), and all severe and dead cases were collected.
