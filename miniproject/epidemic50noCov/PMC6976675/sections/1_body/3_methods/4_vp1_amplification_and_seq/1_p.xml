 </sup>. The reaction conditions were: 50 °C 30 min, 94 °C 2 min; 94 °C 30 S, 55 °C 30 S, 72 °C 1 min, 35 cycles; extension 10 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were detected with 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and the positive products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The amplicons were bi-directionally sequenced using ABI 3500 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, USA).
