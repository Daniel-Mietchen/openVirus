<p id="Par27">The nucleotide sequences were assembled using Squencher software (version 4.0). DNAstar software was used for homology sequence analysis. Sequence alignment was conducted using MEGA software (version 5.0) and phylogenetic tree was constructed for the VP1 sequences by the neighbour-joining method based on the Kimura 2-parametermodel, with 1000 bootstrap replicates. All the reference strains used were retrieved from the GenBank database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).</p>
