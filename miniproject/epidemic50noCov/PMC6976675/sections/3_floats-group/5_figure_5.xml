  <p>Phylogenetic tree of VP1 region of EV-A71 Strains Isolated from HFMD in Shaanxi Province, China, 2010–2016. The neighbor-joining method was used to construct the tree. The phylogenetic tree was determined for 1000 replicates. Only strong bootstrap values (≥90%) were shown. The viruses isolated from Shaanxi province were labeled with different colour solid circle, in which 2010 (green), 2011 (purple), 2012 (orange), 2013 (wathet), 2014 (yellow), 2015 (blue) and 2016 (red). The 40 reference strains were obtained from the US National Center for Biotechnology Information’s Genbank. BrCr(U22521) was the prototype strain of EV-A71.</p>
