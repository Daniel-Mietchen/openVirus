  <p>Knockdown of Hsp70 reduced PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Vero E6 cells were transfected with siRNA1, siRNA2, siRNA3 and nonspecific control (siRNA NC) targeting the Hsp70 gene, and incubated for 48 h. The Hsp70 mRNA levels were detected by qRT-PCR. The level of Hsp70 mRNA was normalized to the level of β-actin mRNA in the same sample. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The cells were harvested for western blotting analysis with anti-Hsp70 anti-GAPDH antibodies. The levels of Hsp70 was quantified by immunoblot scanning and normalized with respect to the amount of GAPDH (lower panel). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Vero E6 cells were transfected with siRNA1, siRNA3 and siRNA NC targeting the Hsp70 gene, 24 h post transfection PEDV were infected at MOI = 1 and incubated for another 24 h. The Hsp70 and PEDV ORF3 mRNA levels were detected by qRT-PCR. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The cells were harvested for western blotting analysis with anti-Hsp70, anti-PEDV-N and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The relative protein levels were quantified by immunoblot scanning and normalized with respect to the amount of GAPDH (lower panel). The data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). Statistically significant differences are indicated as follows: ns, not significant; *,
