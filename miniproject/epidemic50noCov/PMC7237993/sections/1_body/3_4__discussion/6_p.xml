<p>In this study, we showed that cold exposure could induct Hsp70 levels in vivo and in vitro. We found that synthesis and activity of Hsp70 were essential for PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression in vitro. This feature may help explain the seasonality of PED epidemics. Although Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells are the most common cell line used to study PEDV infection [

Also, further studies are needed to understand the detailed mechanism of Hsp70 mediated enhancement effects on PEDV infection in vivo and in vitro.
