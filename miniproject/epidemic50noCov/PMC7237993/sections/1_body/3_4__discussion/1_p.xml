<p>Seasonality of the PED epidemic may link to environmental factors such as the drop of ambient temperature. Physiological stress experienced under cold exposure leads to a weakening of immune response [

 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00246" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It has been reported that Hsp70 could promote influenza A virus replication through modulates polymerase activity [

 <xref rid="B38-pathogens-09-00246" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Obviously, low environmental temperature is related to the outbreak and spread of infectious diseases.
