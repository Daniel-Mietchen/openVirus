<p>We have investigated the effect of cold exposure on the expression of Hsp70 in vivo and in vitro. Duodenum, jejunum, and ileum of cold exposed piglets were analyzed at different time point by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The Hsp70 expression was enhanced in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum after 12 h of cold exposure (
