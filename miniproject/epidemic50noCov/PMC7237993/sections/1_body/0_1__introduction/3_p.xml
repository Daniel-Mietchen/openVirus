<p>In this study, Hsp70 expression in the intestinal of cold exposed pig and cold exposed Vero E6 cells were investigated. The role of Hsp70 in PEDV replication has also been studied in Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells. We showed that cold exposure could induce Hsp70 expression levels in vivo and in vitro. Also, Hsp70 levels were in parallel with the viral mRNA synthesis and protein expression levels in vitro. These results indicated that exposure to low ambient temperature may enhance PEDV replication through up-regulated Hsp70 in the intestinal which may contribute to the seasonality of PED epidemics, suggesting environmental temperature control is important to prevent PEDV infection and disease outcomes in the cold seasons.</p>
