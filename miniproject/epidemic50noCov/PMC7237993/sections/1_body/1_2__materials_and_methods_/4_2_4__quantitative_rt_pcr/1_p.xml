<p>Total RNA was extracted from the tissue or cellular samples using RNA extraction kit from Tiangen Biotech (Beijing, China). Reverse transcription was carried out using PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takala, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two microliter of the RT reaction mixture was submitted to quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) using gene specific primers (

 <sup>®</sup>SYBR qPCR SuperMix Plus (E096-01B, Novoprotein, Shanghai, China), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The reaction procedure was 95 °C for 2 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. The relative amount of target gene mRNA was normalized to that of β-actin mRNA in the same sample. To confirm specific amplification, melting curve analysis of the RT-PCR products was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The qRT-PCR was performed in an ABI QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR system. Relative quantification analysis was performed using the cycle threshold (2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>) method [
