<p>Equivalent amounts of tissue or cellular lysate proteins were subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45 μm). After blocking with 5% (

 <italic>v</italic>) non-fat milk, membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with mouse monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against GAPDH, Hsp70 and PEDV N protein. After three times washing with 0.05 % Tween-20 in tris-buffered saline (TBST), the membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Protein detection was performed using LuminataTMCrescendo Western HRP substrate (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) and Amersham Imager 600 (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Protein levels were determined using ImageJ quantification software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
