<p>To investigate the effects of silenced monkey Hsp70 on PEDV replication, three small interference RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the monkey Hsp70 (siRNA-Hsp70-1, 5′-GGAGGUAUCCUCUAUGGUUTT-3′; siRNA-Hsp70-2, 5′-GCAGAAAGAAACGUGCUUATT-3′; siRNA-Hsp70-3, 5′-CCUGAUGAAGCUGUUGCUUTT-3′) were synthesized. Non-specific siRNA (siRNA-NC, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′) was used as control. Vero E6 cells grown to approximately 30%–50% confluence in 6-well plates were transfected with siRNA-Hsp70 (40 nmol/well) or siRNA-NC (40 nmol/well), respectively, using Exfect 2000 transfection reagent (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Twenty-four hours post transfection; cells were washed three times with PBS, and infected with PEDV strain CV777 at 1 MOI. At 24 hpi, samples were subjected to detection of PEDV RNA and protein by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively.</p>
