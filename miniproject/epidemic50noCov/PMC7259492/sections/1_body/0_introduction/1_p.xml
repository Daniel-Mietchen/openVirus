<p>Arboviruses are an ongoing concern for regions where their vectors are endemic, namely most tropical and subtropical areas. Factors such as global warming and globalization have enabled the vectors of these viruses to spread into new geographical regions and support autochthonous transmission of a number of human disease causing arboviruses [
