<p>Testing of the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture supernatants by qRT-PCR detected no Zika virus growth either by cytopathic effect or by qRT-PCR testing of the supernatant, even in the case of the two positive bodies. This indicates that the individuals originally categorized as positive via molecular testing were positive for viral RNA and not for infectious virus. PCR and gel-electrophoresis showed no evidence of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection in either pools of
