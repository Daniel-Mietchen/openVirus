<p id="p0085">This study illustrates that Nepal observes two peaks of influenza infection round the year; first in the month of January–February and second in the month of July–August which is similar to the pattern followed by some Asian countries in temperate zone of Northern hemisphere [

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The first peak was observed in winter season followed by the second peak coinciding with the rainy season. This is further supported by a study from India which reports maximum influenza activity during the rainy season [

 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This suggests that seasonality of influenza appears to be country specific despite of similar type of climatic conditions. Though influenza A/H3 was the predominant circulating strain in year 2016 in Nepal, somewhat surprisingly noticed was the second peak of infection in July–August that was marked by influenza B despite of A/H3 strain. The possible explanation behind circulation of different viruses in the two peaks of the year might be the outbreak with different strain or host-related and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity which supports activity of particular strain of virus.
