  <p>Strategy for constructing PRV chimeric viruses. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Swapping of non-essential gene. Two sgRNAs were designed to guide Cas9 to cleave off a non-essential gene, and GFP was used for both positive and negative screening of recombinant virus. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Swapping of essential gene. To increase the rescue rate, Cas9 recognition sites within donor DNA were mutated synonymously to avoid cleavage by Cas9.
