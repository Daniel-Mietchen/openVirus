  <p>Sensitivity of chimeric viruses to swine neutralizing antibodies to Bartha-K61. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Sensitivity of PRV strain HB1201 and its derivatives to anti-Bartha-K61 sera. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Sensitivity of PRV Bartha-K61 and its derivatives to anti-Bartha-K61 serum. Virus neutralization assays were performed with antisera from three individual piglets. The data represent means Â± standard deviations (SD) of three replicates. Asterisk indicates a significant difference: *
