  <p>Multistep growth curve of chimeric viruses in Vero cells. Vero-CCL81 cells in 12-well plates were infected with the viruses at an MOI of 0.01. At each indicated time point, total viruses were titrated with the endpoint dilution assay. The data represent means Â± standard deviations (SD) of three replicates. Asterisk indicates a significant difference: *
