<p>The viral load in the tissues of pigs challenged PRV HB1201 were assessed using quantitative real-time PCR with primers targeting the gene coding for gB. The results showed that immunization with Bartha-gC

 <sub>1201</sub> significantly reduced viral tissue load in lung, kidney, tonsil, and lymph nodes by several logs compared with Bartha-K61 group (

 <sub>1201</sub> were much lower than the group Bartha-K61 with the exception of brain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9B</xref>). For the negative control group, PRV antigens were not detectable in all piglets. For the DMEM group, the PRV antigens were distributed in all the organs with specific signals detected in alveolar epithelial cells of lung, nerve cells of brain, renal tubular epithelial cells, and lymphatic nodules of tonsils and submandibular lymph nodes (
