<p>We next investigated whether Bartha-gCD

 <sub>1201</sub> alone. To this end, piglets were immunized with Bartha-K61, Bartha-gCD

 <sub>1201</sub>, or DMEM. At 28 dpi, the piglets of all groups were challenged with a lethal dose of PRV HB1201 (10

 <sub>50</sub>), and the clinical signs were monitored and scored (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>). For the non-vaccinated group (DMEM), the pigs displayed steady progression of PR syndrome, from fever to respiratory and CNS symptoms, and all died within 6 dpc. For the Bartha-K61 group, the piglets also showed significant respiratory symptoms, depression, convulsion signs and ataxia, and two of them died at 6 dpc exhibiting CNS symptoms such as ataxia and agitation. In contrast, the Bartha-gCD
 <sub>
  <italic>HB</italic>
 </sub>
 <sub>1201</sub> group showed only transient, slight loss of appetite and respiratory symptom between the third and fifth days. However, the piglets in this group developed fever, which lasted for 4 days before returning back to normal, but this duration was much shorter that Bartha-K61 group, which lasted for 6 days. In addition, the Bartha-gCD

 </sub>
 <sub>1201</sub> group had generally much lower rectal temperatures than the Bartha-K61 group at different days post challenge.
