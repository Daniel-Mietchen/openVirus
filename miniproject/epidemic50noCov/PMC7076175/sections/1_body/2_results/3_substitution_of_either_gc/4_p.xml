<p>We also looked into the histopathological changes by HE staining. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>, the Bartha-K61 group developed severe microscopic lesions of multiple organs, such as alveolar septal capillary dilatation, hemorrhage, congestion, alveoli disappearance; tonsil necrosis and congestion; lymphocyte infiltration around the blood vessels or nerve cells in brain; severe hemorrhage and cortical necrosis in submandibular lymph nodes; and renal tubular epithelial cells detachment in kidney. In contrast, Bartha-gC

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). Correspondingly, the microscopic lesion scores in all tissues of these two groups were significantly lower than that in Bartha-K61-immunized group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). Thus, Bartha-gC
