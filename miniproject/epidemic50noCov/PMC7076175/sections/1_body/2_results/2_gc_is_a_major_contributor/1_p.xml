<p>The sensitivity of chimeric viruses to neutralizing antibodies was investigated by using swine anti-Bartha-K61 serum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). As expected, anti-Bartha-K61 serum had a much higher neutralization titer (NT) against Bartha-K61 than HB1201, and a difference of about threefold could be discerned. In the gain-of-function test, swapping Bartha-K61 gC (HB1201-gC

 </sub>) enabled HB1201 gained the sensitivity to anti-Bartha-K61 serum (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>), while the mutant HB1201-gD
 <sub>
  <italic>Bartha</italic>
 </sub> is less sensitive to the neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, swapping of both gC and gD had a similar effect to gC alone, suggesting that variability of gC plays a major role in the neutralization escape. Interestingly, swapping of gB (HB1201-gB
 <sub>
  <italic>Bartha</italic>
 </sub>) did not have a statistically significant effect on the sensitivity of neutralization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the loss-of-function test (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), anti-Bartha-K61 serum had significantly reduced NT against Bartha-gC
