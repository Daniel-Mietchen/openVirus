<p>We assessed the individual contribution of gB, gC, and gD to the neutralizing antibody escape by constructing chimeric mutants via swapping the genes individually or in combination in a reciprocal manner. The chimeric viruses between Bartha-K61 and HB1201 were generated by taking advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 technology and homologous recombination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In brief, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to cleave the target sequence off the virus genome, and the subsequent gene swapping is facilitated via the mechanism of cellular homologous recombination by co-transfecting a gene fragment containing the target gene flanked by homologous arms on both ends (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). For swapping the non-essential gene coding for gC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>), the GFP gene was first inserted into the acceptor genome to facilitate virus purification, which was then replaced in the next round of recombination with the target gene by homologous recombination following cleavage of the target sequence by Cas9. For swapping the essential gene (e.g., gB and gD) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>), the donor sequence was designed to contain synonymous mutations to avoid cleavage by Cas9. By using these strategies, a total of eight chimeric viruses were made, including HB1201-gB
