<p>It has been reported that immunization with the Bartha-K61 vaccine does not provide complete protection against challenge of PRV novel variants (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2015</xref>). This observation implies that the antigenic changes in viral envelope glycoproteins likely contribute to the escape of either humoral or cellular immunity or both. PRV encodes at least nine envelope glycoproteins, and a sequence comparison between Bartha-K61 and PRV epidemic strain HB1201 (Genbank no: KU057086) showed that gB, gC, gD, gN, gM contain the most large number of mutations (
