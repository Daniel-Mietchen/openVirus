<p>Genomic characterization of PRV variants revealed their remarkable genetic divergence from European and American strains, including Bartha-K61 (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2015</xref>). Gene deletions, insertions and substitutions are scattered along the genome (

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2015</xref>). In this regard, a long-asked question is how the genetic variations contribute to increased viral virulence and escape of host immunity provided by Bartha-K61 vaccine in the field. Progress has recently been made toward to this direction. 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. (2017)</xref> have recently shown that the glycoprotein B (gB) contributes to the immunogenic difference between PRV variant JS-2012 and Bartha-K61, and that Bartha-K61 carrying gB from the strain JS-2012 could provide partial protection in a mouse model. While our work is under way, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2019)</xref> showed that Bartha-k61 carrying gD and gC of variant strain AH02LA provided complete clinical protection against the challenge by AH02LA. However, in that study, the piglets immunized with Bartha-K61 did not show any clinical symptom and also all survived the challenge by AH02LA (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is not clear whether vaccination with the chimeric mutant will protect pigs from lethal challenge of epidemic strains. In addition, the virus-induced lesions, the viral tissue load and the role of individual genes in the protection were not assessed. Thus, there still exists a considerable knowledge gap regarding how the antigenic changes lead to inefficient cross-protection.
