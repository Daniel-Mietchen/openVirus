<p>Nevertheless in late 2011, a severe form of PR emerged suddenly in Bartha-K61-vaccinated swine farms in North China and then quickly spread to most parts of the mainland (

Compared with the Chinese classical strains such as Fa or SC, the PRV variants clearly exhibit increased virulence to pigs from 35 to 127 days old pigs. Pigs infected with PRV variants showed much severer pathological lesions, with extensive antigen distribution in different organs and severe clinical symptoms, such as high fever, respiratory symptoms, and neurological signs (
