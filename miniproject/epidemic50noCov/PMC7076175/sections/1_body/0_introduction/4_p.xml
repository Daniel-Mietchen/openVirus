<p>In this study, we identified the envelope glycoproteins gB, gC, and gD as the key regions of PRV genetic variation by bioinformatics analysis. By constructing a series of chimeric viruses between Bartha-K61 and epidemic strain HB1201, we found that gC is a major contributor to cross-neutralization against HB1201. Immunization with Bartha-K61 chimera carrying either gC of PRV HB1201 is sufficient to protect piglets from lethal challenge by PRV HB1201 at a lethal dose of 10

 <sub>50</sub>. Interestingly, despite a lower cross-neutralization ability, swapping of PRV gD alone also enabled Bartha-K61 to acquire the ability to induce a protective immunity. A better protection in terms of reducing viral load in brain and virus-induced microscopic lesions could be achieved when both gC and gD were swapped. These findings have important implications in development of novel vaccines for PRV control in China.
