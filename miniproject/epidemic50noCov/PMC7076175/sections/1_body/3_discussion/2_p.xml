<p>The glycoproteins gB, gC, and gD are involved in virus entry and are critical targets of neutralizing antibodies (

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gerdts et al., 1997</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Pomeranz et al., 2005</xref>). In particular, gC mediates the initial attachment of PRV to cell surface. It acts through distinct viral heparin-binding domains (HBDs) that are located in its N-terminal region (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Flynn and Ryan, 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ober et al., 2000</xref>), and consequently, antibodies targeting this antigenic domain have been shown to interfere with the viral attachment (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Ober et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, a large portion of the neutralizing activity of pooled convalescent swine sera have been found to be directed against gC (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Ben-Porat et al., 1986</xref>). Thus, it is not very surprising that gC shows a high level of genetic variability among viral strains across different geographic regions. Our studies show that gC has the highest mutation rate and that the genetic mutations are mainly scattered in the N-terminal region between 14 aa and 243 aa. Further, we provide evidence to show that gC variability is a key factor for the low capacity of anti-Bartha-K61 serum to neutralize the epidemic strain HB1201 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Future studies may be directed to map critical amino acids for the antigenic difference. On the other hand, gB and gD are important for virus penetration (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Pomeranz et al., 2005</xref>). Our analyses showed that the genetic variation of gD is a secondary factor for the inefficient cross-neutralization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Despite a lower cross-neutralization ability, swapping of gD from PRV epidemic strain HB1201 enabled Bartha-K61 to acquire the ability to induce a protective immunity, suggesting a possibility of gD-induced cellular immunity in the cross-protection. The gain or loss-of-function tests also revealed a less critical role in cross-neutralization for gB variability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Interestingly, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al. (2017)</xref> have recently shown that Bartha-K61 carrying gB from the strain JS-2012 could provide partial protection in a mouse model. It will be worthy to test whether the corresponding virus can also induce a protective immunity in piglets.
