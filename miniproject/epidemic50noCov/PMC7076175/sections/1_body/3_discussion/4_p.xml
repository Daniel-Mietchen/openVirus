<p>Our studies also showed that Bartha-gCD

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al., 2016</xref>). It should be noted that although the mutant could alleviate the clinical symptoms rather significantly, but it did not stop piglets from developing a transient fever (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al. (2015)</xref> found that piglets vaccinated with rSMXgI/gEΔTK attenuated strain with a dose of 10

 <sub>50</sub> displayed fever lasting 4 days with rectal temperature between 40°C and 42°C after challenge with 10

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al., 2015a</xref>). In contrast, PRV HN1201 TK

 <sup>–</sup> strain could provide full protection for young piglets against challenge with HN1201, and no clinical symptom and increasing temperature were observed (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). It is noteworthy that in that study the immunization dose is the same as the challenge dose; both are 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>. In another study, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Tong et al. (2016)</xref> used PRV variant JS-2012 derivative JS-2012-ΔgE/gI for vaccination at a dose of 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> and JS-2012 for challenge with a dose of 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>. Similarly, no fever was developed. Since the immune responses are usually dose-dependent, we speculate that the clinical protective effect may be contingent to the dose used; a high challenge dose may overwhelm the host immune system, leading to fever development. Future studies should be focused on dose-dependent immunization and challenge experiment to determine the most appropriate dose for immunization and highest dose an immunized pig can resist.
