<p>The PRV epidemic strains can escape from the immunity provided by the classical Bartha-K61 vaccine, but the underlying mechanisms have remained poorly understood. By constructing chimeric viruses, here we revealed the following findings: (i) gC was a critical contributor to the inefficient cross-neutralization ability to epidemic strain; (ii) swapping of either gC or gD alone enabled Bartha-K61 to induce a protective immunity against the lethal challenge by PRV strain HB1201; and (iii) gC and gD displayed a synergistic effect, and immunization with Bartha-K61 carrying both gC and gD of HB1201 could significantly decrease viral load in brain and provide much better protection. The relevant significance or insights of this study are discussed below.</p>
