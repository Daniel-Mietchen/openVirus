<p>Fifteen 4-week-old healthy piglets were divided randomly into three groups with five piglets in each group. The piglets in each group were immunized with either Bartha-K61, Bartha-gC

Serum samples were collected weekly to monitor PRV gB-specific and gE-specific antibody responses. At 28 days post-immunization (dpi), the immunized piglets were challenged with PRV epidemic strain HB1201 at a dose of 2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> via intranasal route. The clinical signs of disease and rectal temperature were recorded and scored daily. A detailed scoring system is summarized in
