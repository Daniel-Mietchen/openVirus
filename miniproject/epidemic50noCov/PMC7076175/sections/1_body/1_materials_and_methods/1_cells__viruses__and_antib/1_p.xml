<p>Vero-CCL81 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, United States) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, United States). The PRV variant strain HB1201 (Genbank no. KU057086) was isolated from PR outbreak of a swine farm in Hebei province of China in 2012. PRV Bartha-K61 vaccine strain (Genbank no. JF797217.1) was a gift from Dr. Zhijun Tian (Harbin Veterinary Institute, CAAS) preserved in our laboratory. All PRV strains were propagated in Vero-CCL81 cells maintained in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS (Gibco, United States) at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific to PRV gE were obtained from Beijing Jinnuo Baitai Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
