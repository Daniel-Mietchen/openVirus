<p>To analyze the growth property of rescued viruses, Vero-CCL81 cells in 12-well plates were infected with indicated viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. After absorption for 1 h at 37Â°C, the unbound viruses were inactivated by brief acid wash (135 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 40 mM citric acid, pH 3.0). The acid was then removed by washing the cells with PBS twice, and then the cells were supplemented with fresh DMEM containing 2% FBS. At indicated time points post-infection, the whole culture was harvested; the virus titer was determined by endpoint dilution assay and expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>), according to the Reed-Muench method (
