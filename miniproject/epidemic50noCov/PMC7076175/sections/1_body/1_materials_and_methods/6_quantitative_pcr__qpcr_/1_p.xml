<p>The viral tissue load was measured by absolute quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the gB gene. The viral DNA from tissues were extracted by TIANamp virus DNA/RNA kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China) with the ChamQ
 <sup>TM</sup> SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) on an ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystem, United States) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The primers were as follows: upstream primer: 5′-GTCTGTGAAGCGGTTCGTGAT-3′ and downstream primer: 5′-ACAAGTTCAAGGCGCACATCTAC-3′. Seven serial dilutions of plasmid containing gB with the copy number from 10
 <sup>1</sup> to 10
 <sup>7</sup> copies/μL served as template to generate a standard curve. The PCR was performed in a 20 μL reaction containing 0.4 μL gene specific primers (10 μM), 10 μL ChamQ
 <sup>TM</sup> SYBR
 <sup>®</sup> qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing China), 2 μL PRV genome, and 7.2 μL ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O. The PCR parameter was set up as follows: 50°C for 2 min, 95°C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 45 s. The viral loads were calculated with the 7500 System SDS software according to standard curve and expressed as log
 <sub>10</sub> copies per gram of tissue sample.
