<p>At necropsy, the tissues, such as lung, lymph node, kidney, tonsil, and brain, were all assessed for gross lesions. The histopathological examination and IHC were performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Halbur et al., 1995</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Briefly, the collected tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution at room temperature for 48 h. The fixed tissues were trimmed, dehydrated in graded alcohol, and embedded in paraffin. Micro sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) for microscopic pathological changes. To visualize the antigen load and distribution, the micro sections were also stained with the PRV gE mAb at a dilution of 1:5,000. The severity of lesions was blindly evaluated from 0 to 4 according to previous studies (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Halbur et al., 1995</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). The IHC scores of PRV antigen were conducted through a range score of 0 to 4 for by calculating the number of gE positive cells.
