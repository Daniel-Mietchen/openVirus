<p>To perform the virus neutralization assay, anti-Bartha-K61 sera were inactivated at 56°C for 30 min and diluted with DMEM in a series of two-fold dilutions. The serially diluted serum of 50 μL was then mixed with equal volume of 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of indicated viruses and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The mixtures were then used to infect Vero-CCL81 cells in 96-well plates. The virus-induced CPE was examined daily for 72 h following infection and the neutralizing antibody titer was calculated by the Reed-Muench method.
