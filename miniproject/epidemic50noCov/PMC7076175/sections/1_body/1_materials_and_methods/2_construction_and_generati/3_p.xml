<p>The process for swapping the essential gene is one-step with the procedure very similar to that above for gC. The only difference is that the sites that can be recognized by sgRNA in donor DNA fragment were mutated synonymously to avoid the cleavage of donor sequences by Cas9. All viruses were verified by nucleotide sequencing. The primers used for generating recombinant viruses are included in
