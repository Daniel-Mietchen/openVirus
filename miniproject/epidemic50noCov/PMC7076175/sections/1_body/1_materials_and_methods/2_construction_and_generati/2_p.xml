<p>To exchange the non-essential gene coding for gC, the homologous arms were amplified from the acceptor strain, and GFP was amplified from the plasmid pEGFP-N2 (Clonetech, CA, Mountain View, United States) by PCR using Phanta
 <sup>®</sup> Max Super-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Vazyme, Nanjing China). The donor GFP flanked by the homologous arms was then generated by overlapping PCR. To make recombinant virus, PRV genome DNA was extracted from the infected Vero-CCL81 cell as previously described (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hirt, 1967</xref>), and co-transfected with linear donor DNA (5.0 μg) and two sgRNA plasmids (each 1.5 μg) into Vero CCL81 cells using the lipofectamine
 <sup>®</sup> 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States). The cytopathic effect was monitored daily and the recombinant virus carrying GFP was harvested after 72 h later. The virus was purified by plaque purification with homogeneity monitored by the plaque sizes and confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate the chimeric gC virus, the GFP was replaced by donor gC flanked by homologous arms from acceptor PRV. The recombinant virus was generated via transfection and screened by loss of GFP fluorescence.
