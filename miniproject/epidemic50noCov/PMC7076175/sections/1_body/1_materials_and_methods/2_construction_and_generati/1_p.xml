 </sup>. For each target gene, two sgRNAs were designed that are located on both sides of variation region within the open reading frame. To minimize the off-target effect, we chose those with a high comprehensive score. Following that, the sgRNA oligos were blasted against PRV genome to ensure their high specificity. The sgRNA plasmid of CRISPR/Cas9 was constructed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Ren et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, the oligo pairs were synthesized (
