<p>Vector control remains the primary control method for dengue, of the two dengue mosquito vectors 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> in Singapore [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The low seroprevalence rates across the national population make the implementation of vaccination using Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) challenging, therefore techniques such as Wolbachia, fogging and breeding site reduction are utilized to both prevent and control epidemics [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The successful application of these methods in epidemics depends on the correct timing for control ramp up in which house inspections increase, community engagement campaigns are rolled out to generate awareness in breeding site reduction and fogging in areas deemed at high risk of transmission [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].The characterization of dengue transmission dynamics through time is therefore critical. Finite resources for ramp up of vector control measures also beg the question of estimating the duration and severity of epidemics in different climates.
