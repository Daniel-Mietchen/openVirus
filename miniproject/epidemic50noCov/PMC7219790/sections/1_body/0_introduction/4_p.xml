<p>Regime switching models are used to model phenomena in which time series are characterized by characteristic changes in behavior [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and they have potential applicability in modelling disease states and transmission due to the differential behavior of disease transmissions in epidemic and endemic periods [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Martinez et al. explored influenza epidemic detection in Spain using a regime switching framework where highly seasonal dynamics of infection allowed distinct classification of epidemic and endemic disease states [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The framework used could detect periods and behavior of high influenza transmission counts and low influenza transmission counts. However, regime switching models have yet to be applied for transmission dynamics which are highly non-seasonal, irregular and persistent such as dengue within tropical climates [
