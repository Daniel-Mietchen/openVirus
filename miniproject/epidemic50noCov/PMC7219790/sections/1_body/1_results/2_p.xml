<p>In the BRS-3 Lag model, the endemic and epidemic regime lasts for around 66 and 20 weeks respectively (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). While our variable of interest is differenced dengue case counts and identifying restriction set to the variance of the differenced dengue transmission counts, the model was able to correctly identify periods of high levels of dengue transmissions and periods where levels of dengue transmissions are relatively low even when we compare regimes to the undifferenced original time series (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007839.g002">2</xref>). Posterior probabilities assigned to the epidemic state also assign high probabilities near 1 to the epidemic regime when it occurs. (
