<p>To the best of the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first application of regime switching autoregressive models for analyzing dengue transmission dynamics across separable states. We found evidence that epidemic and endemic regimes which characterize dengue transmission are highly persistent and are not associated to climatic factors. Our results point towards the need for long-term policy formation for effective vector control which is timed with upcoming epidemic switches.</p>
