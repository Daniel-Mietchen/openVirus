<p>Lastly, to provide a mechanistic interpretation of the labelled regimes, in addition to looking at posterior transition probabilities and the data fit to the regimes on actual case count data, we fit BRS to data simulated using a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (sSIR) model. The sSIR model was used due to its ability to generate realistic time series of disease case counts [

For the sSIR, we first let infections be parameterized by separate infection functions with seasonality, state (epidemic or endemic) and population dependence. sSIR difference equations are then iterated forward in time to provide a simulated time series of infected individuals. Simulated infected individuals were then pre-processed through normalization and differencing, with regime classification conducted by fitting the simulated time series using Bayesian regime switching following the same estimation steps conducted for dengue case counts. The full technical details are provided in
