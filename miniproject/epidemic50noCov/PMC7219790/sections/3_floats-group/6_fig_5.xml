  <title>Posterior predictive check on BRS-3 Lag model.</title>
  <p>Figures from left to right represent: (1) Fitted dengue transmission counts on observed values from the BRS-3 Lag model, with line representing the Y = X function across endemic and epidemic regimes. (2) Dengue transmission counts fitted against dengue transmission counts one week ago, with line representing the Y = X function across endemic and epidemic regimes. (3) Probability density function of dengue transmission counts across endemic and epidemic regimes.</p>
