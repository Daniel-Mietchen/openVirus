<p>One hundred seventy-nine nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from hospitalized patients who exhibited a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes ranging from upper respiratory illness and pneumonia to bronchitis from January to March 2017. Ethical clearance for this study was provided by the Institutional Human Ethics Committee of Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (no. IHEC/1/2013/01). Sample processing was carried out as per WHO guidelines (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> qualitative detection of novel H1N1 2009 virus from respiratory specimens was performed using the Real Star influenza reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) kit 2.0 (Altona GmbH). Out of 179 samples, 25 tested positive for influenza A(H1N1) virus. We report the complete genome sequence of four of these positive samples. All eight gene segments were amplified directly by RT-PCR using the recommended WHO whole-genome overlapping sequencing primers (

Samples were sequenced on an ABI 3500 DNA analyzer. Data were analyzed using sequence scanner software version 2 and aligned using Bio Edit version 7.2.5.
