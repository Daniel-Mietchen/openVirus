<p>All gene segments were aligned against the reference strain A/California/07/2009, along with globally circulating H1N1 strains. Sequence analysis revealed that the 2017 circulating strains from Kerala acquired several mutations over time. We have previously reported two new mutations, S181T and I312V, in the HA gene, which could lead to altered glycan specificity (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). None of the isolates harbored the neuraminidase drug resistance mutations in the NA gene. Similarly, we observed the following point mutations in genes of all four sequenced samples, along with mutations reported during the pandemic season (

 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>): R54K, M66I, D195N, R293K, R299K, V344M, I354L, S453T, and V731I in polymerase basic 2 (PB2); F94L, G154D, I397M, K430R, and I435T in polymerase basic 1 (PB1); X18E, V100I, P224S, N321K, I330V, and R362K in polymerase acidic (PA); D2E, E55K, L90I, I123V, E125D, K131E, and N205S in nonstructural protein (NS); A22T, V100I, M105T, X114E, L122Q, and S498N in nucleoprotein (NP); V80I, M192V, Q208K, and K230R in matrix (M); A13T, S91R, P100S, S101N, D114N, S179N, K180Q, S181T, S202T, A212T, S220T, I233T, A273T, K300E, I312V, I338V, E391K, S468N, E516K, and V544I in hemagglutinin (HA); and V13I, I34V, L40I, N44S, G77R, I188T, N200S, V241I, N248D, V264I, N270K, I314M, I321V, N369K, N386K, K432E, and N449D in neuraminidase (NA).
