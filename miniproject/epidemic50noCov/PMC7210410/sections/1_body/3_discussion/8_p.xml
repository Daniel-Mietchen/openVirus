<p id="p0125">Direct transfusion of B19V-containing blood and blood components can infect a susceptible receptor. In this situation, transfusion transmission is associated to risk of anemia, particularly in vulnerable recipients (non-immune pregnant women and immunosuppressed/transplant patients) in whom different moderate to severe diseases can occur after B19V-induced depletion of erythrocyte precursors [

Even when blood units from B19V viremic donors from our study might have been used for transfusion, reception of more than one blood unit dilute the virus and also passively immunize with neutralizing antibodies. In this situation the risk of B19V transfusion transmission is low, mainly due to the high IgG frequency. However, it should be reminded that is a variable scenario (specific of post-epidemic periods), and both the rate of DNA and specific IgG can fluctuate yearly.
