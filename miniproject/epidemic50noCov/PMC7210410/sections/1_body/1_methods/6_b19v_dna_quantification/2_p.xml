<p id="p0060">After DNA extraction with commercially available columns following the instructions of the manufacturer (Qiagen), B19V DNA in samples identified as positive in the screening assay was tested by a quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). The procedure used a set of primers targeting a fragment of NS1 region from nucleotide 2082 through 2274 on GenBank
