<p id="p0050">Individual plasma samples were randomly recovered from cryopreservation (-70 °C) at the blood bank and transported in biological secure packaging with ice to the Institute of Virology, where nucleic acid were extracted and then kept at -20 °C until testing. Different aliquots of each plasma sample were also conserved at -20 °C to perform serological assays and further independent DNA extraction and quantification.</p>
