<p id="p0010">Human parvovirus B19 (B19V, 
 <italic>Erythroparvovirus primate 1</italic> [
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]) infection is associated with manifestations that vary depending on the host immunological and hematological status, but many infected subjects are asymptomatic or have mild, nonspecific symptoms. The virus tropism for erythroid progenitor cells, the high virus titer during the acute phase of the infection (usually 10
 <sup>6</sup>â€“10
 <sup>7</sup> IU/ml B19V or higher) and the death of infected cells after the viral cycle is complete [

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] can lead to an acute cessation of red blood-cells production causing clinical conditions related to anemia, which can range from moderate to severe, even life-threatening [

 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. B19V is transmitted mainly by respiratory secretions and is mostly a childhood infection [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It can also be transmitted by transfusion, since there is no specific questionnaire to identify or suspect an infection in asymptomatic blood donors that could carry the virus [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, B19V particle is extremely small and lacks an envelope, for which it is an agent difficult to eliminate by conventional methods (detergent, extreme pH, heat, filtration) [
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Transmission, seroconversion, symptomatic and asymptomatic infections have been documented in patients treated with different blood products obtained from plasma and platelet concentrates from apparently healthy donors [
