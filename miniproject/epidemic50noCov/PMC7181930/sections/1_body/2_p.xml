<p>McCarthy is quite the storyteller—he even manages to wrestle drama and excitement out of the institutional review board process—but he is at his best describing the human impact of failing antimicrobial drugs. Healthcare professionals in the trenches with patients will find good therapy here. Professionals, like me, who work on antimicrobial resistance but do not see patients will be reminded why the work is so vital. And professionals who work on other aspects of infectious diseases and wonder whether antimicrobial resistance is overhyped, I implore you to read this important book.</p>
