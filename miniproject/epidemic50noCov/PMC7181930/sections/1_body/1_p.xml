Using the trial as a hook, McCarthy discusses many aspects of antimicrobial resistance, from its origins (historic and within patients) to the history of antimicrobial drugs, medical ethics, medical malpractice, health economics, and perhaps most powerful of all the impact of antimicrobial resistance on individual patients and the physicians who care for them.
