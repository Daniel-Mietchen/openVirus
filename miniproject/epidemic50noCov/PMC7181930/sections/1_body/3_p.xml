<p>Antimicrobial resistance is a complex, multifaceted problem. No magic bullets will make the problem vanish. It will be with us forever. McCarthy, like many, argues that much use of antimicrobial drugs is inappropriate (for example, for farming or viral infections), and of course we should avoid using them when they are unnecessary. Iâ€™d love to understand how much inappropriate use exacerbates the problem created by appropriate use of antimicrobial drugs. I know of no quantitative analysis. It is quite possible that medically appropriate use is the main driver of resistance evolution.</p>
