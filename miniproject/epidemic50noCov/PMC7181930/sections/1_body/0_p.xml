<p>Infectious disease professionals should not be put off by this bookâ€™s title. Sensationalist titles are de rigueur for books aimed at the general public. I do hope the title grabs that audience because the more lay readers who read this book, the better (great gift for families, friends, and especially young persons seeking meaningful careers). However, this book contains plenty of information for professionals, too. And it is a rattling good read that will greatly shorten a long flight.</p>
