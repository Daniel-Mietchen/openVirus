<p>Based on data from the infectious disease surveillance center, HPeV3 epidemics occur every two to three years in Japan (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Interestingly, the HPeV3 epidemics appear to be closely related to the frequency of reports of epidemic myalgia in Japan. Thus, it has been speculated that an outbreak of HPeV3 among children is a necessary background condition for an outbreak of epidemic myalgia in adults (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The positive rate for neutralizing antibodies against HPeV3 has been reported to increase with age until the late teens but seems to decline in older age groups (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Therefore, it has been speculated that individuals between 20 and 40 years old do not have enough neutralizing antibodies, leading to an increase in the prevalence of HPeV3-associated myalgia among them. If this is the case, elderly people may be more likely to develop HPeV3-associated myalgia; however, no such cases have been reported thus far. This may be, at least in part, attributable to the reduced chances of contact between elderly individuals and sick children infected with HPeV3 virus, although whether the elderly are less susceptible to HPeV3 infection or the development of epidemic myalgia due to HPeV3 infection remains unclear.
