<p>Regarding the symptoms, it should be noted that severe myalgia and muscle weakness predominantly occur in the proximal upper and/or lower limbs but are not confined to the torso, as described for epidemic myalgia associated with Bornholm disease caused by Coxsackievirus and Echovirus. One possible mechanism that may underlie such severe myalgia induced by HPeV3 infection has been reported by Nakamura et al. (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The authors measured several cytokines and found that the interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was significantly elevated in patients, suggesting that an elevated IL-6 level may serve as a characteristic finding of severe myalgia. However, the reason underlying the exclusive association between HPeV3 infection and severe myalgia remains unknown, as cytokine levels are elevated in patients with infections induced by other viral infections as well.
