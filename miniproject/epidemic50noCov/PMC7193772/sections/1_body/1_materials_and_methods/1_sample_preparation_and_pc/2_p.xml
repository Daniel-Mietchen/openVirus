<p>Viral genomes were amplified in six overlapping PCR amplicons of roughly 2 kb in length (primer sequences available in 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) using LongAmp polymerase (New England Biolabs) with the following PCR cycling conditions: 30 s at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 94°C, 1 min at 56°C and 2 min 15 s at 65°C, with a final extension for 10 min at 65°C. Primers were designed in regions of the SAV genome conserved between SAV2 and SAV3 (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). All PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel before being excised and purified using Monarch Gel Extraction Kit (New England Biolabs), eluted in 10 μl of elution buffer and stored at −80°C until sequencing.
