<p>Five hundred ng of PCR product from each sample, quantified with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), was used as the input for MinION library preparation with the Ligation Sequencing Kit 1D SQK-LSK109. DNA was end-repaired with NEBNext Ultra II End Repair/dA Tailing kit (New England Biolabs) and purified with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) in a 1:1 ratio before being eluted in 25 μl of nuclease-free water (Sigma-Aldrich). 350 ng of each cleaned DNA sample was barcoded using the Native Barcoding Expansion 1-12 and 13-24 kits (ONT: EXP-NBD104 and EXP-NBD114) and Blunt/TA Ligation Master Mix (New England Biolabs) before being purified with AMPure XP beads in a 1:1 ratio and eluted in 26 μl of nuclease-free water. The barcoded samples were pooled in equal quantities to a total of 250 ng in 45 μl of water. Sequencing adapters (AMII – ONT) were ligated to the DNA using Blunt/TA Ligation Master Mix before being purified with AMPure XP beads in a 1:2 ratio and washed with Short Fragment Buffer (SFP) (ONT) before being eluted in 15 μl of elution buffer. Samples were sequenced in two libraries on separate R9.4.1 MinION flow cells (ONT) (
