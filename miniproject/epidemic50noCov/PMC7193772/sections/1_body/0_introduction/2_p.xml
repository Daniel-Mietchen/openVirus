<p>Six subtypes of SAV have been identified by phylogenetic analysis (SAV1-6) (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Fringuelli et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al., 2012</xref>), which are to some extent separated geographically, with Scotland reporting cases of SAV1, SAV2, SAV4, and SAV5, Ireland reporting cases of SAV1, SAV2, SAV5, SAV6 (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Graham et al., 2012</xref>), and Norway presenting sustained epidemics of SAV2 and SAV3 (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hodneland et al., 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Hjortaas et al., 2013</xref>). Previous work has shown that the different subtypes diverged prior to the onset of modern aquaculture, and that it is likely that each SAV subtype had independent introductions to farmed salmonids (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Karlsen et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, multiple wild fish species testing positive for SAV have been identified as being potential viral reservoirs including common dab (
 <italic>Limanda limanda</italic>), long rough dab (
 <italic>Hippoglossoides platessoides</italic>), European plaice (
 <italic>Pleuronectes platessa</italic>), and ballan wrasse (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bruno et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">McCleary et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Ruane et al., 2018</xref>), with the ancestral source of SAV likely being centered in the North Sea (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Karlsen et al., 2014</xref>). Such discoveries have shown that salmonids are not the exclusive host range of SAV, but is instead present in a range of other fish species, though SAV has not yet been shown to cause mortalities in non-salmonids.
