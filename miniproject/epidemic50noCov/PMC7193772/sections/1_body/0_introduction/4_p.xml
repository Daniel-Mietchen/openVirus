<p>Both the transport of fish stock and passive drift along water currents are suggested to be involved in the spread of SAV strains (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Viljugrein et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is likely that the two routes of viral transmission play roles at different spatial and temporal scales. While passive drift along water currents is probably important in local outbreak clusters and for several years at a time, anthropogenic transport of virus (i.e., the movement of fish stock) may play a more important role in viral transmission across large geographic distances and the seeding of previously uninfected regions. Assuming the major explanatory factor for SAV3 transmission was transport by water currents, we would expect to recover geographically distinct groups of SAV in a phylogenetic analysis, particularly when considering the high evolutionary rate of SAV (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Karlsen et al., 2014</xref>) and length of the SAV3 epidemic in Norway (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Poppe et al., 1989</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Hjortaas et al., 2016</xref>). However, it has not yet been possible to test alternative predictions about SAV transmission routes, as the most recent publicly available genome sequences from Norwegian SAV3 were sampled in 2010 (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Petterson et al., 2013</xref>), leaving the current status of SAV genetic diversity and SAV evolutionary dynamics in Norwegian aquaculture poorly characterized.
