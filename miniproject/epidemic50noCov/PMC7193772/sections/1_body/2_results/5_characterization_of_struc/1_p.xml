<p>Natural SAV3 infections have previously been shown to possess numerous defective genomes characterized by deletion variants (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Petterson et al., 2013</xref>). To further explore this finding, all samples sequenced on the MinION platform were screened for structural variants. The size of deletions detected ranged widely between and within samples, from 11 bp (FR16934408 and FR14304869) to 378 bp (FR14696209). In all but one of the samples (FR14700631) deletions were found, again with a wide range of prevalence (between 1 and 40 deletions per sample). While deletions were found in all genes of the SAV genome, they were not evenly distributed across genes, with relatively fewer deletions detected in the capsid and E3 genes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Several strains from different fish contained the deletions in the same or similar loci (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). While some closely related strains contained similar deletion variants, which may have been transmitted from one fish to another in the event of a viral genome containing an in-frame deletion being packaged into an infective virion (see “Discussion”), there was little phylogenetic signal in the overall distribution of many apparently similar deletions across the tested samples. Additionally, the estimated frequency of commonly observed deletions varied widely across samples, including closely related strains (
