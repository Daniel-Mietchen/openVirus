<p>Heterochronous gene sequences (i.e., sequences sampled at different time points) can be used to infer time-constrained phylogenies, especially those of rapidly evolving RNA viruses. However, for reliable estimation of a time-scaled phylogenetic tree, sequences should contain enough temporal signal to reconstruct the relationship between time and genetic distance (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2016</xref>). To determine whether such an analysis is appropriate for this data, and to estimate the evolutionary rate of SAV3, an analysis on the clock-like behavior of SAV was performed using TempEst. A root-to-tip regression analysis showed that the whole dataset (37 SAV3 genome sequences; 11,861 bp alignment) showed temporal signal (correlation coefficient, 0.765) and was subsequently used to estimate the evolutionary rate of SAV3. The evolutionary history was reconstructed with a relaxed molecular clock and a coalescent skyline population demographic model (

 <sup>–5</sup> substitutions per site, per year (95% highest posterior density [HPD], 5.33 × 10
 <sup>–5</sup>–9.994 × 10
 <sup>–5</sup>).
