<p>We sequenced 24 SAV3-infected fish hearts from Norway using an overlapping PCR amplicon approach and the MinION Nanopore platform (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This resulted in an average coverage of 6,459x across samples (minimum average coverage of 1,089x and maximum average coverage of 12,434x); significantly more than the minimum requirement for high consensus sequence accuracy (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Gallagher et al., 2018</xref>). Of the 24 samples sequenced, near full genomes were recovered from 21 samples (approximately 11,600 bp in length), while partial genomes were recovered from 3 samples (âˆ¼ 9,500 bp). Overall, the SAV sequences generated in this study were found to be highly conserved, with an average nucleotide and amino acid similarity of the SAV3 sequences being 99.7% and 99.8%, respectively.
