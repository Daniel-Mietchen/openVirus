  <title>Interactive overview of dispersal patterns of nonsynonymous mutations prior to and during the 2015–2016 ZIKV epidemic.</title>
  <p>Individual cells to be queried by cursor position (as shown in brown inset adjacent to mutation queried). Readout includes: x mutation information, y sample identification, z # corresponding to color code (i.e. 0 no color, data missing), year mutation was first detected, or in cases where more than one mutation occurs at the residue “different than described” for example mutations at nts 3050, 3458, 6026, 8006, and 10265). X-axis labels include nucleotide location: codon: protein: codon mutation: number of genomes containing that mutation.</p>
