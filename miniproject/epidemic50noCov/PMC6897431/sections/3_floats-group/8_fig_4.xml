  <title>Epidemic-associated mutations tend to occur in exposed regions of Zika proteins.</title>
  <p>Protein “hydrophobicity surface” representation of Zika proteins Pr, E, NS1, NS3, and NS5 using Kyte-Doolittle scale [
   <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and the coloring scheme from blue (hydrophilic) to red (hydrophobic), with white color representing neutral residues. For a given mutation, a difference in hydrophobicity score between initial residue and the mutation is indicated by a change in the color intensity used as text background. For example, light red for lower and dark red for higher hydrophobicity, and light blue for lower and dark blue for higher hydrophilicity. Exposed regions of listed mutations are circled and colored in green. Plots were constructed using Chimera software. (A) Model of the Pr protein with epidemic mutations first detected in 2013: Val1Ala, Ser17Asn. (B) E protein with high abundance epidemic mutation Val473Met (observed in 387 sequences; see 
   <xref rid="pone.0225699.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) first detected in 2013, and two mutations, Asp393Glu and Thr487Met, first observed in pre-emergent samples from Thailand in 2006, Cambodia in 2010, Philippines in 2012 and French Polynesia in 2013. (C) Homodimer conformation of the NS1 protein (chain B colored in yellow). Mutations Met349Val, Gly100Ala, and Arg324Trp are from different subclusters: 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, respectively (

   <xref rid="pone.0225699.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Mutation Tyr122His first detected in Haiti 2014 and Brazil 2015, and a group of three exposed mutations and in close vicinity to each other with significant amino acid property change observed: Trp98Gly, Lys146Glu, and Val264Met. (D) NS3 protein showing 4 microcephaly associated mutations Thr566Ala, Thr567Ile, Met572Leu and Tyr584His, with predicted location in the interface with NS5, and His355Tyr mutation first detected in Haiti 2014, Brazil 2015, and not detected in French Polynesia. (E) NS5 protein showing critical outbreak mutation 114Val (forms Cluster 1;
