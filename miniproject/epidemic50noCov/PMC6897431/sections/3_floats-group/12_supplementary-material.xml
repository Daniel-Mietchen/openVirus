  <title>Dispersal patterns of nonsynonymous mutations according to country and year.</title>
  <p>The number of whole genome sequences present in detected in 3 or more sequences in GenBank and ViPR databases for each epidemic-associated mutation were tabulated to allow easy visualization of similarities in time, location, and number of cases between mutations. The first column identifies each mutation according to nt site: codon: protein: residue #: amino acid. Cells are colored according to number of genome sequences with the mutation (red, yellow, green: high, medium, low). Country names are abbreviated using the first 5 letters of the name or common abbreviation. AA- amino acid; Imporâ€“Imported case.</p>
