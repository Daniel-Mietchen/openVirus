  <title>Compilation and comparison of nonsynonymous mutations according to protein structural context, and prevalence prior to and during the 2015–2016 ZIKV epidemic.</title>
  <p>Genome coordinates such as nucleotide site are numbered according to reference sequence PRVABC-59, accession # KU501215. Amino acid mutations are listed by polyprotein residue (“PolyRes”), and gene (“Residue”) information, and data from protein structural analysis. Mutation frequencies are listed according to year, frequency, and percent of genomes with the mutation. Column “2006–2017” shows cumulative data from 2006–2017. Other abbreviations: SS–residue is in a secondary structure element, C—coil, E—strand, H—helix; AC–residue is in an exposed region (0 = no; 1 = yes); EP–residue is in a region predicted to be an epitope (0 = no; 1 = yes). Ref AA- Amino acid present in 1966 Malaysian strain; Epi AA- Amino acid mutation present in pre-emergent (Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines) or epidemic strains. Standard single-letter amino acid and nucleotide codes are used where applicable.</p>
