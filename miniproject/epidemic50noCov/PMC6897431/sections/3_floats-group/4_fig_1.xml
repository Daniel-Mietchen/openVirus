  <title>Overview of dispersal patterns of nonsynonymous mutations prior to and during the 2015–2016 ZIKV epidemic.</title>
  <p>Mutations that are detected in 5 or more genome sequences are shown on the x axis and are listed in order of number of sequences with the mutation (high to low; 398–5). The y axis represents data from 408 ZIKV genomes and due to the number of genomes the genome names are not shown in this condensed version of the figure; see Figs 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g002">2</xref> and 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g003">3</xref>. Cells are colored according to year in which a given mutation was first detected in a ZIKV genome sequence, as shown in legend located in the lower right corner of the figure. Mutation data from Asian strain genomes are condensed to allow mutations to be grouped according to co-occurrence, prevalence, and persistence. 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225699.s001">S1</xref> and 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225699.s002">S2</xref> Figs include interactive versions of the data spreadsheet enabling individual cells to be queried by cursor position (as shown in brown inset adjacent to mutation queried). Readout includes: x mutation information, y sample identification, z # corresponding to color code (i.e. 0 no color, data missing), year mutation was first detected, or in cases where more than one mutation occurs at the residue “different than described” for example mutations at nts 3050, 3458, 6026, 8006, and 10265). X-axis labels include nucleotide location: codon: protein: codon mutation: number of genomes containing that mutation.
