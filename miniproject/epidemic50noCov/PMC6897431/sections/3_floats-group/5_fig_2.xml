  <title>Overview of the dispersal patterns of nonsynonymous mutations within all sequences from Cluster 0.</title>
  <p>Subsection of the graph from 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g001">Fig 1</xref> showing higher resolution of mutation patterns within the Cluster 0. Cluster 0 is defined by NS5 mutation Thr114Met (marked by a star) first detected in 2006. Mutation accession numbers, year, host type, country and number of mutations detected in genomes are listed on the y axis. Genomes listed in the y axis are listed in order that best illustrates mutation clusters. Y-axis labels include: Accession number. year. species. geographic location the mutation was identified: total number of mutations identified in that genome compared to the reference genome (Malaysia 1966).
