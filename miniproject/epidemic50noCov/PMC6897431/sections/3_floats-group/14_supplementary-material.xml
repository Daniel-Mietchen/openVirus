  <title>List of nonsynonymous mutations according to Asian lineage strains of the 2006–2017 ZIKV.</title>
  <p>Amino acid epidemic related mutations (“Epi_AA”) are listed by gene name (“Gene”) and a residue number (“Residue”) for each ZIKV strain within which they are observed. Genome coordinates such as a nucleotide site (“Nt”) and a residue number within a gene are numbered according to reference sequence PRVABC-59, accession # KU501215. A number of genomes (“2006_17_Number_of_strains_with_Epi_AA_mutation”) where a particular mutation is observed is also listed.</p>
