<p>RT-PCR products that were generated with each primer set (1 kb set and 2 kb set) were processed separately to enable primer output to be assessed. The 12 kb amplicons were sonicated using an M220 ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) and final sheared sizes ranged from 144 to 186 bp with an average size of 164 bp. Libraries were prepared using the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free LT Library Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following standard manufacturerâ€™s protocols with the exception of the bead-based library size selection steps in which 150 bp sized libraries were selected instead of the standard kit sizes. Indexed samples were pooled and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq system with the MiSeq V2 sequencing kit utilizing 2 X 150 bp paired-end reads. Sequences were de-multiplexed and trimmed using the Illumina bcl2fastq conversion software. Error rate due to PCR and sequencing was controlled for using a plasmid control of known sequence and overlapping read pair analysis as described previously [
