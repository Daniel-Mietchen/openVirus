<p>In an attempt to characterize possible phenotypic changes that could be induced by specific mutations (i.e. if they are located within functional sites, binding sites or interfaces between interacting molecules), a large number of structural models of ZIKV proteins (with and without mutations) were constructed in their monomeric, oligomeric states and formed complexes. For those of ZIKV proteins for which a set of “good” homology (at least 50% of sequence identity, and 50% coverage) structural templates from Protein Data Bank (PDB) were detected, structural models were constructed using the homology based structural modeling system AS2TS ([

A list of primary templates from PDB used for modeling ZIKV proteins: Capsid, Pr, M-E (complex), NS1, NS3, and NS5 included respectively: 5z0r, 6idi, 6co8, 5k6k, 5y4z, and 5u0b. For proteins NS2A, NS2B, NS4A, and NS4B for which low coverage or no homology to protein structures from current PDB was detected, a number of additional “threading-based” and “de novo” models were constructed using I-TASSER and QUARK servers ([

These additional constructed models were used to assess confidence in predictions of spatial location of mutations identified in proteins with low or no homology to reliable structural templates.
