<p>Created structural models were analyzed to assess the possibility of conformational changes implied by the identified epidemic mutations, and to estimate the level of possible sequence variability in detected structurally conserved regions. Structure alignments were calculated using the program LGA (Local Global Alignment) [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and evaluation of structural similarities between ZIKV proteins and related structures from PDB was performed by StralSV sequence/structure variability evaluation system [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. StralSV identifies structurally similar protein structure fragments in the PDB for any given structural motif, evaluates calculated structure-based alignments between the query motif and the fragments, and quantifies observed sequence variability at each residue position. This helps detection of other proteins (sometimes from more distant organisms) in which a similar structural motif with a given substitution was observed and characterized. For proteins with specific mutations additional structural models were also constructed and processed.
