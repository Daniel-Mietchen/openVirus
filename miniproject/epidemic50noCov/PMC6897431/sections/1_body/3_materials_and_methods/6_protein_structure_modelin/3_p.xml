<p>The collected genomic sequences and results from sequence and structure-based analyses were processed using the GeneSV system to identify unique (outbreak related) mutations and their context within ZIKV genome (i.e. sequence/structure variability and conservation regions, surface exposure). Examples of the GeneSV output is provided in
