<p>In a study performed at the California National Primate Research Center, and approved by the University of California Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, a pregnant rhesus macaque (
 <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) was inoculated intramniotically and intravenously in the first trimester at gestation day 41 (term is 165 days). The inoculum was 5.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU of ZikaSPH2015 in 1 ml of RPMI1640 medium and was injected intravenously (IV) to simulate direct IV mosquito feeding in the saphenous vein of the animal under aseptic conditions. The same dose was also administered just after the IV inoculation via ultrasound-guided intra-amniotic inoculation under aseptic conditions. Clinical data and viral RNA tropism are described elsewhere [
