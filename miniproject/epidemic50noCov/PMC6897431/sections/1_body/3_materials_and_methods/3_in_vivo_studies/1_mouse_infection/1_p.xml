<p>These studies were carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the 
 <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> and the National Institute of Health. All efforts were made to minimize suffering of animals. All animals were housed in ABSL2 conditions in an AAALAC-accredited facility, and the protocol was approved by the LLNL Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which includes ethics in evaluation of protocols. Inbred, barrier-housed, specific pathogen-free C57Bl/6J mice were obtained from (Stock 000664), and acclimated for one week prior to experiments. Six-week old, male mice were treated with an Ifnar1blocking mouse mAb (MAR15A3, Cat# I401, low endotoxin-formula, Leinco Technologies) [

At 7 days post-infection, tissues were collected immediately after euthanasia (brain, testis, spleen) and stored in RNA-Later (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions until RNA isolation and RNA analysis. RNA was extracted from mouse tissues using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions, after being homogenized in lysis buffer using 1.5 and 3.0 mm Zirconium Lysis BeadBug beads and a BeadBug 3 homogenizer (Benchmark Scientific, Edison, NJ).
