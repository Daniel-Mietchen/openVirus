<p>A set of all available ZIKV complete genome sequences was collected from GenBank and ViPR databases. The sequences of Asian lineage strains were split into three groups: unassociated with the recent emergence of ZIKV (Asian strain Malaysia 1966 (accession # KX377336)), “pre-emergent strains”, and Asian genomes associated with the epidemic. The genomic sequence PRVABC-59 (accession # KU501215) was selected as a reference sequence in all comparisons to provide uniform genome coordinates (position numbering) for nucleotide sites, polyprotein residue, protein residue information, and data from protein structural analysis. Asian strain Malaysia 1966 (accession # KX377336) was used as a distant progenitor for comparison and was used as a reference to identify all mutations for further evaluation. Protein sequence-based and structure-based position conservation analyses were performed on all protein sequences collected from evaluated genome sequences (see section below, “Protein structure modeling”). Selected results from calculated characteristics of “epidemic related” mutations are provided in
