<p>ZIKV strain PRVABC59 (Human/2015/Puerto Rico) was obtained from BEI Resources (NR50240 ZIKV). The complete genomic sequence of PRVABC59 has been determined (GenBank: KU501215), and the complete coding sequence of NR50240 has also been determined (GenBank: KX087101). The PRVABC59 virus stock was passaged a total of 5 times in Vero cells prior to sequencing according to the GenBank description of KX087101. The ZikaSPH2012015 (GenBank: KU321639.1) was obtained from Mike Busch at Blood Systems Research Institute and was originally isolated from a transfusion recipient in Brazil in 2015. This strain was passaged 3 times in Vero cells prior to use in this study.</p>
