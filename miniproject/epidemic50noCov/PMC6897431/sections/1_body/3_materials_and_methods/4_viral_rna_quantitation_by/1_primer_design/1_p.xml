<p>Primer sets were assembled that spanned a majority of the genome yielding RTPCR products of 1 or 2 kb, and which overlapped by approximately 100 nt. Primer sets included primers described in literature [

Two distinct multiplexed primer sets were used to enable each region of the genome to be covered by at two different primer sets. Because we mixed subsets of primers and primers from different publications into multiplexed reactions occasionally new primers needed to be designed. The additional primers were designed to perform as two highly multiplexed reactions as described in Gardner
