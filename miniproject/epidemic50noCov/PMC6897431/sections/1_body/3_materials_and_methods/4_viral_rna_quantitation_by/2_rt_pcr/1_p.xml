<p>Reverse transcription was performed using random hexamers and the Superscript III RT reverse transcriptase kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Viral cDNA templates were amplified using Q5
 <sup>®</sup> Hot Start High Fidelity 2X Master Mix (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), following manufacturer’s instructions. PCR conditions consisted of 98°C for 30 s, followed by 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 60°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 1 min. The final cycle was 72°C for 2 min. PCR products were prepared for sequencing using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Aarhus, Denmark).
