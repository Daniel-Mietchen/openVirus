<p>Combining prevalence and persistence data with information derived from protein structural modeling may provide unique context in regard which mutations may play key roles in the epidemic phenotype. For example, early in this study, protein structure analysis of mutations in both dimer and hexamer states for NS1 predicted that mutations which were associated with a microcephaly case mostly occur on exposed regions of the protein. Exceptions include Gly100Ala which occurs in a sidechain buried within the protein, and two mutations Ala188Val and Thr233Ala that are in the interface between subunits (

Mutation 188Val (buried within the interface) was of particular interest as it was first detected in Thailand and French Polynesia in 2013 and was maintained throughout the epidemic, thus is a mutation that defines the epidemic genotype. Recently 188Val has been shown to impact viral phenotype, increasing the replication rate in mosquitoes and decreasing host interferon response [

 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Mutation Val264Met is an example of highly abundant and surface exposed mutation that is also predicted to be antigenic. It was first detected in Cambodia in 2010 and thus was circulating well before the onset of the epidemic so its relevance is less obvious.
