<p>In the present study a combination of sequence and structure based analyzes was used to identify common features of mutations associated with epidemic spread. Protein structural analysis of mutations detected in Asian linage ZIKV strains collected between 2010 and 2017 was performed to determine if the mutations that were highly transmitted in 2016 were more likely to be surface exposed (solvent accessible) or buried within the protein. Notably, most (38/45) of the mutations associated with the epidemic transmission occurred in exposed residues (
