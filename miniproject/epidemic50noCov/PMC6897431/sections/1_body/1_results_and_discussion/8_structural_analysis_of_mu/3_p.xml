<p>Protein structure analysis of highly transmitted mutations (occurred in 20 or more cases in 2016) showed that these mutations were more likely to occur on the surface of the protein as compared to those mutations that were not seen during 2016 or detected in fewer than 5 cases (p = 0.096, Mann Whitney two tailed t test). Interestingly, several of the mutations including 4 associated with microcephaly cases (Thr566Ala (Guatemala, 2016), Thr567Ile (Cuba, 2017), Met572Leu (Mexico, 2016), Tyr584His (Brazil, 2015)) occur in the exposed region of NS3 (residues 565–584) that interfaces with NS5 (residues 317–338) and may impact replication [
