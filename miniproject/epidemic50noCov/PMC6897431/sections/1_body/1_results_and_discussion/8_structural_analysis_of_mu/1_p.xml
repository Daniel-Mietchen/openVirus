<p>Computational system, GeneSV [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], was used to facilitate assessment of regions of sequence/structure variability in ZIKV genomic sequences. Such assessments may be very valuable especially for RNA viruses, which are characterized by high mutation rates and presence in highly diverse populations. The GeneSV system combines information from a large variety of sources and processes information from all 3 types of data: genomic sequences, corresponding protein sequences as well as homologous protein sequences, and protein structures taken (if available) from Protein Data Bank (PDB) or constructed using AS2TS homology-based protein structure modeling system [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Generated results aid functional annotation of genomes, predict potential nucleic and amino acid mutations not observed in current databases, and may be useful for prioritization of mutations for further study using reverse genetics.
