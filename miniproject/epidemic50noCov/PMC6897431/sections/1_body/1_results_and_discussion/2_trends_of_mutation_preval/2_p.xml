<p>Hundreds of mutations that emerged in the genome of ZIKV as the Asian lineage spread from French Polynesia to Haiti and Brazil, and then to other countries in South, Central, and North America, and beyond [

A set of 408 complete genome sequences was collected and evaluated, and 544 nonsynonymous mutations were identified for further analysis. Mutations in the 5’ and 3’ UTR of the genome were not included in the database, nor were synonymous mutations.

 <xref rid="pone.0225699.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>, subsets of genome variants were organized according to geographical location and number of whole genome sequences in GenBank or ViPR that carry the variant, illustrating trends of co-dispersal of mutations associated with the 2015–2016 epidemic. Because it is not known if Asian lineage strains circulating prior to the French Polynesia outbreak are capable of causing microcephaly in humans, genomes from Thailand 2006, Cambodia 2010, Philippines 2012, and Thailand 2013 are included in the analysis as “pre-emergent strains” (in the context of the 2015–16 epidemic) and compared along with the later Asian genomes associated with epidemic. Asian strain Malaysia 1966 was used as a distant progenitor for comparison and considered to be unassociated with the recent emergence of ZIKV.
