<p>Analysis of ZIKV genomes show distinct patterns of emergence of nonsynonymous mutations in the years prior to the epidemic, as has been previously described [

 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, as the number of genome sequences in databases such as GenBank increase well into the hundreds, patterns of dispersal become harder to decipher using conventional methods such as dendrograms, and it is difficult to discern the impact of gaps in sequence data. Thus, a process was developed for organizing large sets of sequence data enabling patterns of emergence and spread of mutations associated with the 2015â€“2016 outbreak to be readily visualized, as well as gaps in whole genome sequence data to be shown.
