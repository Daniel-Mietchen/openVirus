<p>Two of the high frequency variants, Env Val330Lys and NS1 Trp98Gly, that were detected in the tissues of multiple mice (
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), were also observed as high frequency variants in a recent study by Duggal, et al., 2019 which described the passage of the same ZIKV strain, PRVABC59, in immunocompromised AG129 mice. Interestingly, the study used reverse genetics to show that the 330Leu variant had an attenuated phenotype in mice, and concluded that the Env 330Leu/NS1 98Gly genotype was enriched during passage in Vero cells and less pathogenic in mice. Thus, our data demonstrate that variant data is reproducible between laboratories and study parameters and may detect variants that impact viral pathogenicity.
