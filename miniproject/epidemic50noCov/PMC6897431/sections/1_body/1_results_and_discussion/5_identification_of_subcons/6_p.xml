 <xref rid="pone.0225699.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>) showed that while most mutations present in the stock were also detected in the mouse tissues, NS4A residues 75 and 78 (polyprotein residues 2194 and 2197, nts 6688 and 6696) had high frequency variants present at 31.5% and 30.7%, respectively that were not found in any of the mouse tissues indicating that they may be selected against during passage in mice. These NS4A variants, Asn75Lys and Ile78Thr, are also present in both amniotic fluid samples, days 2 and 7, as well as the Brazil 2015 GenBank reference sequence (accession # KU321639), thus were not selected against during passage in the macaque. NS4A is a small, hydrophobic protein, and is not well characterized with little structural data are available, so the potential impact of these mutations is unknown. Interestingly, an analogous mutation occurs with WNV with NS4A position 6687 mutating from a His to Gly after passage in mosquito cells, thus for both ZIKV and WNV there is a fluctuation at this residue between a positively charged residue and polar uncharged residue [
