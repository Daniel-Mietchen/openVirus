<p>High frequency variants were present in the stock of both viral strains, however many of the variants detected in the tissue samples were not present in the stock suggesting that these sites readily mutate during

 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], variants detected in the stock used in this study may have arisen due to laboratory passage [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Alternatively, because the GenBank sequence data for KU501215 is limited to consensus data, these variants may have been in the original clinical sample as subconsensus variants but not included in the GenBank consensus data. Understanding the diversity of the mutant spectrum in clinical samples is important for understanding which mutations arise
