<p>To identify if any of the epidemic associated mutations represent “hot spots” of diversity in the genome, deep Illumina sequencing was performed on two different ZIKV strains after passage 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. A 2015 strain of ZIKV from Brazil (strain ZIKV/H.sapiens-tc/BRA/2015/Brazil_SPH2015, KU321639.1) was analyzed prior to and after passage in a pregnant macaque. Additionally, deep sequence data were obtained for a 2015 strain, PRVABC59 (accession # KU501215), from Puerto Rico before and after passage in mice dosed with Ifnar1 blocking mouse mAb (MAR1-5A3) which blocks the IFN-α/β response. PRVABC59 is a strain used in many animal infections and has been passaged multiple times in cell culture prior to the infections. However, passage in animals introduces selection pressures absent from cell culture and thus may more accurately reflect intrahost variability circulating in nature as compared to sequence data from serially passaged samples. Although necessary for productive infection, the use of mice with a compromised IFN-α/β response does introduce unnatural biases that may impact the range of variants detected in the tissues. For example, mAb MAR1-5A3 does not cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently, and this may impact viral replication in brain tissue [
