<p>Genomic sequence data generally is limited to the dominant, “consensus”, sequence, however, because RNA viruses exist within a host as genetically diverse “mutant spectra” viral phenotype is affected by both consensus and variant (“subconsensus”) genotypes. In some cases variants are present at high frequency, occasionally becoming consensus; thus minor shifts in variant frequencies can sporadically affect the consensus sequence leading to an overestimation of genetic differences between isolates. This is particularly likely at regions of the genome that are known to be hypervariable. Variants can also persist at low levels within a host and serve as a reservoir of emergent genotypes, or alternatively may represent remnants of an ancestral genotype [

The advent of next generation sequencing technology has provided a window into the dynamics of the mutant spectra and thus may reveal unique insight into mechanisms of genotype emergence, and may provide insight into the trajectory of an outbreak.
