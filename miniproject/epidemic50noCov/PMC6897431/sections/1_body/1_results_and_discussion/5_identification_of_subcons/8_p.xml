<p>Insertions and deletions are often detected as variants, sometimes in multiple samples and studies. For example, an insertion at nt 117â€“118 causing a single nucleotide frameshift in the capsid protein at residue 7 is observed in a number of samples. This mutation was detected in samples from the macaque (amniotic fluid, 1.7% and 7.7%), 2 of the mouse spleen samples (1.8% and 1.2%) as well as in the sequence data from the French Polynesia strain (2.2%) in the SRA (Bioproject PRJNA316976).</p>
