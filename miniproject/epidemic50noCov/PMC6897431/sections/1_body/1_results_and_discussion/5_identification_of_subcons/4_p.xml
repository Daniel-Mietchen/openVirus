<p>RT-PCR amplicons were generated from RNA extracted from tissue samples from a ZIKV-infected pregnant rhesus macaque [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and from infected male mice (dosed with anti-IFNAR1 antibody MAR1-5A3, as described). These samples were deep sequenced and data were compared for the presence of variants that resulted in an amino acid change. These analyses indicated that 17 residues and 2 insertions had variants present at &gt;1% in two or more samples tested. Six variants were present only in the macaque tissues, 7 variants were present only in the mouse samples, and 6 variants were present in tissues from both hosts (
