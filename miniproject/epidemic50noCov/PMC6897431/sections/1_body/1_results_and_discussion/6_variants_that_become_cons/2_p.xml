<p>Some residues had two or more variants present, indicating the propensity of the protein to tolerate variation at this site. For example, at NS1 residue 98 (polyprotein residue 892; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) a macaque amniotic fluid sample had a Trp98Arg mutation detected at low level. Interestingly, a low frequency 98Arg mutation has also been detected in a human clinical sample [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, in mouse samples, a Trp98Gly variant was detected at very high frequency (10.8%-99.5%) in all nine mouse tissue samples tested and became consensus sequence in five of these samples. One consensus sequence from Puerto Rico 2015 also had a Gly mutation present at this residue (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225699.s004">S2 Table</xref>). Protein structural modeling indicates that this residue is exposed, thus these mutations may occur in response to interaction with the host immune system. Interestingly, neighboring mutation Gly100Ala becomes consensus during the outbreak and increases in prevalence from 8 to 24% from 2015â€“16 (
