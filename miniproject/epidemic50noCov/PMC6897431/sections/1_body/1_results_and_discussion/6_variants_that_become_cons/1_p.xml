<p>To determine if mutations associated with the 2015â€“2016 epidemic also exist as variants, variant sequence data from laboratory stock derived from human cases and from our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were compared to consensus data deposited in GenBank. Additionally, when available, deep sequence data from pre-outbreak strains (i.e. Univ. Wisconsin Bioproject PRJNA316976) were queried for the presence of variants that became consensus during the epidemic. Subconsensus mutations were detected throughout the genome, and many appeared in multiple samples and in some cases become consensus. For example, at nt 860, a variant in M protein residue, Phe37Leu, is detected at approximately 1.6% in one macaque amniotic fluid sample, and is consensus in a single sequence from an epidemic sample from 2016, but does not persist as consensus in other epidemic samples. Data from Univ. of Wisconsin Bioproject PRJNA413108 shows that a Puerto Rico ZIKV laboratory strain has 37Leu at 17% and the variant was also detected in stock of Paraiba strain at 9.4% [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], thus indicating that this mutation may be present as a variant in a variety of sample types but seldom reaches consensus.
