<p>NS2B residue 32 (polyprotein residue 1404), shows significant variation at the consensus and subconsensus level. Mutations Met32Val and Met32Ile are detected in both the macaque and mouse tissue, at up to 40% and 26%, respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Interestingly, Illumina deep sequence data available from a 2013 French Polynesia strain also showed a Met32Ile mutation detected at 5% (Bioproject PRJNA316976). These mutations did become consensus in several epidemic samples, in particular 4 sequences from 2015 and 3 from 2016 show an Ile as consensus, and one 2016 sample had Val as consensus (
