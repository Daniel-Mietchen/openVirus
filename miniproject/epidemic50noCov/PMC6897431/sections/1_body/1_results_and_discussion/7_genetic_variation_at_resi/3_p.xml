<p>NS1 mutation Arg324Trp (polyprotein residue 1118) was observed in a single sample from Brazil but spread extensively to other countries during the outbreak, in particular Colombia as shown in Cluster 1.3 and 
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. A different amino acid, 324Gln, was detected in several 2016 cases, however, only 324Trp mutation was detected as a variant in macaque amniotic and vaginal tissues at 2.0% and 11.1% (
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>), respectively. Interestingly SRA data from Bioproject PRJNA316976 show the 324Trp mutation present in an infected macaque at 6.5%, but not in the French Polynesia stock used to initiate the infection. Protein structure analysis shows residue 324 is exposed on the surface of NS1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and a mutation from a charged residue, Arg, to a nonpolar amino acid, Trp, may impact protein-protein interactions.
