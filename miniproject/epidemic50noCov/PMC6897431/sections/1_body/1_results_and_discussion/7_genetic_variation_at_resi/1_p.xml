<p>Many of the mutations that characterize the ZIKV 2015â€“2016 epidemic genotype show variation at the subconsensus level. In some cases, an amino acid that was previously consensus in pre-outbreak samples was detected at subconsensus levels in epidemic strains. For example, nt 473, Pr residue 1, changes from a Val to an Ala in 2013, and Ala persists during the outbreak as consensus. Interestingly one amniotic sample from the ZIKV-infected macaque has a Val present at 1% indicating that ancestral variants may be present at low frequency. Additionally, Val is present at 3.5% in data from a macaque infected with the French Polynesia strain from Bioproject PRJNA316976.</p>
