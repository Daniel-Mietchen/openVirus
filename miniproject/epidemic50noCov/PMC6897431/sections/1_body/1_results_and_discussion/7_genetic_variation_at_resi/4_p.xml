<p>The NS1 mutation 349Val (polyprotein residue1143) emerged in 2014 and spread extensively during the epidemic (
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), however this residue varies in consensus and variant sequences of pre-epidemic and epidemic strains. For example, strains from Africa, Malaysia, Cambodia, and French Polynesia have Met349 as consensus, whereas 2014 strains from Haiti have either Met or Val, as do outbreak strains from Brazil. Interestingly, Val at residue 349 has been associated with at least 4 microcephaly cases (3 Brazil 2015 and 1 Cuba 2017) [

 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Deep sequence data show that this residue also varies at the subconsensus level, but not necessarily reflecting the pre-outbreak amino acid, Val. For example, analysis of the Illumina data from the 2013 French Polynesia strain (Univ. of Wisconsin Bioproject PRJNA316976) show a Thr variant present at 7.3% in stock virus and up to 10.4% after passage in macaques. Our data from macaque passage of the Brazil 2015 strain (accession # KU321639) shows Met349Lys at 7.4% to 15.5% in amniotic samples and at 8.8% in vagina samples (
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). The mutational profile of the Paraiba strain shows a Val to Ala mutation at a frequency of 4.2% [

 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] shows that residue 349 is exposed on the protein surface (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), thus it is possible that this residue is variable in response to host immune selection pressures. Reverse genetics studies using
