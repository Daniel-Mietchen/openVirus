<p>Sequence data from 408 consensus sequences and 544 mutations were organized into tables to illustrate the different temporal and geographical dispersal patterns and allow comparison of specific mutations (Tables

To visualize patterns of co-occurring mutations across the entire viral genome coding region, mutation data from Asian lineage genomes were condensed and sorted to allow mutations to be grouped according to co-occurrence, prevalence, and persistence (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g003">3</xref>). This organization of data enables observations to be made in regard to regions of the genome undergoing nonsynonymous mutation in the years leading up to the epidemic and as the epidemic progressed. For example, graphing of mutations at the amino acid level show that six mutations, NS1 Tyr122His and Met349Val, NS3 His355Tyr, and NS5 114Val (but not 114Met), Ile322Val, and Asp878Glu, were first detected in Haiti and not detected in French Polynesia in 2013 or in any of the pre-epidemic strains (

 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], which indicated that ZIKV was circulating in Haiti in 2013, prior to emergence in Brazil. Three of these mutations, NS1 349Val, and NS5 322Val and 878Glu, were detected in relatively low numbers in Brazil but subsequently became more abundant in the Dominican Republic and USA. In addition to these genotypes being highly prevalent, as the outbreak unfolded, these mutations persisted and were all detected in one or more samples from Cuba 2017. In the case of NS5 residue 114,
