<p>ZIKV sequence data from publicly available databases and generated as part of this study were organized to look for patterns of mutation at multiscale levels. At the macroscale level, consensus sequence data were organized into large and interactive databases to allow the spread of individual mutations and combinations of mutations to be visualized and assessed for temporal and geographical patterns. At the microscale level, data from deep Illumina sequencing was used to analyze subconsensus mutations (“variants”) for the presence of epidemic-associated mutations in pre-epidemic samples (2006–2014), and for persistent and prevalent variants that may play a role in quasispecies phenotype and/or the emergence of novel genotypes. Finally, mutations were examined at the protein structure level to look for molecular characteristics of mutations associated with epidemic-associated mutations.</p>
