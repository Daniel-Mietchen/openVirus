<p>Although the clusters described in this study are similar to phylogenetic groupings from the outbreak described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the sheer number of samples associated with large outbreaks makes more subtle patterns of mutations difficult to visualize. This problem becomes more significant as rapid whole genome sequencing of hundreds of samples becomes the norm. Observations derived from relatively small subgroups such as these shown in this graphic representation of the large ZIKV data set may serve as starting points for hypothesis formation, particularly if there is metadata associated with sequences. For example, within Cluster 1.1 there is a group of 12 sequences that notably have two amino acids unchanged from the ancestral 1966 Malaysian strain at 2 NS5 positions, Ile322 and Asp878, and 3 of these sequences are obtained from microcephaly cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g003">Fig 3</xref>) suggesting this genotype be particularly virulent. Thus this combination of mutations may be interesting to target for reverse genetic characterization.
