<p>This graphic representation of large sets of sequencing data clearly shows combinations of mutations that were first detected in 2013 (Pr Val1Ala and Ser17Asn, Env Val473Met, NS1 Ala188Val, NS3 Tyr584His) and especially NS5 Thr114Val 2014 were turning point mutations and subsequently became an integral part of the epidemic genotype. This group of genomes (Cluster 1) can be divided into four subgroups defined by three sets of specific mutations first detected in 2014 and 2015. Cluster 1.1 consisting of ~100 genomes (mostly Haiti, Brazil, Dominican Republic, and USA—Florida) is characterized by one additional 2014 mutation: NS1 Met349Val. Cluster 1.2 of ~100 genomes (mostly Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua) is defined by three 2015 mutations: NS1 Gly100Ala, NS3 Met572Leu, and NS5 Arg525Cys. Cluster 1.3 (~60 genomes; mostly Colombia, Panama, and Venezuela) can be identified by three 2015 mutations: Capsid Asp107Glu, NS1 Arg324Trp, and NS5 Thr833Ala. And finally, the Cluster 1.4 (~100 genomes; mostly Brazil, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela) can be defined based on the absence of any of the above listed mutations (Clusters 1.1–1.3), i.e. showing the same residues at these positions as observed in the ancestral 1966 Malaysia strain. Other mutations that were detected early in the epidemic did not spread as extensively and occurred in only a handful of cases as shown by the scattered mutations on the right side of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g001">Fig 1</xref>. While those mutations that first occurred late in 2016 may have had limited transmission due to herd immunity, others may have reduced viral fitness that limited spread.
