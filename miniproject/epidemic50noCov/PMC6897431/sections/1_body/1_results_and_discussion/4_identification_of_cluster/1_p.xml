 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g001">Fig 1</xref> illustrates the condensed version of the mutation dispersal data from 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225699.s003">S1 Table</xref> graphed according to the number of genomes with each mutation and the year in which the mutation was first observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g001">Fig 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225699.s001">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225699.s002">S2</xref> Figs). This graphic representation allows clusters of mutations to be readily discerned, for example, the emergence of NS5 114Val in 2014 (and subsequent replacement of NS5 114Met which sequences form Cluster 0, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g002">Fig 2</xref>), as well as smaller clusters of mutations that occurred from 2014 to 2016, are defined by the subsets of strains in which the mutation was detected. Because whole genome data from 408 Zika genomes are included in the graph individual data points can be defined by moving the cursor over the graph (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225699.s001">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225699.s002">S2</xref> Figs). By zooming in, the graph allows individual genomes to be identified on the x axis thus allowing data points to be attributed to individual genomes from Cluster 0 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and Cluster 1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This allows clusters of mutations to be defined by prevalence, date, and location. For example, a group on the upper right of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g001">Fig 1</xref> were first detected in 2016 (light green bars) but did not spread extensively. By zooming in and identifying the group of sequences that had these mutations, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225699.g002">Fig 2</xref>, one can see that these mutations were largely confined to islands in Polynesia and to Fiji. Thus, it is likely that the limited spread may have been influenced due to island location, and possibly reduced fitness associated with the mutation.
