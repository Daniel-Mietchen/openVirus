<p>As is the case with all viruses with RNA genomes, ZIKV mutates rapidly due to its highly error prone RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase. The high mutation rate of RNA viruses increases the ability of these viruses to adapt to diverse hosts and cause new human and zoonotic diseases [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Among RNA viruses, arboviruses such as ZIKV are notable for having a relatively conserved consensus sequence, which changes more slowly compared to other RNA viruses due to the requirement for arboviruses to replicate efficiently in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the relatively limited evolution rate of the consensus sequence masks the presence of viral variants within the sample that influence viral virulence and transmission cycles and which are constantly in flux in response to environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0225699.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In fact, viral virulence may change in the absence of mutation in the consensus sequence but rather due to changes in the composition of the intra-host subconsensus genotypes (referred to as “mutant spectra” or “quasispecies”). Thus, deep sequencing of the genetic variant genotypes is necessary to understand the mechanisms used by the virus to change phenotype, including virulence, tissue tropism, or host range. Importantly, identifying the variant genotypes circulating within infected hosts allows early detection of genotypes that may evade countermeasures and diagnostic assays and impact viral phenotype.
