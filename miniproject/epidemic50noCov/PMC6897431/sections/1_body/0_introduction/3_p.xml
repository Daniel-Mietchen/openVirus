<p>ZIKV has a 10.7 kb genome of single-stranded RNA encoding ten proteins. The genome is translated into a polyprotein of about 3300 amino acids which is cleaved by viral and host proteases into three structural proteins (C, Pr/M, and E) and seven nonstructural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) proteins. The structural proteins form the viral particle whereas the nonstructural proteins form a complex responsible for viral replication. Both structural and nonstructural proteins interact with the host immune response [
