<p>In this study multiscale analysis of the wealth of genomic data generated over the course of the epidemic and available in public databases was combined with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> laboratory data. The objective of this study was to examine viral emergence at multiple scales: the microscale (molecular) and macroscale (temporal and special dispersion of mutations) to enable trends in mutations and outbreak trajectory to be assessed. Using the recent ZIKV epidemic as a model, we mined both consensus and subconsensus sequence data derived from 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> infections and from Illumina read data available in GenBank in an effort to define patterns of mutations that may impact viral emergence and virulence. The genomic data were queried for the presence of consensus and subconsensus variants that persist over time and increase in prevalence. Because whole genomic sequence data was available for over 400 genomes associated with the outbreak, a process was developed for organizing large sets of sequence data, thus enabling patterns of emergence and spread of mutations associated with the 2015â€“2016 outbreak to be readily visualized. Comparative analyses of constructed protein structure models of different ZIKV variants were used to identify mutations likely to modify protein structure conformation. This approach provides insight into which mutations or combinations of mutations should be further investigated using detailed structural modeling and reverse genetics in functional assays.
