<p>In this study, publicly available NGS data generated over the course of the epidemic combined with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> laboratory data allowed comparison of trends in mutations. Our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> data from ZIKV passage in a pregnant macaque and in mice confirmed the presence of mutations at subconsensus levels in ZIKV strains ZikaSPH2015 and PRVABC59, respectively, both of which were isolated from patients during outbreaks. Interestingly, some of the mutations occurred in different laboratory host species from multiple studies and were also detected as changes in the consensus sequence in a subset of epidemic samples. Similarly, amino acids that were previously consensus in pre-outbreak samples were detected as low frequency variants in epidemic strains.
