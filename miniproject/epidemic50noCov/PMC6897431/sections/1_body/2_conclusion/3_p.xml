<p>Classification of measures of amino acid properties such as charge, antigenicity and conservation may also be useful for detecting trends in the data. Nonsynonymous mutations that defined the epidemic genotype were further characterized at the protein structure level. Comparative analyses of constructed protein structure models of different ZIKV variants were used to identify mutations likely to modify protein structure conformation. For example, our structural analyses indicate that mutations that were persistent and prevalent in the outbreak more often occurred in surface-exposed rather than buried regions of the protein. Interestingly, four mutations associated with microcephaly cases were shown by protein structure analysis to occur in an exposed region of NS3 that interfaces with NS5 and may impact replication. Thus, protein structural models can be used to identify mutations of potential importance such as those that occur in or adjacent to regions known to influence protein functions and/or viral phenotype.</p>
