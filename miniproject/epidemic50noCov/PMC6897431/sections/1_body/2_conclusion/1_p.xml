<p>The objective of this study was to examine genotype emergence at the microscale (molecular) and macroscale (temporal and spatial dispersion of mutations) to enable trends in mutations and outbreak trajectory to be assessed. At the molecular scale, this study used computational analysis of online and laboratory-generated sequence data to detect patterns of ZIKV evolution at the inter- and intra-host level. Genetic data from the recent ZIKV epidemic was examined for patterns in mutations at the protein, nucleotide, and quasispecies (variant) level. It is now acknowledged that RNA viruses evolve as a diverse intra-host population (“mutant spectrum” or “quasispecies”), and it is the diversity at the population level that determines the outcome of the infection [

The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) enables viral populations to be defined at increasing depths and thus allows unprecedented examination of the evolutionary process. However, generation and analysis of NGS data can be complex due to the massive output of relatively short sequencing reads of the Illumina platform, which is currently the only NGS technology with error rates low enough to allow detection of low frequency variants in intra-host viral populations. Importantly, the inherently stochastic process of RNA genome replication and the resulting genetic drift produces many mutations that are lethal, as well as many which individually have no phenotypic consequence. This obscures the identification of mutations that do have functional consequences, and the short reads of Illumina sequencing make linking mutations difficult. The challenge with the current technology is to find ways to see signal and patterns through the noise. Encouragingly, as one examines deep sequence data from various sources, trends do appear, and some sites do consistently undergo mutation and the consensus and subconsensus level. As scientists increasingly deposit NGS sequence data online, it becomes possible to compare results across studies and verify patterns of mutations and hypotheses.
