<p>To gauge trajectory of an outbreak it is important to look at viral mutation dynamics in the spatio-temporal context (“macroscale”) as well as in a molecular context such as the potential impact on protein functionality and viral phenotype. In this study, a process was developed for organization of large sets of sequence data, thus enabling patterns emergence and spread of mutations associated with the outbreak to be readily visualized. At the macroscale level, consensus data was organized into large and interactive databases to allow the spread of individual mutations and combinations of mutations to be visualized and assessed for temporal and geographical patterns. This type of analysis highlights the dynamics of amino acid changes within the circulating genotype, as was the case with NS5 position 114 and mutations from Thr to Met and Val between 2014 to 2016 (

(2016) and others, the present analysis includes sequence data from samples collected as the outbreak progressed, thus provides a comprehensive picture of clusters of mutations that persisted into later stages of the outbreak as well as mutations that were only detected in a handful of samples. Additionally, this graphical representation allows gaps in whole genome sequence data to be easily recognized.
