<p>In summary, the recent ZIKV outbreak was analyzed using next generation sequencing for detection of emerging mutations, structural models to identify mutations likely to impact viral phenotype, and organization of large datasets to detect trends in mutation spread. Together these multiscale analyses provide a mechanism estimating the trajectory of an epidemic. Use of multiscale modeling for prioritizing mutations according to geographical spread and potential for phenotypic impact can aid the formation of hypotheses which can then be tested using reverse genetics.</p>
