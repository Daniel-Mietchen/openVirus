    "The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic led to significant uncertainty among physicians and patients about the safety of immunosuppressive medications used for the management of dermatologic conditions. We review available data on commonly used immunosuppressants and their effect on viral infections beyond COVID-19. Notably, the effect of some immunosuppressants on viruses related to SARS-CoV2, including SARS and MERS, has been previously investigated. In the absence of data on the effect of immunosuppressants on COVID-19, these data could be used to make clinical decisions on initiation and continuation of immunosuppressive medications during this pandemic. In summary, we recommend considering the discontinuation of oral JAK inhibitors and prednisone, considering the delay of rituximab infusion, and the careful continuation of cyclosporine, mycophenolate, azathioprine, methotrexate, and biologics in patients currently benefitting from such treatments."
