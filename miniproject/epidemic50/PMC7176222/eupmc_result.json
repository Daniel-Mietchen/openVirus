    "A novel coronavirus was identified as the aetiological agent for the global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The SARS coronavirus genome encodes for proteins that are common to all members of the coronavirus, i.e. replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1b) and structural proteins (spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope), as well as eight accessory proteins. The accessory proteins have been designated as open reading frames (ORF) 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b, and they do not show significant homology to viral proteins of other known coronaviruses. Epidemiological studies have revealed that the part of the viral genome that encodes for ORF8a and ORF8b showed major variations and the animal isolates contain an additional 29-nucleotide sequence which is absent in most of the human isolates. As a result, ORF8a and ORF8b in the human isolates become one ORF, termed ORF8ab. In this chapter, we will discuss the genetic variation in the ORF8 region, expression of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab during infection, cellular localization and posttranslational modification of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab, participation of ORF8a, ORF8b and ORF8ab in viralâ€“viral interactions, their effects on other viral proteins and impact on viral replication and/or pathogenesis."
