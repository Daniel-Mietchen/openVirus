Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers new hope in not only effectively pre-empting, preventing and combating the threats of infectious disease epidemics, but also facilitating the understanding of health-seeking behaviors and public emotions during epidemics. From a systems-thinking perspective, and in today&#x02019;s world of seamless boundaries and global interconnectivity, AI offers enormous potential for public health practitioners and policy makers to revolutionize healthcare and population health through focussed, context-specific interventions that promote cost-savings on therapeutic care, expand access to health information and services, and enhance individual responsibility for their health and well-being.

While the Asia-Pacific region was generally regarded as the main epicenter of emerging infectious diseases, with outbreaks of Avian Flu, Asian Flu and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the recent and unexpected emergence of Zika pandemic spurred global concerns about pandemic preparedness capabilities particularly as it relates to training and deployment of healthcare workforce at a massive level, worldwide. Despite coordinated global efforts, containing the &#x0201c;red alert&#x0201d; pandemic of Zika remained a challenge, as both healthcare workers and public health advocates were uncertain about such disastrous contagion causing serious complications including congenital microcephaly in newborns and neurological deficits in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Control measures were obtunded as public health advocates were initially speculative about the potential transmission route of Zika, while clinicians in hospitals were irresolute, instituting multiple levels of care and management to tackle the complications of Zika. This debacle gave rise to an urgent need to debate the circumstances under which the Zika epidemic has challenged human intelligence behavior and capacity to battle the threat effectively and efficiently.</p><p id="Par4">As population explosions and uncontrolled human mobility across nations catalyzes rapid disease propagation, our next question is, what else above human intelligence could help resolve such unprecedented epidemic crisis?

At the peak of emergent multi-function contexts of AI and the rise of Big Data Analytics, the United Nations (UN) in 2017 unified global experts to galvanize a dynamic consensus on the adoption and expansion of AI use in delivering good public care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Succinctly, various stakeholders were assembled together in another UN meeting to assess the role of AI towards achieving Sustainable Developmental Goals (SDGs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. From the healthcare perspective, massive data have been obtained from public health surveillance efforts with the advancement of AI. One major public health field that gained momentum to develop various AI applications for disease prevention was the infectious disease domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The human population is currently able to access potentially useful massive data sources of infectious disease spread through sentinel reporting systems, national surveillance systems (usually operated by national or regional disease centers such as the Center for Disease Control (CDC)), genome databases, internet search queries (also called infodemiology and infoveillance studies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], Twitter data analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], outbreak investigation reports, transportation dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], vaccine reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and human dynamics information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">With the influx of massive data volume, effective data integration, management and knowledge extraction systems are required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

Our next question is&#x02014;could AI perform these essential intellectual tasks as well? The answer is absolutely yes, but in a different mode of function. While human interpretation is solely dependent on cognitive functions, AI requires mathematical algorithms to automate machines for execution of such functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Machines here refer to programmable computers! An example is to visualize the cause of an outbreak; Dengue, Chikungunya or Zika, of which these diseases are commonly caused by the vector mosquito. In massive epidemics, elimination of the vector is important, and human cognitive functions can never detect all mosquitos in an outbreak investigation area! However, this can be easily detected through deployment of AI in areas which have loads of mosquito vectors to facilitate control measures.

The system identifies images of mosquito larvae captured and delivered by a group of citizen scientists. Not only did the developed prototype facilitate collection of images, it also facilitated training of image classifiers for the recognition of a particular specimen.

The following examples illustrate real life applications of AI during disease epidemics:</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>The Use of Twitter Data to Track Public Behavior During Outbreak Crisis</title><p id="Par25">Twitter, a free social-networking micro-blogging service has enabled loads of users to send and read each other&#x02019;s &#x0201c;tweets (short, 140-character messages).&#x0201d; As important information and geo-political events are embedded within the Twitter stream, researchers now postulate that Twitter users&#x02019; reactions may be useful for tracking and forecasting behavior during disease epidemics.</p><p id="Par26"><bold>The Zika Pandemic.</bold> Most of the world&#x02019;s populations are living in endemic areas for common mosquito-borne diseases. The Zika pandemic between the years of 2015 and 2016 marked the largest known outbreak, reaching a &#x0201c;red-alert&#x0201d; warning of multiple complications requiring global public health interventions. In such exigencies, population health behaviors are important for potential control measures. Daughton and Paul postulated that internet data has been effective to track human health seeking behaviors during disease outbreaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. They used Twitter data between 2015 and 2016 respectively to identify and describe self-disclosures of an individual&#x02019;s behavior change during disease spread. They combined keyword filtering and ML classifications to identify first-person reactions to Zika. A total of 29,386 English tweets were analyzed. Keywords include &#x0201c;travel,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;travelling intentions,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;cancellations.&#x0201d; Individual demographic characteristics, users&#x02019; networking and linguistic patterns were compared with controls. The study found variations between individual characteristics, users&#x02019; social network attributes and language styles in 1567 Twitter users. These users changed or considered to change their travel behaviors in response to Zika. Significant differences were observed between geographic areas in the USA, with higher discussion among women than men and some differences in levels of exposure to Zika-related information. This finding concludes that applying AI concepts could contribute to better understanding on how public perceives and reacts towards the risks of infectious disease outbreak.</p><p id="Par27"><bold>The Influenza A H1N1 Pandemic.</bold> Signorini and colleagues in 2011 analyzed Twitter embedded data for tracking rapid evolvement of public concerns with respect to H1N1 or swine flu, while concurrently measuring actual disease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The researchers explored public concerns by collecting tweets using pre-specified search terms related to H1N1 activity with additional keywords related to disease transmission, disease countermeasures and food consumption within the United States. They utilized influenza-like illness surveillance data and predicted an estimation model using supervised learning method in machine learning. The results showed that Twitter was useful to measure public interest or concern about health-related events associated with H1N1. These include an observed periodical spikes related to user Twitter activity that were linked to preventive measures (hand-hygiene practices and usage of masks), travel and food consumption behaviors, drug related tweets about specific anti-viral and vaccine uptake.

The researchers subsequently explored correlations between overall and weekly web hit searches of terms in relation to the total number and weekly new cases of Ebola incidence. The highest search volumes that generated Ebola related queries were captured across the West African countries, mainly affected by the Ebola epidemic. Web searches were concentrated across state capitals. However, in Western countries, the distribution of web searches remained fixed across national territories. Correlations between the total number of new weekly cases of Ebola and the weekly Google Trends index varied from weak to moderate among the African countries afflicted by Ebola. Correlations between the total number of Ebola cases registered in all countries and the Google Trends index was relatively high. The researchers concluded that Google Trends data strongly correlated with global epidemiological data.

A group of researchers were determined to investigate Chikungunya-related digital health-seeking behaviors, and subsequently explored probable associations between epidemiological data and internet traffic sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Public reactions from Italy toward Chikungunya outbreaks were mined from Google Trends, Google News, Twitter traffics, Wikipedia visits and edits, and PubMed articles to yield a structural equation model. The relationships between overall Chikungunya cases, as well as autochthonous cases and tweet productions were mediated by Chikungunya-related web searches. But in the allochthonous case model, tweet productions were not significantly mediated by epidemiological figures, instead, web searches posed significant mediating tweets. Inconsistent associations were detected in mediation models involving Wikipedia usage. The effects between news consumption and tweets production were suppressed in this regard. Subsequently, inconsistent mediation effects were found between Wikipedia usage and tweets production, with web searches as a mediator. After adjustment of Internet Penetration Index, similar findings were retrieved with the adjusted model showing relationship between Google News and Twitter to be partially mediated by Wikipedia usage. The link between Wikipedia usage and PubMed/MEDLINE was fully mediated by Google News, and differed from the unadjusted model. The researchers found significant public reactions to the Chikungunya outbreak. They concluded that health authorities could be made aware immediately of such phenomenon with the aid of new technologies for collecting public concerns, disseminating awareness and avoiding misleading information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Computer Based Expert Systems</title><p id="Par32">Expert systems are built upon the basis to act as a diagnostic tool to accelerate detection of infectious disease epidemics, determining the intensity or concentration of vector-agents within the triads of infectious disease dynamics.</p><p id="Par33"><bold>The Malaria Control Strategy Using Expert Systems.</bold> Malaria constitutes a &#x0201c;red-alert&#x0201d; health threat to the African communities. A group of researchers from Nigeria built an expert system for malaria environmental diagnosis with the aim of providing a decisional support tool for researchers and health policy-makers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As prevailing malaria control measures were deemed insufficient, this group of researchers developed a prototype that constituted components of &#x0201c;knowledge,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;applications,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;system database,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;user graphics interface,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;user components.&#x0201d; The user component utilized Java, while the application component used Java Expert System Shell (JESS) and the Java IDE of Netbeans. The database component used SQL Server. The system was able to act as a diagnostic tool to determine the intensity of malarial parasites in designated geographical areas across Africa.

Even in resource-rich settings, there are challenges associated with building and updating the knowledge base of expert systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], providing high-quality datasets upon which machine learning algorithms can be premised, and ethical issues associated with data ownership and management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Additionally, resource-limited settings are further plagued with constraints of poorly organized and integrated health systems, poor IT and communication infrastructure, and socio-economic and cultural contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] that significantly impact successful implementation of AI systems. Beyond these, the dynamics of human behavior and other environmental covariates (such as mass/social media, public emotions, public policy etc.) may not only influence the accuracy of epidemic disease modeling frameworks but also impact health seeking behavior during epidemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. More than ever before, public health experts, IT developers and other stakeholders must work together to address concerns related to scalability of AI for healthcare, data integration and interoperability, security, privacy and ethics of aggregated digital data. Finally, the transparency of predictive AI algorithms have been called to question, particularly given their &#x02018;black box&#x02019; nature which makes them prone to biases in settings of significant inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Opportunities and Future Direction of AI Applications During Disease Epidemics</title><p id="Par35">Perhaps, it may be premature to describe AI as the future of healthcare given it is still in its infancy, however, it has become increasingly difficult to not acknowledge the substantial contributions of AI systems to the field of public health medicine. Notwithstanding current challenges with the widespread adoption of AI particularly in resource-limited settings, the use of AI in providing in-depth knowledge on individuals&#x02019; health, predicting population health risks and improving pandemic preparedness capabilities is likely to increase substantially in the near future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Further, the rapidly expanding mobile phone penetrance, developments in cloud computing, substantial investments in health informatics, electronic medical records (EMRs) and mobile health (mHealth) applications, even in resource-constrained settings, holds significant promise for increasing use and scalability of AI applications in improving public health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Public health policy, practice and research will continue to benefit from the expanding framework of infodemiology and infoveillance in analyzing health information search, communication and publication behavior on the internet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Advances in cryptographic technologies&#x02014;including block chain is likely to allay fears and concerns with security, privacy and confidentiality of public digital data/information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par36">There is no doubt that AI is and will continue to revolutionize healthcare and population health. From prevention and health promotion to diagnosis and treatment, AI is increasingly being deployed to improve clinical decision-making, enhance personalized care and public health outcomes. In particular, AI offers enormous potential for cost-savings on therapeutic care given its predictive accuracy of potential outbreaks and epidemics and ability to enhance positive health seeking behaviors (at individual and population levels) during epidemics predicated upon robust infodemiology and infoveillance frameworks supported by expert systems, machine learning algorithms and mobile applications. Amazing as the future of AI in healthcare seems, there are significant legal and ethical concerns that need to be addressed in order to pave way for robust implementation and scalability across a variety of socio-cultural, epidemiological, health system and political contexts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Ministry of Health Malaysia for the support to publish this chapter.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tsui</surname><given-names>KL</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>ZSY</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldsman</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Edesess</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tracking infectious disease spread for global pandemic containment</article-title><source>IEEE Intell.
