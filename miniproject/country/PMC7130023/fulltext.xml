In a recent paper, Rubin et al. <xref rid="b0005" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, tells us: <italic>At the Journal, we work with authors to craft their messages to provide readers the best information from rigorous medical practice and basic science. The process can take time, with careful peer review, editing, and graphics often involving multiple rounds of revision. This work fulfills our mission: to provide our readers with the highest-quality information to guide the care of patients</italic>, and continues, <italic>But some situations call for a different approach. The current outbreak of coronavirus infection is a threat to the health of the public and a breaking news story that changes hour by hour. We can eventually take a long view of how to manage and prevent epidemics, but today practitioners and public health authorities need actionable information as soon as possible.</italic> And concludes the article, <italic>the rapid pace of infectious disease outbreaks can be frightening. Our aim is to transparently bring readers the best information available in a highly expedited manner.</italic>

As of March 1st, 2020, outside China, another 58 countries had confirmed COVID-19 cases. Now, on March 18th, there are already more than 150 countries, in addition to China.

The disease was named COVID-19 by the WHO <xref rid="b0010" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Most SARS-CoV-2 infected patients have developed mild symptoms such as dry cough, sore throat, and fever, and the majority of cases have spontaneously resolved. However, some cases have developed various fatal complications including organ failure, septic shock, pulmonary oedema, severe pneumonia, and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p id="p0020">Thus, even in a short time, from December to the present, a significant amount of information about the pandemic for COVID-19 has been generated.

This text highlights that, it is now hard to imagine a world that is not permanently changed by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We do not know whether this is an event like 9/11 or the 2008 global financial crisis-where life will mostly go back to the way it was-or whether the institutions and practices of the future will transform in ways that we cannot yet imagine. The success of the world&#x02019;s scientists-along with strong political and social leadership-will determine which scenarios unfold, so it is time to focus on what we can all do to help <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p id="p0040">Considering the significant number of dentists around the world working at this time, it is necessary to reflect and act quickly to better enable them in dental treatment in the face of the challenges of the pandemic of COVID-19.
