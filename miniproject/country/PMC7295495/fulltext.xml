Firstly, a literature survey is done on COVID-19 highlighting a number of factors including its origin, its similarity with previous coronaviruses, its transmission capacity, its symptoms, etc. Secondly, data analytics is applied on a dataset of Johns Hopkins University to find out the spread of the viral infection. It is shown here that although the disease started in China in December 2019, the highest number of confirmed cases up to June 04, 2020 is in the USA. Thirdly, the worldwide increase in the number of confirmed cases over time is modelled here using a polynomial regression algorithm with degree 2. Fourthly, classification algorithms are applied on a dataset of 5644 samples provided by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein of Brazil in order to diagnose COVID-19. It is shown here that multilayer perceptron (MLP), XGBoost and logistic regression can classify COVID-19 patients at an accuracy above 91%. Finally, a discussion is presented on the potential applications of data analytics in several important factors of COVID-19.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Classification</kwd><kwd>Machine learning</kwd><kwd>Regression</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">A life threatening infectious coronavirus [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] started from Wuhan of China in December 2019. As of June 04, 2020, the disease has officially spread to 213 countries and territories infecting a total of 6,632,985 people causing a death of 391,136. The patients affected by this coronavirus show symptoms of pneumonia. The World Health Organization (WHO) has termed this particular virus as <italic>severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2</italic> (SARS&#x02010;CoV&#x02010;2) and the associated disease as COVID&#x02010;19 [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>]. Recently, the WHO has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. One of the similar coronaviruses reported in the last two decades is the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 causing thousands of deaths. Another disease Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) emerged in 2012. A third virus known as Swine Acute Diarrhea Syndrome (SADS) was noted in the swine industry in 2017. These diseases originated from bats and they are pathogenic to humans or livestock [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>]. Some of the main symptoms of this disease are the development of fever, cough, and respiratory problems including shortness of breath. According to WHO, the incubation period of this virus in most cases vary from 2 to 10 days. Unfortunately, there is no known cure for this disease, for example there is no vaccine for prevention of this disease. There is no specific antiviral treatment as well. The doctors help the patients to manage the symptoms. In many cases, the patients may develop pneumonia and experience failure of multiple organs leading to possible death. The COVID-19 is spread by respiratory droplets from the patients. In other words, the spread is severe when the infected patients cough or sneeze [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the spread can be minimized to some extent by taking hygiene measure including careful handwashing. Moreover, early detection of this disease can help in the containment of the virus. Because of the life threatening nature and no cure of COVID-19, significant research interest has been seen in this field since early January 2020. It is expected that data analytics can play an important role in investigating the salient features of COVID-19 and eventually find a vaccine for it. Therefore, this paper focuses on the application of data analytics on COVID-19.

Particularly the interest is significant after the start of COVID-19 in late December 2019. Some of the important research results are described in the following.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Transmission of COVID-19</title><p id="p0045">This section focuses on the transmission dynamics and reproductive number of COVID-19. There is a relation among the species of coronaviruses, geographical distributions of coronaviruses, bat species and reservoir hosts [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the early outbreak of COVID-19 in China, work-related transmission has been an important factor, and the infection may have spread greatly among health care workers, transport workers, services and sales workers [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The transmission of COVID-19 is estimated by the collection and analyzation of spatiotemporal data [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this regard, the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is estimated using the individual case reports of 140 infected persons. With the consideration of case reports, the estimates of the epidemiology parameters, human travel data and infection data, the basic reproductive number is found to be in between 4.7 and 6.6 [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There may be underreporting cases of coronavirus during the period of January 1-15, 2020 [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The cumulative incidence of 5502 cases in China is estimated with a confidence interval of 95% [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The epidemic of COVID-19 may spread due to some untraced exposures other than the exposure in seafood marker in China [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Some patients do not show symptoms, while others have different types of symptoms [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Some patients have different symptoms such as pneumonia with problem identified in CT scan, acute respiratory distress syndrome, RNAaemia, etc. [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There may be undetected internationally imported cases too [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A transmission model in Ref. [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] estimated the basic reproductive number to be 3.11.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Origin of COVID-19</title><p id="p0050">This section focuses on the time origin and genetic diversity of COVID-19. The increasing genetic diversity of this disease is indicated by phylogenetic, transmission network, and likelihood mapping analyses of the genome sequences [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The SARS and MERS diseases are caused by the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV pathogens, respectively. SARS outbreak in 2002&#x02013;2003 caused more than 8000 cases with 774 deaths in 37 countries. On the other hand, MERS outbreak in 2012 caused 2494 cases with 858 deaths in 27 countries over the world [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are infectious disease zoonotic in origin that means these are spread from animal to human. Bats are regarded as the animal host source, while palm civets and camels are the intermediate means between bats and animals for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively. Similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 may be originated from bats, but the intermediate carrier between bats to humans is yet to be cleared [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The concepts of the pathology and pathogenesis used for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are now applied to find the characteristics of COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. COVID-19 is a class of &#x003b2;-coronavirus genus, having a 79.0% and a 51.8% nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This virus has 96% similarity when compared with a bat coronavirus in terms of genome [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. COVID-19 is a recombinant virus which may be a homologous recombination of a bat coronavirus and another coronavirus whose origin is not known [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Moreover, COVID-19 has some genetic similarity with bat coronavirus and codon usage bias with snake or snake's translation machinery [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Four structural proteins are essential for the formation of coronavirus during virion assembly [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="p0055">The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes non-structural proteins as well as structural proteins. The non-structural proteins are 3-chymotrypsin-like protease, papain-like protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). The structural protein is spike glycoprotein. There are also accessory proteins [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In order to prevent any future outbreak of COVID-19, it is important to find the exact origin and the intermediate hosts of SARS-COV-2 [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. It is found that the codon usage pattern of SARS-COV-2 is unique. When the codon usage of different viruses including SARS-CoV are taken into consideration, the codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 is very much different from that of humans. For the case of SARS-CoV-2, the codons are replaced by ones with lower human-preference. Because of this unique codon usage pattern, it is believed that SARS-CoV-2 was probably formed by evolving in an uncommon intermediate host for a long time. The codon biases are generated due to the evolution of genome composition [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. When whole genome level is taken into consideration, SARS-CoV-2 has 79.5% similarity to SARS-CoV and 96% similarity to the bat coronavirus (RaTG13) [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This virus is still new in its evolutionary journey in human body hence it will be evolved in the future by changing codons, structures, etc. [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Clinical characteristics of COVID-19</title><p id="p0060">The clinical symptoms, features, and parameters of COVID-19 are being investigated in a number of experiments and studies [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>]. The study in Ref. [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] evaluates the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 for the case of nine pregnant women and possibility of intrauterine vertical transmission of this virus. The data related to clinical records, lab tests, and chest CT scans of those women are studied. According to the study [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], as of February 4, 2020, seven patients had fever, four had cough, three had myalgia, two had sore throat, two had malaise, two had fetal distress, five had lymphopenia, three had increased aminotransferase concentrations, and no one died. Furthermore, the study reports that no neonatal asphyxia was observed in 9 newborn babies. Results of these nine patients indicate that COVID-19 may not cause intrauterine fetal infections at pregnancy. However, the small sample size of nine patients is not good enough to come to a definite conclusion. The interaction between the human innate immune system and COVID-19 is studied in Ref. [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] to understand the virus induced inflammation of lung tissues. The results show that the infection can be controlled by humoral immunity, targeted immunotherapy can be useful [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The genome structure, entry of the virus into target cells, etc. information is reported in Ref. [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Drugs of COVID-19</title><p id="p0065">Recently there has been significant research [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>] in the development of drugs and vaccines for COVID-19. Some of the promising drugs target nonstructural proteins, while other drugs target viral entry and immune regulation pathways [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As of April 2020, some of the main potential post-infection therapies known as favipiravir (antiviral against influenza), remdesivir (antiviral), lopinavir/ritonavir (antiviral) and hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (antiparasitic and antirheumatic) &#x02013; are in the final stage of human testing [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The development of vaccine against COVID-19 started just after the publication of genetic sequence of the causative virus SARS-CoV-2 on January 11, 2020. The first vaccine candidate started clinical trial on human on March 16, 2020. As of April 8, 2020, there are 78 confirmed active vaccine candidates of which 5 are into clinical development stage. Three of these are mRNA-1273, Ad5-nCoV and INO-4800 developed by Moderna, CanSino Biologicals, and Inovio, respectively. The remaining two LV-SMENP-DC and pathogen-specific aAPC are developed by Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Very recently 5 more vaccines are also in the clinical trial stage. These are Covid-19/aAPC (Phase I), LV-SMENP-DC (modified DCs) (Phase I/II), bacTRL-Spike (Phase I), mRNA-1273 (Phase II), and Ad5-nCoV (Phase II) [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Data analytics on the status of the disease</title><p id="p0070">The situation of this COVID-19 is changing very frequently. The work in Ref. [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] discusses about a number of datasets related to this virus. The authors in Ref. [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] also provide some visualization of this epidemic up to February 16, 2020. In this work, we analyze the dataset of June 04, 2020 provided by the Johns Hopkins University available in Kaggle repository [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This dataset has 35775 records as of June 04, 2020. The attributes of the dataset are Province/State, Country/Region, Latitude, Longitude, Date, Confirmed Cases, Deaths, and Recovered cases. We present data visualizations in terms of tables, bar charts, pie charts and other graphs. According to this dataset, 213 countries have confirmed cases of 6,632,985, death cases of 391,136, active cases of 3,371,886 and recovered cases of 2,869,963 by COVID-19 as of June 04, 2020. The death rate can be obtained in two ways. When the number of deaths is divided by the number of confirmed cases then death rate is 5.90%, however when number of deaths is divided by the number of closed cases (death&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;recovered) then death rate is 11.99%. For the rest of this paper, death rate will only be considered in terms of number of deaths over number of confirmed cases.</p><p id="p0075">

shows 20 countries that have the highest confirmed cases. Apart from the number of confirmed infection cases, <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> also presents the number of recovered patients, the number of active cases, the number of deaths, death rate and recovery rate. It can be seen that most of the confirmed cases are in the USA. After the USA, the countries with most confirmed cases are Brazil, Russia, UK, Spain, Italy, India, and France.

It indicates that the number of confirmed cases and death cases of the disease are significantly higher in the USA than any other countries. Spain has the second and Italy has the third highest confirmed cases, while Italy has the second and the UK has the third highest death cases. An important point to note here that although China experienced the most number of confirmed cases up to February 16, 2020 [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], it is now in the 18th position in the world in terms of the number of confirmed cases and death cases. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>

The largest death rate is in Yemen being 22.74%. The Belgium, France and Italy have the 2nd, 3rd and 4th highest death rates being 16.25%, 15.33% and 14.40%, respectively. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>

It can be seen that the recovery rate has significantly increased from January to first week of March, however, it decreased from second week of March to first week of April 2020. The recovery rate has increased since early April 2020 which indicates that the number of active cases has reduced as many active patients have recovered. On the other hand, the death rate has increased from below 3% in Mid-February 2020 to around 6.0% in June 2020. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>

Hence for modelling the number of confirmed cases over time and predicting the future evolution, regression is considered. There are a number of regressors in machine learning, in this paper, two widely used algorithms named linear regression and polynomial algorithms are considered. Linear regression is popular for simple algorithm and for a having well-known features. Linear regression finds an equation that ensures the smallest difference among the observed sample values and the corresponding fitted sample values. Polynomial regression is a special form of regression where the relationship between independent and dependent variable are modelled as a polynomial of n-th degree in the independent variable. The regression prediction can be evaluated by a number of metrics, but we will consider one of the popular metrics known as coefficient of determination or R-squared value (<inline-formula><mml:math id="M1" altimg="si1.svg"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>).

In this case, dataset [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] is used for regression where the number of days is the independent variable and the confirmed cases is the dependent variable.

Currently there is a lack of acceptable datasets that could be used for prediction of COVID-19 in patients. One dataset is recently uploaded at [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] which contains 5644 samples with 111 attributes provided by Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil. This dataset contains anonymized data samples collected by RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital. In a recent preprint paper [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], some results are provided on the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients using a subset of the dataset in Ref. [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p id="p0140">First of all, preprocessing is done to process and standardize null values and categorical data. The attributes that have more than 99.80% null values in positive samples are dropped as these attributes are unlikely to predict positive cases. The records with mostly null values are also removed. This way the processed dataset has 1091 records and 61 columns. The target feature is converted to make positive samples or virus infected patients as &#x02018;1&#x02019; and negative samples or normal persons as &#x02018;0&#x02019;. Next, feature selection is performed using the steps shown in <xref rid="enun_Algorithm_1" ref-type="statement">Algorithm 1</xref> of Section <xref rid="sec4.1" ref-type="sec">4.1</xref>. This provides us the ranking of all the features. The most 10 influential features are shown in <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>
. It can be seen that &#x02018;Serum Glucose&#x02019; has the best ranking (rank 1) and thus is the most influential attribute among all the attributes in the dataset. The second and third best attributes are &#x02018;Respiratory Syncytial Virus&#x02019; and &#x02018;Influenza A&#x02019;, respectively.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Ranking of the features of the dataset.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0080">Table 5</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Name of the feature</th><th>Rank</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Serum Glucose</td><td align="left">1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Respiratory Syncytial Virus</td><td align="left">2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Influenza A</td><td align="left">3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Influenza B</td><td align="left">4</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CoronavirusNL63</td><td align="left">5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Coronavirus HKU1</td><td align="left">6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Parainfluenza 3</td><td align="left">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Adenovirus</td><td align="left">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Parainfluenza 4</td><td align="left">9</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Coronavirus229E</td><td align="left">10</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0145">Next, classification algorithms are applied on the processed dataset to classify the COVID-19 positive patients from all suspected patients in the dataset. There are many popular classification algorithms including support vector machine (SVM), k nearest neighbors (kNN), XGBoost, multilayer perceptron (MLP), logistic regression (LR) and decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), majority voting and other ensemble methods. The parameters of these classifiers can also be varied to find the best result for a particular scenario. In this case, XGBoost, MLP, KNN, LR and DT are considered as these provide more promising results than others in our experiments. These well-known classifiers are briefly described in the following [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. XGBoost is a DT-based ensemble classifier having a gradient boosting framework. It is designed for optimal hardware usage. MLP is a form of feed forward artificial neural network and composed of multiple layers of artificial neurons termed as perceptrons. In MLP algorithm, a perceptron uses an activation function which maps the weighted input of each neuron. In KNN, classification is performed by a plurality vote of the k neighbors where the output class is the one most closest to the neighbors. kNN is a non-parametric simple and versatile algorithm. Its implementation is easy, but the functioning gets slower with increase in the number of predictor variables. LR functions according to the concept of probability. LR is a form of classification algorithm where the observations are assigned to discrete classes with a logistic sigmoid function. This algorithm can be of three different types: binomial, multinomial and ordinal. In DT classifier, data are continuously split into subsets, then split into even smaller subsets, and this process continues until the data within the subsets become near homogenous. The structure of a DT is similar to flow-chart where each non-leaf nodes represent a test on an attribute, a branch represents the outcome of a test and each terminal node represent a class label. Moreover, DT algorithm is easy to interpret and performs well with large datasets.</p><p id="p0150">For our experiments, the steps in <xref rid="enun_Algorithm_2" ref-type="statement">Algorithm 2</xref> of Section <xref rid="sec4.1" ref-type="sec">4.1</xref> that are for classifiers and for cross validation are considered. In this case a 20 fold cross validation is performed to split the dataset into training and testing portions. These performance of the classifiers are measures in terms of precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) termed as AUC value, testing accuracy. <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref>
shows the performance comparison of these algorithms. It can be seen that MLP has the highest testing accuracy value of 93.13%, while LR and XGBoost have the testing accuracy values of 92.12% and 91.57%, respectively. This means that the MLP can 93.13% accurately classify a negative (normal) case as normal and a positive (infected) case as infected. In other words, any classification test with MLP for this dataset has 93.13% probability to be correct. <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="table">Table 6</xref> also shows that MLP has the highest AUC value 96.70%. This means that the classifier can successfully separate the positive and negative classes of the COVID-19 suspected patients with 96.70% probability. In addition, MLP has the highest values of precision, recall and F1 score, all being 93%. Note that the 93% recall value of MLP means that the classifier identifies patients having the disease at 93% accuracy. In other words, if a patient is diagnosed as negative (normal) there is only 7% chance that the test is inaccurate. Both XGBoost and LR have precision, recall and F1 score values equal to or greater than 92%. Hence, among the classifiers considered, MLP, XGBoost and LR are good choices for classifying this specific dataset and thus predict COVID-19 patients reliably.<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl6"><label>Table 6</label><caption><p>Performance Comparison of the classifiers.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0085">Table 6</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Classifier</th><th>Precision</th><th>Recall</th><th>F1 Score</th><th>AUC value</th><th>Testing Accuracy</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">MLP</td><td align="left">93%</td><td align="left">93%</td><td align="left">93%</td><td align="left">96.70%</td><td align="left">93.13%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">LR</td><td align="left">92%</td><td align="left">93%</td><td align="left">92%</td><td align="left">96.60%</td><td align="left">92.12%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">XGBoost</td><td align="left">92%</td><td align="left">92%</td><td align="left">92%</td><td align="left">96.30%</td><td align="left">91.57%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">KNN</td><td align="left">89%</td><td align="left">89%</td><td align="left">89%</td><td align="left">93.70%</td><td align="left">88.91%</td></tr><tr><td align="left">DT</td><td align="left">87%</td><td align="left">87%</td><td align="left">87%</td><td align="left">94.40%</td><td align="left">86.71%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="p0155">The performance of the classifiers in our work are better than that of the work in Ref. [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] in terms of recall, AUC value and testing accuracy. For example, the highest value of AUC value in Ref. [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] is 84.70% compared to our highest AUC value of 96.70%, and the highest F1 score in Refs. [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] is 78.10% compared to our highest F1 score of 93%. The difference in the results of [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and our work are due the fact that the work in Ref. [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] considers only 245 suspected patients and 15 attributes. On the other hand, our work considers 1091 probable patients and 61 attributes after preprocessing. Moreover, the work in Ref. [<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] uses the holdout method with 30% testing data and 70% training data. On the other hand, our work considers cross validation method for splitting the testing and training data samples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Possible scope of data analytics</title><p id="p0160">In future modeling the processes of COVID-19 can contribute to improving our understanding in this disease.

For example, the images of CT scans of normal people and coronavirus affected patients can be stored for training the system, while any new patient's CT scan image can be compared with the training images to find the similarity score. The main features of these patients can be found out from the application of machine learning.

</p><p id="p0205">In addition to the above issues, research is required on the possible effect of the coronavirus in developing countries that are highly populated but have poor health care systems. In these countries many people are not accustomed to maintaining personal hygiene appropriately. Lack of proper education and awareness is also a big problem. Lack of proper testing kits means many are not tested. Moreover, there is lack of good lab facilities, skill personnel resulting in possible error in processing and analysis. So, many patients may remain undetected. Therefore, it is important to find an inexpensive and cheap artificial intelligent system for data driven diagnosis of COVID-19 patients in these countries.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0210">COVID-19 has become a pandemic across the globe since its first official appearance in China in December 2019. As of June 04, 2020, the disease is now in 213 countries and territories, with the USA having the highest confirmed cases of the world. Since early March 2020, the situation in China has improved due to a number of steps taken including strict quarantine measures and travel bans. Currently there is no effective treatment for COVID-19, the existing treatments are only for the symptoms. Hence, investigation into the pathogenesis of this infection is important for finding its appropriate treatment. It is shown here that the current increase in the number of confirmed cases over time can be modelled by polynomial regression of degree 2. However, new models have to be developed to reliably predict the future number of confirmed cases considering continuation and relaxation of lockdowns and other aspects. It is also shown in this work, that MLP, XGBoost and LR can reliably classify COVID-19 patients found in a dataset of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Brazil. However, the effectiveness of the classifiers should be validated on a more reliable and larger dataset. With the use of machine learning and with the availability of data on important features, automatic predictions can be made on the possibility of a suspected person to have COVID-19. In future it is believed that different types of coronavirus outbreaks will continue originating from animals for example bats. Hence continuous research is required in the investigation of current and any future coronaviruses.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Ethical statement</title><p id="p0215">All authors have reported that they have no relationships relevant to the contents of this paper to disclose.
