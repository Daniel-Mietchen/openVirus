    "The 2019 novel coronavirus disease, SARS-CoV-2, is now spreading globally and is characterized by person-to-person transmission. However, it has recently been found that individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic, and simultaneously a source of infection in others. The viral load detected in nasopharyngeal swabs of asymptomatic carriers is relatively high, with a great potential for transmission. More attention should be paid to the insidious spread of disease and harm contributed by asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers. To provide a theoretical basis for the accurate and early clinical identification of asymptomatic patients, this review objectively summarizes the epidemic status, transmission characteristicsÂ and clinical features of asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection."
