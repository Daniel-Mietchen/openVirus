ZIKV was first isolated in 1947 from a febrile rhesus macaque in the Zika forest of Uganda <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Only 14 cases of sporadic infection with mild symptoms were reported in the following 60 years <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. After several epidemics in Yap Island in 2007 and in French Polynesia and other Pacific islands in 2013-2014, ZIKV colonised the Americas in February 2015, causing 707,133 cases of autochthonous infection within 48 countries and territories by late 2016 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. During these large epidemics in the Americas, ZIKV infection resulted in severe pathological complications, notably microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome (GBS) in adults <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. The virus is mainly transmitted by the bite of <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, but direct, interhuman transmission through sexual or vertical route has also been confirmed, setting ZIKV apart from most other flaviviruses <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. To date, there is no licensed vaccine or antiviral therapy available for the treatment of ZIKV infection. The efficient transmission of this virus combined with deficient antiviral strategies has exacerbated public panic over ZIKV <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>The mechanisms for the dissemination and pathogenesis of ZIKV in developing fetuses, pregnant mothers, and adults remain largely unknown. ZIKV is likely to invade a unique set of immune-sheltered tissues, including the brain, testis, and placenta. Several ZIKV animal infection models have been previously established <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> to quantify viral genomes and antigens, which have provided useful information about both the viral and host factors that determine replication and pathogenesis <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. However, it has not been possible to monitor the real-time patterns of ZIKV infection through these methods <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. The collection of tissues and organs to evaluate ZIKV infection requires the euthanasia of the animals, and important tissues or organs may be missed if samples are not taken adequately <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>Bioluminescence imaging is a sensitive and non-invasive technology that allows for the visualization of viral dynamics in real time <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. This strategy measures the light generated by luciferase-catalysed oxidation reactions, an indicator of the extent of infected tissues, by using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Bioluminescence imaging measures the spatial and temporal progression of both primary infection and reinfection in the same animal model, which is able to not only reduce the inter-animal variability and animal suffering, but also improve the accuracy, stability, and reproducibility of the results <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Bioluminescence imaging has been widely utilised in the study of viruses, including influenza virus, enterovirus 71, herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, monkeypox virus, and hepatitis C virus <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Recently, bioluminescence imaging assays of flaviviruses infection in mice have been implemented using recombinant viruses harbouring the firefly luciferase (Fluc) or Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Compared with Fluc and Rluc, the very small nanoluciferase (Nluc) (19-kDa) produces 150-fold more light <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, and shows a greater potential for bioluminescence imaging <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. To date, there have been no successful attempts at the non-invasive detection of ZIKV infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is warranted for characterizing the mechanisms of the replication and pathogenesis of the virus, as well as to improve the preclinical evaluation of vaccines, antiviral drugs, or therapeutic antibodies for ZIKV.</p><p>In this study, a recombinant ZIKV harbouring the Nluc gene (ZIKV-Nluc) was designed, recovered, and purified. This recombinant virus showed a high genetic stability and replicated well in cells with similar properties to the wild-type ZIKV (ZIKVwt). The levels of bioluminescence were found to be directly correlated with viral loads <italic>in vitro</italic> and<italic> in vivo</italic>. The dynamics of ZIKV infection in A129 (interferon (IFN)-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; receptor deficient), AG6 (IFN-&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3; receptor deficient), and C57BL/6 mice were well characterized. To our knowledge, this is the first real-time non-invasive tracking of the progression of ZIKV invading immune-sheltered tissues, as well as its vertical propagating, during pregnancy. The results presented in this study demonstrate that ZIKV-Nluc is a powerful tool for use in the study of the replication, dissemination, and pathogenesis of ZIKV <italic>in vitro</italic> and<italic> in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation and characterization of a stable reporter ZIKV</title><p>To generate a bioluminescent ZIKV reporter virus, a Nluc gene was engineered into a full-length infectious cDNA clone of an Asian-lineage Zika virus, SZ-WIV01 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, the monomeric Nluc gene flanked by the N-terminal 38 amino acids of C protein (C38) and a FMDV2A (F2A) sequence was inserted between 5'UTR and the N-terminus of open reading frame (ORF). The C38 sequence was required for maintaining genome cyclization and for viral RNA replication, and the F2A sequence was placed downstream of the Nluc gene to ensure that the Nluc protein was properly processed <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>.</p><p>P0 ZIKV-Nluc virus was rescued through the transfection of Vero cells with the full-length ZIKV-Nluc cDNA clone (ZIKV-Nluc-FL). P0 ZIKV-Nluc virus harbouring the intact genome, without the loss of Nluc, was confirmed by RT-PCR assay by amplifying the fragment from 5'UTR to the C gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Compared with ZIKVwt, the P0 ZIKV-Nluc virus produced smaller plaques, which were visualized by immunostaining (P &#x0003c; 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C) and 0.33% neutral red (P &#x0003c; 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D), demonstrating that the insertion of the Nluc gene attenuated the virus in cell culture. The infection of Vero cells with P0 virus resulted in the robust production of luciferase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E), despite the P0 virus having lower infectious titres, at 3 and 4 days post infection (dpi) (P &#x0003c; 0.05), and exhibiting a lower replication efficiency than ZIKVwt (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F).</p><p>The genetic stability of ZIKV-Nluc is prerequisite for its use. To test the stability of the ZIKV-Nluc virus, the P0 ZIKV-Nluc virus was passaged in Vero cells for five rounds. After each passage (P1 to P5), the viruses were examined for the Nluc gene. The RT-PCR results indicated that the Nluc gene began to be lost in the P1 viral stock (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>G). To improve the stability of ZIKV-Nluc, the P0 ZIKV-Nluc virus was purified for four rounds in Vero cells using a double plaque assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>H). The resulting P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus was re-passaged five times in Vero cells, the passages of which did not result in any apparent loss of NLuc gene, indicating that the genome of ZIKV-Nluc was stable for at least five life cycles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>I). Sequence analysis of the entire genome of P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus revealed no nucleotide substitution (Fasta data-S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Supplementary material</xref>).</p><p>To further validate the ZIKV-Nluc virus (P8), viral protein synthesis was examined in Vero cells. As measured by IFA assays, the amount of E-positive cells infected with ZIKV-Nluc virus increased with the time of infection, although the percentage of positive cells was less than that of ZIKVwt before the peak at 3 dpi (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). Next, we determined the kinetics of the luciferase activities in Vero cells infected with different MOIs (0.001, 0.01, 0.1 or 1) of ZIKV-Nluc virus. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B, the growth of the Nluc signal showed a good correlation with the MOI in the ZIKV-Nluc virus (P8)-infected Vero cells. In a parallel experiment of double plaque assay, P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus showed low infectious titres at 2, 3, 4, and 5 dpi (P &#x0003c; 0.05). However, the growth pattern for the bioluminescent virus was similar to that for ZIKVwt (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). In addition, the MOI of 0.01 was selected and applied in subsequent correlation analyses of viral titres and Nluc activities. We demonstrated that there was an excellent linear correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.9114) between the Nluc signal values and the viral titres of P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D). Collectively, the P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus showed a superior genetic stability and produced levels of luciferase activity that accurately reflected the replication of the virus<italic> in vitro</italic>. Therefore, this virus was used in further experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Pathogenicity of ZIKV-Nluc in A129, AG6, and C57BL/6 mice</title><p>To determine whether the ZIKV-Nluc virus causes a similar disease progression compared to ZIKVwt, mice were infected with 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc/ZIKVwt via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route and monitored for 20 days for weight loss and mortality. Both A129 mice and AG6 mice infected with ZIKVwt showed weight loss starting at 4 dpi, and all mice died between 7 and 9 dpi (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B). By contrast, in the ZIKV-Nluc virus-infected mice, only 33.3% A129 mice and 50% AG6 showed significant weight loss and succumbed to infection by 19 and 18 dpi, respectively (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B). The immunocompetent mice, C57BL/6 mice, were not susceptible to infection with neither ZIKVwt nor ZIKV-Nluc (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B). The viral titres in sera obtained from A129 mice at 3 and 5 dpi were measured using an immunostaining focus assay (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C and D). A129 mice infected with ZIKV-Nluc were found to have significant different viral titres at both 3 dpi (P &#x0003c; 0.05) and 5 dpi (P &#x0003c; 0.01) compared to A129 mice infected with ZIKVwt (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C and D). These results showed that despite reduced levels of attenuation, the ZIKV-Nluc virus could develop detectable viral titres in sera, suggesting that the virus replicated well in immunodeficiency mouse models. In addition, C57BL/6 mice showed no clinical signs of disease or weight loss when infected with both ZIKV-Nluc and ZIKVwt.</p></sec><sec><title>Using ZIKV-Nluc for the bioluminescence imaging of ZIKV infection</title><p>To investigate whether ZIKV-Nluc can be used as a tool for the bioluminescence imaging of ZIKV infection, A129 mice were inoculated with 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc via the i.p. route, and the bioluminescent signal was monitored at regular times post infection. As shown in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and B, a rapid dissemination of bioluminescence from the injection site was observed in A129 mice as early as at 1 dpi, with the peak bioluminescence occurring at 5 dpi (a robust bioluminescence signal was detected in the whole abdomen, brain, limbs, and tail). For some C57BL/6 mice, a slight detectable luminance signal above background was observed at the indicated time points (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and B). In a separate experiment, A129 mice were inoculated intracranially (i.c.) with 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc, and the bioluminescence in the brain regions were monitored at 2, 4, and 5 dpi. The titres of ZIKV-Nluc were measured using the double plaque assay. A direct correlation (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.9617) was found between the viral titres of ZIKV-Nluc and the intensity of luminescence, indicating that the virus replication <italic>in vivo</italic> could be reflected by the changes in luminescence intensity (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C and D). To further validate the correlations between the bioluminescent signals and viral loads, AG6 mice were inoculated with 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc via the footpads. Tissues, including spleen, kidney, testis, and ileocecal junction, were isolated at 1, 3, and 5 dpi and subjected to bioluminescence imaging and viral load measurement. Linear regression analysis showed that Nluc signal values correlated well with viral RNA copies in mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S1</xref>). Collectively, using ZIKV-Nluc, the whole disease progression of the viral infection could be traced well via the IVIS CCD camera system.</p></sec><sec><title>Involvement of type I and type II IFN in viral dissemination</title><p>To determine the mechanisms of ZIKV dissemination and pathogenesis in adults, pregnant mothers, and developing fetuses, the infection of mouse models by mimicking the natural infection route (footpad) is key <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. A129, AG6, and C57BL/6 mice were infected with 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc, or the parental ZIKV as control, via intra-footpad injections. The resulting bioluminescent signal was monitored longitudinally at regular time points post infection. No real or effective bioluminescence was detected in the mock-infected AG6, A129, and C57BL/6 mice, nor in mice infected with ZIKV-Nluc at 0 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S2</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, in the infected A129 and AG6 mice, following the footpad injection, the bioluminescent signals were primarily observed at the local sites of inoculation and the peritoneal cavity at 1 dpi, further disseminating to the brain and other tissues or organs, peaking in the peritoneal cavity and brain at 5 dpi, and subsequently decreasing throughout the process of viral infection. These results revealed the complete process of ZIKV dissemination and showed that the ZIKV-Nluc virus primarily invaded various abdominal organs and the brain.</p><p>At 9 dpi, only a slight bioluminescent signal was detected in the peritoneal cavity in the majority of the A129 and AG6 mice. However, at 14 dpi, the real and effective bioluminescence was still detectable in the peritoneal cavity of both AG6 and A129 mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), highlighting the viscerotropism of ZIKV <italic>in vivo</italic>. By contrast, only a weak bioluminescent signal was detected in the peritoneal cavity of some C57BL/6 mice almost throughout the trial period. Next, we calculated the total flux of each ZIKV-Nluc-infected mouse, and found that the signal values of the AG6 mice were significantly higher than those of the A129 mice at 2 dpi for the dorsal side (P &#x0003c; 0.05), and at 2 and 3 dpi for the ventral side (P &#x0003c; 0.05) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A and B). These results indicated that although type I IFNs were crucial for the viscera dissemination of ZIKV-Nluc, type II IFN also played a role in the process by delaying disease development in the early stages of virus infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue localization of ZIKV-Nluc</title><p>To accurately identify the potential target organs of ZIKV-Nluc in infected mice, the <italic>in vitro</italic> imaging of organs harvested from AG6, A129, and C57BL/6 mice infected with ZIKV-Nluc at 3 and 5 dpi was performed in a separate experiment. Marked Nluc signals were consistently observed in the abdominal organs of the infected AG6 and A129 mice, including in the spleen, intestine (i.e. ileocecal junction, a key region of the intestine), testis, uterus/ovary, and kidney at both time points (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A and B). Among these organs, the lymphoid rich organs, namely the spleen and the ileocecal junction, radiated two of the strongest light emissions, followed by the uterus/ovary, testis, and kidney. Bioluminescent signals in other organs, such as the brain, heart, and lung, varied individually among mice. For C57BL/6 mice, although only weak luciferase signals were detected in the intestines, no detectable bioluminescence was observed in other organs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A and B). In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of ileocecal junction, testis, and brain tissue sections showed a relatively clear distribution of E protein in AG6 mice infected with the ZIKV-Nluc virus (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>C and D). By comparison, for C57BL/6 mice, the distribution of E protein was only found in ileocecal junction section at 5 dpi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S3</xref>). Although the possibility that infection in other anatomical tissues may have occurred at earlier time points, or infected cells may have migrated from one location to another at later time points, these results supported previous observations that ZIKV preferentially replicated in both male and female reproductive tracts and led to infertility in mice <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Vertical transmission of ZIKV-Nluc</title><p>Given the fact that embryonic day 10-13 (E10-13, later in gestation) corresponds to the period of neurogenesis in mice <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, we infected pregnant dams with 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc at E10 via intra-footpad injection to determine the transmission of ZIKV from mother to offspring in mice.

By comparison, only a slight bioluminescence signal was detected in the brains of infected pregnant AG6 mice at 3 and 5 dpi, which was markedly different from that of 3-week-old AG6 mice infected with ZIKV-Nluc. The peritoneal cavity of the maternal mice still radiated slight light emissions at 1 day postpartum. In terms of the newborn mice, 25 &#x003bc;l of diluted substrate via a single i.p. injection resulted in an exact and effective bioluminescence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>B), indicating that ZIKV was capable of crossing the maternal-fetal barrier to infect the fetuses through vertical transmission.</p></sec><sec><title>Visualizing immunological protections of pooled immune serum</title><p>Although pooled immune sera (neutralizing anti-ZIKV antibodies) were recommended for protection against ZIKV infection <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, it is unclear how these sera suppress the progression of viral infection <italic>in vivo</italic>. We adopted our established bioluminescence imaging to evaluate the immunological effect of a pooled immune serum, #22-1, which conferred robust neutralizing activities against ZIKVwt (NT<sub>50</sub> titre of ~2048). Firstly, 80 IFU of the ZIKV-Nluc virus was pre-incubated with a 1:10 dilution of #22-1 at room temperature (RT) for 1.5 h before injection. The bioluminescent signal was monitored at regular time points post infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>A). Pre-incubation with #22-1 significantly reduced the bioluminescence signal at 3 and 5 dpi (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>B and C), and the bioluminescence of the #22-1-treated mice peaked in the peritoneal cavity and brain at 7 dpi (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>A). By contrast, the bioluminescence of the control mice peaked in the peritoneal cavity and brain at 5 dpi, before decreasing along with the process of viral infection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>A).</p><p>Next, we designed a treatment regime of #22-1, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>D. The pooled immune sera were administered at the indicated time points before and after infection with ZIKV-Nluc, while the bioluminescent signal was monitored at regular time points post infection. In the mice receiving PBS-immunized sera, a similar kinetic pattern of ZIKV-Nluc expression was observed in different tissues, with bioluminescence peaking at 5 dpi (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>E and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>B).

Taken together, the #22-1 treatment greatly restricted the spread of viral infection <italic>in vivo</italic>, which clearly demonstrated that the ZIKV-Nluc virus could be used as a tool for the real-time monitoring of how pooled immune sera (neutralizing anti-ZIKV antibodies or antiviral compounds) suppress the progression of viral infection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>ZIKV is a pathogenic virus that causes microcephaly, diffuse calcifications, GBS, meningoencephalitis, and other neurological complications in humans <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. In this study, we generated a replication-competent Nluc reporter ZIKV, which is genetically stable <italic>in vitro</italic> and<italic> in vivo</italic>, which represents a powerful tool for the monitoring of the spatio-temporal dynamics of viral infection in living mice. For the first time, we report on the complete process of ZIKV dissemination, as well as the identification of the ileocecal junction as a crucial visceral target of viral infection, the tracking of the vertical propagation of ZIKV, and the congenital infection of fetuses during pregnancy. Our findings confirmed the utility of the reporter virus for use in immunological protection or therapeutic efficacy studies using mouse models.</p><p>In the generated ZIKV-Nluc virus, the Nluc reporter was expressed as an additional part of the viral polyprotein, followed by its cleavage from the capsid protein mediated by 2A protease. Notably, C38, which retained the 5' sequence downstream of the AUG region (5'DAR), the hairpin in the C protein-coding region (cHP), the 5'cyclization sequence (5'CS), and the sequence downstream of the 5'CS-pseudoknot (DCS-PK) <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, was duplicated upstream of the reporter gene to ensure viral RNA replication.

A major hurdle in the practical application of these reporter flaviviruses is the relative instability of viral genomes. It has been proposed that engineered viruses evolve during their lifetime, and that a stable reporter virus could be harvested by picking small plaques <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. In our study, a strain of P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus was found to be stable after five rounds of viral infection with no nucleotide substitution in the genome. We postulated that the high stability of P8 ZIKV-Nluc was due to the very small Nluc gene (513bp), the P0 stocks as a population (quasispecies) of general consensus sequence might contain few viral particles with mutant genomes, after purification, the single virus yields exhibited homogeneous entity and high genetic stability. Further studies are still warranted to investigate the reason for the high stability of ZIKV-Nluc.

As expected, the purified ZIKV-Nluc exhibited a lower replication kinetic in the cell culture and a relatively low pathogenicity in mice. Despite this, the ZIKV-Nluc virus showed a similar growth pattern compared to that of its parental counterpart and produced robust luciferase activities with a peak value of &#x0003e; 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> light units. The magnitude of the bioluminescence generated by ZIKV-Nluc correlated well with its titre in both the cell culture and mice, which was in agreement with the findings reported by studies on JEV and DENV reporter viruses <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Such properties of ZIKV-Nluc provide a powerful means for further characterizing ZIKV dissemination in living mice using bioluminescence imaging.</p><p>Using the ZIKV-Nluc virus, we visualized the real-time ZIKV infection in A129, AG6, and C57BL/6 mice. ZIKV is known to directly infect neuronal progenitor cells and causes microcephaly, among other severe pathological complications <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>-<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Here, we demonstrated that ZIKV-Nluc primarily spread to the peritoneal cavity in A129, AG6, and C57BL/6 mice at 1 dpi, and was sustained throughout the remaining infection course. We hypothesized that the high viral loads in the peritoneal cavity may contribute to the quick dissemination of ZIKV to the brain and other organs. Although ZIKV-Nluc was found to be confined to specific parts of the peritoneal cavity in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, the lack of type I IFN receptors in A129 mice is likely to have contributed to the rapid proliferation of the virus, as well as to its spread to the brain and other organs, which was consistent with a previous biochemical analysis that found that ZIKV did not antagonize type I IFN response by promoting the degradation of STAT2 and did not induce disease in immunocompetent mice <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. By studying genetically deficient animals, previous studies have demonstrated that type I IFNs are crucial for the dissemination of JEV to visceral organs <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Type I IFNs serve as one of the key components in the innate immune system, and many interferon stimulated genes were found to be essential for viral restriction and clearance <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>. After infection with a neurotropic virus, such as West Nile virus, the induction of type I IFN expression in the endothelium has been found to enhance tight junction integrity and limit the permeability of the blood&#x02012;brain barrier <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. We also investigated the function of type II IFNs in the control of ZIKV infection. Compared with the singly-deficient A129 mice, AG6 mice lacking both type I and type II IFN receptors were found to be more susceptible to ZIKV-Nluc, with significantly higher bioluminescent signals being observed at 2 dpi for the dorsal side and at 2 and 3 dpi for the ventral side, indicating that type II IFNs contribute to limiting systemic ZIKV infection in mice in the early stage. Neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) have a limited regeneration ability, implying that the noncytolytic clearance of virus from neuronal cells, rather than direct neuronal lysis, is required to maximize the preservation of CNS function <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>. Type II IFNs were previously found to non-cytolytically clear Sindbis virus and measles virus from infected CNS neurons <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>. However, the protection of the noncytolytic immune response against neurotropic flavivirus has been disputed <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>. Given that type II IFNs interact with type I IFNs through distinct as well as common IFN receptor complexes <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, we proposed that both type I and type II IFNs are functionally non-redundant for the anti-ZIKV defence, and may modulate virus dissemination by restricting infection in extraneural tissues before irreversible CNS damage in mice. Further studies will be needed to determine the exact mechanism of the non-cytolytic clearance of ZIKV from infected neurons in the CNS.</p><p>ZIKV is known to preferentially replicate in the reproductive tract, including in the testis, uterus, and ovary <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, and this has been was confirmed by the bioluminescence imaging of specific organs. However, whether the intestine is a potential target organ of ZIKV infection remains to be further clarified. In this study, we found that the Nluc signal was widespread in the whole intestine in all of the immunodeficient mice tested, indicating that the intestine is likely to serve as an important organ of ZIKV infection. Previously, luciferase signals were also detected in the intestine of singly-deficient A129 mice infected with JEV-Rluc or doubly-deficient AG129 mice infected with DENV-Fluc, suggesting that JEV and DENV can replicate in gut-associated lymphoid tissues <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which intestine segment is the exact ROI prone to viral infection. In this study, we excised the whole intestine of infected mice, and found that the anatomical location radiating the strongest light emission was the ileocecal junction. The ileocecal junction functions as a mechanical barrier against colonic reflux, and is involved in the &#x0201c;ileal brake&#x0201d;, which slows the transit of chyme through the intestinal tract <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>. The fact that ZIKV targets the ileocecal junction is consistent with a recent study that found that the infection of enteric neurons with neurotropic flaviviruses causes delayed gastrointestinal transit in mice <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>.</p><p>Our study elucidated the spatio-temporal dynamics of ZIKV in pregnant mice and its subsequent vertical spread to the fetuses. The placenta develops within days of conception and acts as an innate barrier to invading microorganisms <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>. Based on epidemiological data combined with the detection of proteins and nucleic acids, it has been previously suggested that ZIKV can cross the placental barrier, being directly associated with fetal death, microcephaly, and other fetal abnormalities during pregnancy <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>. However, the mechanism for the infection and dissemination of ZIKV at the different stages of gestation remains unknown. In this study, by infecting pregnant AG6 mice with ZIKV-Nluc, the virus was found to primarily target the local site of inoculation and peritoneal cavity, subsequently spreading to other organs. The fetus may be highly sensitive to ZIKV infection during the first trimester of pregnancy <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>. However, devastating fetal outcomes, such as microcephaly, cerebral atrophy, ventricular enlargement, and cerebral calcifications, have also been found at other various gestational ages <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>.

Further longitudinal studies are needed in order to define the relationship between the severity of maternal infection and fetal consequences, as well as to determine the mechanism by which ZIKV crosses the placental barrier at the different stages of gestation.</p><p>We used the Nluc-expressing virus to visualize the neutralizing activities and therapeutic potential of the immune serum #22-1 in mice. As expected, significant reductions in bioluminescence signal were observed in mice receiving a pre-incubated virus-immune serum mixture in the early stages of infection. The bioluminescence in mice peaked at 7 dpi, indicating that pre-incubation before inoculation may not guarantee the neutralization of all the infectious particles. Nevertheless, these results provide new evidence for the superior genetic stability of ZIKV-Nluc<italic> in vivo</italic> compared with other reporter flaviviruses <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we traced the infection and clearance of ZIKV-Nluc in A129 mice treated with several doses of #22-1. The imaging results showed that a significant reduction of bioluminescence was observed in the mice that received a 9-dose treatment of antiviral serum, indicating that #22-1 exhibits therapeutic activity similar to that of other reported antibodies <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>. Previously, bioluminescence imaging has been recommended to predict lethality and evaluate the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic strategies in mice <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>. Here, we demonstrated that the ZIKV-Nluc virus may provide a new means for the development of antiviral therapeutics and the preclinical evaluation of vaccines.</p><p>Despite its merits, this study also contains some limitations. One limitation was that ZIKV-Nluc exhibited a lower replication efficiency and a lower pathogenicity than ZIKVwt. Of note, heterologous gene insertions always led to the attenuation of recombinant RNA viruses <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>-<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. Although ZIKV-Nluc was used to determine the replication, dissemination, and pathogenesis of ZIKV, as well as evaluate antivirals and vaccines, further studies will be needed to address the issue of attenuation. The second limitation of this study was the immunocompromised mice that were used. A129 and AG6 mice have been used previously to mimic aspects of ZIKV infection in humans. However, due to the lack of key components of antiviral immunity, these mouse models may not reveal the full range of disease manifestations in humans <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>. Immunologically competent mice treated with IFNAR1-blocking monoclonal antibody <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> or humanized mouse models may achieve better results in future studies.</p><p>In summary, a novel ZIKV reporter virus was established for the <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of ZIKV. This study is the first to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of ZIKV replication, the invasion of immune-sheltered tissues by ZIKV, and the vertical propagating of ZIKV during pregnancy. In addition to the brain and reproductive tract, including the testis, uterus, and ovary, the intestine was also demonstrated to be a potential target of ZIKV dissemination, wherein the ileocecal junction may likely play a key role in the neuronal dysfunction of ZIKV infection. The non-invasive imaging of ZIKV-Nluc is a powerful tool for use in the characterisation of the replication, dissemination, and pathogenesis of ZIKV, as well as for the evaluation of antivirals and vaccines <italic>in vivo</italic> for the treatment of ZIKV infection in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal experiments were conducted in strict accordance with the institutional guidelines for animal research and approved by the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals of the People's Republic of China.

The 50% neutralization titre (NT<sub>50</sub>) was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of each serum sample that resulted in a 50% reduction of the relative light unit relative to the control samples. The traditional neutralization method, PRNT<sub>50</sub>, was also performed to ensure the accuracy of the Nano-Glo assay.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>The immunohistochemistry assays were performed as previously described <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In brief, the tissues were fixed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at a thickness of 5 &#x003bc;m, and mounted onto slides. After deparaffinization and antigen retrieval, the sections were incubated overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. After washing three times, the sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated second antibodies and visualized using DAB reagent (Envision system kit; Dako). The slides were counterstained with haematoxylin and eosin. Images were captured using a whole-slide digital Pannoramic scanner (3D-Histech, Budapest, Hungary).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Student's t-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyse all of the virologic and immunologic data for significant differences (p &#x0003c; 0.05).
