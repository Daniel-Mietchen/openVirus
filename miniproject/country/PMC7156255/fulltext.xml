Brazil, occurring simultaneously to a Dengue fever epidemic, together
represent major challenges to public health authorities. This study aimed to
identify and compare the 2015-2016 spatial diffusion pattern of Zika,
Chikungunya, and Dengue epidemics in Salvador-Bahia. </p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><p> We used two study designs comprising a cross-sectional-to-point pattern and
an ecological analysis of lattice data. Residential addresses involving
notified cases were geocoded. We used four spatial diffusion analysis
techniques: (i) visual inspection of the sequential kernel and choropleth
map, (ii) spatial correlogram analysis, (iii) spatial local autocorrelation
(LISA) changes analysis and, (iv) nearest neighbor index (NNI) modeling.
</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p> Kernel and choropleth maps indicated that arboviruses spread to neighboring
areas near the first reported cases and occupied these new areas, suggesting
a diffusion expansion pattern. A greater case density occurred in central
and western areas. In 2015 and 2016, the NNI best-fit model had an S-curve
compatible with an expansion pattern for Zika (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.94; 0.95),
Chikungunya (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.99; 0.98) and Dengue (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93;
0.99) epidemics, respectively. Spatial correlograms indicated a decline in
spatial lag autocorrelations for the three diseases (expansion pattern).
Significant LISA changes suggested different diffusion patterns, although a
small number of changes were detected. </p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p> These findings indicate diffusion expansion, a unique spatial diffusion
pattern of Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue epidemics in Salvador-Bahia,
namely. Knowing how and where arboviruses spread in Salvador-Bahia can help
improve subsequent specific epidemic control interventions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>Zika</kwd><kwd>Chikungunya</kwd><kwd>Dengue</kwd><kwd>Arboviruses</kwd><kwd>Spatial diffusion</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="33"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In recent years, the emergence of arboviruses in different territories and countries
of the Americas, including Brazil, has been observed<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. The most recent arbovirus identified in Brazil was Zika fever in 2015,
which triggered an epidemic of undetermined exanthematous disease in the northeast
region<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The disease presented in most individuals with a mild and benign evolution; however,
a concentration of Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome cases generated hypotheses that the Zika
virus infection was associated with neurological and autoimmune complications in
Brazil, as had also been suspected in French Polynesia in 2013<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. Moreover, a considerable increase in the number of reported cases of
microcephaly in newborns provided evidence supporting a connection between Zika
fever and congenital neurological malformations<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Prior to the sudden rise in Zika fever cases, Chikungunya fever emerged in Brazil in
2014<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. Along with its severe articular pain characteristic, severe manifestations
such as neurological, cardiac, renal, and ocular complications have been reported to
be associated with the disease<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>These two arboviruses emerged amidst an endemic Dengue fever circulation present
since 1986, involving four viral serotypes and considered one of the most prevalent
infectious diseases. A triple epidemic in 2016 resulted in approximately 2 million
reported cases<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>These arboviruses have several characteristics in common; transmission occurs through
the same vector, namely, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which is abundant throughout
Brazil, and these arboviruses are derived from very close families that have
similarities in signs and symptoms, making diagnosis difficult<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>. The vector control measures and the main strategy for disease control were
inefficient and favored the propagation of arboviruses in Brazil<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Given this situation, an analysis of the geographical processes of spatial diffusion
can be used for monitoring epidemics and planning interventions, since it enables an
understanding of how and where diseases propagate through space and in the course of
time<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. In 2014, Sant-Julien stated that the process of spatial diffusion is the
action, or the result of an action of propagating a phenomenon homogeneously in a
system, whatever the force that drives the dispersion of this phenomenon<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>. The visualization of spatial patterns in data and the description of these
patterns aims to predict changes and uses this information to guide the formulation
of policies<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In the most commonly used classification, it is stated that spatial diffusion can
occur through four phenomena. The first is expansion, in which the phenomenon
propagates from one place to the other, often intensifying in the region of origin.
The second phenomenon is relocation, when the phenomenon propagates to new
localities but when moving, leaves the areas where it originated. The third is
contagion, dependent on direct contact and, therefore, strongly influenced according
to distance (individuals in nearby regions have a much higher probability of contact
than individuals in distant regions). Lastly, a hierarchical phenomenon is
characterized by the occurrence of diffusion respecting an ordered sequence of
classes or places, as from a large metropolitan center to remote villages<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A very limited number of studies have sought to specifically analyze the spatial
diffusion of arboviruses, with an emphasis on investigating Dengue fever in the
state of Bahia, Brazil<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">

ecologic study for the area data. The study area comprised the municipality of
Salvador, the capital of state of Bahia which is the third most populous city in
Brazil with an estimated population of 2,938,092 inhabitants in 2016<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>In the data analysis, three island neighborhoods namely Ilha dos Frades, Ilha de
Mar&#x000e9;, and Ilha de Bom Jesus dos Passos were excluded, because we considered that,
through discontinuity with the territory, the processes that act for spatial
diffusion of arboviruses could have differed. Centro Administrativo da Bahia (CAB)
and Aeroporto were also excluded since they are not residential neighborhoods,
making 5 of 163 neighborhoods excluded from the study.</p><p>The study period covered the epidemic waves that occurred in the years 2015 and 2016.
For Zika fever, the first wave comprised epidemiological weeks (EW) 15/2015 to
52/2015, and for Chikungunya and Dengue fever, the first wave comprised the EWs from
01/2015 to 52/2015. For the three arboviruses, we considered the second wave
comprised the EWs from 01/2016 to 52/2016.</p><p>Confirmed cases were used, as notified in the <italic>Sistema de Informa&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de
Agravos de Notifica&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o-SINAN</italic> of the Brazilian Ministry of Health.
Residential addresses for each case were georeferenced to generate punctual spatial
data using three automated geocoding application programming interfaces to obtain a
greater number of georeferenced cases: Google Maps, Bing Maps, and Open Street
Maps.</p><p>For aggregated data, we opted for smoothed incidence rates (empirical Bayesian)
because of the large variation of gross rates that would have strongly influenced
the analyses. The number of people living in the neighborhoods of Salvador in 2015
was obtained from estimates according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and
Statistics (IBGE), based on a 2010 census, and a linear interpolation was performed
to estimate the population for the year 2016<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. Cartographic digital meshes of the municipalities and the neighborhoods
were obtained from the IBGE.</p><p>An analysis of spatial diffusion patterns was performed using various techniques that
have been previously applied in other studies, namely visual inspection of the
sequential kernel and choropleth map, spatial correlogram analysis, local spatial
autocorrelation (LISA) changes analysis, and the nearest neighbor index (NNI)
modeling.</p><p>For visual inspection of sequential maps, 30 choropleth maps and 30 kernel maps were
generated with data from every three EWs of Zika fever. For Chikungunya and Dengue
fevers, 35 thematic and 35 kernel maps were generated.</p><p>Kernel estimation is a method for smoothing point events through inserting a
continuous surface over each point and requires a bandwidth of the region of
influence. A smoothed surface is displayed on the territory representing the levels
of case intensity<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>. Kernel maps were developed with a bandwidth of 2500 m, using QGIS
software<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Choropleth maps display levels of the same attribute per area at each time range for
sequential demonstration of the distribution of the disease. The maps were
constructed using five classes of incidence rates using QGIS software<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In the modeling of the NNI, the ratio of the nearest neighbor, or R, is calculated by
dividing the mean of the distances of the nearest points in a point pattern by the
average of the distances of a random distribution of the same number of points in
the same area. R is calculated cumulatively whenever a new case is diagnosed. The Rs
are presented as a function of time and modeled with a set of regression curves to
find the one that best fits the distribution. The results were interpreted according
to Lee et al. (2014)<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>. Their approach indicates that the processes of diffusion through contagion
and expansion are better adjusted using an inverse curve, and the hierarchical and
relocation processes are better modeled using a cubic curve.</p><p>In our study, linear, logarithmic, inverse, quadratic, cubic, power, compound,
S-curve, logistic, growth, and exponential regression curves were constructed using
the &#x0201c;curvefit&#x0201d; function of Stata software<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>. These curves were compared to the annual R curves plotted against time so
that the best fit was identified with the coefficient of R&#x000b2;.</p><p>For the analysis of the spatial correlograms, the values &#x0200b;&#x0200b;corresponding to Moran's I
(global autocorrelation indicators) were calculated using an adjacency matrix
(determining the spatial autocorrelation) and plotted against the spatial lags
referring to the distance intervals. The correlograms were developed for each
arbovirus annually, using &#x0201c;R statistical software&#x0201d;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref> in conjunction with QGIS software<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The incidence of each arbovirus was considered autocorrelated in space using
definitions proposed by Lam et al. (1996)<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>, in which a propagation by contagion model is considered when the
correlogram shows a tendency to autocorrelation in a soft decline, pointing to
distance as a principal factor in determining the similarity of incidence rates. A
hierarchical diffusion is suggested when the trajectory decreases and then rises,
forming a V-shaped curve, indicating that distant areas show similarity in rates and
that the diffusion then occurs in jumps.</p><p>To apply the technique of change in local autocorrelation, the Cohen and Tita (1999)
study was used as a reference<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref>. LISA indicators consist of the decomposition of Moran's I<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>28</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The values &#x0200b;&#x0200b;of a variable for a location and its neighboring areas provide the most
basic representation of local spatial associations. Each Local-Neighbor (LN) pair
consists of standardized levels of a variable in the local spatial unit L and in
neighboring spatial units N. Each element of the pair is low (L) or high (H)
relative to the local and neighbor value distributions in all observations<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In a scatterplot, pairs in which both local and neighbor values &#x0200b;&#x0200b;are above their
respective averages fall in the upper right quadrant (HH), or into the lower left
quadrant (LL). When they differ, pairs fall into the HL or LH quadrant. </p><p>For a dynamic view of the process, Cohen and Tita (1999)<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref> suggested analyzing changes in local-neighbor pair levels over time, looking
for evidence of diffusion that involves the propagation of high rates (or low rates)
to other spatial units. The authors claimed that the types of pair changes in
successive periods were compatible with a different type of diffusion, and allowed
for a determination of the mechanisms behind the change corresponded to each type of
diffusion.</p><p>LISA values were calculated using GeoDa software<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>29</sup>
</xref>, based on the incidence rates of each arbovirus, with reference to periods
of three EWs. Analyzed annually, changes in the predominant local autocorrelation
levels determined the spatial diffusion type for each arbovirus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The distribution curve of Zika fever cases showed two epidemic waves. The first
occurred between EW 15 and EW 41 in 2015, with an epidemic peak at EW 27 (112
cases). The second less significant epidemic, occurred between EW 01 and EW 22 in
2016, with a higher concentration at EW 9 (43 cases) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>
<fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2:</label><caption><title>Distribution curves of reported cases of Zika fever, Chikungunya
fever and Dengue in Salvador, 2015-2016.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1678-9849-rsbmt-53-e20190563-gf2"/></fig>
</p><p>The distribution curve of Chikungunya fever cases shows an epidemic wave in 2015,
with a higher case concentration between EW 26 and EW 38, and an epidemic peak at EW
33 (76 cases). Waves of lesser intensity were identified throughout 2016.</p><p>The distribution curve of Dengue fever cases shows a large epidemic wave that covered
the entire year in 2015, with a higher concentration of cases between EW 14 and EW
39. During 2016, there was a regular level of reported cases.</p><p>The majority of reported cases involving the three arboviruses lacked confirmatory
diagnostic criteria (undetermined), and diagnosis was presumably based on
clinical-epidemiological criteria, as laboratory confirmation is usually performed
at the beginning of epidemics to confirm autochthony.</p><p>The georeferencing of Zika fever cases in Salvador resulted in 1,780 (93%)
georeferenced addresses for the 1,914 cases confirmed between 2015 and 2016. These
cases were organized according to the date of first symptoms, and 32 cases were
discarded due to the date of first symptoms field having been incorrectly completed.
In total, 1,748 cases were considered in the statistical analysis and, of these,
there were 937 cases in 2015 and 811 in 2016. Of 2,120 Chikungunya fever cases,
1,974 (93%) were georeferenced, 38 were discarded, and we used 1,210 cases from the
year 2015 and 726 from the year 2016 in the statistical analysis. Of 9,302 cases of
confirmed Dengue fever, 8,938 (96%) were georeferenced, 301 discarded, and we used
5,449 cases for the year 2015, and 3,188 for the year 2016.</p><p>Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue fever cases were recorded in approximately 95% of
neighborhoods analyzed in the municipality of Salvador. The analysis of kernel maps
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>) and choropleth maps suggested
that the spatial diffusion process of Zika fever occurred through expansion, as did
Dengue and Chikungunya fevers. Some areas of the municipality, mainly in the
west/southwest region, showed an emergence of cases that then intensified and
reached nearby regions.</p><p>
<fig id="f3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3:</label><caption><title>Kernel maps for analysis of the spread of Zika fever in Salvador, EW

similarities).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1678-9849-rsbmt-53-e20190563-gf3"/></fig>
</p><p>Regarding Zika fever, the northeast of the municipality also presented a greater
concentration of cases in 2015. In Chikungunya and Dengue fevers, the central region
was highlighted. In 2016, the diseases appeared to have occurred with less
intensity, with a greater concentration of cases observed in the central region.</p><p>For Zika fever, 144 and 311 R-values &#x0200b;&#x0200b;were generated for the years 2015 and 2016,
respectively. For Chikungunya fever, 285 and 303 R-values &#x0200b;&#x0200b;were generated for the
years 2015 and 2016, respectively. For Dengue fever, 357 and 414 R-values were
generated for the years 2015 and 2016, respectively.</p><p>The regression curve that best fit the R curves was the S-curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), with R<sup>2</sup> 0.94;0.95 (Zika fever),
R<sup>2</sup> 0.99;0.98 (Chikungunya fever), and R<sup>2</sup> 0.93;0.99 (Dengue
fever) in 2015 and 2016, respectively; therefore, showing a process of diffusion
through expansion.</p><p>

</p><p>The correlograms of the three arboviruses show a smooth decline in spatial
autocorrelation as the distance between spatial lags increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). This decline shows that expansion diffusion was the
dominant factor for the spread of Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue fevers in the
municipality of Salvador. That is, the municipality presented areas with high
incidence rates and neighboring areas that had lower incidence rates, indicating
that these diseases progressively spread from one region to their neighboring
regions.</p><p>

</p><p>In the analysis of LISA changes, LISA values &#x0200b;&#x0200b;were generated with reference to
periods of three EWs, for each of the 160 neighborhoods within the Salvador
municipality. Analyzing the changes in these values, 19 of 1,280 LISA changes were
significant for Zika fever in 2015 and 34 of 2,400 LISA changes were significant for
Zika fever in 2016. The local autocorrelation changes characteristic of expansion
diffusion[14] were predominant in 2015 and hierarchical diffusion[20] in 2016.
Relocation diffusion was considered likely here, along with hierarchical diffusion,
due to similarity in the characteristics of the processes that occurred in
jumps.</p><p>For Chikungunya fever, 42 out of 2,400 LISA changes were significant in 2015 and 19
out of 2,080 LISA changes were significant in 2016. In two years, the type of
spatial diffusion was mixed because the number of changes related to the expansion
and hierarchical diffusion were equal in 2015[21;21], and similar in
2016[10;19].</p><p>For Dengue fever in 2015, 62 out of 2,560 LISA changes were significant and 79 out of
2560 changes were significant in 2016. The number of changes characterizing the
hierarchical diffusion process[34] surpassed the expansion[28] in 2015 but was very
close in 2016[39;40] with diffusion mixed in this year. </p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The analysis of the spatial diffusion of Zika fever, Chikungunya fever, and Dengue
fever in Salvador demonstrated that the propagation of the three arboviruses
occurred through expansion in the two years of study.</p><p>In 2015, Zika and Chikungunya fevers broke out in Salvador and, as expected, due to
population susceptibility and abundance of the main vector, <italic>Aedes
aegypti</italic>, the arboviruses caused an explosive number of cases.</p><p>Although Dengue fever had already established in this period in Salvador, it showed a
significant increase in notifications, which was observed throughout Brazil. Experts
attribute this increase to the reemergence of the DENV1 serotype in 2013 and to a
reduced DENV4 circulation, taking into account that the presence of the four
serotypes of the Dengue virus in Brazil often trigger epidemics of the disease after
alternating or replacing the predominant serotype<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>31</sup>
</xref>. The antigenic diversity of the Dengue virus is a contributing factor to the
continuous occurrence of the disease, since multiple sequential infections may occur
due to the lack of cross-immunity between virus serotypes<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>32</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that the three diseases emerged and intensified in some areas
of Salvador, and initially expanded to nearby sites through the expansion diffusion
process. This finding is compatible with the dynamics of infectious diseases, where
transmission is more likely to occur among individuals who are closely connected in
space and time<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>For the year 2016, our results indicated that the three arboviruses had spread
through expansion, although with less intensity. The progressive decrease in the
number of new cases was consistent with the dynamics of the arboviruses in the
second year of propagation because, although the number of new cases continued to
intensify in places with greater population density, a decrease in the susceptible
population in some areas led to a lower occurrence of diseases in the greater part
of Salvador.</p><p>The diffusion through expansion model was identified by Barreto et al. (2008)<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">

emergency period of this arbovirus. Lee et al. (2004)<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">

between 2003 and 2008 in Taiwan.</p><p>Morato et al. (2015)<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> identified a different pattern in their study on the spatial diffusion of
Dengue fever in the municipality of Jequi&#x000e9;, Bahia, in 2009, where they showed that
the disease epidemic occurred initially through expansion and later through
relocation.</p><p>In addition to the identification of the spatial diffusion processes, analysis of
kernel maps indicated that the three diseases had a main focus of transmission in an
area that extended from the west/southwest region of the municipality, where
administrative districts are concentrated, to the central region, with both regions
having higher population density and social interaction networks. This area
sustained a high number of cases throughout almost the entire study period, possibly
due to the higher concentration of susceptible cases compared to other areas.</p><p>Areas with high population density and economic development that can act as
transmission focuses reinforce the pattern of diffusion through expansion as a
characteristic of communicable diseases, reaching a greater number of people who are
interacting in close quarters<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>These areas are compatible with the epicenter of the first Dengue fever epidemic,
also occurring in Salvador, as reported by Barreto et al. (2008)<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>. This similarity suggests that, if interventions had been directed to those
areas of previous Dengue fever epidemics, the expansion of arboviruses and the
recent triple epidemic could have been minimized.</p><p>Among the visualization methods, the kernel maps provided a better appreciation of
the spatial diffusion than the choropleth maps, because they exhibited areas with a
higher density of cases where the risk of arbovirus transmission may have been
higher due to prevalent cases.</p><p>Choropleth maps were more difficult to interpret because of excessive variation in
incidence rates, a phenomenon less frequent in large populations and more important
when small numbers of cases are related to small populations. The color scale has
been reported to be also very sensitive to variations, which hinders
interpretation<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Apart from this, the diffusion processes were evaluated in conjunction with
other techniques used.</p><p>Despite a high degree of subjectivity, the use of visual presentation methods
combined with statistical techniques can make quantitative results easier to
interpret.</p><p>Among the statistical methods used, the LISA changes analysis technique produced a
different result for the three arboviruses compared to the other techniques.
However, the LISA result should be interpreted with caution because of the small
proportion of statistically significant changes found in our study (&#x0003c;3%).</p><p>The spatial correlograms presented similar configurations. The NNI analysis technique
appeared to be the most robust method of analysis as it was based on a statistical
approach that used daily information, was modeled using regression curves, and could
be compared to other analyses previously simulated by Lee et al. (2008)<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is that the surveillance data may have contained a
poor diagnostic classification in reports, possibly due to the rapid emergence of
arboviruses and similarity in the symptoms when defining the diagnoses according to
clinical epidemiological criteria. Simultaneous circulation of the three arboviruses
was a factor that may have compromised the investigation of some of the diseases and
led to more intense investigation of others. Since most cases were asymptomatic, we
considered that a substantially lower number of cases might have been reported. It
is likely that diagnostic cross-classification errors occurred during the
simultaneous triple epidemic, but it is difficult to evaluate the magnitude of such
bias. It might be that the cross-diagnosis brings the specific spatial diffusion
patterns close to that observed for Dengue. This would obscure specific
characteristics that might happen for Zika and Chikungunya.</p><p>Despite this limitation, the combination of statistical and visualization techniques
appeared to allow the analysis of spatial diffusion. This information should allow
the implementation of more effective control programs by directing prevention and
control strategies to specific areas and periods, as recommended by Cliff et al.
(1981)<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>Our study of the spatial diffusion of Zika, Chikungunya, and Dengue arboviruses in in
Salvador-Bahia, in the period of triple epidemics between 2015 and 2016, enabled an
identification of the propagation process of these arboviruses, indicating that the
diffusion pattern of the Zika fever epidemics was the same as that of the Dengue and
Chikungunya fever epidemics. During the two years of study, these diseases spread
through diffusion expansion. This knowledge on how and where arboviruses spread in
Salvador in a triple epidemic situation provides important information for improving
epidemiological surveillance, both in terms of monitoring cases and in terms of
targeting interventions for disease control.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="fn3"><p>
