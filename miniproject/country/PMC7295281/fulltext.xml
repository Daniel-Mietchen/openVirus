These were like famous last words until the Corona blitzkrieg struck. Blitzkrieg is a German word for &#x0201c;lightning war,&#x0201d; a calculated war tactic which employs the elements of surprise, speed, and superiority in material and firepower and creates psychological shock and complete disorganization in enemy forces. SARS-CoV2 did exactly that and within 3 months has changed the face of the world. It has created havoc in health care networks in most affluent countries, with unnerving ferocity it has devoured the health supply lines, and set the scientists and research community scampering for solutions which seemingly mutate faster than the virus itself.</p><p>
Although COVID has been a respiratory disease, yet its malevolence seems to have grazed the gastrointestinal (GI) tract too. Samanta et al in a comprehensive review have lucidly presented the GI associations and GI manifestations of Coronavirus.
<xref rid="JR_1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
They have done a meticulous job by looking at every aspect including mechanisms of viral entry, the significance of ACE-2 and TMPRSS2 and diarrhea, the impact on natural course of preexisting GI diseases, and the possible methods to break transmission lines.

The first COVID case in India was reported on January 30, 2020, 100th case on March 14, 1,000th case on March 29, and 10,000th case on April 13, and 20,000th case on April 21, 2020.
<xref rid="OR_2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>Yet, we are not aware of how many of them have had GI manifestations. In India, we do not have a national registry for COVID cases in patient with underlying GI or liver diseases; maybe it would be prudent if the GI societies make such a registry.</p><p>
As it would appeal to common sense, patients on immunomodulators for preexisting diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and autoimmune hepatitis should be prone to both infection with SARS-CoV2 as well as a more severe COVID course. Yet, this again remains a conjecture and the real-world data which is emerging does not provide strong support to this. An international registry has been established for IBD patients with COVID.
<xref rid="OR_3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
As per this registry as of April 22, a total of 704 COVID-19 cases from 38 countries have been reported. The observed overall case fatality rate in patients with IBD is approximately 4% which is similar to patients without any disease. Interestingly, the case fatality rate was 8% for patients on 5-ASA/sulfasalazine, 12% for patients on steroids, 4% for those on budesonide, and 1 to 3% for those on biologicals. The last update from this registry also suggest that many IBD patients with symptom flares may actually have COVID-19, so this is something to keep in our differential with our patients during this pandemic.
</p><p>Do we have the answers? It is amazing that despite 3 months of pandemic and despite the complete unswerving attention of the entire clinical and scientific community, we are grappling for answers and that too with all the crucial aspects of COVID.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Fecal viral shedding has been noted, yet the quantitative magnitude of viral load is much less than respiratory viral load, raising questions on whether it has the capacity to cause infection.

And with collective effort we should overcome this scourge and until then would be what Robert Frost most appropriately said &#x0201c;We dance round in a ring and suppose, But the Secret sits in the middle and knows.&#x0201d;</p></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="d31e81"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="JR_1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Samanta</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Dhar</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Khaliq</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kochhar</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>2019 Novel Coronavirus infection: gastrointestinal manifestations</article-title><source>J Digest Endosc</source><year>2020</year><volume>11</volume><fpage>13</fpage><lpage>18</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="OR_2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Available at: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/.
