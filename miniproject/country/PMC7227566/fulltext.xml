The virus, SARS-Coronavirus-2, is particularly virulent in the elderly who can develop symptoms and become mortally ill within days of contracting the virus. The virus is easily transmitted by droplets (e.g., sneezing and coughing) and communal living settings such as personal care homes can be vulnerable to the spread of the virus. Identifying patients early in the disease process is important to providing appropriate medical interventions. To date, most of the medical literature, including Center for Disease Control guidelines, has relied on three necessary symptoms in making the diagnosis of COVID-19: fever, cough, and shortness of breath. We present four cases of elderly patients who developed altered mental status as their presenting symptom without associated fever or respiratory symptoms.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0001"><title>Key Words</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>altered mental status</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0001"><title>OBJECTIVES</title><p id="para0005">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019 and a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.

In the majority of adult patients, respiratory distress is the most common presenting symptom. Waiting for patients to develop dyspnea and/or fever will delay treatment.
