While outbreaks have typically been of relatively limited size and confined to rural Central Africa, the 2013&#x02013;2016 mostly urbanized epidemic in West Africa took the world by surprise and showed the potentially devastating impact of the Ebola virus [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The case fatality ratio (CFR), the proportion of EVD cases who died [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], remains a challenging quantity to estimate due to undetected cases, incomplete data on detected cases, and the lack of laboratory confirmation of probable and suspected cases. CFR estimates may vary because of unreported survival outcomes, time of case diagnosis, and the statistical methods used for estimation [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For instance, 14 694 (44%) of the survival outcomes for confirmed, probable, and suspected cases are unreported in the dataset analyzed by the World Health Organization (WHO) Ebola Response Team [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Using clinical, laboratory, and field surveillance data, we imputed unreported outcomes based on models fitted to observed outcome data. Imputed outcomes have previously been used in other contexts to generate baseline estimates of CFR necessary in evaluating interventions and designing randomized controlled trials [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Regression modeling has been used widely to predict EVD survival outcomes [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>]. For instance, after the first 9 months of this epidemic, logistic regression was used to identify predictors of CFR [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It was found that age, sex, country, and fever were correlated with CFR [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, much of the observed heterogeneity remained unaccounted for. Thus, there is a need to use methods that can account for multiple predictors and their interactions as well as limitations of the data available.</p><p>Machine learning (ML) techniques are powerful alternatives to conventional statistical regression models [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In ML, less restrictive algorithms are used to learn the relationship between outcome and proposed predictors [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because of this flexibility, ML techniques are generally very effective in predicting outcomes at the individual level. Boosted regression trees (BRTs), a well-characterized ML technique, have been used in infectious disease modeling for data imputation [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The predictive performance of a BRT, its ability to identify influential predictors and interactions, and its ability to model nonlinear relationships make it an ideal technique to answer key questions in infectious disease epidemiology. For instance, Bhatt and colleagues [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] used BRTs to map the global distribution and burden of the dengue virus. Similarly, Dorigatti and colleagues [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] used BRTs to refine the efficacy estimate of the Sanofi Pasteur dengue vaccine CYD&#x02013;TDV (chimeric yellow fever virus-DENV tetravalent dengue vaccine), illustrating the effectiveness of BRTs in estimating the uncertainty around missing or unrecorded data. However, despite these attempts, ML models are still seldomly used in the analysis and modeling of infectious diseases.</p><p>Here, we used BRTs to identify, using a nonparametric approach, the predictors of CFR for the West African epidemic, imputed unreported survival outcomes, and combined the imputed and reported survival outcomes to re-estimate CFRs for the epidemic. Finally, we compared the CFR estimates obtained without data imputation with estimates obtained including data imputation and estimates adjusted for model imperfection.</p><sec sec-type="materials" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Data Sources</title><p>We used case-level data that were reported to the WHO using the viral hemorrhage fever case-reporting forms as published in the supplementary data of the WHO Ebola Response Team [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the case-reporting forms, cases were defined as confirmed, probable, and suspected using the WHO EVD case definition system [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Our main analyses present CFR inference based on confirmed, probable, and suspected cases, while sensitivity analyses using either &#x0201c;confirmed&#x0201d; cases or &#x0201c;confirmed and probable&#x0201d; cases are presented in the Supplementary Data (Supplementary Sensitivity Analysis). A wealth of information was recorded for each case, including demographic (eg, age, country) and clinical (eg, fever, diarrhea, bleeding) data.</p><p>The survival outcome for this dataset was reported as the &#x0201c;final status&#x0201d; of cases. Final status was defined as alive, dead, or missing. The fate of cases with missing final status was unknown (eg, cases could have been alive in the communities or later died in the communities but were not reported to, or recorded by, the appropriate authorities). Cases with known final outcomes accounted for 18 644 (56%) of the cases in the dataset.</p><p>We selected 43 variables as candidate predictors of CFR. This selection was informed by the literature [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] as well as judgment on the influence of potential predictors on CFR.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>BRT models rely on decision trees and gradient boosting. With regression trees, a recursive binary split of data is carried out until a stopping criterion is reached [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Used alone for analysis, regression trees are susceptible to bias and inaccuracy. The gradient boosting applies randomness into the stage-wise fitting, which by introducing stochasticity helps to avoid overfitting of the model to the data (Supplementary Methods).</p><p>To fit the BRT model, we used the survival outcomes as the dependent variables and the candidate predictors as the independent variables. We evaluated the model performance in terms of multiple measures of predictive accuracy&#x02014;that is, sensitivity, specificity, proportion of predictions correctly classified, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The performance measures quantify the ability of the BRT model to discriminate between outcomes (death/survival) for the given predictors [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For the AUC, performance values of 0.5 (50%) indicate random discrimination of outcomes and performance values of 1 (100%) indicate perfect discrimination of outcomes. These performance measures were used to determine the optimal hyperparameters.</p><p>To identify the model hyperparameters (tree complexity [tc], learning rate [lr], and bag fraction [bf]), multiple BRT models were fitted using different parameter combinations. In total, we explored 72 hyperparameter combinations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> presents a summary schematic of the analysis and further details of the parameterization are included in the Supplementary Data.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic summary of the analysis steps used in this study. Abbreviations: AUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; BRT, boosted regression tree; PCC, percentage correctly classified. </p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ciz678f0001"/></fig><p>BRT models return probabilities for each outcome. Converting these probabilities into binary values requires a threshold probability [<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We selected our threshold to obtain equal sensitivity and specificity. It allowed us make predictions without trading off death and survival outcomes.</p><p>We simplified the BRT model by excluding noninformative predictors with minimal effect on prediction [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The relative influence (RI) of a predictor is the number of times the predictor is selected to discriminate outcomes (death/survival) and the improvement in the model for each selection, which is based on the amount of residuals explained at each selection [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These RIs are scaled to sum to 100, and higher influences indicate greater effects on survival outcome. The model was repeatedly refitted, each time removing the predictor with the lowest RI. We applied a default rule that continued to remove predictors with the lowest RIs until the average change in predictive deviance exceeded the standard error of the full model (ie, model using all candidate predictors) [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The simplified model was used to predict the survival outcomes for the 44% of cases in the dataset with missing outcomes and the CFRs were re-estimated for the full dataset. Using nonparametric bootstrapping with replacement for 1000 realizations, we calculated the means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the re-estimated CFRs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup5">Supplementary Methods</xref>).</p><p>CFR estimates with imputation ignore the bias arising from the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of the imputation algorithm. We therefore corrected our CFR estimate using the estimated sensitivity and specificity of the BRT model to obtain unbiased estimates [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The inferred CFR was calculated for each subset of interest according to the following formula:</p><disp-formula><mml:math id="M1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mtable columnalign="left" columnspacing="1"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mtext>&#x000a0;</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>&#x000a0;</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>&#x000a0;</mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">v</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>&#x02212;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>&#x000a0;</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mtext>&#x000a0;</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>&#x000a0;</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the CFR for the imputed data (ie, data with unknown outcomes) using the estimated sensitivity and specificity of the BRT model [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

To our knowledge, the dataset used in this study (33 338 cases) is the largest case-level data used to characterize the CFR of EVD.</p><p>The effects of the BRT&#x02019;s hyperparameters on the survival outcome were consistent with those in the published literature [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], with AUCs greater than 70% and less than 90% indicating appreciable predictive performance [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The data to which we fitted the BRT model were large relative to typical epidemiological datasets in outbreak settings; however, our method proved robust to changes in sample sizes, with comparable mean imputation performances reported even after data downsampling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup3">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Model simplification suggested that district, hospitalization status, age, case classification, quarter, reporting delay, anorexia, difficult breathing, fever, and fatigue were the most important predictors retained in the model. Most bleeding predictors (except for unexplained bleeding) were removed, which corroborates the existing literature suggesting that external bleeding was not a prominent characteristic of the West African Ebola epidemic [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref>]. Consequently, the predictive value of bleeding predictors was limited compared with the other (eg, age, reporting delay, district, and fever) predictors of CFR. Simplification removed some clinical predictors, but we found that the significance of clinical predictors varied with sample size and the subset of data included in the analysis. For example, hiccups occurrence was excluded from the final (simplified) model in our analysis but was found to have a predictive value in an earlier study conducted in Sierra Leone [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], although larger sample sizes would be needed to validate the significance of those results [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Earlier analyses of the West African epidemic showed that fever was not a significant predictor of the CFR [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], while, in contrast, our study identified fever as the ninth most important predictor of the CFR. Further investigations revealed that the occurrence of fever only became a significant predictor in analyses using the datasets compiled after 25 November 2014 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup5">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). From this finding we cannot determine whether the emergence of fever occurrence as an important predictor of the CFR is related to changing clinical presentation of the EVD over time or was caused by changes in reporting practices over the course of the epidemic. The high CFR in patients without fever might also suggest immune evasion [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, survival outcomes were better for patients with anorexia (see Supplementary Results), perhaps because these patients were better medically attended.</p><p>The predictors retained in the simplified model were broadly similar to those reported in the literature and the identified clinical predictors reflected the symptomatic profile of EVD cases during the West African epidemic and in previous outbreaks [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Demographic predictors of age, case classification, reporting delay, quarter, and district were important predictors of CFR, which broadly agrees with discussions in the literature suggesting that, notwithstanding the clinical presentations of EVD, demographic factors were predictors of EVD fatalities [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Age-dependent CFR variation, consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], suggests a biological effect. Potential biological reasons include variation in the immunocompetency of children and young adults and the increased likelihood of comorbidities in aged individuals [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The CFR increased with increasing reporting delay, suggesting that early case reporting could have improved survival outcomes, although previous findings have suggested that early reporting was insufficient to increase survival probability [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A clinical consideration is that people who were reported late may have been more likely to die because their symptoms persisted while those with milder symptoms would have recovered earlier and were less likely to report as patients with Ebola.</p><p>While adjusted CFRs were broadly higher than uncorrected CFRs, they corroborate with estimates of the Ebola <italic>Zaire</italic> CFR, from 1979 to 2014, compiled by Van Kerkhove and colleagues [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, adjusted CFRs must be interpreted with appropriate caution, as CIs are wide. Results validating the sensitivity and specificity adjustments are reported in the Supplementary Data.</p><p>Country-level CFR estimates were consistent for Guinea, which had the highest proportion of complete outcome data (99.5%; ie, 3740 out of 3757 cases; see <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) among the 3 countries. The relatively high adjusted CFR estimates obtained in Liberia and Sierra Leone compared with estimates without and with imputation, and the associated relatively wide CI, could reflect the true CFR in these 2 countries but also possibly the changing data-collection practices over time. For instance, Liberia switched from an aggregate system of reporting to an individual-based system of reporting that could have affected data curation at the country level [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Potential biases may arise because definitive outcomes are more frequently reported for hospitalized cases, who, this study shows, were less likely to die from EVD infection [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Adjusted CFRs account for the estimated sensitivity and specificity of the BRT imputation model and the dependence of missingness on characteristics of the cases (eg, age and reporting delay).</p><p>These robust CFR estimates in conjunction with other resources can be used to inform public health contingency planning for future Ebola epidemics&#x02014;for instance, to allocate resources and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In epidemic settings with limited resources, as was the case in West Africa, reliable CFR estimates are essential for planning hospital care and managing cases [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>While previous studies show clinical characteristics indicative of death with the intention of having a profile that could be used in subsequent case triaging [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the model built in this study cannot be used in such manner as it lacked clinically significant predictors, such as viral load, which were not captured in the dataset. Rather, the output of our analyses should be used to inform resource allocation and care planning. Also, our analysis provides a baseline CFR against which the CFR observed with interventions (such as a new treatment) could be assessed. As a known predictor of EVD CFR [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], viral load data, where available, should be used in future attempts to further refine CFR estimates of EVD. If some survival outcomes were incorrectly recorded during data collection and/or if some cases were missing entirely from the database, then, in the absence of at least some gold-standard data, no estimation strategy can fully account for such limitations and this may be in part responsible for the imperfect nature of the imputation process.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that BRT modeling can be used to obtain improved estimates of CFR where outcome data are unreported. This BRT modeling framework could be implemented to further investigate EVD CFR heterogeneity and adapted to other infectious disease epidemiological analyses based on datasets with missing data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Clinical Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
