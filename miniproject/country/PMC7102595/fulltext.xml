Since then, this highly contagious COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide, with a rapid rise in the number of deaths. Novel COVID-19&#x02013;infected pneumonia (NCIP) is characterized by fever, fatigue, dry cough, and dyspnea. A variety of chest imaging features have been reported, similar to those found in other types of coronavirus syndromes. The purpose of the present review is to briefly discuss the known epidemiology and the imaging findings of coronavirus syndromes, with a focus on the reported imaging findings of NCIP. Moreover, the authors review precautions and safety measures for radiology department personnel to manage patients with known or suspected NCIP. Implementation of a robust plan in the radiology department is required to prevent further transmission of the virus to patients and department staff members.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Visual abstract</title><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><graphic xlink:href="fx1_lrg"/></fig></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>pneumonia</kwd><kwd>infection control</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="p0010">Coronaviruses are nonsegmented, enveloped, positive-sense, single-strand ribonucleic acid viruses, belonging to the Coronaviridae family [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Six types of coronavirus have been identified that cause human disease: four cause mild respiratory symptoms, whereas the other&#x000a0;two, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, have caused epidemics with high mortality rates.</p><p id="p0015">In December 2019, a new type of coronavirus called COVID-19 was extracted from lower respiratory tract samples of several patients in Wuhan, China. These patients presented with symptoms of severe pneumonia, including fever, fatigue, dry cough, and respiratory distress. Novel COVID-19&#x02013;infected pneumonia (NCIP) is believed to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan. The&#x000a0;virus, which has been reported in 28 countries as of this&#x000a0;writing, has shown human-to-human transmission [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and has been classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The mean incubation period is estimated to be 5.2 days, which allows air travelers to spread the disease globally [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p id="p0015s">Evidence shows that virus transmission can occur during the incubation period in asymptomatic patients. Moreover, high sputum viral loads were found in a patient with NCIP during the recovery phase [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As of February 5, 2020, more than 25,000 confirmed cases have been reported worldwide, with a rapid rise in the number of deaths. The World Health Organization has called the outbreak a global health emergency.</p><p id="p0020">Imaging is critical in assessing severity and disease progression in COVID-19 infection. Radiologists should be aware of the imaging manifestations of the novel COVID-19 infection. A variety of imaging features have been described in similar coronavirus-associated syndromes. In this brief review, we discuss the epidemiologic and radiologic features of coronavirus syndromes, with a focus on the known imaging features of NCIP. In addition, precautions and safety measures for radiology department personnel in managing patients with known or suspected NCIP are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>SARS: Epidemiology and Imaging</title><p id="p0025">SARS coronavirus was first recognized in 2003 after a global outbreak originating in southern China. The virus spread to 29 countries globally, affecting 8,422 patients, with a mortality rate of 11%. The transmission of this coronavirus occurs via large droplets and direct inoculation [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The virus may remain viable for up to 24 hours&#x000a0;on dry surfaces, but it loses its infectivity with widely available disinfectants such as bleach and formaldehyde [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">Initial chest radiography in individuals with SARS will frequently show focal or multifocal, unilateral, ill-defined air-space opacities in the middle and lower peripheral lung zones [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], with progressive multifocal consolidation over a course of 6 to 12 days involving one or both lungs [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Chest CT will show areas of ground-glass opacity and consolidation in involved segments.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>MERS: Epidemiology and Imaging</title><p id="p0035">MERS coronavirus infection was first reported in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, in 2012 [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Since then, approximately 2,500 laboratory-confirmed human infections have been reported in 27 countries, with a mortality rate reaching more than 30% [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The risk for transmission to family members and health workers seems to be low. Despite the potential for epidemics through Hajj pilgrimages in Saudi Arabia, there&#x000a0;has not been a notable outbreak recently. It seems that in contrast to the human-to-human pathway as the main route of virus spread in SARS coronavirus, the transmission in MERS coronavirus occurs mainly through nonhuman, zoonotic sources (eg, bats, camels) [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p id="p0040">In 83% of patients with MERS coronavirus infection, initial radiography will show some degree of abnormality, with ground-glass opacities being the most common finding [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Likewise, CT will show bilateral and predominantly ground-glass opacities, with a predilection to basilar and peripheral lung zones, but observation of isolated consolidation (20%) or pleural effusion (33%) is not uncommon in&#x000a0;MERS [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>NCIP: What Do We Know?</title><p id="p0045">Patients with COVID-19 infection present with pneumonia (ie, fever, cough, and dyspnea). Although fatigue is common, rhinorrhea, sore throat, and diarrhea uncommonly occur. A recent report in <italic>The Lancet</italic> described the clinical manifestations of NCIP in 41 patients [<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. According to that report, abnormal chest imaging findings were observed in all patients, with 40 having bilateral disease at initial imaging. This early report on the presentation of the NCIP in intensive care unit patients indicated bilateral subsegmental areas of air-space consolidation, whereas in non&#x02013;intensive care unit patients, transient areas of subsegmental consolidation are seen early, with bilateral ground-glass opacities being predominant later in the course of the disease (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>, <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>
). Serial chest radiography of a 61-year-old man who died of NCIP showed progressively worsening bilateral consolidation during a course of 7&#x000a0;days. Another report on 99 individuals with confirmed NCIP described similar imaging findings, with bilateral lung involvement in 75% and unilateral involvement in 25% [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Another study of five individuals in a family cluster with NCIP [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] described bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities, with more extensive involvement of lungs parenchyma in older family members. The reported imaging features most closely resemble those of MERS and SARS. No pleural effusion or cavitation has been reported so far in confirmed cases of NCIP, but pneumothorax was reported in 1% of patients (1 of 99) in a study by Chen et&#x000a0;al [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Overall, the imaging findings are highly nonspecific and might overlap with the symptoms of H1N1 influenza, cytomegalovirus pneumonia, or atypical pneumonia. The acute clinical presentation and history of contact with a COVID-19-infected patient or history of recent travel to an eastern Asian country (eg, China, South Korea, or Japan), Italy, or Iran should raise clinical suspicion for the diagnosis of NCIP. Although further investigations on the clinical and radiologic aspects of the COVID-19 are ongoing, imaging will continue to be a crucial component in patient management.<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Chest CT scan from a 50-year-old male Chinese patient with a confirmed diagnosis of novel COVID-19-infected pneumonia.

Diagnostic imaging facilities should have guidelines in place to manage individuals with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. The novel COVID-19 is highly contagious and is believed to transmit mostly through respiratory droplets, but there is uncertainty as to whether the virus can be transmitted by touching a surface or an item that is contaminated (ie, a fomite). A thorough understanding of the routes of virus transmission will be essential for patients&#x02019; and health care professionals&#x02019; safety. Droplets have the greatest risk of transmission within 3 ft (91.44 cm), but they may travel up to 6 ft (183 cm) from their source [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For the purpose of diagnostic imaging in individuals with NCIP,&#x000a0;whenever possible, portable radiographic equipment should be used to limit transportation of patients. On the basis of experience with SARS, the use of a satellite radiography center and dedicated radiographic equipment can decrease the risk for transmission from known infected individuals. If a patient needs to be transported to the radiology department, he or she should wear a surgical mask during transport to and from the department.</p><p id="p0090">As of March 4, 2020, for providers, the World Health Organization recommends respiratory protection with use of a standard medical mask, unless aerosol-generating procedures are performed. [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additional guidelines from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend airborne precautions and the use of a N95 mask or higher when in close contact with patients who have COVID-19 or are under investigation for the virus. In addition, the droplet precaution instruction&#x000a0;recommends appropriate personal protective equipment, including a disposable isolation gown with fluid-resistant characteristics, a pair of disposable gloves with coverage over gown cuffs, eye protection with goggles, and if&#x000a0;possible a face mask over goggles [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In a study of 254 medical staff members who had been exposed to SARS coronavirus, the risk for virus transmission was significantly reduced by using droplet and contact precautions [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p id="p0055">CT and MR machine gantries, noninvasive ultrasound probes, blood pressure cuffs, and image viewing station mice and keyboards need to be disinfected after every contact with suspected patients. According to the Spaulding classification of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x000a0;and FDA, these surfaces need to be either washed with soap&#x000a0;and water or decontaminated using a low-level or intermediate-level disinfectant, such as iodophor germicidal detergent solution, ethyl alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol. Environmental services staff members need to be specifically trained for&#x000a0;professional cleaning of potentially contaminated surfaces&#x000a0;after each high-risk patient contact [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Radiology departments should contact their equipment vendors to find the safest disinfectant for each piece of equipment in use.</p><p id="p0060">US health care imaging facilities need to be prepared for&#x000a0;the escalating incidence of new cases of COVID-19. If appropriately prepared, radiology department staff members can take greater measures to manage the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the facility and personnel. A multidisciplinary committee should convene to outline guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus through human-to-human contact and the department equipment. Implementation of&#x000a0;a robust plan can provide protection against further transmission of the virus to patients and staff members.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Take-Home Points</title><p id="p0065">
