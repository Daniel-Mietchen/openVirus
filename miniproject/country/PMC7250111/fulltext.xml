CQ is ineffective in curing dengue (high certainty evidence) and may have little or no benefit in curing chikungunya (low-certainty evidence).

Chloroquine (CQ), a well-established anti-malarial agent, and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a similarly established disease modifying anti-rheumatic (DMARD) agent have received increased attention in recent days for their purported efficacy as antiviral agents in context of COVID-19. Both drugs are out-of-patent, cheap, and widely available in high, middle- and low-income countries.</p><p id="p0015">The antiviral properties of CQ was first explored against viral hepatitis as far back as 1963(<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).

Yet, the ultimate test for their benefit as antivirals come from human clinical studies and to our knowledge both these drugs are not used as mainstream antiviral agents for any viral infection. This review focusses on the clinical evidence for using both CQ and HCQ as antiviral agents against any viral infection. This reflection and summary of evidence is needed in current context for judicious, evidence-based recommendations for off-label use of these drugs. Even when such evidence may be incomplete or unavailable for emerging infections such as COVID-19, historical attempts for repurposing these agents for other emerging viral infections from time to time, may draw parallels to the current scenario to inform a rational approach to clinical trials and guideline recommendations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Study selection criteria</title><sec id="sec2.1.1"><title>Types of studies</title><p id="p0020">Interventional and observational studies (controlled and non-controlled) including case series were considered, but case reports limited to single patients were excluded.

Two authors searched and selected abstracts independently and all authors identified studies for full-text review by consensus. The following data items were extracted from each included study; study design and location, viral infection and diagnostic criteria, participant demographics, intervention and control groups (if any), drug doses, primary and secondary outcomes and adverse events attributable to therapy. A meta-analysis was planned if comparable clinical trials were available in terms of participants, interventions, comparators and outcomes. Risk of bias for all randomized controlled studies, regardless of whether published or deposited as pre-prints, were assessed according to Cochrane guidelines(<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Risk of bias in non-randomized trials with more than one intervention was assessed with the ROBINS-I tool(<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). All other study designs were considered to have an inherent high risk of bias. Certainty of evidence was assessed for each infection (only from randomized controlled trials - RCTs) according to the GRADE recommendations(<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).

). The majority of these (n-2026) were published after 1990. After removing retrospective studies, <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal studies, reviews, letters, opinion papers and editorials, only 209 abstracts remained. Further examination identified 26 articles for full-text review revealing a significant disparity with the large number of articles demonstrating <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence for antiviral effects of HCQ and CQ. Only 19 publications (including two preprints) from this subset met the inclusion criteria. One full text paper was in Mandarin but had an English abstract. The studies included randomized and non-randomized controlled trials and uncontrolled prospective studies equivalent to case series. These had tested the efficacy of CQ and HCQ in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue, chikungunya, Hepatitis C and COVID-19 infections. A meta-analysis was not performed due to unavailability of similar studies. A summary of risk of bias for all controlled clinical trials are given in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>

There was also no difference in time to aviraemia, or symptom resolution by day 28. Many secondary outcomes proposed in methods including all-cause mortality, are not reported in results presumably due to lack of events.

The most researched infection in this regard is HIV. However, mainstream anti-retroviral treatment in HIV is highly successful in viral load suppression allowing reasonable control of disease though it is not a cure. These newer combinations have not been tested against CQ/HCQ and given the inconsistent evidence from existing trials in this regard, there is no need to. The same can be said of HCV infection where pan-genotypic directly antiviral agents can now achieve over 90% cure rates with minimum adverse events(<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Repurposing HCQ/CQ for these infections is largely redundant and of historical interest only.</p><p id="p0115">In contrast, for acute viral infections such as dengue, chikungunya or COVID-19, effective antivirals are not available. These infections cause epidemics in vulnerable populations exerting an enormous financial burden on resource limited healthcare systems. For dengue fever, given the evidence presented here we conclude that CQ is of no benefit (high certainty evidence). This conclusion is supported by a single well designed RCT with an adequate sample size and a low risk of bias. CQ may have little or no effect in curing acute chikungunya infection (low certainty evidence) and this conclusion is supported by a small clinical trial which may have inadvertently recruited people with more severe disease to the CQ arm despite randomization.</p><p id="p0120">For COVID-19 we are unsure if either CQ or HCQ is of any benefit as per currently available evidence (very low certainty evidence). The only peer reviewed publication describing a RCT on using HCQ for COVID-19 was a small trial that did not demonstrate any benefit of HCQ. The other peer reviewed publication which did show a benefit was an open label, non-randomized trial with a serious risk of bias in sample selection, confounders and assessing outcomes. The sample size was small, and there was a marked age discrepancy (of approximately 14&#x000a0;years) between test and control groups. Administration of azithromycin to six subjects who also received HCQ, does not seem to be based on an <italic>a priori</italic> hypothesis or a study protocol. Some control group patients were from a different centre, and it is unclear if management protocols in both institutions were the same. More importantly, it is now established that most patients (&#x0003e;95%) with COVID-19 will recover after a mild infection regardless of antiviral treatment. Therefore, the primary outcome assessed in this study (clearance of viraemia) is less useful for patient management compared to outcomes that demonstrate a benefit in the more severe end of the disease spectrum such as mortality benefit, reduction in intensive care unit admissions or faster discharge from intensive care (or high dependency units), faster recovery from assisted ventilation or prevention of the need for assisted ventilation. Examining such outcomes require a well-coordinated multi-centre study (preferably with a randomized, double blind, study design) with similar management protocols across all centres. The other two studies from China (available as pre-prints) mentioned in the results section also does not help to resolve this issue due to methodological issues and conflicting conclusions. For example in one of these studies(38), the control group is said to have received &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; treatment which includes &#x0201c;antivirals, antibiotics and steroids or immunoglobulins&#x0201d;. These may have a serious confounding effect on the interpretation of results.</p><p id="p0125">The role of CQ in COVID-19 is also unclear and not supported by evidence at the moment. One small RCT reported no benefit of CQ in terms of achieving negative viraemia by day 14 compared to treatment with lopinavir and ritonavir(40). The authors report faster radiological improvement and reduced hospital stay with CQ but on average the CQ group received treatment at an earlier stage of the illness than the comparator group. This plus the small sample size make it difficult to interpret the results. The other RCT did not have a no CQ control group which is rather surprising. Instead of proving the efficacy of CQ, the authors investigated if a higher dose of CQ was safe in patients with severe infection. Notably this CQ dose (1200mg/d for 10&#x000a0;days) was much higher than that used for cure of malaria which is the standard indication for CQ. Mortality was significantly higher in the high CQ dose group and patient recruitment was halted prematurely. Thus, this trial also doesn&#x02019;t help to confirm if CQ is beneficial for COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0130">CQ and HCQ have been examined for their antiviral properties in many <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal studies for more than five decades and in a limited number of human clinical studies spanning over 25&#x000a0;years. For HIV and HCV infections, the benefit of either drug is doubtful and perhaps no longer relevant as other effective treatments are now available for viral load suppression (HIV) or cure (HCV). There is good evidence that CQ is ineffective for curing dengue infection or preventing dengue haemorrhagic fever. CQ also may not have any benefit in curing acute chikungunya infection. Role of HCQ or CQ in COVID-19 is yet unclear and needs to be assessed by well-designed randomized double-blind clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0135">SR conceived the study.
