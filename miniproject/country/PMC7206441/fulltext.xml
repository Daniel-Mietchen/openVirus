In recent years growing outbreaks of infectious disease, such Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 (<xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">Maunder, 2004</xref>), novel influenza A / H1N1 (swine flu) in 2009 (<xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">Fitzgerald, 2009</xref>) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012 (<xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">Kim, 2018</xref>), have suggested a potential global pandemic (<xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Seale et al., 2009</xref>). The discovery of novel coronavirus Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China in December 2019 brought this potential to realization (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Huang and rong Liu, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="para0018">Pandemics have enormous implications on health care systems, particularly on the workforce (<xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">Ives et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Seale et al., 2009</xref>). Respiratory infectious pandemics and epidemics are particularly virulent given their spread via droplets and interpersonal contact (<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2012</xref>). Nurses, as the largest group of health professionals (<xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>) are at the frontline of the health care system response to both epidemics and pandemics. Nurses deliver care directly to patients in close physical proximity and as such, are often directly exposed to these viruses and are at high risk of developing disease (<xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">Hope et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Seale et al., 2009</xref>). In the SARS outbreak in Taiwan, some 4 of the 70 deaths were nurses (<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Chiang et al., 2007</xref>). Early reports related to COVID-19 indicate that the rate of infection among health care professionals with this virus may be even more extensive (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Huang and rong Liu, 2020</xref>).</p><p id="para0019">Despite having a professional obligation to care for the community during a pandemic or epidemic, many nurses have concerns about their work and its impact on them personally. In particular, the risk of being infected, transmission to family members, stigma about the vulnerabilities of their job and restrictions on personal freedom have been reported as key concerns (<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Chiang et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">Hope et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Seale et al., 2009</xref>). Complicating the situation for nurses during pandemics are the logistical issues related to supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), and shortages of other necessary resources to support service delivery (<xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2020</xref>). The notion of perceived risk to health professionals during pandemics has been explored in the literature (<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2011</xref>), although there are fewer studies reporting data about nurses, as distinct from other health professionals, and their experiences of involvement in a pandemic.</p><p id="para0020">While the literature identifies that many health care professionals are willing to accept the risks of their occupation in a pandemic situation, others perceive the risks of their work are too high (<xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2012</xref>). In particular, nurses, females and younger health care workers have been identified as being less likely than doctors, male health care workers and older individuals to accept the occupational risks (<xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">Imai et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2012</xref>). As nurses perceive personal risks as being too high, some decide to leave their jobs (<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">Chiang et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Shiao et al., 2007</xref>). This has significant implications for the workforce and ability of health systems to deliver care at a time of heightened need. Understanding the factors that impact nurses&#x02019; decisions to stay or leave the workforce are essential to inform future workforce policy and institutional responses and requires further investigation.</p><p id="para0021">For those nurses who remain in clinical practice, an obvious impact relates to the psychosocial ramifications. Nurses&#x02019; have been reported to experience stress associated with separation from family, sleep deprivation and heavy workloads created by health system demand and staff shortages (<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Huang and rong Liu, 2020</xref>). Additionally, the ethical and resource issues that emerge during a pandemic or epidemic can have negative psychological impacts (<xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">Johnstone and Turale, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Seale et al., 2009</xref>). Being involved in setting up specialised pandemic clinics, staging facility operations or being seconded to areas outside their usual scope of practice can also be stressful (<xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">Seale et al., 2009</xref>). Psychological impacts are likely to have both short and long term consequences for individual nurses. Understanding the experiences of nurses can assist in identifying particular stressors and helpful coping strategies to inform support services.</p><p id="para0022">To date, there is limited research about nurses&#x02019; experiences of a pandemic or epidemic, particularly as distinct from other health professionals (<xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">Corley et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib0027" ref-type="bibr">Lam and Hung, 2013</xref>). However, understanding the experiences and impacts of pandemics and epidemics on nurses is vital to ensure that these essential workers are well supported to remain in the workforce and facilitated to provide high quality health care during this time of elevated health need in the community.</p><p id="para0023">A preliminary search of PROSPERO, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the <italic>JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports</italic> was conducted to identify qualitative reviews on nurses&#x02019; experiences during a pandemic. The search did not reveal any systematic review addressing the current review question or inclusion criteria.

Such pressure on the nursing workforce meant nurses had to adapt to changes quickly, often in suboptimal conditions, with high patient turnover and limited isolation rooms (<xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">Holroyd and McNaught, 2008</xref>, Wong et al., 2011, <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Liehr, 2009</xref>).

As such, they are important to inform support strategies to optimise the international nursing workforce both during and following the current COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p id="para0044">Nurses have a high degree of intra-disciplinary collaboration (<xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">Padgett, 2013</xref>) and work in multidisciplinary teams focussed on collaborative care, which is considered an important strategy to improve patient outcomes (<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Oandasan, 2006</xref>). Teams of healthcare professionals have existed in hospitals for many years, with some experiencing effective collaboration and some not. Within an effective interdisciplinary approach to patient care, <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">Petri (2010)</xref> described how collaboration can simply be defined as the act of working together, but that in order for it to be effective, it needs to occur in an atmosphere of mutual trust and respect. These are critical elements for nurses&#x02019; to feel in pandemic situations where uncertainty is high.</p><p id="para0045">In this review, and within the context of a health pandemic, mutual trust and respect were identified by many nurses when they described how supportive the team were and that they felt crises engendered professional collegiality. The primary aim of collegiality according to <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">Hansen (1995)</xref> is the advancement of some superordinate goal in order to achieve clinically integrated care. During times of crisis, like natural disasters and health epidemics, nurses work within highly interdependent but stressful healthcare environments, which appear to bring collegial relationships to the fore, perhaps to ensure that the care that is delivered is always the highest quality.</p><p id="para0046">At the very core of the nursing profession, and the reason for its very existence, is the patient. This review found that nurses have a strong sense of duty toward patients. Despite nurses&#x02019; sense of fear and vulnerability, nurses&#x02019; duty to care for patients outweigh their competing obligations to their families and the risk of their own exposure (<xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">Pfrimmer, 2009</xref>). The duty referred to here isn't the legal obligation that is embedded within nurses Codes of Practice (<xref rid="bib0048" ref-type="bibr">Young, 2009</xref>), but rather, it is the deep sense of wanting to provide quality care because that is what a nurse does; it is considered the right thing to do (<xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Godfrey, 2002</xref>). It is what <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Hewlett and Hewlett (2005)</xref> describe as exceptional commitment to the nursing profession in a context where the lives of health care workers are in jeopardy. The concept of doing the right thing doesn't only exist in times of crisis. Research regarding nurses doing the right thing has also occurred in studies on nursing education (<xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2018</xref>), academic leadership (<xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">Horton-Deutsch et al., 2014</xref>), and palliative care (<xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="para0047">Although nurses had a deep sense of wanting to continue to provide care as a result of their strong sense of duty and wanting to do the right thing, these virtues did not preclude them from harbouring fears and concerns about the safety of themselves and their families. Nursing practice during crisis, particularly those that place the nurse in mortal danger, meant it was important to acknowledge both the physical and emotional impacts. Fear of transmission and contagion was also a factor in this systematic review and has been reported in studies on H1N1, SARS and Ebola virus (<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">Bukhari et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">Koh et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">Speroni et al., 2015</xref>).Importantly, even though nurses are fearful, they remain in the workplace and continue to provide care (<xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="para0048">The organizational reaction was a key consideration for nurses across studies in this review. Participants looked to their respective organizations to provide them with knowledge about the pandemic that was easy to understand and delivered in a consistent way. They did not want &#x02018;mixed messages&#x02019;. Understanding the best practice in PPE use and being supplied with adequate PPE appear to be the largest issues of concern and can be seen in many studies related to pandemics and epidemics (<xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">Cohen and Casken, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al., 2020</xref>, <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">Michaelis et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">Speroni et al., 2015</xref>)</p><sec id="sec0021"><label>4.1</label><title>Study strengths and Limitations</title><p id="para0049">The strengths of the review included the use of the standardised JBI critical appraisal instrument for qualitative studies to assess the methodological quality of included studies. In addition, potential bias was reduced through the involvement of more than one reviewer in the quality assessment, data extraction and data analysis. The validity of the review is augmented by the recurrence of findings between studies. The use of the meta-aggregation approach enabled the categorisation of each finding reported in the studies without seeking to re-interpret the primary author's findings. In addition this approach allows for the development of generalizable&#x000a0;<bold>statements in the form of recommendations to guide practitioners and policy makers</bold>&#x000a0;(Hannes &#x00026; Lockwood 2011).</p><p id="para0050">Despite the rigour in which this review was conducted some limitations need to be acknowledged. Firstly, although a comprehensive search of the databases using the best key word combinations was undertaken, publications not indexed in these data bases could have been omitted. In addition, this review only included studies published in English. Therefore, studies published in other native languages, where the SARS pandemic was widespread, could have been excluded. Furthermore, despite being the largest percentage of the nursing workforce, female nurses were largely represented in the included studies. Hence the experiences reported in the review may not be representative of male nurses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0022"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="para0051">The findings from this review suggest that there is a need for Governments, policy makers, nursing groups and health care organisations to actively engage in supporting nurses both during and following a pandemic or epidemic. This engagement needs to be multifaceted and recognise the importance of nurses and the nursing role to pandemic and epidemic control. It is vital that nurses receive clear, concise and current information about best practice nursing care and infection control, as well as sufficient access to appropriate PPE to optimise their safety. Adequate staffing is essential to ensure that nurses are able to take breaks during shifts, take leave when they are ill and provide appropriate skill mix. Support for nurses to manage competing family responsibilities and maintain safe contact and communication with family members can reduce personal stress and anxiety. Finally, the physical and psychological impact of working during a pandemic or epidemic on nurses needs to be recognised and made visible. To promote physical and mental health among nurses and ensure that they stay in the workforce, Governments, policy makers, nursing groups and health care organisations must closely monitor nurses&#x02019; support needs both during the pandemic or epidemic and in the following period and be agile and responsive to these with meaningful support systems. Without this support nurses are likely to experience significant stress, anxiety, and physical side-effects all of which can lead to burnout and loss of nurses from the workforce.</p><p id="para0052">
