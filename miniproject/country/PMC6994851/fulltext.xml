The annual epidemic of influenza results in an estimated 3&#x02013;5 million cases of severe illness and about 290000&#x02013;650000 deaths globally [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Influenza virus affects population of all age-group however, younger children below 5 years, elderly population above 65 years, pregnant women and other population with certain medical conditions such as: Asthma, Diabetes, Cancer, HIV/AIDS and Heart Disease are under high risk for flu complications [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A study suggests that 2&#x02013;7% of the death in children younger than 5 years of age in 2008 was associated with seasonal influenza, majority of which were from the developing countries [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">Influenza virus is a member of the family orthomyxoviridae and it is classified into four genera: influenza A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B are mainly responsible for infection in human and are also the cause of seasonal epidemics [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Influenza C virus causes only mild illness whereas influenza D virus is not known to cause illness in human. Influenza A virus is divided into subtypes based on haemagglutin (H1 &#x02013; H18) and neuraminidase (N1 &#x02013; N11) transmembrane glycoproteins. Influenza B virus is divided into two lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There are 131subtypes of influenza A detected in nature among which A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) routinely circulate worldwide [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Influenza virus emerged as a pandemic in 1580 for the first time after which it continued to appear as an epidemic or pandemic in different time and place [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A study on global influenza activities suggests that 171 seasonal influenza epidemics have occurred from 1997 to 2005 in different parts of the world [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Three major pandemics have been recorded in last century: first the Spanish flu in 1918 caused by H1N1, second the Asian flu in 1957 caused by H2N2 and the third Hong Kong flu in 1968 by H3N2 [<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Studies suggest that influenza virus has an annual or semi-annual cycle based on geography and climatic conditions. Generally, annual cycle occurs in temperate region with a peak in winter. Tropics/subtropics region may involve annual, semi-annual or year-round activity [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The pattern of influenza virus circulation varies or remains same throughout the year depending upon genetic re-assortment or seasonal influence. This may results in epidemic or pandemic that can alter the intervention action concerning vaccination program and other preventive measures of a country [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Previous records also show that pandemic in the past was either due to antigenic shift with strains from the avian reservoir or by direct introduction of an avian strain into the human population [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This further suggests that genetic characterization of influenza viruses circulating around the world is important and timely in order to aid in the development of vaccine and, control the spread of viruses.</p><p id="p0025">The first outbreak of influenza in Nepal was detected in year 2004 at Bhutanese refugee camp in southeastern Nepal, which was caused by influenza A/H3 serotype [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since then, Nepal has an increasing number of influenza positive cases with two major epidemics in year 2004 and 2009 [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The epidemic in 2009 was due to influenza A (H1N1) whose first case was seen in June 2009 among people returning from US [<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the very preliminary phase of diagnostic services of influenza virus in Nepal, we had very limited information about influenza infection and its types. In addition, it was also difficult to conduct study at molecular level due to limitation of resources and poor setting. In this perspective we carried out this study with two central objectives: 1. to determine the seasonal activity of influenza virus in Nepal in year 2016 and, 2. to check whether the recommended vaccine matched the prevailing strain during the season or not.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods and methodology</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design and sample collection</title><p id="p0030">A descriptive cross sectional study was carried out at National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL), Kathmandu, Nepal for the period of one year (January&#x02013;December 2016).

Influenza A positive samples were screened for Pdm A, Pdm H1, A/H3 whereas samples showing influenza B positive were tested for B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineage. Due to limited number of PCR kit, only 106 influenza B positive samples were processed to identify their lineages. The primers and probes used in the reaction mixture for identification of different types, subtypes and lineages of influenza virus (H1N1, H3N2, H1N1pdm09, Influenza B, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) were provided by US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the assays were performed following the manufacturer's protocols [<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

It has been observed that following an outbreak influenza virus tend to re-assort with different kinds of genetic modifications resulting in a new strain, which may further cause an epidemic. World Health Organization reports that in the European region, the 2018/19 influenza season is dominated by influenza A virus; co-circulation of both subtypes (H1N1pdm09 and H3N2) however, the past season (2014/15&#x02013;2016/17) was dominated either by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or by A(H3N2) [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The re-emergence of influenza virus in every season with some genetic modification or, introduction of a new strain brings about novel antigenic properties in them that may decrease vaccine induced immunity due to mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains. For this reason it is necessary to identify and characterize the novel strain of virus, and modify the vaccine according to the predominating strain to confer maximum protection against influenza infection.</p><p id="p0080">The findings of our study suggest that influenza A/H3 was the predominant strain circulating in Nepal in year 2016. A previous study by Upadhyay et&#x000a0;al. also reported similar finding according to which influenza A/H3 was responsible for 60.1% of the total infection in year 2014 in Nepal [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A study from countries in tropical Asia also reports influenza A dominant over influenza B during 2007&#x02013;2013 which is in correspondence to this study [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Among influenza type B virus, we noticed B/Yamagata lineage dominant over B/Victoria lineage in this study that was different from those of other countries in northern hemisphere in 2016/2017 season [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, study in Asia-pacific region during 2010&#x02013;2017 suggest that B/Yamagata was dominant over B/Victoria lineage which is similar to this study [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The difference in prevalence rate reported in various study is probably due to different time and places the study have been carried out. Furthermore, it seems likely that the geographical and climatic condition of different locations around the world is different that might be reason for high prevalence of dissimilar subtypes of influenza virus in different study.</p><p id="p0085">This study illustrates that Nepal observes two peaks of influenza infection round the year; first in the month of January&#x02013;February and second in the month of July&#x02013;August which is similar to the pattern followed by some Asian countries in temperate zone of Northern hemisphere [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The first peak was observed in winter season followed by the second peak coinciding with the rainy season. This is further supported by a study from India which reports maximum influenza activity during the rainy season [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A study carried out by Sun et&#x000a0;al. from mainland China also reported two peak of influenza activity; first in winter and then in Spring in each monitoring year which is in correspondence to our study [<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In contrast, mainland of japan which lies in temperate region experience only one peak of influenza activity in winter season [<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, a study from Hong Kong also reports annual cycle of influenza A(H3N2) during the study period [<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This suggests that seasonality of influenza appears to be country specific despite of similar type of climatic conditions. Though influenza A/H3 was the predominant circulating strain in year 2016 in Nepal, somewhat surprisingly noticed was the second peak of infection in July&#x02013;August that was marked by influenza B despite of A/H3 strain. The possible explanation behind circulation of different viruses in the two peaks of the year might be the outbreak with different strain or host-related and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity which supports activity of particular strain of virus.</p><p id="p0090">The findings from this study also suggest that influenza prevalence was higher in Kathmandu and nearby districts. These districts are densely populated according to the report of Central Bureau of Statistics [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Because the transmission of influenza virus mainly occur by aerosol inhalation and spread more rapidly in crowded areas, these districts had higher prevalence of influenza in comparison to other districts of Nepal [<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Also, Kathmandu valley and nearby districts are surrounded by mountains and experience distinct climatic condition and lower temperature in comparison to other districts [<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As higher temperature enhances defense mechanism and decreases replication of influenza virus, Kathmandu valley having lower temperature favors influenza virus replication which might also be the reason for higher prevalence rate [<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p id="p0095">Our study suggests that 2016 influenza season was dominated by influenza A/H3 strain. Besides that, influenza B infection was also found in higher number of cases among which B/Yamagata lineage was more prevalent than B/Victoria lineage. According to the report, WHO had recommended both trivalent and quadrivalent vaccine to be used in countries in northern hemisphere during 2016&#x02013;2017 season [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The choice for trivalent or quadrivalent vaccine was made by national or regional authorities in accordance to their seasonability pattern of influenza virus circulation [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In Nepal, influenza vaccine was not provided to the public at government level and also we did not find any guidelines made by national authorities in Nepal regarding influenza vaccine use. However, clinician preferred to use trivalent vaccine and, was widely available in Nepal during the season. The trivalent vaccine consisted of: A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus and B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus. The antigenic and genetic characteristics of B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus was closely related to most B/Victoria/2/87 lineage viruses.</p><p id="p0100">But, since we found B/Yamagata lineage dominant in Nepal over B/Victoria lineage in year 2016, we noticed a mismatch between prevailing strain and available vaccine in 2016&#x02013;2017 seasons. An implication of these findings is the potential for improvement in vaccination program in the country. The previously published researches suggest that B/Victoria lineage was dominant in most of the south Asian countries which we found different in our study [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For this reason the vaccine to be introduced in Nepal should be decided by national authority in Nepal based on prevailing strain to confer effective immunization. Furthermore, when we consider the timing for influenza vaccination, the vaccine needs to be introduced within 4 months prior to peak season and twice a year as this study observed two peaks in year 2016; first during winter in the month of January&#x02013;February and second after rainy season in the month of July&#x02013;August. Because we observe only 2016 influenza season, the recommendation for vaccination twice a year should be further conformed by a longitudinal study in the country.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion and recommendations</title><p id="p0105">This study set out to determine that Nepal experience semiannual cycle of influenza infection firstly, during the winter month of January&#x02013;February and secondly, during the month of July&#x02013;August following rainy season. Despite few cases of influenza B and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A/H3 remained predominant throughout the year 2016. This paper argued that the vaccine to be introduced in Nepal must be decided by national authority based on prevailing influenza types.</p><p id="p0110">There is abundant space for further progress in recommending the timing and composition of influenza vaccine to be introduced in Nepal by the national authority to confer effective immunization and to prevent seasonal epidemic in the country. The vaccination campaign at community level also seems necessary which should be carried out by the government. In addition, a further longitudinal study with more focus on genetic characteristics of the virus need to be done to monitor evolution in circulating strain and efficacy of vaccination program.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0115">Bimalesh Kumar Jha: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments.</p><p id="p0120">Roshan Pandit: Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0125">Runa Jha: Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data.</p><p id="p0130">Krishna Das Manandhar: Conceived and designed the experiments; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0135">This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.3"><title>Competing interest statement</title><p id="p0140">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.4"><title>Additional information</title><p id="p0145">No additional information is available for this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Korsun</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Angelova</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Trifonova</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name><name><surname>Georgieva</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name><name><surname>Tzotcheva</surname><given-names>I.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mileva</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Predominance of influenza B/Yamagata lineage viruses in Bulgaria during the 2017/2018 season</article-title><source>Epidemiol.
