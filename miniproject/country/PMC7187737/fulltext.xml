This mortality seems to considerably vary from country to country, and this has not been fully explained. The real-time numbers infected and the mortality rates can be accessed at the following site: <uri xlink:href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/</uri>. The low rates in areas such as South Korea are probably due to the extensive testing that has been performed to date, increasing the denominator by including asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients; however, other factors may be involved such as the overall age of the populations concerned and possibly the effect of vitamin D (i.e. sunlight) on the viral receptor ACE2 in the lung.(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</p><p>Whatever the cause is, it is incumbent upon society to reduce the impact of the pandemic by social distancing, i.e. restriction of movement and mandatory isolation (which are more difficult to achieve in societies that are less authoritarian and the populace less obedient), effective therapies and vaccination. As far as the therapy is concerned, there have been, as of 6 April 2020, 1,277,248 documented cases with 69,570 deaths. Of the 941,217 active cases, 95% are mild and 5% are serious or critical, and it is the latter group that requires therapy beyond pure supportive measures.</p><p>It appears that there are three phases to the disease that merge into each other although it is difficult to predict whether or when progression will occur (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) &#x02013; first, the viral response phase in which mild constitutional symptoms predominate and associated laboratory features such as lymphopaenia, increased prothrombin time, increased D-dimer and a mild increase in LDH occur. This merges over a variable time period in a proportion of patients into a phase in which pulmonary symptoms begin to emerge with dyspnoea and mild hypoxaemia with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO<sub>2</sub>) relative to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>), i.e. a <italic>P</italic>/<italic>F</italic> ratio &#x02264;300 and a rising C-reactive protein (CRP) with a low procalcitonin. An even smaller proportion then progresses to the hyperinflammatory phase in which a &#x0201c;cytokine storm&#x0201d; characterized by increased interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, interferon-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> inducible protein 10, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, tumour necrosis factor and possibly most importantly IL-6 results in organ dysfunction, including the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), renal dysfunction, hypotension and cardiac failure.(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</p><p>The aim of any therapy would be to intervene at a point that could prevent the need for mechanical ventilation (MV) and the occurrence of significant organ dysfunction, as the mortality for patients receiving MV exceeds 50% in most studies.(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) In order to do so, patients must be assessed for features denoting the phase of the illness. Clinical markers of severity include older age, comorbidity (particularly diabetes and hypertension), hypoxaemia, requirement for MV and evidence of organ dysfunction, including myocardial ischaemia or heart failure.(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) These factors were confirmed in a large retrospective case series of 1099 patients, which demonstrated that higher age and any comorbidity were associated with more severe diseases. Overall, severe pneumonia occurred in 15.7%, and mortality in this study was 1.36%, which was lower than the other estimates at that time.(<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</p><p>The INARC data from the United Kingdom summarizing those patients with severe disease found the following to be significant:(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</p><p>Men are more likely to be admitted to ICU compared with other viral pneumonias (70.5% vs 54.3%) and men with CoVID-19 are more likely to die than women (53.2% vs 37.5%). The overall death rate for CoVID-19 for patients admitted to critical care is also much higher than for other viral pneumonias (47.9% vs 22.2%); 22.4% of patients admitted to ICU are young (&#x0003c;50 years old), but the death rate increases dramatically with age; 16&#x02013;49 years (24.3%), 50&#x02013;69 (40.3%) and &#x0003e;70 (73.2%). The death rate was higher in people who are overweight (BMI 30+ = 60.9% vs BMI 25 to &#x0003c;30 = 41.7%).(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</p><p>Laboratory parameters associated with the development of ARDS and progression from ARDS to death include neutrophilia (HR, 1.14; 95%CI, 1.09&#x02013;1.19; and HR, 1.08; 95%CI, 1.01&#x02013;1.17, respectively), higher lactate dehydrogenase [HR, 1.61; 95%CI, 1.44&#x02013;1.79; and HR, 1.30; 95%CI, 1.11&#x02013;1.52] and D-dimer [HR, 1.03; 95%CI, 1.01&#x02013;1.04; and HR, 1.02; 95%CI, 1.01&#x02013;1.04, respectively].(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) In another study, an absolute D-dimer value &#x0003e;1 &#x003bc;g/l (18.42, 2.64&#x02013;128.55; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0033) was particularly significant.(<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</p><p>Hyperferritinaemia (mean 1297.6 ng/ml in non-survivors vs 614.0 ng/ml in survivors; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) was highly discriminatory as were IL-6 levels (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), suggesting that mortality might be due to virally driven hyperinflammation and may also be a marker of virally induced haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.(<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</p><p>With reference to the above, possibly the most important marker of the hyperinflammatory state and worse outcome is the IL-6 level. A study that examined 40 patients admitted to a single hospital found that the 32.5% that required MV did not differ with regard to epidemiological factors such as age, comorbidities, radiological findings, respiratory rate or qSofa score. However, an elevated IL-6 was strongly associated with MV (<italic>P</italic> = 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) and that a level &#x0003e;80 pg/ml during the disease predicted respiratory failure with high accuracy (<italic>P</italic> = 1.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>, AUC = 0.98) with a rate of 22 times higher vs those with lower levels.(<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</p><p>Cardiac disease and thrombotic episodes appear to contribute to mortality. With regard to thrombosis, in a study of 449 patients with severe CoVID-19, 99 received heparin (mainly low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) for &#x02265;7 days). As seen in previous studies, in multivariate analysis, D-dimer, prothrombin time and age were positively, and platelet count negatively correlated with 28-day mortality. However, it appeared that heparin was only of benefit in those with more extensive thrombosis as evidenced by a sepsis-induced coagulopathy score &#x02265;4 (40.0% vs 64.2%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.029), or D-dimer &#x0003e;6 fold of upper limit of normal (32.8% vs 52.4%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.017).(<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)</p><p>In another study in patients receiving conventional antiviral treatment, LMWH reduced hypercoagulability, inhibited IL-6 release and counteracted IL-6 biological activity potentially blocking the cytokine storm.(<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) This hypercoagulability may predispose to pulmonary embolism.</p><p>With regard to cardiovascular disease (CVD), a recent study described the relationship between troponin levels and prior cardiac disease and outcome. Of 187 confirmed CoVID-19 patients, 23% died. Sixty-six (35.3%) had underlying CVD which included hypertension, coronary heart disease and cardiomyopathy, and of these and 52 (27.8%) had elevated troponin T (TnT) levels. There was an exponential increase in mortality according to the presence of CVD and or elevated TnT; 7.62% (no CVD; normal TnT), 13.33% (CVD; normal TnT), 37.50% (no CVD; elevated TnT) and 69.44% (CVD; elevated TnT).(<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)</p><p>Patients with underlying CVD were more likely to develop myocardial injury with increased TnT levels, and the high-sensitivity CRP positively correlated with the rise in TnT and N-terminal pro&#x02013;brain natriuretic peptide levels. Interestingly, the mortality of patients with and without use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 36.8% and 25.6%, respectively; however, this may just be due to a correlation between the use of these agents and underlying CVD.</p><sec id="other1"><title>THERAPIES FOR COVID-19</title><p>Therapy should be administered according to disease severity.

We are as yet hamstrung by a lack of an effective vaccine or of effective therapies to halt spread of disease and progression to the potentially lethal hyperinflammatory phase of this illness. Some agents appear promising in this regard and in particular those that inhibit IL-6, which frequently appears to be the driver of the inflammatory process. Given the high mortality of those in this phase of the disease, therapy with these agents and potentially other anti-inflammatory agents such as pooled immunoglobulin would appear to be justified.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><string-name><surname>Paules</surname>
