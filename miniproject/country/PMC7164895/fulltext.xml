They are responsible for numerous cases of hospitalization, many deaths, and widespread crop destruction, all of which result in an enormous medical, economical, and biological burden. Each of the currently used decontamination methods has important drawbacks. Cold plasma (CP) has entered this field as a novel, efficient, and clean solution for virus inactivation. We present recent developments in this promising field of CP-mediated virus inactivation, and describe the applications and mechanisms of the inactivation. This is particularly relevant because viral pandemics, such as COVID-19, highlight the need for alternative virus inactivation methods to replace, complement, or upgrade existing procedures.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="l0005"><list-item id="li0005"><p id="p0065">Pathogenic viruses are becoming an increasing burden for health, agriculture, and the global economy.

They have inhabited the Earth for billions of years [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], have adapted to various environments, and are now found across all ecosystems. Viruses have contributed to the evolution of life on Earth, and can be beneficial for preserving ecosystems and important natural Earth cycles such as the carbon cycle in the sea [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On the other hand, pathogenic viruses cause tens to hundreds of millions of plant, animal, and human infections annually, which result in high crop losses and numerous deaths (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>
). Therefore, inactivating harmful viruses is crucial for better quality of life.<boxed-text id="b0005"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>Viruses and Methods for Their Disinfection</title></caption><p id="p0005">Viruses are microscopic agents that can infect all forms of cellular life. Their classification as living organisms has historically been a question of philosophical debate, but they are unquestionably one of the most powerful engines of evolution on the planet [<xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Most viruses are not harmful, and some are even beneficial for their hosts [<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In recent years viruses have been increasingly used to promote human wellbeing. For example, lentiviruses [<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and adeno-associated viruses [<xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] are being genetically engineered to formulate state-of-the-art gene therapies. Nevertheless, viruses have a bad reputation as causative agents of various human, animal, and plant diseases. This is no surprise because they have been the main players in numerous epidemics and pandemics throughout history (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/managing-epidemics/en/" id="ir0005">https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/managing-epidemics/en/</ext-link>). Several viral agents have contributed to the well-deserved &#x02018;biohazard&#x02019; fame of viruses, including influenza, Ebola, HIV ,and coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Despite not being such &#x02018;viral celebrities&#x02019;, waterborne viruses pose increasingly serious health and economic burdens in the present era that is threatened by climate change and the scarcity of potable water.</p><p id="p0010">Different physical and chemical treatments have traditionally been applied for inactivation of viruses. Chlorine, alcohols, acids, alkalis, and bleach are examples of chemical disinfectants, whereas UV irradiation, filtration, pressure, and temperature are physical treatments [<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The method of choice depends on the matrix to be disinfected and on the virus targeted for inactivation. Waterborne viruses, including enteric viruses [<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and plant tobamoviruses [<xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], are among the most stable of all viruses. To inactivate such stable viruses in a delicate matrix, the disinfection method needs to be strong enough to inactivate the virus but at the same time it needs to be nontoxic to maintain the quality and properties of the water. It is now known that chlorination, a traditionally used method for water disinfection, does not efficiently inactivate some viruses, and in the long term can pose a risk to human health through release of toxic byproducts [<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In recent years novel waterborne virus inactivation technologies have been developed, such as membrane filtration, reverse osmosis, UV and ozone treatments, and hydrodynamic cavitation, each of which has their own pros and cons. The frequent disadvantages of these technologies are cost inefficiency, scalability problems, and unsustainable power usage. Laboratory-scale studies suggest that CP has potential to overcome these problems, but confirmation will require studies focused on pilot or industrial scale deployment of plasma-based disinfection devices.</p><notes notes-type="alt-text" specific-use="for-accessibility" id="al0020"><p>Alt-text: Box 1</p></notes></boxed-text></p><p id="p0090">Viruses can be transmitted directly from one infected individual to another or indirectly via contaminated intermediates such as surfaces, objects, air, food, and water. Transmission via contaminated surfaces and aerosols has shown to be of great importance in the COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Water is also an increasingly important transmission route for pathogenic viruses. This has arisen from global climate change and the continued increase in water demand, combined with inefficient virus removal by traditional water treatments and reuse of wastewater for irrigation purposes [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Pathogenic waterborne viruses are important contributors to one of the most important global risks we are facing today, the scarcity of potable water [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Various <bold>virus</bold>
<bold>inactivation</bold> (see <xref rid="gs0005" ref-type="list">Glossary</xref>) methods are used to prevent viral spread in different matrices, but unfortunately the ideal method has yet to be discovered (<xref rid="b0005" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 1</xref>). Thus, there is an urgent need for an environmentally friendly treatment that produces neither waste nor toxic byproducts, does not use toxic chemicals, is easy and safe to work with, and is also efficient in terms of virus inactivation. The emergence of CP treatments for virus inactivation aims to provide a solution to all of these features.</p><p id="p0095">Plasma is the fourth state of matter. It is a partially or fully ionized gas where the atoms and/or molecules are stripped of their outer-shell electrons (<xref rid="b0010" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 2</xref>
) [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among its complex constituents, the emission of UV radiation and <bold>reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species (RONS)</bold> have the most important antimicrobial properties [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. UV can damage nucleic acids [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], whereas RONS can oxidize nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids, with different affinities that depend on the species [<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These inherent properties of plasma, and more specifically of CP, have motivated extensive studies on the use of CP for inactivation of various pathogenic microorganisms. The main target has been bacteria, with investigations across different fields such as food production [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], medicine, and dentistry [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These have even extended to oncotherapy applications, where cancer cells are targeted instead of pathogenic microorganisms [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].<boxed-text id="b0010"><label>Box 2</label><caption><title>Let&#x02019;s Talk about Plasma</title></caption><p id="p0015">Plasma is the most abundant state of matter and comprises 99% of the visible universe. The sun and other stars, nebulae, solar winds, lightning, and aurora borealis are all in the plasma state. Plasma TVs as well as neon and fluorescent lights are the best-known man-made uses of plasma. Generally, plasma contains free electrons, atoms, and molecules in neutral, ionized, and/or excited states (including ROS/RNS). Plasma of many gases represents an extensive source of UV and vacuum UV radiation [<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The possibility to use a particular or a combination of constituents makes plasma a unique material-treatment technique.</p><p id="p0020">Plasma can be roughly divided into thermal or equilibrium plasma, where all particles have approximately the same temperature (average kinetic energy of random motion), and nonthermal, nonequilibrium, or CP, where light electrons have much higher temperatures compared with heavy atoms and molecules, which often remain close to room temperature. In other words, CP is at the point of application at room temperature, and is therefore suitable for treating diverse biological material including solids, liquids, and aerosols. CP can be further classified into low pressure and atmospheric pressure. The latter is limited to the volume where there are large electric fields, whereas low-pressure plasma spreads in a large volume [<xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. CP is usually sustained with an electrical discharge. The gas temperature is usually almost unaffected, but the chemical reactivity is vast compared with the source gas because of the presence of reactive species. In most cases of virus inactivation, atmospheric pressure plasma has been used because of practical considerations ([<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] for more information on various plasma sources used in microbial decontamination).</p><p id="p0025">Plasmas are used in various industries, mainly for tailoring the surfaces of solids (e.g., oxidation, cleaning, nanostructuring, binding different atom/molecule groups), but also for the destruction of microorganisms such as viruses. Plasma can also be used for treatment of liquids; however, inactivation of viruses in liquid media is more challenging than for surfaces because plasma cannot be sustained in liquids, and is only present in gaseous bubbles inside the liquid or above the liquid surface. Depending on the place of their generation, RONS interact with either the bubble surface or the surface of the liquid, where many dissolve. They can then diffuse within the liquid, and may eventually interact with the virus. Furthermore, UV radiation penetrates liquids with a penetration depth that depends greatly on the wavelength, and the concentration, and type of impurities [<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. There are various techniques for measuring both long- and short-lived RONS in liquids [<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], but these are not used frequently by researchers working on the destruction of viruses. Many authors state the discharge parameters (voltage, current, power) rather than the plasma parameters (concentration of reactive species) which are necessary to compare various plasma sources. The plasma&#x02013;virus scientific niche is therefore in its infancy at present.</p><notes notes-type="alt-text" specific-use="for-accessibility" id="al0025"><p>Alt-text: Box 2</p></notes></boxed-text></p><p id="p0100">Plasma-mediated virus inactivation is a relatively young field of research (reviewed in [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) which started only about 20 years ago [<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This is despite the decades-old knowledge that ozone, that is usually synthesized from O<sub>2</sub> subjected to plasma conditions, can inactivate viruses [<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, over the past few years the number of publications in the CP&#x02013;virus field has doubled, and research has expanded from only defining the virucidal properties of plasma to describing its modes of inactivation.</p><p id="p0105">This review offers a comprehensive overview of the latest progress and achievements in the CP&#x02013;virus field. We also describe and discuss the modes of CP-mediated virus inactivation and the reactive species that are responsible.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>CP Inactivation of Viruses</title><p id="p0110">Almost every study on CP inactivation of viruses is unique because they either use a specific plasma source [e.g., <bold>dielectric barrier discharge (DBD)</bold>, <bold>plasma (micro)jet</bold>
<bold>s</bold>] (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) with different characteristics (e.g., power, gas, treatment time) or they deal with the treatment of different liquid volumes (from microliters to several milliliters), matrices (e.g., water, other solutions, surfaces, cells), and viruses (surrogates of human viruses, human, animal, and plant viruses). Such wide diversity makes it difficult to directly compare these studies and to define the mechanistic conclusions or any universal inactivation parameters. To simplify these complexities, we consider here the individual types of viruses that have been subjected to CP treatments. A complete list of the treatments published to date is given in <xref rid="ec0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>, <xref rid="ec0010" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref> in the supplemental information online.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Human Viruses</title><sec id="s0020"><title>Enteric Viruses</title><p id="p0120">
CP treatments have been often focused on <bold>enteric viruses</bold> such as norovirus, adenovirus, and hepatitis A virus.

Working with human viruses can pose serious health hazards, and such studies require specialized laboratories and equipment. Moreover, infectivity assessments of important enteric viruses, such as norovirus, have been limited owing to a lack of cultivation methods [<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For these reasons, these viruses are often replaced by surrogate viruses.<fig id="f0005"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Examples of Commonly Used Plasma Sources for Virus Inactivation in Different Matrices.</p><p>These include different types of (micro)jets (A) and dielectric barrier discharges (B).

Such a mask would have the potential to stop the spread of various viruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) that are transmitted by droplets because droplets are ideal for dissolution of radicals owing to their large surface-to-volume ratio. However, the problem again arises because radicals such as ozone and nitric oxides would be inhaled, and a mask would need to include a radical catalyzer or, even better, a two-membrane design in which the first plasma membrane inactivates the virus, and the second membrane serves as a catalyzer to remove toxic species created by the plasma.

The inactivation of the surrogate FCV measured by EMA-RT-qPCR in the same medium on the stainless steel surface was similar to that of norovirus, although the cell culture-based infectivity assays showed complete FCV inactivation after 3 min (also confirmed in [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). The underestimation of FCV inactivation based on EMA-RT-qPCR in comparison with the infectivity assay might also indicate underestimation of norovirus inactivation. Because FCV and norovirus were similarly affected by the CP treatment, FCV can be considered as an appropriate surrogate. However, it remains to be determined if this would also apply when using different treatment conditions.</p><p id="p0140">FCV was also inactivated by a DBD plasma torch on a glass surface [<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], indicating that both this device, and the previously mentioned DBD, have good potential to inactivate enteric viruses on various surfaces. On the other hand, inactivation of adenovirus on a glass surface with a pulsed high-voltage source that sustains plasma at 0.5 bar was not as successful and would thus not be as suitable as DBD for this purpose [<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p id="p0145">One of the most successful events of inactivation in liquid medium, including work on bacteriophages (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 3</xref>), was achieved by a 15 s treatment of FCV using a plasma jet [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].

It was also shown that DBD could be used to treat packaged food [<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; however, inactivation was not as good as for nonpackaged food, and this process would therefore require further improvement before implementation. Application of CP in food industry for decontamination has multiple advantages over the most widely used thermal processing of food because it can sustain the freshness and quality of food with minimal impact on the environment because of shorter treatment times and energy requirements [<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One must be careful when using CP for treating sensitive material such as food because, although CP is generally at room temperature at the point of application, the temperatures can rise in some cases because of the specific CP generation conditions. To prevent thermal damage during treatment of sensitive materials, the CP discharge needs to be placed far enough from the treated material [<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and/or have additional cooling provided.

RSV is the most frequent causative agent of lower respiratory tract infections in infants, and is one of the most important viruses in pediatric medicine, particularly because it spreads easily through contact with contaminated surfaces [<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Even though CP treatment completely inactivated RSV on a glass surface after 5 min [<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], a simpler and more portable plasma configuration would be needed for efficient decontamination of hospital surfaces, and the previously described method would be practical only for decontamination of tools and smaller objects. Some respiratory viruses can also remain stable as aerosols for longer periods of time (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) and, to stop their spread, it is crucial to treat the air and not only surfaces (see the section on Animal Viruses and <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><title>Sexually Transmitted Viruses</title><p id="p0160">HIV is one of the most important sexually transmitted pathogens, and one of the greatest challenges to public health in general (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/hiv-aids" id="ir0015">https://www.who.int/news-room/facts-in-pictures/detail/hiv-aids</ext-link>).

All three viruses pose a significant threat to global food security and economic stability. Some strains of AIV can cause up to 100% mortality in chickens (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/influenza-a-virus-subtypes.htm" id="ir0020">https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/influenza-a-virus-subtypes.htm</ext-link>), and some strains of NDV can cause up to 100% mortality in different avian species [<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Prevention of their spread by vaccination is essential. Vaccines against both viruses would benefit from improvements that would allow them to be more cost-effective, provide higher immune protection, and decrease the risk of disease development by ensuring complete virus inactivation without affecting the antigens responsible for inducing the immune response [<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. For this purpose, CP was used as a possible inactivation step in vaccine preparation [<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Complete inactivation was achieved after a 2-min treatment with a plasma jet. This was shown to be ideal for vaccine preparation because longer treatment times can alter the antigen determinants responsible for immunogenicity. Both vaccines have been used to successfully induce the production of specific antibodies, and the NDV vaccine induced even higher antibody titers than the traditionally inactivated vaccines. Additional prevention methods to stop the spread of these viruses include decontamination of surfaces and tools that are in contact with potentially infected poultry by using CP-activated solutions. It has been shown that, at specific ratios, CP-activated distilled water, 0.9% NaCl, and 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> completely inactivated viruses, and the chicken embryos attained 100% survival [<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p id="p0175">PRRSv is economically one of the most important pathogens in the pork industry, and can be transmitted as aerosols and remain infective after traveling long distances, making it a potential threat even to distant barns [<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Most commonly used methods for air treatment in general rely either on physically limiting virus transmission (e.g., the use of various filters) or on lowering virus infectivity (e.g., UV irradiation). CP could potentially achieve both goals by stopping viral spread and abolishing virus infectivity, by charge-driven filtration and RONS, respectively [<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39.</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40.</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">41.</xref>].

Minor disruption or conformational changes of the capsid proteins (or the lipid envelope when present) caused by RONS can result in loss of viral infectivity owing to disruption of the virus binding to receptors on the host cell surface. In cases where genomic nucleic acids are damaged, viruses will no longer be infective because intact genetic material is necessary for virus genome translation and replication. Even in cases where the damage was shown to be inflicted only to nucleic acids, it is likely that RONS also damaged or disrupted the outer protein layer to some extent because otherwise it would not be possible for the RONS to penetrate the virus and reach the genetic material.</p><p id="p0225">One challenge in the study of the modes of virus inactivation is the selection of the appropriate method. Methods used for determination of protein degradation are either not as sensitive as the molecular methods used to determine nucleic acid degradation, or they target only specific protein subunits, and hence can sometimes overlook other changes to proteins. Future studies using combinations of the state-of-the-art methods to assess both types of damage will help with more accurate interpretation of how the damage occurs. These include cryo-electron microscopy, mass spectrometry, and long-read sequencing, as well as methods based on nucleic acid amplification such as quantitative PCR and digital PCR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0060"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p id="p0230">Diverse CP sources can completely inactivate or significantly reduce the infectivity of numerous human, animal, and plant pathogenic viruses on or in various matrices (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, Key Figure). However, as indicated from various studies (<xref rid="ec0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S1</xref>), virus inactivation is highly dependent on the treatment properties, and the optimal parameters need to be chosen on a case-by-case basis.</p><p id="p0240">
Based on the recent developments in the CP&#x02013;virus field described here, we anticipate that CP will be one of the most effective and environmentally friendly tools for inactivating different viruses in the near future. Ultimately, its use should lead to reduced human, animal, and plant infections, as well as lower economic and biological burdens. We believe that one of the fields of virus inactivation where plasma can represent a more significant breakthrough is water decontamination. CP could inactivate problematic enteric viruses and resilient plant viruses for either human consumption and/or for agricultural purposes. In any case, it will first be necessary to evaluate the potential adverse genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of plasma-activated water on humans and plants. In addition, a field of CP application that may gain relevance as a response to viral outbreaks (e.g., SARS-CoV-2), would in our opinion be CP-mediated air purification and incorporation of CP into protective masks and respirators (<xref rid="b0015" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 3</xref>), which could help to palliate the sanitary burden caused by any future outbreaks. There is also potential in decontaminating small-surface objects such as tools and food. Although initial results are promising, the use of CP in medicinal treatments or vaccine preparation will require significant research before implementation.<fig id="f0010"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Key Figure. Inactivation of Viruses Using Cold Plasma (CP).</p><p>(A) Morphologically different viruses treated with CP. (B) Close-up of CP properties responsible for virus inactivation. The most essential moieties in virus inactivation are reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species (RONS), although UV radiation and charged particles (e.g., ions, electrons) can also play a role. Molecules in the ground state are neutral and do not have any effects on virus inactivation. CP can target both viral proteins and nucleic acids (or even the virus envelope, when present). (C) After CP treatment, the virus particles and nucleic acids are partly or completely degraded to noninfective particles that cannot cause harm to their hosts.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0010">Figure 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="p0245">Despite the high efficiency of virus inactivation, the exact modes of action and the plasma functionality in scaled-up systems remain largely unexplored (see Outstanding Questions), and further research needs to be focused in this direction. Insufficient knowledge of plasma/virus interactions present the biggest obstacle to expansion of this field. To understand these interactions, it is important to know the flux of reactive species (RONS or radiation) on the surface of the virus, the probability that a particular type of reactive species inactivates the virus, and synergetic effects between different reactive species for viral deactivation. None of these parameters are currently understood completely. Another issue to be dealt with is how to scale up CP reactors without altering the composition and amount of reactive species achieved at small scale. This could be overcome by a scale-out approach, where several small-scale reactors could be used in parallel, thus increasing the amount of treated material but maintaining the desired plasma composition. Such an approach would also abolish the need for specialized equipment for characterizing plasma chemistry in scaled-up systems because they would be the same as those already characterized at laboratory scale.</p><p id="p0250">In view of environmental protection, novel environmentally friendly decontamination methods are needed. We suggest that CP should replace current chemical decontamination practices because it does not produce excessive waste and can efficiently inactivate viruses in or on different media and surfaces. CP usage will likely spread in different directions to help in coping with upcoming global challenges such as the scarcity of clean water and the detrimental effects of future viral epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19. CP in combination with other existing technologies could help to improve virus inactivation through synergistic effects, thus providing an ultimate decontamination tool.<boxed-text id="b0020"><label>Outstanding Questions</label><p id="p0255">What CP source conditions will enable optimal efficiency of targeted virus inactivation in terms of the required treatment times and energy consumption?</p><p id="p0260">Which types of RONS are the most relevant for inactivation of a given virus in a given matrix, how can we optimize production of such relevant RONS, and which methods should be used for their accurate determination?</p><p id="p0265">Does UV radiation have a synergistic effect with RONS in virus inactivation?</p><p id="p0270">What are the main viral components that are affected by different CP-mediated virus inactivation strategies, and which viral characterization methods should be used in each experiment to get a precise answer?
