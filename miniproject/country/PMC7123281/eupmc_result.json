    "Chapter 5 looks at bird flu (H5N1) pandemics and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This chapter shifts the focus from the relationship between individual health rights and state requirements, notably immunization, and responsibilities, particularly in providing security against health threats, to international requirements and responsibilities for health. Through the lens of the SARS and the H5N1, it traces the newest evolution of the International Health Regulations (IHRs). It analyses the positions and compromises of states, notably with regard to their sovereignty, in reaching the final compromise: to share responsibility in safeguarding global health. It takes to task the regulations’ lack of ‘teeth’: the fact that despite international treaty status, the IHRs operate on a voluntary basis without an enforcement mechanism."
