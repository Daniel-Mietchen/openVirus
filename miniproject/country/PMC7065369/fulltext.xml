While MERS took about two and a half years to infect 1000 people, and SARS took roughly 4 months, the novel SARS-CoV-2 reached that figure in just 48&#x000a0;days. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">As with the original SARS-CoV epidemic of 2002/2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and with seasonal influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], geographic information systems (GIS) and methods, including, among other application possibilities, online real- or near-real-time mapping of disease cases and of social media reactions to disease spread, predictive risk mapping using population travel data, and tracing and mapping super-spreader trajectories and contacts across space and time (see, as an example, the first diagram in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]), are proving indispensable for our timely understanding of the new disease source, dynamics and epidemiology, and in shaping our effective response to it.</p><p id="Par5">Indeed, health professionals have long considered conventional mapping, and more recently geographic information systems (GIS), as critical tools in tracking and combating contagion. The earliest map visualisation of the relationship between place and health was in 1694 on plague containment in Italy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The value of maps as a communication tool blossomed over the next 225&#x000a0;years in the service of understanding and tracking infectious diseases, such as yellow fever, cholera and the 1918 influenza pandemic. From the 1960s, when computerised geographic information systems were born, the possibilities for analysing, visualising and detecting patterns of disease dramatically increased again. A 2014 review of the health GIS literature found that 248 out of 865 included papers (28.7%) focused on infectious disease mapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Since then we have seen a revolution in applied health geography through Web-based tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Now, as we deploy these tools to protect human lives, we can ingest big data from their sources and display results in interactive and near-real-time dashboards.

This is where map-based dashboards become crucial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. At the time of this writing in mid-February 2020, seven coronavirus dashboards are among the top ten requested applications from Esri ArcGIS Online service, accumulating over 160 million views. First published on 22 January 2020 in response to escalating pandemic fears in late January 2020, the Johns Hopkins University&#x02019;s Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) dashboard leads the pack, garnering 140 million views. Developed by Lauren Gardner (an epidemiologist) and her team from the JHU CSSE, the dashboard went viral with hundreds of news articles and shares on social media (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This intense response to the JHU CSSE and other dashboards shows how eager people are to track health threats. Anyone with Internet access can learn, in a few short clicks, a tremendous amount of information about the COVID-19 virus from these resources.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Johns Hopkins University CSSE is tracking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in near real time with a map-centric dashboard (using ArcGIS Online) that pulls relevant data from the WHO, US CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control), Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC), NHC (China&#x02019;s National Health Commission), and Dingxiangyuan (DXY, China).

Graphs detail virus progress over time. Viewers can see the day and time of the most recent data update and data sources. The dashboard&#x02019;s five authoritative data sources include World Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Health Commission of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the Chinese online medical resource DXY.cn. The dashboard provides links to these sources and others. A blog post [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] details this work. The corresponding data repository is accessible as Google sheets in GitHub [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Web services allow GIS users to consume and display disparate data inputs without central hosting or processing to ease data sharing and speed information aggregation. In the first dashboard iteration, from January 22 through January 31, 2020, the Hopkins team manually updated data twice per day. In February 2020, Esri&#x02019;s ArcGIS Living Atlas team assisted them in adopting a semi-automated living data stream strategy to update the dashboard. It primarily relies on the DXY.cn data resource, which updates every 15&#x000a0;min for case reports at provincial and country levels. However, Lauren Gardner&#x02019;s blog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] notes that for countries outside of China, other data resources were quicker to update than DXY.cn, so those case counts are manually updated throughout the day. Current feature layers are freely accessible in the ArcGIS Living Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Yet, the COVID-19 outbreak has been difficult to monitor. As Gardner explains, &#x0201c;<italic>it is especially challenging to collect good data at a fine spatial resolution, which is what most people want to know, and without having travel data in real time that captures these altered mobility patterns, it is hard to assess what the geographic risk profile will look like moving forward</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The JHU CSSE dashboard (at the time of writing) lacks archiving services for full retrospective map visualisation of data from previous days. As far as the latter are concerned, the dashboard only offers timeline charts of total confirmed cases (grouped into &#x02018;mainland China&#x02019; and &#x02018;other locations&#x02019;) and total recovered cases. But one is unable to retrieve and display detailed map snapshots in time (by individual country/region and Chinese province), e.g., to see how the coronavirus world distribution map looked in the past on a specific day, such as 25 January 2020. The dashboard developers are encouraged to compile and make such interactive daily map snapshots permanently accessible online for future reference after the epidemic has gone, as a service to public health researchers and professionals worldwide.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The World Health Organization dashboard</title><p id="Par13">The WHO directs and coordinates international health, combating communicable diseases through surveillance, preparedness and response, and applying GIS technology to this work. On 26 January 2020, the WHO unveiled its ArcGIS Operations Dashboard for COVID-19, which also maps and lists coronavirus cases and total number of deaths by country and Chinese province, with informational panels about the map and its data resources (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>The WHO COVID-19 situation dashboard.

The WHO dashboard reflected laboratory-confirmed cases, whereas JHU CSSE included cases diagnosed using a symptom array plus chest imaging (accounting for some 18,000 additional reports). However, as of 19 February 2020, both dashboards are in sync, displaying similar total case counts.</p><p id="Par15">The WHO dashboard includes an epidemic curve up front, showing cases by date of reporting. Putting the epi curve visualisation above the cumulative cases graph provides important information about outbreak progression, and may decrease fear since we can see a steady decline in the total number of new cases per day since 4 February 2020 (except for a spike on 13 February 2020, when more than 15&#x000a0;K cases were added after China started to include &#x02018;clinically diagnosed&#x02019; cases and not just laboratory-confirmed cases in its figures).</p><p id="Par16">A &#x02018;hamburger&#x02019; menu at the top right corner of the WHO dashboard provides links to additional information about COVID-19 and leads to an interactive Web map that puts COVID-19 into context among other WHO-monitored health emergencies, such as dengue fever, Rift Valley fever and West Nile fever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">The WHO is updating its COVID-19 dashboard automatically using ArcGIS GeoEvent Server to push updates to a single feature service multiple times per day. The WHO dashboard optimisation measures include moving tiled data off its server and into ArcGIS Online tiled services to benefit from Esri&#x02019;s content delivery network. This allows good map performance at 10&#x02013;12 levels of zoom.</p><p id="Par18">Both the WHO and JHU CSSE dashboards consider the importance of mobile devices. Among dashboards built with Esri&#x02019;s ArcGIS Operations Dashboard app, nearly 8% of viewers choose those built for mobile consumption. Consistent with how people want to receive information, mobile-optimised dashboards are versatile and accessible on phones or tablets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>HealthMap: analysing and mapping online informal sources</title><p id="Par19">Founded in 2006, HealthMap is run by a team of researchers, epidemiologists and software developers at Boston Children&#x02019;s Hospital, USA, and uses online media sources for real-time surveillance of emerging public health threats.

Of course, not all tweets and retweets with the hashtag #coronavirus are spreading misinformation, and many of them originate from legitimate bodies and organisations such as the WHO, but the map serves as a good illustration of the &#x02018;viral nature&#x02019; of Twitter and other social media.

The WHO has joined forces with social media giants such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube (Google) and Pinterest to combat the spread of misinformation around coronavirus. For example, Pinterest and YouTube users can now (at the time of writing this article) see a link prominently displayed that points to an official WHO page about COVID-19 whenever they search for, or browse/watch, material about coronavirus on these platforms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Other ways GIS technologies can help in combat infectious disease outbreaks and epidemics</title><p id="Par33">During the COVID-19 outbreak, map-centric dashboards, such as the ones by Johns Hopkins CSSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Early Alert Inc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], have gone viral themselves, informing both the public and health professionals. But dashboards are just the beginning of how GIS and location technologies can support the fight against infectious diseases. Following are a few more examples.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outbreak source</title><p id="Par34">John Snow (1813&#x02013;1858) was able to trace the source of a cholera outbreak in Soho, London, in 1854, thanks to his well-known manual spatial analysis exercise using hand-drawn paper maps of cholera cases and water pumps/water companies supplying them with water. Today, more advanced computerised spatial analyses integrating phyloepidemiological methods are used to identify the likely sources of new outbreaks; e.g., see the map and discussion of the likely source of SARS-CoV-2 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Public events</title><p id="Par35">An important factor affecting epidemics such as COVID-19 is the calendar. During the Ebola and MERS scares of 2014, many people considered cancelling their participation in the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca made by over two million Muslims every year. Equipped with days-old data and rumours, many faithful proceeded with their pilgrimage, putting themselves at risk of contracting potentially deadly viruses and further spreading disease when they returned home.</p><p id="Par36">In the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese New Year celebrations posed a threat as the themes of togetherness and reunion trigger the largest human migration in the world. The Chinese government extended the Lunar New Year holiday to reduce mass gatherings (that were to happen upon return to work and schools), a public health intervention called social distancing. Travellers worldwide were subsequently restricted from entering China. With access to current information, authorities in Beijing, Macao and Hong Kong cancelled many major festivities.</p><p id="Par37">Dashboards and Web maps that bring together location and time-sensitive events in relationship to a spreading disease give travellers and officials the potential to reduce exposure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Site selection</title><p id="Par38">Facing treatment facility shortages in Wuhan, government officials commissioned in late January the emergency construction of two new hospitals, which together provide an additional 2600 beds. Construction teams finished the first hospital on 2 February 2020, just 10&#x000a0;days after breaking ground [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The second facility received its first patients on 6 February 2020. Site selection, whether for emergency treatment units or permanent infrastructure, is a common and high-value application of GIS technology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Supply chain</title><p id="Par39">During public health emergencies of international concern, we often see shortages of medicines and supplies. Shortages can have significant consequences such as hoarding and price gauging by suppliers or distributors. Sometimes, the impacted places are also manufacturing centres for the supplies, leading to a production decline. Digital supply chain maps prove foundational to planning and ensuring geographical diversity in suppliers as well as aligning needs with distribution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Resource locators</title><p id="Par40">Residents of affected areas can use publicly available applications to locate crucial aid and resources. Apps and maps can display information and navigation to hospitals with available beds, clinics offering medical aid along with current wait times, grocery stores and pharmacies that are open, places to purchase personal protective equipment, and more. In heavily impacted cities, this information could critically improve outcomes and save lives.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Drones</title><p id="Par41">In China, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are transporting crucial medical supplies and patient lab samples. In highly impacted areas, drones reduce human contact with lab samples and free up ground transport assets and personnel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Drones are also being used for broad disinfectant operations in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Integrated drone and GIS technologies can help target and speed efforts in places they are needed most.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par42">Modern GIS technologies centre around web-based tools, improved data sharing and real-time information to support critical decision-making. Dashboards exemplify those ideals and have been extremely popular in sharing and understanding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Communication through map-based dashboards offers accessible information to people around the world eager to protect themselves and their communities. This tool type improves data transparency and helps authorities disseminate information.</p><p id="Par43">Certainly, dashboards have taken centre stage in COVID-19 outbreak awareness. But we hope that readers consider how a comprehensive GIS platform can support the entire process of infectious disease surveillance, preparedness and response, because as one epidemiologist put it, outbreaks like this &#x0201c;<italic>should be expected to happen more frequently moving forward</italic>&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In other words, it is not a question of <italic>if</italic> another outbreak will occur, but <italic>when</italic> and <italic>where</italic>.
