Wuhan, China. On 7 January 2020, the causal organism was identified as a new coronavirus,
later named as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Genome sequencing found the genetic
sequence of 2019-nCoV homologous to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated
coronavirus. As of 29 January 2020, the virus had been diagnosed in more than 7000
patients in China and 77 patients in other countries. It is reported that both symptomatic
and asymptomatic patients with 2019-nCoV can play a role in disease transmission via
airborne and contact. This finding has caused a great concern about the prevention of
illness spread. The clinical features of the infection are not specific and are often
indistinguishable from those of other respiratory infections, making it difficult to
diagnose. Given that the virus has a strong ability to spread between individuals, it is
of top priority to identify potential or suspected patients as soon as possible&#x02014;or the
virus may cause a serious pandemic. Therefore, a precision medicine approach to managing
this disease is urgently needed for detecting and controlling the spread of the virus. In
this article, we present such an approach to managing 2019-nCoV-related pneumonia based on
the unique traits of the virus recently revealed and on our experience with coronaviruses
at West China Hospital in Chengdu, China.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>2019-nCoV</kwd><kwd>COVID-19<sup>*</sup></kwd><kwd>coronavirus pneumonia</kwd><kwd>SARS</kwd><kwd>MERS</kwd><kwd>epidemic</kwd><kwd>pandemic</kwd><kwd>precision medicine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">National Key Development Plan for Precision

Wuhan, China.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The results of genome
sequencing, released on 10 January 2020, showed that the pneumonia outbreak was related to a
new coronavirus, named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), whose genetic sequence is
homologous to that of the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Coronaviruses are enveloped with a
positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome and with a nucleocapsid.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Although the 2019-nCoV is a new coronavirus, it has
characteristics common to other coronaviruses, such as sensitivity to heat (it can be
inactivated after 30&#x000a0;minutes at 56&#x02009;&#x000b0;C), diethyl ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing
disinfectants, peracetic acid, and chloroform.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref></p><p>Further genetic and amino acid sequencing of the S-protein of 2019-nCoV established that
the receptor-binding domain of the S-protein binds to recipient cells and interacts strongly
with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor molecules.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> This finding shows that the underlying pathogenesis of the
virus is to infect the human respiratory epithelium through the S-protein-ACE2 binding
pathway. The sequencing from isolated 2019-nCoV became available to the World Health
Organization (WHO) on 12 January 2020,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>
and the genomic sequence substantially facilitated the development of real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays to detect the virus.</p><p>By 29 January 2020, the virus had infected more than 7000 people in China and had caused
170 deaths.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> At the same time, the
disease is gradually being spread to several other countries as the virus can be transmitted
through air and contact.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Fortunately, at
least 124 patients have been cured, according to a recent report of the National Health
Commission of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref></p><p>According to the research that examined the infectious patients in Wuhan Jinyintan
Hospital,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> typical clinical features
included fever (98%, 40 of 41), cough (76%, 31 of 41), malaise (44%, 18 of 41), sputum
production (28%, 11 of 39), and other less-common symptoms (headache, haemoptysis,
diarrhoea, etc.). The median age of the infected patients was 47&#x000a0;years (interquartile range
[IQR], 41.0&#x02013;58.0), and the median time from onset to admission was 7&#x000a0;days (IQR, 4.0&#x02013;8.0).
Severely ill patients may have acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac
injury, secondary infection, septic shock, and acute kidney injury. Laboratory findings
include lymphopenia, leucopenia, elevated concentrations of procalcitonin, serum amyloid A,
D-dimer, and hypersensitive troponin and longer prothrombin times.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>The 2019-nCoV epidemic is suspected to be highly similar to other highly threatening
coronavirus diseases such as SARS and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS), both
intensely infectious diseases related to animals.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>
Like with other epidemics, health systems need to respond quickly and accurately to control
the spread of the virus. Here, we describe our understanding of the 2019-nCoV epidemic and
our experience with other coronavirus-related diseases in West China Hospital. Based on
this, we aim to establish a precision medicine approach to managing Wuhan coronavirus
pneumonia, starting from accurate and rapid recognition of individuals infected by
2019-nCoV. It will facilitate decision-making by health care workers with necessary clinical
information, laboratory detection, and imaging findings. The approach consists of the
following four parts: screening, diagnosis, preventive control, and treatment of 2019-CoV
pneumonia (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Given our clinical experience in
preventing and treating various viral pneumonia, including those caused by coronaviruses, we
believe that such an approach would help in preventing further the spreading of
2019-nCoV.</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Screening, diagnostic, in-hospital control and prevention, and treatment options for

associated with the highest incidence of coronavirus epidemics, which is consistent with the
current epidemic of 2019-nCoV. In this sense, the particularities of 2019-nCoV incidence
should not be overemphasized.</p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

pneumonia, including multiple patch shadows and interstitial changes with significant
peripheral distribution (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). At early stage they

be examined immediately if they experience respiratory symptoms, such as fever, or related

improved in China. As compared to the 2&#x000a0;months spent before the first report of SARS case in
Foshan Guangdong Province in 2002,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>
the 2019-nCoV infection was reported to the WHO China Office on 31 December 2019, less than
1&#x000a0;month after the first few sporadic cases.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> Although many questions, such as detailed pathogenic
characteristics, remain unanswered, from what we know about other coronavirus infections,
the behavior of 2019-nCoV is not unusual. To reduce the incidence of infection as well as
prevent nosocomial infections, we have been working to establish a precision medicine
approach for screening, diagnostic, in-hospital preventive control, and treatment for
individual patients. With this approach, West China Hospital identified 14 infected patients
immediately, each of whom was treated according to the approach developed by the
multi-disciplinary medical team. By the time this paper was published, one patient was
clinically cured (negative nucleic acid test result for throat swab), while other patients'
vital signs remained stable. Since then, the precautionary measures for prevention, control,
and quarantine have been implemented and no cases of human-to-human transmission or
infection of the medical staff have happened in our hospital.</p></sec><sec id="sec10"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None declared.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="pbaa002-ack"><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This article was supported by the National Key Development Plan for Precision Medicine
