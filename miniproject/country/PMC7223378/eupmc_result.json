    "Enterovirus A71 (EV71), the main etiological agent of handfoot- mouth disease (HFMD), circulates in many areas of the world and has caused large epidemics since 1997, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. In this study, we determined the full-genome sequence of CMC718, a newly isolated EV71 strain in Korea. The CMC718 genome was 7,415 nucleotides in length and was confirmed by whole-genome phylogenetic analysis to belong to the B5 genotype. In particular, CMC718 demonstrated maximum identity with strain M988 of the B5 genotype and numerous amino acid variants were detected in the 3D domain of the viral protein P3, which is consistent with the mutation pattern of a B5 strain isolated in 2012-2013. Comparison of the CMC718 sequence with other EV71 reference strains confirmed the relationship and genetic variation of CMC718. Our study was a full-genome sequence analysis of the first EV71 strain of the B5 genotype isolated in South Korea. This information will be a valuable reference for the development of methods for the detection of recombinant viruses, the tracking of infections, and the diagnosis of EV71."
