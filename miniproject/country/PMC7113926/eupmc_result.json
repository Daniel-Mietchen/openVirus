    "Introduction:Dengue fever is a common mosquito-borne viral disease which has reached alarming size in the past few years. It is endemic in more than 100 countries and significant differences were found in clinical profile and atypical manifestation. Aim of the Study:A retrospective observational study of clinical profile and atypical manifestations in patients with dengue fever. Materials and Methods:Serum samples were collected from clinically suspected cases of dengue fever and it was confirmed by NS1 antigen, IgM, and IgG antibody by ELISA. Clinical details and atypical manifestations were recorded. Observation:During the study period, a total of 2502 patients were suspected to have dengue infection, of which 464 (18.5%) samples were found to be positive for dengue viral infection. A majority of the cases were males [268 (57%)] when compared with females [196 (42%)]. Fever was the most common clinical presentation seen in all the patients, followed by headache (78.4%), myalgia (61%), body pain (49.3%), vomiting (40%), joint pain (31.5%), dry cough (19%), nausea (14%), abdominal pain (8%), diarrhea (5.6%), retro-orbital pain (04%), burning micturition (2.4%), and rashes (0.6%). Among atypical manifestations, hepatomegaly [32 (7%)] was the most common, followed by splenomegaly [23 (5%)], bradycardia [18 (4%)], meningitis [6 (1.2%)], hemoptysis [5 (1%)], acalculous cholecystitis [4 (0.8%)], and acute pancreatitis [2 (0.4%)]. The study of hematological parameters showed thrombocytopenia was present in 179 (38.5%) patients, followed by leukopenia [77 (17%)] and raised hematocrit [29 (6.2%)]. Conclusion:During ongoing epidemics, the clinical profile and atypical manifestations in clinically suspected dengue patients should be investigated early so that severe forms can be treated promptly."
