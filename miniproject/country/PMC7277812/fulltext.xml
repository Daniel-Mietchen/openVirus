Understanding its transmission characteristics, including heterogeneity and the emergence of super spreading events (SSEs) where certain individuals infect large numbers of secondary cases, is of vital importance for prediction and intervention of future epidemics. Here, we collected information of all infected cases (135 cases) between 21 January and 26 February 2020 from official public sources in Tianjin, a metropolis of China, and grouped them into 43 transmission chains with the largest chain of 45 cases and the longest chain of four generations. Utilizing a heterogeneous transmission model based on branching process along with a negative binomial offspring distribution, we estimated the reproductive number <italic>R</italic> and the dispersion parameter <italic>k</italic> (lower value indicating higher heterogeneity) to be 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54&#x02013;0.84) and 0.25 (95% CI: 0.13&#x02013;0.88), respectively. A super-spreader causing six infections was identified in Tianjin. In addition, our simulation allowing for heterogeneity showed that the outbreak in Tianjin would have caused 165 infections and sustained for 7.56 generations on average if no control measures had been taken by local government since 28 January. Our results highlighted more efforts are needed to verify the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 in other populations and its contributing factors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>super spreading</kwd><kwd>transmission heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-ijerph-17-03705"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>In December 2019, many cases of viral pneumonia-like disease similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) were detected in Wuhan, China. Later, they were confirmed to be caused by a novel coronavirus, provisionally called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak as a global health emergency of international concern [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. On 11 February 2020, WHO named the diseases CoronaVirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and announced &#x0201c;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)&#x0201d; as the name of the new virus. On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic. As of 18 April 2020, more than 2,160,207 cases were confirmed globally and the National Health Commission (NHC) of China reported a total of 82,735 cases of COVID-19 in mainland China, including 77,062 recoveries and 4632 deaths.</p><p>The dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak depends on both the potential and the heterogeneity of disease transmission. The transmission potential of an infectious pathogen is usually represented by its reproduction number (denoted as <italic>R</italic>) which is the average number of secondary cases caused by a typical infectious individual. Estimates of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x0003e;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (i.e., supercritical outbreak), such as for the early outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in China 2003 [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], indicate the great risk for an infection pathogen to generate a major outbreak; Estimates of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm2"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x0003c;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (i.e., subcritical outbreak), such as for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in South Korea 2018 [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], imply that the outbreak is slowing down with declining trend of incidence. Though different in transmission potential, both SARS and MERS shared the same feature of high level of heterogeneity which involved the uneven transmission patterns with a number of super-spreading events (SSEs), where some individuals spread to a disproportionate number of individuals, compared to most individuals who infected a few or none [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. SSEs of SARS and MERS were responsible for triggering the initial outbreaks in several large cities such as Beijing, Hongkong, and Singapore, and therefore sustaining the spread of disease worldwide. Besides, SSEs were also documented in many other infectious disease [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Detection of transmission heterogeneity may direct prevention efforts and reduce future infections [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The transmission potential of COVID-19 has been studied based on mathematical models, yielding consistent evidence for the high level of reproduction number <italic>R</italic> (1.95&#x02013;2.2) within a completely susceptible population [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, evidence for the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 and the related SSEs was limited and conflicting. So far, two studies found no heterogeneity in Singapore [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and in a southern city of China [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but one study confirmed heterogeneity based on data from 46 countries [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In addition, several possible SSEs have been reported in China [<xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which involved large numbers of infections. Therefore, it would be essential to further explore the transmission heterogeneity, SSEs, and relevant factors of COVID-19.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the transmission characteristics of COVID-19 using the epidemiological data of all the confirmed cases in a metropolis in Northern China. We analyzed the transmission chains and then estimated the reproduction number and the transmission heterogeneity using a branching model along with a negative binomial offspring distribution [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, we identified the SSE according to the 99-percentile criterion in [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and assessed the effect of control measures employed by local government.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijerph-17-03705"><title>2.

Data Collection</title><p>Tianjin is a municipality and a coastal metropolis in Northern China, with a population of 15.66 million and an area of 11,966 square kilometers. Since the first case of COVID-19 in Tianjin was confirmed on 21 January, a total of 135 cases were confirmed by the time of data collection (26 February 2020) of the current study. From 6:00 on 22 Februaryto 18:00 on 26 February, the city had no new confirmed cases for 108 consecutive hours. The municipal government publicized the epidemiological information of the cases every day. Diagnosis of COVID-19 were based on the protocol issued by China CDC [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>From the official websites of the Municipal Health Commissions [<xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we retrieved data of the 135 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Tianjin, including demographic characteristics and epidemiological characteristics, i.e., travel history and contact history with confirmed/suspicious cases. According to this information, the infection relationship within the scope of Tianjin can be specified. Each case was given a unique number according to its sequential order as reported.</p><p>We adopted the definition in [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to define a transmission chain as a group of cases connected by an unbroken series of local transmission events. We grouped all the confirmed cases in Tianjin into transmission chains and for each transmission chain, we identified the primary case, calculated the chain size (i.e., the total number cases including the primary case), and reconstructed the transmission history (i.e., who infected whom). According to the extent of resolution of the reconstructed information, three types of transmission chains were further identified. The first type was the <italic>simple transmission chain</italic> of which the transmission history could be clearly recovered. The second type was the <italic>ordinary transmission chain</italic> of which the transmission history was not clear but the single primary case could be clearly identified and the chain size was also clear. The third type was the <italic>complex transmission chain</italic> of which the chain size was clear but the primary case could not be clearly identified. More than one individual in the chain exhibited similar behavior/clinical characteristics, so we have to regard them as the primary cases.</p><p>As COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, a city in the middle of China, a primary case was defined if the individual had a history of travel to or residence in Wuhan within one month, had direct contact with an individual who had confirmed infection outside Tianjin, having fever outside Tianjin, or had the earliest onset of symptoms in the transmission chain.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-ijerph-17-03705"><title>2.2. Analytical Approach</title><sec id="sec2dot2dot1-ijerph-17-03705"><title>2.2.1. Inference of Transmission Characteristics</title><p>To quantify the transmission potential and heterogeneity for the COVID-19 outbreak in Tianjin, we adopted a stochastic model based on branching process to characterize both the distribution of secondary cases (i.e., a negative binomial distribution) and the resulting distribution of transmission chain sizes under the same parameterization of reproduction number <italic>R</italic> and dispersion parameter <italic>k</italic> (lower value indicating higher heterogeneity) for subcritical epidemic [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>We first fitted the stochastic model to the retrieved information of the simple/ordinary transmission chains. Then, in handling a complex transmission chain with two primary cases, we regarded it could be separated into two ordinary transmission chains, each of which was led by a primary case. The difficulty lay in that the exact size of each ordinary chain was unclear. We dealt with this ambiguity in two ways: one was the combinatorial method in [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] by allowing for all the possible combinations and treated the sum as an overall probability (Further detail can be found in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-17-03705">Section SB, Supplementary Materials</xref>.); the other was to adopt the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm by treating the sizes of two separated chains as latent variables. The EM algorithm also estimated the latent chain size, which was informative for dividing the complex transmission chain into constituent chains (Further detail can be found in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-17-03705">Sections SC and SD, Supplementary Materials</xref>.).</p><p>To identify possible SSEs in the Tianjin outbreak, we adopted the definition in [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] to define a super-spreader as any infected individual causing more infections than would occur in 99% of infectious histories in a homogeneous population. The transmission in a homogeneous situation was modelled with a <italic>Poisson</italic> distribution which is the special case of negative binomial distribution without heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2dot2-ijerph-17-03705"><title>2.2.2. Assessment of Control Measures</title><p>Based on the stochastic model accounting for transmission heterogeneity, we assessed the control measures imposed by the Tianjin government. We compared the transmission characteristics (i.e., <italic>R</italic> and <italic>k</italic>) for the periods of before and after the control measures taking effect. Then, based on the estimate of transmission characteristics before control, we simulated the expected distribution of outbreaks that might occur in Tianjin if no control measures were taken. Each simulated outbreak was initiated with 43 infectious individuals (as the number of transmission chains in Tianjin), and was propagated with the branching process model on the basis of inferred characteristics.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec3-ijerph-17-03705"><title>3.

As shown by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-03705-f001">Figure 1</xref>A, of the total 135 cases, 34 (25.2%) cases were imported cases.

In addition, both combinatorial method and EM algorithm gave the same estimate of reproductive number <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm3"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.67</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> being lower than the critical value of 1, indicating the local transmission would finally die out. Note that these estimates of transmission potential were based on the data by 26 February, implying the average trend over the same period.</p><p>When comparing the CIs from different methods, we observed that the EM algorithm generated slightly narrower CIs for both parameters than the combinatorial method. In addition, the EM algorithm had advantage on the ability of providing more information on the split of complex transmission chain, as it also produced a probabilistic insight of unknown partitions of the chain. Recall that the COVID-19 data in Tianjin contains two complex transmission chains of size 5 for each. For these two complex chains, the EM algorithm tended to split it into one size-1 and one size-4 transmission chain (posterior probability = 95.5%), instead of two chains with size 2 and size 3 (posterior probability = 4.5%).</p><p>Furthermore, the estimates along with the 95% CIs and confidence regions of combinatorial method were plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-03705-f003">Figure 3</xref>A. The confidence region incorporated the uncertainty in both parameters simultaneously, thus it undoubtedly gave much wider range than the CI, especially for <italic>k</italic>. We also found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-03705-f003">Figure 3</xref>B) that the observed chain size distribution was close to the expected distribution based on the estimated characteristics (i.e., <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm4"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.67</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm5"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.26</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). Particularly, the probability of a chain with size over 5 was less than 10%, and the probability of a single infected case resulting in a chain of size 45 (the largest size of transmission chain in Tianjin) was about 0.8%.

The cut-off value was 6, suggesting that an infected individuals who infected 6 or more secondary cases could be regarded as a super-spreader of the COVID-19 outbreak in Tianjin. According to this criterion, a 57-year-old man, case 2, was a super-spreader. He infected six colleagues in close contact with him before being confirmed on 21 January 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-03705-f002">Figure 2</xref>).

In addition, our result was consistent with another study conducted among 46 countries (<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm11"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, 95% CI: 0.05&#x0223c;0.2) [<xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, it should be noted that the large-scale spread of COVID-19 is likely to be heterogeneous because many extrinsic factors, such as weather and control measures, may affect the transmission of pathogen. The transmission heterogeneity revealed in the current study was in a local outbreak, which indicates that some intrinsic properties of the pathogen might have contributed to the heterogeneity. This finding is more meaningful for the development of targeted control measures.</p><p>Besides the super-spreader in Tianjin, as discussed in the results, some other SSEs were also identified based on our criterion in other cities of China, such as in Ningbo, Zhejiang [<xref rid="B21-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; in Harbin, Heilongjiang [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; and in Hong Kong [<xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. With the tendency of pandemic of COVID-19, all governments should strengthen controls to prevent SSEs.</p><p>Previous studies identified multiple underlying reasons for the emergence of SSEs and high transmission heterogeneity [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For example, SSEs of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were largely driven by the environmental and clinical factors, such as hospital transfer, substantial delay of diagnosis, and fundamental crowding of population [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The transmission heterogeneity and the identified SSE of COVID-19 in Tianjin, however, exhibited different features. The SSE happened in a working place, and there was no obvious delay of diagnosing the super-spreader (3 days from onset of symptom to diagnosis). In addition, the longest transmission chain (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-03705-f002">Figure 2</xref>) occured after the initiation of level one response of public health emergency by the Tianjin government. Moreover, the public were advised to avoid mass gathering and stay at home. Obviously, the aforementioned reasons for the transmission heterogeneity in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV did not hold in the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, we suspected the transmission heterogeneity of COVID-19 were driven by some other epidemiological characteristics, such as asymptomatic transmission and contagiousness during incubation period, i.e., transmission can occur before symptom onset. The onset of viral shedding prior to the onset of symptoms, or in cases that remain asymptomatic, is a classic factor that makes infectious disease outbreaks difficult to control [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A recent reported transmission chain of large size in Harbin, China, was triggered by asymptomatic infections [<xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], which justified our speculation and highlighted the need for efficient measures such as rapid testing suspected cases to reduce the transmission from subclinical cases.</p><p>Additionally, our estimate of transmission potential (<inline-formula><mml:math id="mm12"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x0003c;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>) suggested that the spreading of COVID-19 would not cause large infection in Tianjin. This estimate was the average trend over the period of data collection (from 21 January to 26 February), and was considerable lower than that of other studies, especially at the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The differences in the reproductive number reported from different studies are largely due to differences methods, differences in data sources and time periods used to estimate the reproductive number. In addition, as indicated with our evaluation based on simulation, the value of <inline-formula><mml:math id="mm13"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>&#x0003c;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> indicated that the control measures imposed in succession by the local government had been considerable to reduce the spread of virus.</p><p>Regarding the effect of control measure undertaking by the local government, there were changes in point estimates of <italic>R</italic> and <italic>k</italic> of before and after government control, but the difference was not statistically significant with overlapping confidence intervals. Even though, by considering the resulted decrease of 19% infection (from 165 cases to 135 cases) within 25 days, these control measures still had some practical implication.</p><p>Although the spread of COVID-19 is currently under control in China, it is still facing the risk and challenge brought by the resumption of work and imported cases from other countries. The verification of transmission heterogeneity and SSE in Tianjin outbreak of COVID-19 reminds the government to pay much attention to asymptomatic transmission and other factors that may lead to the transmission heterogeneity and SSEs. Furthermore, more efforts are also needed to explore the emergence of SSE and its contributing factors.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning the limitations of our study. Totally 34 imported cases were reported in Tianjin during the period of our study, but we identified 43 transmission chains, which meant some epidemiology links among cases were missing. The estimate of heterogeneity might be driven up if the confirmed cases were condensed into fewer transmission chains. Meanwhile, we only analyzed COVID-19 data from Tianjin (135 confirmed cases), a relatively small sample size compared with the total number in China (exceeds 80,000 confirmed cases), and our case data might be subject to bias or under-reporting. However, this could not alter our final conclusion of significant heterogeneity, since a study [<xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-03705" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] explored small-sample bias and under-reporting bias and found that maximum likelihood estimates of k can be biased upward but are not biased downward.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-ijerph-17-03705"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we proved that the transmission of COVID-19 is heterogeneous and identified the existence of one SSE in Tianjin. We also showed that the control measures undertaken by the local government effectively alleviated the outbreak in terms of infection size and duration. As a pandemic which is still spreading worldwide at a startling speed, the transmission characteristics of COVID-19 needs more exploration and investigation in a large scale.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors acknowledge support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China and Zhejiang University special scientific research fund for COVID-19 prevention and control.
