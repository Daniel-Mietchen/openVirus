Povidone&#x02011;iodine (iodine with the water-soluble polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone, PVP-I) was discovered in 1955 at the Industrial Toxicology Laboratories in Philadelphia by H. A. Shelanski and M. V. Shelanski. It was developed so as to find an alternative form of antimicrobial iodine complex that was less toxic than tincture of iodine. The onset of antimicrobial action of PVP-I starts when free iodine [<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] dissociates from the polymer complex. The free form of iodine rapidly penetrates microbes disrupting proteins and oxidising nucleic acid structures resulting ultimately in microbial death. PVP-I antibacterial activity is enhanced by dilution of the usually available 10% w/w cutaneous solution, from 1:2 dilution up to a 1:100 dilution (0&#x000b7;1%), with a reduction in activity occurring beyond 1:100 [<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. PVP-I has higher virucidal activity than other commonly used antiseptic agents including chlorhexidine [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and benzalkonium chloride. PVP-I has been shown to be active in-vitro against the coronaviruses that have caused epidemics of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2002&#x02013;2003) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2012&#x02013;2013) [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">SARS-CoV-2 causing the COVID 19 Pandemic is highly homologous with SARS-CoV [<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In-vitro study by Eggers et al. [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] on the virucidal activity of PVP-I against MERS-CoV showed that the lowest concentration of PVP-I to be effective was 1% when used for 30&#x0202f;s under &#x0201c;dirty&#x0201d; conditions, leading to a reduction of viral activity of &#x02265;99.99%; but not effective at 0&#x000b7;1% [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In subsequent in-vitro work by Eggers et al. [<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the lowest concentration tested and effective against coronaviruses, was 0&#x000b7;23%. Kariwa et al. showed that in vitro treatment of SARS-CoV with various preparations of PVP-I for 2&#x0202f;min reduced the viral activity to untraceable levels [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The lowest concentration throat spray (Isodine Nodo Fresh&#x000ae;) of 0.23% was used in Japan. In many orthopaedic and ophthalmic surgeries PVP-I is used as preoperative agent for Decolonization of Nasal <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and many infections [<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>]. In many ophthalmic surgeries, different dilutions of PVP-I are used for avoiding contamination and it is well tolerated [<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">The oropharynx and nasopharynx are the target sites of novel coronavirus with the result that saliva contains a high viral load of COVID 19 with up to 1.2&#x0202f;&#x000d7;&#x0202f;10<sup>8</sup> infective copies/per ml [<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As an otorhinolaryngologist is closely working in this area, there is a significant risk of exposure during routine office based examinations of Ear, Nose and Throat and many endoscopy procedures. Even a few microliters of saliva contamination of surfaces or instruments may carry many thousands of infectious viral particles. Though asymptomatic, the viral shedding initial phase of COVID 19 is highly infectious [<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. At present there are no universal guidelines either for preoperative testing or for treatment of for COVID 19, and individual hospitals are creating their own protocols of treatment and prophylaxis. Povidone Iodine (PVP-I) has better antiviral activity than other antiseptics such as chlorhexidine [<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and has already been proven to be an effective virucidal in vitro against similar coronaviruses (SARS &#x02013;CoV and MERS-Cov) [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] although it has not been tested directly with COVID 19.

This application did not cause any significant effect on thyroid function, mucociliary clearance or olfaction.

A significant proportion of COVID 19 sufferers are asymptomatic, but shedding these viral particles. And pre-procedure testing for COVID 19 infection, may not be feasible in all patients attending the clinic. Moreover, a false negative test creates a pseudo feeling of security amongst the health care workers. The evidence presented suggests that application of povidone iodine to the nasal and oral mucosa, oropharynx and nasopharynx of patients with COVID-19 may significantly reduce the viral load in these key anatomical areas. This will definitely help to reduce the risk of transmission to health care workers. It also allows a time period to perform procedures at reduced risk. Further reduction of risk of transmission may be achieved by similar application of PVP-I to the HCW providing the care as a form of prophylaxis. We therefore propose that for the duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic. At low concentrations, staining of teeth is minimal and reversible.</p><p id="p0130">We do accept that direct testing and demonstration of the virucidal activity of PVP I against SARS-CoV-2 has not been yet documented. However, the experience gained from the previous studies by Eggers et al. [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] showing in vitro virucidal action of PVP-I in SARS COV and MERS [<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we propose to use it for reduction of SAR-CoV-2 viral load in the oral cavity to prevent COVID 19 transmission in the suggested manner. We propose this protocol for disinfection of the oral, oropharyngeal, nasopharyngeal and nasal cavities, similar to the recommended practice of hand sanitisation for transmission reduction. It will potentially prevent the infected patients from passing on the virus and at a portal of virus entry for HCW (potentially protecting them from being infected via the nose/mouth). It is accepted that aerosolised secretions from the lower respiratory tract almost certainly have a part to play in disease transmission and therefore that this proposal forms only part of the strategy to reduce transmission, in addition to the use of personal protective equipment by the health care workers.</p><p id="p0135">We propose that protocolled nasal drops/douching and oropharyngeal wash of PVP-I should be used in current COVID 19 pandemic to limit the spread of SARS &#x02013; COV-2 from patients to healthcare workers and potentially vice versa. We propose that no office based ENT examination, office based endoscopic procedures, planned surgical procedures and intubation should be carried out without disinfection by PVP-I. Although, we have not estimated the effective reduction in the viral titres of coronavirus 2, but we theoretically presume depending on past studies that the reduction in the titres is possible and can last at least for 20&#x0202f;min in vivo [<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The reduction in the titres as well as the length of time for which antisepsis remains has to be researched by various randomised controlled studies. A risk free time of 20&#x0202f;min following the use of PVP-I should be sufficient for examination and short procedures. The question of total iodine exposure seems well within previously recorded safe limits in those without contraindications to its use (history of allergy [<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] to PVP, thyroid diseases [<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], dermatitis [<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] etc.) as only PVP-I is used just before examination.

Amidst the deadly menace, we are extrapolating the in vitro efficacy of very economical PVP-I to apply it for in vivo use as there is no harm in considering the potential use of PVP-I in reducing Viral load in oropharyngeal and nasal cavities.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><title>Funding</title><p id="p0190">This study was not financially supported from external sources.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of competing interest</title><p id="p0195">None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wada</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nojima</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ogawa</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Relationship between virucidal efficacy and free iodine concentration of povidone-iodine in buffer solution</article-title><source>Biocontrol Sci</source><volume>21</volume><issue>1</issue><year>2016</year><fpage>21</fpage><lpage>27</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.4265/bio.21.21</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27009506</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Berkelman</surname><given-names>R.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Holland</surname><given-names>B.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>R.L.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Increased bactericidal activity of dilute preparations of povidone-iodine solutions</article-title><source>J Clin Microbiol</source><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><year>1982</year><fpage>635</fpage><lpage>639</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7040461</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0015"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rahn</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Review presentation on povidone-iodine antisepsis in the oral cavity</article-title><source>Postgrad Med J</source><volume>69</volume><issue>Suppl. 3</issue><year>1993</year><fpage>S4</fpage><lpage>S9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8290456</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0020"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0020"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>da Silveira Teixeira</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>de Figueiredo</surname><given-names>M.A.Z.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cherubini</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>de Oliveira</surname><given-names>S.D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Salum</surname><given-names>F.G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The topical effect of chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine in the repair of oral wounds.
