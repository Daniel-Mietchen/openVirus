    "COVID-19, arising from novel, zoonotic coronavirus-2, has gripped the world in a pandemic. The present chapter discusses the current internationally implemented pandemic preparedness strategies succeeding/recommended to curb the COVID-19 threat to humankind. The updated phase-wise categorization of a pandemic as recommended by the WHO is described, and associated innovations in surveillance, response, and medical measures/advisory in practice across the globe are elaborated. From a bird’s eye view, the COVID-19 pandemic management relies on revolutionizing the disease surveillance by incorporating artificial intelligence and data analytics, boosting the response strategies—extensive testing, case isolation, contact tracing, and social distancing—and promoting awareness and access to pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions, which are discussed in the present chapter. We also preview the economic bearing of the COVID-19 pandemic."
