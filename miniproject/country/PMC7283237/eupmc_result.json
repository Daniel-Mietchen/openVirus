    "Chongqing is one of the five provinces in China that has the highest incidence of acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis (AHC). Data of AHC cases from 2004 to 2018 were obtained from National Notifiable Diseases Reporting Information System (NNDRIS). Descriptive statistical methods were used to analyze the epidemiological characteristics; incidence maps were used to reflect incidence trends in each district; spatial autocorrelation was used to identify hotspot regions and spatiotemporal patterns of AHC outbreaks; spatiotemporal scan were conducted to identify AHC clusters. A total of 30,686 cases were reported with an annual incidence of 7.04 per 100,000. The incidence rates were high in 2007 and 2014, and large epidemics were observed in 2010 with the seasonal peak in September. Individuals aged 10-19 years, males, students and farmers were the prime high-risk groups. Except for 2012 and 2013, the spatial distribution of AHC did not exhibit significant global spatial autocorrelation. Local indicators of spatial association showed that the high-risk regions are Chengkou and Wuxi. The spatiotemporal scan indicated that all clusters occurred in September 2010, and the high-incidence clusters were mainly distributed in the northeast of Chongqing. The results could assist public health agencies to consider effective preventive measures based on epidemiological factors and spatiotemporal clusters in different regions."
