The complete clinical picture following COVID-19 infection is not yet fully understood. A recent report on over 72,000 COVID-19 cases by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed the case fatality rate was overall 2.3%. The mortality rises to 8% in patients between 70 and 79-years-old, and spikes to 14.8% in those aged 80 and above [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Sorhabi et al. give an informative and comprehensive account of the timeline, etiology, symptoms, supportive treatment, and transmission prevention of COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p id="p0015">The WHO's declaration of COVID-19 to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern is attributable to the high case fatality rates in China and the global economic effect of COVID-19, which may compound the current ongoing influenza epidemic [<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Furthermore, there is the potential for higher death rates in countries with vulnerable health systems in resource-limited regions. The ability to control local transmission depends on the application of the principles of rapid identification, prevention, and control, followed by patient isolation, rapid diagnosis, and contact tracing. Some countries remain ill-equipped with limited diagnostic capacity, resulting in delays from suspected case identification to vector confirmation and patient isolation, which increases the risk of disease transmission<sup>.</sup> [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Though, 74% of countries in Africa have an influenza pandemic preparedness plan; however, most are outdated and inadequate to deal with a global pandemic such as COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Recent epidemics and pandemics (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1 pandemic, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola) have highlighted the need to reinforce national public health capabilities, including disease-surveillance systems and health care workforce. Pandemic preparedness requires specific training in surveillance, epidemic response, and diagnostic testing. Strengthening health care systems worldwide, particularly in resource-poor settings, is imperative. Recurrent novel pandemics is our new global reality.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Provenance and peer review</title><p id="p0025">Invited Commentary, internally reviewed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Z.</given-names></name><name><surname>McGoogan</surname><given-names>J.M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Characteristics of and Important Lessons From the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Outbreak in China: Summary of a Report of 72&#x0202f;314 Cases From the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention [published online ahead of print, 2020 Feb 24]</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2020</year><comment>10.1001/jama.2020.2648</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sohrabi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Alisafi</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Neill</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Khan</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kerwan</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Jabir</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Iosifidis</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Agha</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>World health organization declares global emergency: a review of the 2019 novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)</article-title><source>Int.
