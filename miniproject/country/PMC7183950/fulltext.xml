To face the new scenario all the hospitals have been re-organised in order to reduce all the outpatient services and to devote almost all their personnel and resources to the management of Covid-19 patients. As a matter of fact, all the services have undergone a deep re-organization guided by: the necessity to reduce exams, to create an environment that helps reduce the virus spread, and to preserve the medical personnel from infection. In these days a re-organization of the endoscopic unit, sited in a high-incidence area, has been adopted, with changes to logistics, work organization and patients selection. With the present manuscript, we want to support gastroenterologists and endoscopists in the organization of a &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; endoscopy unit that responds to the &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; scenario, while remaining fully aware that resources, availability and local circumstances may extremely vary from unit to unit.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="keys0001"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Endoscopy</kwd><kwd>Covid-19</kwd><kwd>Coronavirus</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0001"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="para0002">Italy reported its first native case of severe acute respiratory syndrome from SARS-CoV-2 virus infection on February the 21<sup>st</sup>, after a major outbreak in China. As of March 26<sup>th</sup> the cases of Covid-19 have been rising exponentially up to 74,386 people infected and 7,505 deaths. This enormous number of patients has put severe stress on the healthcare systems of the most stricken areas of northern Italy, especially Lombardy.</p><p id="para0003">The current national guidelines have reserved nasopharyngeal swabs for the PCR assay of SARS-CoV-2 mostly to symptomatic patients, who require hospitalization, in the attempt of maximizing cost-effectiveness. However, preliminary data not yet published on the experience of V&#x000f2; Euganeo, a small town in Veneto where an extensive surveillance protocol by nasal swab testing has been adopted, prove that up to 50-75% of subjects carrying SARS-CoV-2 are actually asymptomatic and are an insidious source of infection. This report is consistent with some recent epidemiological Chinese studies that estimate up to 50-70% of asymptomatic carriers <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

They are characterized by a non-segmented single-strand positive-sense RNA genome. Coronaviruses have been first identified in the 1960s and they are known to infect many different animal species (e.g., bats, snakes, mice) in addition to humans. An epidemiological study held coronaviruses responsible for about 15% of adult common colds <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Coronaviruses have been associated with respiratory illnesses with relatively low virulence, usually in the upper respiratory tract, but occasionally involving the lungs.</p><p id="para0013">Three strains differ from the usual pathogenicity in humans, causing serious respiratory syndromes and leading to higher mortality rates. They are: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Coronaviruses have the potential to transmit across species. In fact, phylogenetic analysis has considered bats as the reservoir of coronaviruses in general, and for SARS-CoV-2 in particular. However, according to current studies, an intermediate host between bats and humans is to be identified amongst the wild animals sold at the Huanan wet market of Wuhan, where the first infection has apparently taken place <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0004"><label>2.2</label><title>Transmission</title><p id="para0014">The animal-to-human spread had been identified in the earliest patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan. Soon, a person-to-person spread developed. The emission of respiratory droplets which are deposited on the mucous membranes of mouth, nose and eyes of nearby people and by close personal contact seem to be the main routes of inter-human diffusion. However, a faecal-oral route of transmission has been recognized as well <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Furthermore, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by fomites is plausible, since it has been shown that the virus can remain viable and infectious on surfaces even for days <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p id="para0015">ACE2 protein is the cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entering host cells. Such a protein is widely expressed in AT2 lung cells but also in the gastrointestinal epithelial cells cytoplasm <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0005"><label>2.3</label><title>Diagnosis</title><p id="para0016">According to the WHO guidelines, it is recommended to collect samples from both the upper (naso- and oropharyngeal samples) and lower respiratory tract, such as&#x000a0;expectorated sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage. The diagnosis of Covid-19 is confirmed by the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In patients with a confirmed Covid-19 diagnosis, the RT-PCR test should be repeated in order to assess viral clearance before their being considered noninfectious <xref rid="bib0016" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p id="para0017">However, some studies suggest a low sensitivity of this method, reporting a positive rate of nasopharyngeal swabs between 30% and 60% at initial presentation. This might worsen virus spreading because of underestimation of infected patients <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p id="para0018">Some studies show that almost all affected patients show CT abnormalities (e.g., ground-glass opacities, bilateral patchy shadowing) <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. A Chinese report on 1,014 cases highlights the benefit provided by chest CT for the diagnosis of Covid-19 with 97% sensitivity, 25% specificity and 68% accuracy <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Interestingly, 30% of patients with symptoms had suggestive CT findings despite negative RT-PCR assays.</p><p id="para0019">Therefore, in case of negative RT-PCR assays, it is important to evaluate chest CT, clinical manifestations and exposure history in order to diagnose Covid-19 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. However, in high-incidence clinical settings with limited resources, only patients with severe signs and symptoms would probably undergo CT scan, thus limiting its potential in diagnosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec0006"><label>3</label><title>Endoscopic patients&#x02019; selection and assessment</title><sec id="sec0007"><label>3.1</label><title>Selection of patients and subdivision of the endoscopic procedures</title><p id="para0020">The aim is that priority should be given to those interventions that can substantially improve a patient's survival and postpone those which are not strictly necessary <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p id="para0021">Reducing or cancelling scheduled routine activities are among the first attempts to be implemented in order to ease the pressure of a rapidly spreading infectious agent such as SARS-CoV-2 on such a healthcare facility as a hospital. Also, good triage allows to perform essential procedures, thus reducing further viral spread from asymptomatic infected patients to medical staff and vice versa.</p><p id="para0022">Another important objective is preserving healthcare professionals.

The current guidelines on medical emergencies recommend providing safety and security to medical personnel and their families <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p id="para0023">As regards patients undergoing endoscopy, we have identified three main categories:<list list-type="simple" id="celist0002"><list-item id="celistitem0003"><label>-</label><p id="para0024">endoscopic emergencies (life-threatening gastrointestinal bleedings and foreign body ingestion);</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem0004"><label>-</label><p id="para0025">oncological patients with a proven impact of endoscopy on their prognosis;</p></list-item><list-item id="celistitem0005"><label>-</label><p id="para0026">non-oncological patients.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="para0027">Clearly, endoscopic emergencies cannot be delayed and should be performed according to the standard emergency endoscopic guidelines. On the other side, patients scheduled for endoscopy for a non-oncologic illness should be evaluated according to the motivation and clinical urgency of the examination. Particular attention should be paid to more advanced endoscopic techniques. In specialized secondary and tertiary centers, enteroscopy (device-assisted endoscopy or video-capsule endoscopy) should be reserved and guaranteed for patients affected by midgut bleeding with moderate to severe anaemia as well as endoscopic ultrasound and operational endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography in the setting of biliary obstructions leading to jaundice and pancreatitis.</p><p id="para0028">Certainly, other non-oncological patients, such as those with suspected functional or motility disorders, should be postponed after the resolution of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p><p id="para0029">Otherwise, oncological endoscopy represents quite a challenge for both clinical and ethical issues.</p><p id="para0030">When taking the clinical status of these patients (ongoing or previous chemotherapy) into consideration, it is general opinion that surveillance endoscopy can be safely re-scheduled. An algorithm considering both the underlying pathology and the required period of surveillance is potentially useful to decide about re-scheduling until routine procedures are restarted.</p><p id="para0031">The correct allocation of resources and appropriate triage during a biological disaster must be taken into consideration at the moment of each decision.</p><p id="para0032">The availability at the Center of prompt surgical and oncological treatments together with the patient's prognosis should guide physicians to perform diagnostic or therapeutic endoscopy in suspected oncological patients <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.</p><p id="para0033">We therefore recommend applying case-by-case judgement based on the expertise and endoscopic resources at the Center.</p><p id="para0034">Furthermore, when assessing patients, tele-medicine is potentially a promising tool to help physicians in their evaluation.
