Nevertheless, several questions still remain to be considered when figuring out a national ECMO network with a structured interhospital transport.</p><p>ECMO is a supportive therapy that ensures gas exchange and systemic perfusion, sustains the life of the patient when lung function and the native heart are dangerously compromised, and therefore should be considered to facilitate safe transfer from outlying hospitals to referral centers.</p><p>Interhospital transportation of critically ill patients to referral centers is required when local resources and technology are insufficient for adequate management. Moreover, many patients requiring transfer are often too unstable to undergo conventional transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Cannulation is performed on site by the retrieving team, and the patient is stabilized before transportation. The process requires a specialized team and resources dedicated to retrieval. Therefore, as ECMO is an invasive, intensive form of support, it requires considerable institutional commitment. Consequently, its use is advocated only in those patients believed to be at substantial risk of death.</p><p>In Australia and New Zealand, during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) winter pandemic, there was a large increase in the use of ECMO for ARDS in patients compared with the winter of 2008, which was predominantly explained by the high number of patients who were transported on ECMO. Despite their illness severity and the prolonged use of life support, most of these patients survived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Establishing explicit criteria for patient selection, timing of ECMO initiation, and optimal and safe application are first steps toward the validity of ECMO for adults with ARDS.</p><p>Could a network organization based on preemptive patient centralization allow a higher survival rate of patients with severe ARDS?</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Network Organization</title><p>The recent epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pandemic influenza A H1N1, have highlighted the potential for respiratory viral infections to cause severe disease with a significant risk of mortality.

The Italian network was set up to centralize all potentially severe patients in a limited number of tertiary hospitals to provide advanced treatment options including ECMO and identify predictors of mortality in order to define the best timing of ECMO institution.</p><p>The network consisted of 14 ICUs with ECMO capability and a national call center.</p><p>The ICU centers were selected based on their (1) experience in treating ARDS patients, (2) experience in respiratory ECMO or presence of a cardiac surgery team expert in ECMO, and (3) territorial distribution. Five centers ensured the interhospital transport through the whole Italian territory whenever the nearest ECMOnet center could not handle a case.

</p><p>If required, an ECMOnet team (2 ICU physicians, 1 perfusionist, 1 ICU nurse) traveled to the referring hospital to take care of the transfer. After an attempt to stabilize/improve the status of the patient, the ECMOnet team would decide to either transport the patient conventionally or establish ECMO at the referring hospital.

Percutaneous peripheral VV ECMO is preferred when cardiac function is adequate or mildly depressed. Patients should always be initiated on VV and eventually transitioned to VA ECMO if cardiac support is required. Vessel cannulation for VV ECMO can be configurated in several ways: dual-site or single-site approach. Beyond the hemodynamic instability, the ECMO team also will have to assess other conditions such as severe obesity and bleeding.</p><p>Some basic facilities are required in peripheral hospitals to ensure safety: echocardiography, fluoroscopy, surgery, and blood bank. The use of a bicaval dual-lumen cannula is recommended only if a safe environment is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

All patients fulfilled criteria for ARDS. Median duration of MV (mechanical ventilation) before ECMO was 2 (1&#x02013;5) days in patients with confirmed H1N1 (ARDS<sub>H1N1</sub>) and 8 (1&#x02013;14) days in patients with other causes of ARDS (ARDS<sub>other</sub>). Before ECMO, 42 patients (70 %) had received at least one &#x0201c;rescue therapy&#x0201d; (recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, inhaled nitric oxide, vasoactive drugs, steroid therapy). There were no statistically significant differences between ARDS<sub>H1N1</sub> and ARDS<sub>other</sub> in terms of severity of respiratory failure, treatment, and nonrespiratory organ function before ECMO.</p><p>Survival to hospital discharge in patients receiving ECMO was 68 %. Survival of patients receiving ECMO within 7 days from the onset of mechanical ventilation was 77 %. Survival rate in patients transported on ECMO was 81 %. There were no statistically significant differences between patients transported on ECMO and patients starting ECMO at the ECMOnet center in terms of severity of respiratory failure, treatment, and outcomes. The length of MV prior to ECMO was an independent predictor of mortality.</p><p>Among the 60 patients who received ECMO, 49 (82 %) ARDS<sub>H1N1</sub> presented a survival rate of 71 %, the remaining 11 (18 %) ARDS<sub>other</sub> presented a survival rate of 54 %.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Comment</title><p>The role of ECMO in ARDS is now well-defined: ECMO support should be considered in patients with respiratory failure refractory to conventional therapy not only to ensure gas exchange but also to minimize ventilator-associated lung injury and its associated multiple organ dysfunction, both crucial determinants of survival for patients with ARDS. Several reports demonstrated that ECMO can be undertaken without the prohibitive morbidity and adverse events seen in the 1970s.</p><p>To be effective, ECMO must be applied to the appropriate patient (indications, contraindications), timing of ECMO initiation must be the most correct (not too early, not too late), and ECMO must be correctly and safely applied (patient considerations: age, obesity, VV or VA ECMO, dual-site or single-site venovenous cannulation; monitoring and general measures&#x02014;ultrasound, fluoroscopy, surgery, and blood bank).</p><p>The centralization of patients to a few selected, specifically equipped centers can improve patient outcome, but the risks associated with patient transportation could exceed the benefits of centralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To reduce these risks, we planned some strategies: transferring in advance the largest proportion of patients potentially at risk of severe respiratory deterioration according to clinical criteria and assigning the patients to expert transportation teams, able to institute ECMO at the referring hospital and provide safe transportation with ECMO according to precise criteria. Some of the patients transported with ECMO might not have needed ECMO if treated from the beginning with other rescue therapies at the referral centers, where more therapeutic options were available. However, most of these patients were considered to be not safely transportable without ECMO.</p><p>The Italian ECMO network ensured a high survival rate of patients with severe ARDS due to H1N1 infection treated by ECMO, a safe centralization, and created an organization ready to challenge future possible epidemics with high demand for critical care units with advanced respiratory support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. CESAR randomized trial indicated that significantly more patients with severe ARDS survived without severe disability if they were transferred to a single ECMO center compared with patients who were managed conventionally. Moreover, this trial showed that patients referred for ECMO had roughly two times longer hospital stays and twice the medical costs of those treated in the conventional management group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. One or two patients with influenza A (H1N1)-related ARDS can strain the capacity of any intensive care unit (ICU) and ECMO team, particularly when ECMO availability is needed for other patients. ECMO centers should make plans for allocation of resources: identification of early predictors of adverse outcome could allow optimization of criteria for ECMO eligibility and referral.</p><p>The Italian ECMOnet activity showed that mortality of adult patients suffering from influenza A (H1N1)-related ARDS undergoing VV ECMO is related to extrapulmonary organ function at the time of cannulation. PreECMO hospital length of stay; bilirubin, creatinine, hematocrit values; and systemic mean arterial pressure were significantly associated with mortality as assessed by multivariate analysis, while respiratory parameters were not associated with survival.</p><p>To improve risk stratification and prediction of mortality risk at time of VV ECMO initiation, we developed a multifactorial scoring system&#x02014;the ECMOnet score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>These data provide new perspectives concerning the allocation of resources for VV ECMO. We confirm the strong clinical perception that survival is strongly correlated to extrapulmonary organ function at the time of ECMO initiation. This knowledge may help to identify potential candidates for ECMO support according to their mortality risk and provides guidance to solve crucial economic and ethical issues.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Peek</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Mugford</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Tiruvoipati</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Efficacy and economic assessment of conventional ventilatory support versus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe adult respiratory failure (CESAR): a multicentre randomised controlled trial</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2009</year><volume>374</volume><fpage>1351</fpage><lpage>1363</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61069-2</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 19762075?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19762075</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Noah</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Peek</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Finney</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Referral to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center and mortality among patients with severe 2009 influenza A(H1N1)</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2011</year><volume>306</volume><issue>15</issue><fpage>1659</fpage><lpage>1668</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/jama.2011.1471</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 21976615?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21976615</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Isgr&#x000f2;</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Patroniti</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Bombino</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for interhospital transfer of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome patients: a 5-year experience</article-title><source>Int J Artif Organs</source><year>2011</year><volume>34</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>1052</fpage><lpage>1060</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5301/ijao.5000011</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 22183518?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22183518</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>The Australia and New Zealand Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ANZ ECMO) Influenza Investigators</collab></person-group><article-title>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 2009 influenza A(H1N1) acute respiratory distress syndrome</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2009</year><volume>302</volume><fpage>1888</fpage><lpage>1895</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1001/jama.2009.1535</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19822628</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lapinsky</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Epidemic viral pneumonia</article-title><source>Curr Opin Infect Dis</source><year>2010</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>139</fpage><lpage>144</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1097/QCO.0b013e328336eaae</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 20087179?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20087179</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><label>6.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Sprung CL, Zimmerman JL, Christian MD, et al, European Society of Intensive Care Medicine Task Force for Intensive Care Unit Triage during an Influenza Epidemic or Mass Disaster (2010) Recommendations for intensive care unit and hospital preparations for an influenza epidemic or mass disaster: summary report of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine&#x02019;s Task Force for intensive care unit triage during an influenza epidemic or mass disaster.
