HEV infections are of particular concern among pregnant women, due to very high mortality rates (up to 70%). Unfortunately, good understanding of the factors that trigger the occurrence of HEV epidemics is currently lacking; therefore, anticipating the onset of an outbreak is yet not possible. In order to map the geographical regions at higher risk of HEV epidemics and the conditions most favorable for the transmission of the virus, we compiled a dataset of HEV waterborne outbreaks and used it to obtain models of geographical suitability for HEV across the planet. The main three variables that best predict the geographical distribution of HEV outbreaks at global scale are population density, annual potential evapotranspiration and precipitation seasonality. At a regional scale, the temporal occurrence of HEV outbreaks in the Ganges watershed is negatively correlated with the discharge of the river (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.77). Combined, our findings suggest that ultimately, population density and water balance are main parameters influencing the occurrence of HEV-1 and HEV-2 outbreaks. This study expands the current understanding of the combination of factors shaping the biogeography and seasonality of waterborne viral pathogens such as HEV-1 and HEV-2, and contributes to developing novel concepts for the prediction and control of human waterborne viruses in the near future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Ecological modelling</kwd><kwd>Viral hepatitis</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is recognized as one of the most important agents of acute viral hepatitis worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. According to estimates of the World Health Organization (WHO), every year there are around 20 million infections, 3 million of symptomatic cases of HEV and more than 50,000 deaths globally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. While in industrialized countries HEV infections normally lead to sporadic zoonotic or foodborne cases of acute hepatitis, in developing regions HEV causes large recurrent outbreaks affecting several hundred to several thousand persons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Such outbreaks are caused by consumption or use of fecally contaminated water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. HEV waterborne outbreaks often occur in areas with limited access to clean water, or with low levels of water sanitation and hygiene. In addition, HEV waterborne outbreaks frequently strike areas of civil conflict or emergency such as refugee camps, where their control may be challenging and the disease outcomes more severe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">HEV particles are small (approximately 27&#x02013;34&#x02009;nm in diameter), non-enveloped, and contain a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome of 7.2 kilobases (kb). HEV is currently classified within the <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> family, and the <italic>Orthohepevirus</italic> genus and the <italic>Orthohepevirus A</italic> species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Based on genetic analyses, human isolates of HEV are classified in four genotypes and several subtypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. HEV genotypes 1 and 2 (HEV-1 and HEV-2, respectively) are responsible for the occurrence of large waterborne outbreaks in tropical and some subtropical regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Specifically, HEV-1 has been detected in Asian countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, India, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam) as well as in Africa (Algeria, the Central African Republic, Chad, Djibouti, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, Namibia, Egypt, and South Africa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Genotype 2 was initially detected in an epidemic in Mexico<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, but more recently it has also been reported in African countries (Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Namibia, and Nigeria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>). Conversely, HEV genotypes 3 and 4 (HEV-3 and HEV-4, respectively) do not cause outbreaks but have instead been identified as causative agents in sporadic acute hepatitis E cases in the United States, Europe, China and Japan, and are only associated with cases of zoonotic origin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">To date, HEV outbreaks due to HEV-1 and HEV-2, are thought to occur after events of heavy rainfall and floods, or in hot and dry months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Rainfall and flooding may magnify the fecal contamination of water used for multiple purposes (drinking, cooking, personal hygiene, religious rituals, etc.). On the other hand, hot and dry months may possibly decrease the level of surface water leading to an increased concentration of enteric pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that climatic factors may be of major importance for the efficient transmission of HEV-1 and HEV-2 and the occurrence of outbreaks. However, the specific environmental conditions influencing HEV spatiotemporal dynamics remain largely unknown. It is therefore currently not possible to anticipate the spatiotemporal occurrence of HEV epidemics. In the context of climatic change, it is urgently needed to better understand the ecology of waterborne pathogens in order to increase our preparedness toward future outbreaks.</p><p id="Par5">The analysis of health data, such as viral outbreaks or presence, from a geographical perspective (e.g. geographical distribution of the outbreaks) can highlight interesting patterns that can be used to formulate hypotheses about the role of different factors in the occurrence of an infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Species distribution models (SDMs), also known as niche models, are based on correlations between environmental data and geo-referenced presence/absence data (occurrence localities) of a particular species of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These models are widely used in ecology and biogeography studies to address a broad array of questions, such as the identification of the potential distribution of an invasive species, mapping the risk of disease transmission, or anticipating the effects of climate change on the distribution of species of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Among different distribution models, the maximum entropy method (MaxEnt) developed by Philips and colleagues a decade ago<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> is one of the most widely used. This method exclusively relies on the use of presence data of a species of interest along with a set of environmental variables to model the species&#x000b4; geographical distribution. This feature is particularly interesting to model the distribution of infectious diseases, such as HEV, for which absence data are rarely available. Presence data used in MaxEnt correspond to latitude-longitude pairs where a species has been observed, and environmental variables are layers of environmental information (e.g. temperature, amount of precipitation, a landcover class, etc.) in GIS format characterizing the same geographic area like the presence data records. Specifically, MaxEnt is based on a machine-learning algorithm which predicts environmental suitability for the species of interest given the environmental information, thereby estimating &#x0201c;a target probability distribution by finding the probability distribution of maximum entropy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>&#x0201d;, thus containing a maximum of information. In other words, MaxEnt estimates what is closest to uniform distribution given a set of constraints based on current knowledge of the environmental variables at the occurrence sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Despite its popularity, the MaxEnt model does not directly estimate occurrence probability. Instead, it generates an index of relative habitat suitability. Other software, such as MaxLike, a more recent maximum-likelihood technique, has been shown to overcome the problem of directly estimating the probability of occurrence using presence-only data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. MaxEnt tends to under-estimate the probability of occurrence within areas of observed presences, but over-estimates it in unsampled areas beyond the spatial coverage of the data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, MaxEnt has shown to perform better than other SDMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and, unlike other software, it has been previously used in environmental virology to predict the distribution of multiple pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In order to anticipate the spatiotemporal occurrence of HEV waterborne outbreaks at a global scale, we aim to: (i) identify spatial patterns in the occurrence of HEV epidemics, and (ii) determine the most important factors influencing such patterns. For this purpose, a database of publicly available data of HEV outbreaks was compiled, and this database was used in conjunction with environmental data to generate a global distribution model for the waterborne genotypes of HEV (HEV-1 and HEV-2). The results of this work expand our understanding of the factors promoting the spatiotemporal occurrence of HEV-1 and HEV-2, may contribute to anticipate the occurrence of waterborne outbreaks, and may ultimately be useful to optimize the control of waterborne pathogens in the next decades.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Summary of the dataset and measures of risk</title><p id="Par7">The final dataset used in this study contains 59 geo-referenced outbreaks of waterborne HEV (caused by HEV-1 and HEV-2). To date HEV outbreaks have occurred in Africa, Asia and central America (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, most of the HEV outbreaks have been reported in Asia (59%) and in Africa (39%). More specifically, 27% of all reports of water-related outbreaks caused by HEV-1 and HEV-2 have occurred in the north of India (Ganges Valley). Notably, the main source of freshwater in the region, one of the most populated in the world is the Ganges river, which is the third largest river on the planet by discharge and highly polluted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Another geographical region with recurrent occurrence of HEV outbreaks is equatorial Africa including Chad, Central African Republic, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Uganda, among others. In these countries, the current number of recorded outbreaks also account for 27% of the total. Frequently, outbreaks in Africa occur in refugee camps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Combined, the events recorded in the Ganges valley and the above-mentioned countries of Africa represent more than 53% of the total number of outbreaks reported to date globally. The rest of the outbreaks occurred in other Asian or African countries.

The incidence proportion was also higher in Asia than Africa (0.006 and 0.015%, respectively). The comparative risk (ratio of the incidence proportion) between Asia and Africa is thus 2.5, indicating that the risk of being infected by HEV in a waterborne outbreak is 2.5 times higher in Asia than in Africa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Models of spatial suitability for hepatitis E virus outbreaks</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>General model</title><p id="Par9">The combination of variables used in the general model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) resulted in an AUC value of 0.96 for the training data and 0.91 for the test data, while a value of 0.5 corresponds to a random prediction (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).

The AUC value of this model (shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) was 0.89 for the training data and 0.90 for the test data.

The variables contributing the most to the model (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) were the annual potential evapotranspiration (percent contribution and permutation importance of 56.9 and 7.1, respectively), the precipitation seasonality (percent contribution and permutation importance of 21.5 and 14.1, respectively) and, at a lesser extent, the precipitation of the driest quarter of the year (percent contribution and permutation importance of 8.4 and 2.6, respectively). In particular, under this model the predicted suitability for the occurrence of HEV outbreaks clearly increases with the annual potential evapotranspiration and the precipitation seasonality (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, supplementary information). Generally, the model based on environmental information predicts a broader ecological suitability for the virus than the general model, which includes data of population density (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). For example, the environmental model expects a high ecological suitability for the virus in the north of Australia and in Central and South America (especially, Brazil) while both locations are not particularly suitable if we take into account population density data. Notably, no HEV outbreaks have ever been recorded in these areas. Other areas of high suitability under the environmental model are the state of Arizona in the United States, the south of Spain and the south-east of Asia.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Map showing the environmental model of the ecological suitability for the occurrence of HEV outbreaks obtained using MaxEnt.

In turn, for each subset of the data we obtained a general model (including population density data) and an environmental model (which only includes environmental information and not population density). The general model obtained with outbreak data from Africa have AUC values of 0.91 for the test data and 0.96 for the training data, and the environmental model showed AUC values of 0.94 for the test data and 0.94 for the training data (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>, supplementary data). Under the African model based on environmental and population density data, the most important variables are annual potential evapotranspiration (percent contribution and permutation importance of 46.6 and 37, respectively), population density (percent contribution and permutation importance of 34.4 and 26.2, respectively), and precipitation during the warmest quarter of the year (percent contribution and permutation importance of 10.9 and 8.6, respectively). If we only use environmental data and outbreak data from Africa, the most important variables are annual potential evapotranspiration (percent contribution and permutation importance of 64.7 and 15.3, respectively), and precipitation during the warmest quarter (percent contribution and permutation importance of 12 and 15.9, respectively) and precipitation during the driest quarter of the year (percent contribution and permutation importance of 8.7 and 0, respectively). Both models predict similar distribution of ecological suitability for HEV as compared to the general model obtained using the complete outbreak dataset. Nevertheless, under the African models, the HEV suitability in the Ganges Valley is remarkably lower than expected under the full-dataset general model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>, supplementary data). This is surprising considering that this region is the one with more reported outbreaks to date globally. Conversely, the general and the environmental model obtained with outbreak data in Asia have AUC values of 0.98 for the test data and 0.99 for the training data (general model), and 0.95 for the test data and 0.96 for the training data (environmental model), respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). While these AUC values are much higher than those obtained by the African models or the full-dataset models, the HEV ecological suitability predicted by the models obtained with outbreak data from Asia are not consistent with the full model (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>, supplementary data). Particularly, the Asian models, only predict a high ecological suitability for HEV in the south-east Asia. As shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>, under the Asian models the most important variables are population density for the general model (percent contribution and permutation importance of 96.5 and 98.3, respectively); and for the environmental model mean temperature of the wettest quarter (percent contribution and permutation importance of 40.9 and 25.1, respectively), annual potential evapotranspiration (percent contribution and permutation importance of 20.5 and 7.5, respectively) and precipitation seasonality (percent contribution and permutation importance of 16.3 and 50.3, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Factors influencing HEV seasonality in the Ganges watershed</title><p id="Par12">We developed a correlation analysis using average monthly data of environmental and hydrological parameters for the Ganges watershed over the year in order to determine what factors may influence the temporal occurrence of HEV waterborne outbreaks (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

Our dataset has highlighted geographical differences in the morbidity of the virus. Specifically, the cumulative incidence rate and the incidence proportion for HEV are much higher in Asia as compared to Africa. As a result, according to our dataset, the risk of being infected by HEV is 2.5 times higher in Asia than in Africa. Morbidity indices such as the cumulative incidence rate and the incidence proportion are a ratio of the cases of an infection or disease, and the population at risk at a certain time and region. Thus, differences in the comparative risk may be thus explained by a higher number of cases or a lower number of population at risk. Given that some of the most populated countries are found in Asia (e.g. China, India, Pakistan or Bangladesh), we can possibly rule out lower numbers of susceptible individuals in Asia as compared to Africa. It is thus possible that the conditions found in highly suitable areas of Asia are more favorable for the waterborne transmission of HEV than those typically found in highly suitable areas of Africa. This hypothesis deserves further attention in the future.</p><p id="Par14">The general model obtained in the present study combines HEV-1 and HEV-2 outbreak data with population density data and other environmental variables selected on the basis of current knowledge on hepatitis E virus. This model predicts a high ecological suitability in regions where HEV waterborne outbreaks are recurrently identified (e.g. India, Pakistan and African countries above the Equator)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. However, we have not found any reports of HEV outbreaks occurred in Saudi Arabia and only one outbreak has been registered to date in Mexico, while both regions have high predicted suitability under our general model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, in consistence with our results some studies have shown that HEV seroprevalence in adult population living in the cities of Makkah and Djeddah (Saudi Arabia) is very high (18 and 15%, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, indicating that at least sporadic or subclinical HEV cases may occur in the region. Other seroprevalence studies conducted in the country have shown lower seroprevalence values in areas of low suitability according to our general model. For example, one study showed that HEV seroprevalence among adult population living in Riyad was around 8%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Most of these studies have observed higher seroprevalence among non-Saudis as compared to Saudi nationals. Johargy and colleagues found that the seroprevalence among Saudi nationals was 15% while it was to 23% among non-Saudis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. A large proportion of immigration entering Saudi Arabia comes from countries with very high suitability for the occurrence of hepatitis E outbreaks such as India, Indonesia, Pakistan or Bangladesh, for instance (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.iom.int/world-migration">https://www.iom.int/world-migration</ext-link>). In these countries the seroprevalence for HEV may be as high as 40%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, thus migration fluxes may contribute to the occurrence of hepatitis E viruses in Saudi Arabia, where some areas are highly suitable for the occurrence of HEV outbreaks. In the light of these results, ensuring water sanitation, water treatment and hygiene in these locations is highly recommended for the control of HEV. It is worth mentioning that few outbreaks have been recorded in areas where the suitability for HEV estimated by our general model is low to moderate. For example, to date three HEV outbreaks have been reported in the south of Africa (Namibia and Botswana) and four in Central Asia (China and Tajikistan). While this may highlight some deficiency in the model, it may also suggest that favorable conditions may eventually occur in regions with low-moderate susceptibility for HEV triggering the onset of a HEV waterborne outbreak.</p><p id="Par15">According to the general model, the main variables influencing the ecological suitability for HEV are: (i) the population density, (ii) the annual potential evapotranspiration, and at a lesser extent (iii) the precipitation seasonality. This indicates that the global occurrence of HEV-1 and HEV-2 outbreaks is associated both with the presence of the virus&#x02019; host and hydrological factors, in agreement with the fact that HEV epidemics are primarily waterborne. These results are consistent with those obtained in previous studies showing that HEV waterborne outbreaks occurred during periods of drought or after extreme rainfall events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Combined, these findings may indicate that the occurrence of outbreaks is influenced by the concentration of the virus in water. Among other factors, pathogen concentration in surface water and their transmission may be in turn influenced by either evaporation of polluted water, or by runoff after heavy rainfall events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In regions with poor hygiene, low sanitation and where open defecation is commonly practiced, runoff after rainfall events can be particularly important as a source of human pathogens for rivers and lakes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">Comparison between the general and the environmental model shows that if population density is not taken into account, the ecological suitability for HEV predicted by the resulting model is much broader. In fact, under the environmental model the suitability for HEV is remarkably high in countries where no waterborne outbreak of HEV has even been recorded (Australia and Brazil, for instance). This observation suggests that in absence of proper sanitation, if human population density increases in these areas, the geographical distribution of HEV epidemics could expand. Overall, considering the environmental model obtained in this work the variables that best predict the distribution of HEV are: (i) the annual potential evapotranspiration, (ii) the precipitation seasonality, and (iii) the precipitation of the driest quarter of the year. Once again, our results suggest that hydrological factors influencing river discharge may contribute to trigger the occurrence of an HEV outbreak caused by the waterborne genotypes of HEV (HEV-1 and HEV-2).</p><p id="Par17">Models obtained using HEV outbreak data from Africa and Asia have showed interesting differences between the most important variables predicting HEV-1 and HEV-2 outbreaks. Human population density and annual potential evapotranspiration are important predictors of the occurrence of HEV-1 and HEV-2 epidemics in Africa and Asia. However, precipitation seasonality is a good predictor under Asian but not in the African models. This suggests that while at global scale HEV outbreaks seem to be explained by the combination of population density, potential evapotranspiration and precipitation seasonality, at local scale other variables may also influence the spatiotemporal occurrence of HEV waterborne cases. This finding may indicate that the environmental conditions favoring the occurrence of HEV epidemics caused by genotypes 1 and 2 in Asia may differ from those in Africa. Notably, these results could explain the difference in HEV risk between Asia and Africa observed from our outbreak dataset.</p><p id="Par18">The correlation analysis developed using monthly data of HEV-1 and HEV-2 outbreaks, environmental and hydrological variables in the Ganges watershed suggests that the higher is the river discharge, the fewer outbreaks occur. Noteworthy, our dataset suggests that the safer months in the region in terms of occurrence of HEV outbreaks are the monsoon months; June, July, August and September. Consistent with previous observations described above, our results highlight that ultimately water balance, and thus pathogen concentration in a watershed may influence the temporal occurrence of waterborne outbreaks caused by HEV. Some previous studies have shown that streamflow is correlated with biological contamination and that pathogen load is influenced by river discharge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Our results are in agreement with a previous study investigating the presence of HEV RNA in sewage of northern India from 2004 to 2006<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In this study, the authors observed the presence of HEV in 46% of the tested samples in winter months (November to February), 55% in summer months (March to June) and 23% during the monsoon months (July to October). This study suggests that HEV load in the Ganges river may be indeed lower during the monsoon months. Conversely, one recent study has shown bimodal peaks for HEV cases in India, with a peak occurring during the cold months of the year and a second peak in August, during the monsoon period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. It is possible that HEV cases occur during the monsoon months but that the environmental conditions during this period have a negative influence on the occurrence of large outbreaks. Another possible explanation for this disagreement is that the methods used in both studies have different accuracy to determine the occurrence of HEV cases or outbreaks. In addition, we cannot exclude the potential influence of sociological factors, such as pilgrimage events and religious celebrations which may sporadically increase the dissemination of the virus at a certain location and time of the year. Further studies are needed to fully understand the specific interplay of water balance, the concentration of enteric pathogens in surface water and the occurrence of infections among the population.</p><p id="Par19">In conclusion, we have identified geographical areas of high general and environmental suitability for the occurrence of waterborne outbreaks of hepatitis E virus (genotypes 1 and 2). Specifically, our results indicate that, at a global scale, the most ecologically suitable hotspots for these viruses are the Ganges Valley and Pakistan, the west coast of Saudi Arabia and subequatorial African countries. In addition, we have determined the most important factors (population density and water balance) for the spatial occurrence of HEV waterborne outbreaks at global scale, and for the seasonal occurrence of outbreaks at regional scale using the Ganges watershed as a case study. Nevertheless, our results have also shown that local particularities may also influence the onset of an outbreak, and thus further studies are necessary to better understand the role of other factors such as rainfall, soil properties, pollution source, land use or river network ephemerality acting at regional scale.</p><p id="Par20">The dataset of HEV-1 and HEV-2 outbreaks used here is relatively small (59 entries) and the existence of geographical and temporal irregularities on the reporting and identification of HEV epidemics cannot be excluded. For example, changes in the sanitation level or population density in a certain region over the study period could certainly influence the occurrence of waterborne outbreaks and therefore change the general model obtained here. Similarly, it is a well-known fact that many waterborne diseases such as HEV are underreported due to the generally mild associated symptoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Due to the lack of spatially continuous data, in our models we have not included other environmental factors that may also be important for the occurrence of HEV outbreaks (e.g. sanitation). In addition, the environmental variables included in as covariate in the analyses were selected given current knowledge on the environmental transmission of the virus, but it is also possible that covariates are missing, representing a further source of modelling error. Similarly, we have not taken into account the potential role of cross-immunity in the population due to co-infection with HEV-3 and HEV-4 circulating in the territory. Some authors have shown that Rhesus monkeys infected with genotype 1 or genotype 4 developed immunity to infections caused by the other genotype, suggesting the possibility of cross-protection between waterborne and foodborne HEV genotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Therefore, the circulation of HEV-1 and HEV-2 in regions with low sanitation conditions could influence the circulation and distribution of HEV-3 and HEV-4, and <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p><p id="Par21">A vaccine against HEV is commercially available in China since 2011 (Hecolin&#x000ae;, Xiamen Innovax Biotech Co., Ltd., China) and recommended for individuals at high risk of HEV infections. To date, it has not been licensed in any other country and no other experimental vaccine has progressed to clinical trials. We cannot comment on the possible effect of the vaccination of risk groups in China on the occurrence of HEV outbreaks in the country since currently little is known about the actual use of the Hecolin&#x000ae; vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Despite its limitations, the present study represents a step forward for anticipating and preventing the occurrence of hepatitis E epidemics due to the contamination of drinking and recreational water with HEV genotypes 1 and 2. Our data will be useful to plan future prospective studies and may contribute to understand the movement of viruses between different geographical areas of diverse suitability levels. Data on the concentration of HEV in surface water, and the occurrence of HEV waterborne cases throughout the year should be obtained in order to establish the potential link between the HEV dose in the environment and the transmission of the virus among people.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Dataset compilation</title><p id="Par23">The dataset used in this work was compiled using literature records of waterborne outbreaks of hepatitis E available in the PubMed database and in WHO reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.
