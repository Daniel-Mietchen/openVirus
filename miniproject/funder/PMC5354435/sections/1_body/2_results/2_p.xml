<p>The results of the cross-correlation of weekly local DF case numbers and prediction variables are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005354.s003">S3 Table</xref>. We found that minimum temperature in the previous 9 weeks, cumulative rainfall in the previous 12 weeks and imported cases in the previous 5 weeks have the highest correlation with local DF. Hence these variables were included in our model. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005354.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the dose-response relationship between local DF cases and imported cases in the previous 5 weeks, minimum temperature in the previous 9 weeks, cumulative rainfall in the previous 12 weeks and DBSI in the previous week. Minimum temperature, cumulative rainfall and imported DF cases were non-linearly associated with the local DF cases. For cumulative rainfall, the risk of DF incidence increases with the increment of rainfall at first, peaking at 149mm, followed by a significant decrease. DBSI in the previous week had a positively linear relationship with the local DF.
