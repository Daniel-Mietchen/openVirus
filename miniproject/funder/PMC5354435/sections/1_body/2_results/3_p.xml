 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005354.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows that both model (1) and model (2) fit the DF cases reasonably well during the training process. Our results indicate that the fit of model (1) and model (2) were both found to be significant (
 <italic>F</italic> = 10.46, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). The value of model with the DBSI (GCV:7.62 and Deviance explained: 99.23%) fit better than the model without DBSI (GCV: 18.41 and Deviance explained: 94.53%). Moreover, the effects of climate, imported cases and DBSI were found to be significant at the 0.05 level (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005354.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Model (2) gives a better prediction of DF cases (ICC:0.94 and RMSE:59.86) than model (1) (ICC:0.72 and RMSE:203.29).
