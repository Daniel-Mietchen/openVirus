<p>Many previous studies reported that climatic factors influenced DF transmission by directly or indirectly affecting each stage in the life cycle of the mosquito and the disease transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005354.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In this study, we found that DF was positively correlated with average weekly minimum temperature at a lag of 9 weeks. This finding is generally in agreement with previous studies that indicate the crucial role of temperature in dengue transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005354.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Possible reasons for this association with temperature are that higher temperature can reduce both mosquito maturity and reproduction time in favor of producing more mosquitoes in a shorter time [

This is consistent with several other studies that found that rainfall influenced vector abundance in subsequent weeks by creating more breeding habitats for mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005354.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. On the other hand, it is also likely that heavy rain can destroy existing mosquito breeding sites and affect the maturation of mosquito eggs or larvae [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005354.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Our study indicated that imported DF cases in the previous 5 weeks had a large impact on the local DF case numbers. The time delay could be the period of the life cycle of dengue transmission.
