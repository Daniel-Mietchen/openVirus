<p>To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to investigate the relationship between DBSI and DF cases in China. We found that DBSI in the previous week had a positive linear relationship with reported DF cases, implying that internet-based search behavior may be a useful predictor of DF incidence. This is consistent with previous studies that investigated the relationship between Google Dengue Trends (GDT) and DF cases [

In one study in Singapore and Bangkok, Althouse et al. demonstrated that the internet search terms could successfully predict incidence and periods of large incidence of dengue with high accuracy. Their model using Google search data had an

Chan et al. also observed in five countries that the models built on the fraction of Google search volume for dengue-related queries were able to adequately estimate true dengue activity, and the correlation between values predicted by models and the surveillance data was generally quite high, ranging from 0.82 to 0.99 [
