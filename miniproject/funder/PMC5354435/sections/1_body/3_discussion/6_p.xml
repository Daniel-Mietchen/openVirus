<p>Some limitations of our study should be mentioned. First, the guidelines of dengue diagnosis and treatment were different before and after October 11
 <sup>th</sup>, 2014 in China. For example, a dengue virus NS1 antigen test was added to the new version as an important criterion, which might lead to some bias to our results. However, the influences of changing diagnosis guidelines on our results are limited, because only dengue cases in the last one and half months in 2014 were diagnosed by the new guidelines. Second, the study developed the prediction model using only a 4-year period of time-series data based on weekly data, and could only be validated for an 8-week period. It is advisable to use long-term time series data in model fitting in the future. Third, this study does not examine other potential confounding factors that may be associated with dengue incidence, such as environmental, socio-economic and demographic factors [

Studies could be conducted in the future to investigate how users interact with internet search sources for providing valuable information on potential biases and suggest mechanisms for improving the robustness of surveillance systems based on internet search queries.
