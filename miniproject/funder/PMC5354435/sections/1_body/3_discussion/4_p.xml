<p>As we mentioned in the introduction, the GFT firstly provided us an excellent example in 2003â€“3007 to illustrate the contribution of internet search data on the prediction of infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005354.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Some researchers analyzed the reasons for this failure in the GFT model suggesting that the internet-based query system can be used as a supplement to, but not a substitute for, the traditional data collection and analysis [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005354.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Moreover, Gluskinet al. also demonstrated in Mexico that the model using GDT data in combination with relevant covariates (maximum temperature, logged precipitation) can significantly improve dengue prediction [

Collectively, these results indicate that integrating internet-based dengue query data into traditional disease surveillance can improve dengue prediction, providing us with a new approach for establishing an almost real-time early warning system. In this big data era when internet-based data are easily available and collected in almost real-time [
