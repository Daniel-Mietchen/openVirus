<p>The df for each variable was determined according to the GCV principles and deviance explained (%) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005354.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Lower GCV and higher deviance explained value indicate a better fit of the model. Finally, we chose df for 
 <italic>week</italic> variable were 4, and other included variables were 3[
 <xref rid="pntd.0005354.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; moreover, the sensitivity of the trend was tested by setting df to be 2, 3 or 4.
