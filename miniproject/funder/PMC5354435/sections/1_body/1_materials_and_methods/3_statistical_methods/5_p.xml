<p>Finally, we employed a Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) method to validate the results of model (1) and model (2). LOOCV is a k-fold cross-validation method [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005354.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and here the total dataset was divided into (n-1) subsets, where n is the number of weeks from the1
 <sup>st</sup> week of 2011 to the 44
 <sup>th</sup> week of 2014. In each subset, a single weekâ€™s data was removed, and the weekly number of dengue cases was predicted. Then we employed the ICC as a metric to test the correlations between predicted and observed cases.
