<p>First, cross-correlation analysis was carried out to identify the correlation between DF occurrence with imported cases, minimum temperature, cumulative rainfall and DBSI with 1 to 16 weeksâ€™ lag. Second, generalized additive models (GAM) were applied to fit the relationships between the variables and local DF cases. Because the variables with different time lags are highly correlated with each other, only those with maximal correlation coefficient were used to construct the model [

In this study, a quasi-Poisson model was applied to allow for over-dispersion of the data. Model selection was based on the lowest generalized cross validation (GCV) scores.
