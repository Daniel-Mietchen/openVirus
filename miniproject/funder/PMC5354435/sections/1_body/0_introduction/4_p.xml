 <xref rid="pntd.0005354.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, there has been no similar study in utilizing such data for DF prediction in China. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine whether an early warning model utilizing internet-based dengue query data can improve DF prediction.
