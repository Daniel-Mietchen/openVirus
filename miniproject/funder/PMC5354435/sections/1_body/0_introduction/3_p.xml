<p>Over the past decade the increasing number of internet users around the world has provided new sources of data potentially useful for disease surveillance. This is increasingly being recognized as an opportunity to improve traditional disease surveillance systems [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005354.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, use of GFT data is not without its problems. For example, studies found that the surveillance data did not correspond with estimates provided by the GFT model in the US during the 2009 pandemic and the 2012/2013 epidemic season [
