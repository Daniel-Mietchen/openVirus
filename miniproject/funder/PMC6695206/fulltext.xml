The mechanism underlying the genotype replacement remains unclear. Therefore, we focused our current study on investigating the roles of mosquito vector and amplifying host(s) in JEV genotype replacement by comparing the replication ability of GI and GIII viruses. GI and GIII viruses had similar infection rates and replicated to similar viral titers after blood meal feedings in <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic>. However, GI virus yielded a higher viral titer in amplifying host-derived cells, especially at an elevated temperature, and produced an earlier and higher viremia in experimentally inoculated pigs, ducklings, and young chickens. Subsequently we identified the amplification advantage of viral genetic determinants from GI viruses by utilizing chimeric and recombinant JEVs (rJEVs). Compared to the recombinant GIII virus (rGIII virus), we observed that both the recombinant GI virus and the chimeric rJEVs encoding GI virus-derived NS1-3 genes supported higher replication ability in amplifying hosts. The replication advantage of the chimeric rJEVs was lost after introduction of a single substitution from a GIII viral mutation (NS2B-L99V, NS3-S78A, or NS3-D177E). In addition, the gain-of-function assay further elucidated that rGIII virus encoding GI virus NS2B-V99L/NS3-A78S/E177E substitutions re-gained the enhanced replication ability. Thus, we conclude that the replication advantage of GI virus in pigs and poultry is the result of three critical NS2B/NS3 substitutions. This may lead to more efficient transmission of GI virus than GIII virus in the amplifying host-mosquito cycle.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Flaviviral vertebrate amplifying host(s), invertebrate vector(s), genetics, and environmental factors shape the viral geographical distribution and epidemic disease pattern. Newly emerging dengue virus genotypes, West Nile virus clades, or Zika virus strains exhibited an enhancement in mosquito vector competence. However, hosts and viral determinants responsible for the occurrence of JEV genotype replacement remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that emerging GI viruses with enhanced transmission potential in amplifying hosts such as pigs and avian species was encoded by three critical GI-specific mutations in NS2B/NS3 proteins. This discovery provides insight into the viral genetic mechanism underlying the GI virus advantage and adaptation in the pig/avian species-mosquito cycle. Our results also emphasize the importance of monitoring viral evolution in amplifying vertebrate hosts to clarify the role of avian species in local transmission of GI virus in JE endemic and epidemic countries.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></funding-source><award-id>MOST 103-2313-B-005-040-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2499-4807</contrib-id><name><surname>Chiou</surname><given-names>Shyan-Song</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant (MOST 103-2313-B-005-040-MY3) from Ministry of Science and Technology awarded to S.S.C.

JEV was first isolated in 1935. Since then JEV has been classified into five genotypes (GI-GV) with variant geographic distribution in Asia and Australia. Traditionally, GIII virus is the most widely distributed and dominant JEV genotype in JEV endemic/epidemic regions [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The ecological factors of GIII endemic or epidemic areas are well characterized, and the virus is maintained primarily in the <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus-</italic>amplifying host (pigs and avian species) transmission cycle, and humans and horses are accidental, dead-end hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].

We suggest that GI virus might compete with GIII virus in the same pig-mosquito cycle and exhibit a transmission advantage over areas previously dominated by GIII virus [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

In addition, the experimental evidence associated with the difference in viral genomic factor(s) does not fully support the occurrence of GIII replacement during the past 20 years [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we investigated the <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> replication characteristics of emerging GI virus and previously dominate GIII virus in <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> mosquito vector and amplifying hosts (pigs, young chickens, and ducklings). We did not include dead-end hosts in this study because of the remote possibility of the involvement of dead-end hosts in the transmission of JEV. More importantly, we constructed, generated and applied various genotypic chimeras of recombinant JEVs from infectious cDNA clones to determine the viral genetic determinants that enhanced and increased the replication efficiency of GI virus over GIII virus. These genetic determinants would be critically important for selection of viral hosts and genes to monitor GI virus activity and evolution in a natural transmission cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Replication ability of GIII and GI viruses in <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic></title><p>To analyze the growth curve of GIII and GI JEVs in mosquito-derived cells, we infected <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>-derived C6/36 cells and <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic>-derived CTR209 cells with GIII viruses (CH1392 and T1P1 strains) and GI viruses (YL2009-4 and TC2009-1 strains) at 28&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>).

All host-derived GI viruses are isolated from pigs [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, JEV can infect young domestic poultry (chickens and ducklings) which are suspected of being involved in local transmission of JEV due to viral titers being sufficiently higher than the minimum infectious dose for mosquito hosts [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Earlier or higher viremia in GI-b virus-infected birds [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and ducklings [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] suggested that a domestic avian-mosquito cycle might enhance the transmission of GI viruses.

Experimental evidence provided in our study, however, suggested that the enhancement of GI-b virus infectivity in amplifying hosts was associated with NS2B/NS3 substitutions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g008">8</xref>), especially the residues NS2B-99 and NS3-78 in the protease domain and NS3-177 in the loop connecting protease and helicase domains of NS2B/NS3 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Other substitutions such as NS2B-D65E, NS2B-A105P, NS3-N182S, or NS1/NS2A only played a minor role in improving viral fitness. The GI virus NS2B-99, NS3-78, and NS3-177 residues were also observed in GII viruses or GV viruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s012">S2 Table</xref>). This implied the substitutions associated with genotype replacement of GIII virus by GI virus and geographical distribution of the other genotypes may be different.

Moreover, flaviviral NS2B/NS3 proteins harbor multiple strategies to evade host innate immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. JEV NS2B/NS3 protease was able to cleave interferon stimulator [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This interferon antagonistic ability of JEV was critical for efficient replication and increased virulence in mice [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A novel interferon antagonist of NS1 protein has recently been identified in newly emerging Zika viruses associated with the current epidemics [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

Therefore, we hypothesize those two possible mechanisms of enhancement in viral post-entry and innate immunity antagonistic ability result in the replication advantage of GI-b virus in amplifying hosts.</p><fig id="ppat.1007992.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007992.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>The conformational location of GI virus-specific substitutions on NS2B/NS3 proteins.</title><p>(A) The homologous modeling of GI virus NS2B/NS3 proteins was carried out with SWISS-MODEL [<xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] by utilizing the template structure of MVEV NS2B/NS3 proteins (PDB: 2WV9).
