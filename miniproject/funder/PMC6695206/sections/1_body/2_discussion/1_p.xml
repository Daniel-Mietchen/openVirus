<p>Emerging GI virus has gradually replaced GIII virus as the dominant JEV isolated from human cases, stillborn piglets, and 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> since the 1990s. The mechanism of genotype replacement remains unclear, especially the role of the genetic determinants affecting the local pig-
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> transmission cycle. In this study, we identified the contribution of NS2B/NS3 mutations correlated with enhanced replication of GI virus in amplifying hosts: domestic pigs as well as in day-old chickens and two-day old ducklings. The role of 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> mosquito might be less significant in the genotype replacement.
