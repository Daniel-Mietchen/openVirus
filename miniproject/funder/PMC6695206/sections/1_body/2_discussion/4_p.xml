<p>Mutation in the NS1 protein of Zika virus and the NS3 protein of HCV has been shown to enhance viral fitness during flaviviral evolution [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Genomic sequencing and analysis has suggested that substitutions in E, NS4B, and NS5 proteins were involved in the evolutionary advantage of GI virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Experimental evidence provided in our study, however, suggested that the enhancement of GI-b virus infectivity in amplifying hosts was associated with NS2B/NS3 substitutions (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g007">7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g008">8</xref>), especially the residues NS2B-99 and NS3-78 in the protease domain and NS3-177 in the loop connecting protease and helicase domains of NS2B/NS3 proteins (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Other substitutions such as NS2B-D65E, NS2B-A105P, NS3-N182S, or NS1/NS2A only played a minor role in improving viral fitness. The GI virus NS2B-99, NS3-78, and NS3-177 residues were also observed in GII viruses or GV viruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s012">S2 Table</xref>). This implied the substitutions associated with genotype replacement of GIII virus by GI virus and geographical distribution of the other genotypes may be different. The NS2B/NS3 proteins were involved in viral RNA replication, polypeptide processing, and infectious particle assembly through enzymatic-dependent or -independent processes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Thus, the GI-b virus NS2B/NS3 substitutions may enhance viral replication at post viral entry, as supported by the observation that infectivity rates were similar between rGI and rGIII viruses in the infectious center assay (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Moreover, flaviviral NS2B/NS3 proteins harbor multiple strategies to evade host innate immunity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. JEV NS2B/NS3 protease was able to cleave interferon stimulator [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This interferon antagonistic ability of JEV was critical for efficient replication and increased virulence in mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A novel interferon antagonist of NS1 protein has recently been identified in newly emerging Zika viruses associated with the current epidemics [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In contrast to PK-15 and DF-1 cells, the virus titer (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g007">7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g008">8</xref>) and focus size (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s010">S10 Fig</xref>) had no significant influence by NS2B/NS3 substitution in interferon-deficient VERO cells, suggested that the virus titers and focus size may associate with interferon antagonism or other host factors. Therefore, we hypothesize those two possible mechanisms of enhancement in viral post-entry and innate immunity antagonistic ability result in the replication advantage of GI-b virus in amplifying hosts.
