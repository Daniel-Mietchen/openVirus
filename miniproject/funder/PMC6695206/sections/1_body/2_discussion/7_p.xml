<p>There are two limitations of the current study: the limited number of SPF pigs used to reveal the replicative advantage of GI vs. GIII viruses and the lack of analytical data to determine the viral dissemination and transmission ability in

We have no doubt that GI viruses are more efficiently transmitted in the amplifying host-mosquito cycle and have similar virulence compared to the GIII virus in human [
