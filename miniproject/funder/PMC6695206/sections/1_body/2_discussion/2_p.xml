<p>There are two geographic variants of GI JEVs: viruses from GI-a clade are mainly distributed in tropical areas of Asia and Australia [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and viruses of GI-b clade used in this study are widely distributed in southern and eastern Asia [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Previous studies have suggested that GI-a or GI-b viruses can compete with GIII for the same mosquito vector and amplifying hosts but are less likely to co-circulate in the same geographic locations [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Mosquito vectors play a critical role in the occurrence of newly emerging flavi- and alphaviruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The previous reports indicated that GI-b virus replicated to higher titer in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito-derived cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] but inconsistent results on the infectivity of GI-a, GI-b, and GIII viruses were observed in 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> is the primary mosquito vector for GI and GIII viruses and account for 93.58% and 74.22% of mosquito-derived isolates, respectively [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We used 
 <italic>in vitro Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic>-derived cells as well as 
 <italic>in vivo Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> mosquitoes to study the infectivity of GI-b and GIII viruses in the current study. Our study results indicated that both genotypes of JEV replicated to similar viral titers regardless of the assay system used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and suggested that the primary vector, 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> mosquito, for GI-b and GIII viruses is less likely to play a significant role in the genotype replacement of GIII to GI-b.
