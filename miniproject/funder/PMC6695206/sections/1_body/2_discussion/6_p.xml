<p>The study of GI-a and GIII virus infectivity in 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> were inconsistent in previous studies [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The NS2B-99, NS3-78, and NS3-177 residues were conserved in GI-a and GI-b viruses but additional substitutions were identified on E-141, NS2A-105, and NS5-438. Thus, the virological factors underlying the replacement of GIII virus by GI-a virus may require re-evaluation of viral replication ability in both 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and amplifying hosts using dominant, circulating GI-a isolates in the future.
