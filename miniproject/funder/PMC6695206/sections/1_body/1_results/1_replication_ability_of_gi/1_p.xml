<p>To analyze the growth curve of GIII and GI JEVs in mosquito-derived cells, we infected 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>-derived C6/36 cells and 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic>-derived CTR209 cells with GIII viruses (CH1392 and T1P1 strains) and GI viruses (YL2009-4 and TC2009-1 strains) at 28°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). The growth curves and virus titers from GI and GIII-infected C6/36 cells were similar with no statistical significance between them during a 60-hour infection period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In CTR209 cells, the growth curves were statistically non-significant differences (p&gt;0.05) between genotypes; although, GI YL2009-4 virus was less efficient and generated an average of 1.61–2.21 log lower viral titer than GIII-CH1392 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). In addition, comparable ratios of viral NS3 proteins to α-tubulin were detected in GIII and GI virus-infected C6/36 and CTR209 cells at 48 hours post-infection (HPI) (

 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, we further compared GIII to GI viruses in CTR209 cells at an elevated temperature. When the temperature was increased to 34°C, similar titers for both GIII and GI viruses were observed even though higher relative intensity of NS3 proteins from GI viruses was detected in CTR209 cells (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s001">S1C and S1F Fig</xref>). This suggested GIII and GI viruses might have different efficiency to generate infectious particle [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in infected CTR209 cells. In addition, the viability of GIII and GI virus-infected CTR209 cells was non-significantly different at 28°C and 34°C (
