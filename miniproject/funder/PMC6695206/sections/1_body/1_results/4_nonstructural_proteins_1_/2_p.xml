<p>Conversely, we investigated the influence of the replication ability of GIII virus- derived NS1-5 and NS1-3 proteins on the rGI backbone for amplification in host-derived cells. The chimeric clones pCMV GI/GIII NS1-5 and pCMV GI/GIII NS1-3 were constructed to produce rGI/GIII NS1-5 and rGI/GIII NS1-3 viruses as described above (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). The recombinant viruses yielded similar titers compared to rGIII virus but produced significantly lower titers than rGI virus in VERO, PK-15, and DF-1 cells at 41°C (p&lt; 0.05) (
