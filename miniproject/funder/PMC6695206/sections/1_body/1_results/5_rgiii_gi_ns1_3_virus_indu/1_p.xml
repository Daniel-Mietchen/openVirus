<p>To verify the role of NS1-3 genes 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we compared the replication ability of rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus to rGIII virus by subcutaneously inoculating 10
 <sup>7</sup> ffu and 10
 <sup>4</sup> ffu of the viruses into ten-week old SPF pigs and 1-day old chickens, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The rGIII and rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus-infected pigs developed viremia with an average titer of 10
 <sup>2.45</sup> and 10
 <sup>3.05</sup> ffu/m at 2 DPI. The following day, rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus-infected pigs reached peak viremia but no viremia was detected in rGIII virus-inoculated pigs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). This difference was also observed in the plasma viral RNA collected from the infected pigs at 2 DPI (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). These results highlighted the higher and extended viremia in rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus-infected pigs compared to rGIII virus-infected pigs. In addition, we also observed that rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus induced significantly higher viremia and RNAemia in chickens with 5-fold and 6-fold increases in viral titer and viral RNA compared to rGIII virus (p&lt; 0.05) at 60 HPI, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). These results further suggest that the major viral determinants for the enhancement of GI virus infectivity in pigs and chickens were located on NS1-3 proteins.
