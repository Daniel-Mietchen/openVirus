<p>To evaluate the role of amplifying hosts in genotype replacement, we compared the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> replicative ability of GIII CH1392 and T1P1 strains to GI YL2009-4 and TC2009-1 strains in pig- and poultry-derived cells (PK-15, DF-1, CER, and DE cells) and primate-derived control cells (VERO cells) at 37°C (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). A similar growth curve of GIII and GI viruses was observed in VERO cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g003">Fig 3A</xref>); in contrast, GI YL2009-4 and TC2009-1 viruses produced 1–2 -log higher viral titers than GIII CH1392 and T1P1 viruses in PK-15 cells at 24 and 36 HPI (p&lt; 0.05) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007992.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). In poultry-derived cells (DF-1, CER, DE cells), two GI viruses and GIII CH1392 virus replicated to similar viral titers but their viral titers were higher than GIII T1P1 virus (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). Natural amplifying hosts for JEV have a higher body temperature of 40–44°C in avian species and 38–40°C in pigs. In pigs, fever can be as high as 41°C following JEV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, we inoculated JEVs into VERO, PK-15, and poultry-derived cells (DF-1, CER, DE cells) and analyzed viral replication at 41°C. Interestingly, as the temperature increased, the overall viral titers of GI viruses were significantly higher than GIII viruses in amplifying host-derived cells and at the single time point of 36 HPI in VERO cells (p&lt; 0.05) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s003">S3C and S3D Fig</xref>). An apparently higher relative intensity of NS3 proteins was also observed at 48 HPI in GI virus-infected PK-15 and DF-1 cells but not in VERO cells at 41°C (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007992.s001">S1G–S1L Fig</xref>). However, the ratio of NS3 to β-actin was inconsistent with extracellular infectious particles in the GIII virus-infected DF-1 cells. This suggested two GIII viruses might have different efficiency to generate infectious particle [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in infected DF-1 cells.
