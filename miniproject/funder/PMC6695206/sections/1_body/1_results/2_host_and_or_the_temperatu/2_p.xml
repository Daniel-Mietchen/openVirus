<p>The higher thermal stability at elevated temperature for GI viruses could be a contributing factor related to enhancement of viral replication of GI viruses. To determine the influence of viral thermal stability, we incubated equal amounts of GIII and GI viruses at 37°C and 41°C, and examined residual viral titers at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours post-treatment (HPT) (

Besides, there was no genotypic difference on cell viability (VERO, PK-15, and DF-1) after GIII and GI virus infection except lower viability of GI virus-infected PK-15 cells, producing higher viral tier, at 41°C at 60 HPI (p&lt; 0.05) (
