<p>To verify the specific substitution(s) of GI NS1-3 proteins involved in the enhancement of GI replication, we conducted a loss-of-function experiment by introduction of a single GIII virus-specific and highly consensus substitution for NS1-3 proteins of the rGIII/GI NS1-3 chimeric virus instead of the rGI virus (

The influence of these substitutions on the replication ability of rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus was evaluated in C6/36 cells at 28°C or in VERO, PK-15, and DF-1 cells at 41°C. As expected, the replication advantage of the rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus was consistently observed in PK-15 and DF-1 cells but not in C6/36 and VERO cells as compared to the rGIII virus at 48 HPI (Figs

However, the enhanced replication of the rGIII/GI NS1-3 virus was significantly reduced after the introduction of three single-substitutions (NS3-S78A, NS3-P105A, or NS3-D177E) in PK-15 cells (p&lt; 0.05) and five single-substitutions (NS2A-I6V, NS2A-T149S, NS2B-L99V, NS3-S78A, or NS3-D177E) in DF-1 cells (p&lt;0.05), respectively. The NS2A-R187K substitution had a minor effect on viral titer in both cell lines (p&gt; 0.05) (
