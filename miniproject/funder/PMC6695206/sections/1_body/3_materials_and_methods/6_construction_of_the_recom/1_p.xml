<p>The infectious clone encoding the full genome of GIII JE RP9 virus was constructed using pBR322 plasmid and referred to as pCMV GIII (kindly provided by Dr. Yi-Ling Lin from Academic Sinica, Taiwan) in this study. JEV viral RNA was transcribed by CMV promoter and terminated by SV40 poly-A terminator. The precise JEV 3’ terminal sequence was generated by a ribozyme sequence of hepatitis delta virus (HDVr) incorporated right after the 3’UTR of JEV (5). To construct GIII and GI JEV chimeric infectious clones, we replaced five genetic fragments or the complete viral genome of pCMV GIII with the corresponding genes of GI JE YL2009-4 virus by blunt-end ligation with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs) to generate six recombinant viruses (rGI, rGIII/GI UTR, rGIII/GI C-E, rGIII/GI NS1-5, rGIII/GI NS1-3 and rGIII/GI NS4-5). We replaced the pCMV GI infectious cDNA clone with the corresponding gene fragment of GIII virus using the protocol of Gibson assembly reaction (New England Biolabs) and generated two additional recombinant viruses, rGI/GIII NS1-5 and rGI/GIII NS1-3 (
