<p>BHK-21 cells were seeded into 12-well plates and grown at 37°C overnight. The next day, the mixture of 1 μg of the infectious clone and Opti-MEM (Life Technologies) was added into a mixture of Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) and Opti-MEM, and then the final mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes. Next the mixture was added onto the 80% confluent cells for five hours at 37°C, and then replaced with the culture medium. After a 3- to 4-day incubation, the production of rJEVs was detected in the transfected cells by an immunofluorescence assay utilizing mouse anti-JEV NS1 antibody (provided by Dr. Yi-Ling Lin from Academic Sinica, Taiwan). The recombinant viruses secreted from transfected cells were harvested and subsequently amplified in C6/36 cells. Virus plaques were identified by plaque assay. The viral RNA was extracted from virus-infected C6/36 cells with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), and transcribed into cDNA with the JEV 3’UTR primer 5’-AGATCCTGTGTTCTTCCTCA-3’ using the Superscript III transcription reaction (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The complete genome of recombinant virus was confirmed by sequencing the PCR products amplified from the viral cDNA template.</p>
