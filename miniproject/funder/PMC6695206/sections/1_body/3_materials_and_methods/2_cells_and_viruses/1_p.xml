 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) and in VP12 medium [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007992.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] supplemented with 10% FBS, respectively. Porcine kidney cells (PK-15, provided by Dr. Chienjin Huang from NCHU, Taiwan), chicken embryo fibroblast cells (DF-1, provided by Dr. Shan-Chia Ou from NCHU, Taiwan), chicken embryo related cells (CER) and duck embryo cells (DE and CER, provided by Dr. Poa-Chun Chang from NCHU, Taiwan), and monkey kidney cells (VERO, provided by Dr. Gwong-Jen J. Chang from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States of America) were all grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS except for VERO cells with 5% FBS. Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21, provided by Dr. Wei-June Chen from Chang Gung University (CCU), Taiwan) were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS. Mosquito cells or mammalian cells were maintained in incubators supplied with 5% CO

GIII subcluster II JE CH1392 and T1P1 viruses (provided by Dr. Wei-June Chen from CCU, Taiwan), and GI-b subcluster II JE YL2009-4 and subcluster I TC2009-1 viruses (from an already-existing collection in our lab) were used in this study. JEV strains CH1392, YL2009-4, and TC2009-1 were isolated from pools of field-captured
