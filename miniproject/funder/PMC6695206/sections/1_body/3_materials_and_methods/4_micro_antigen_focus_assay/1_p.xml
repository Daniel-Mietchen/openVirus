<p>The micro-antigen focus assay was used to determine viral titers in the supernatants of infected cells, in the plasma recovered from infected animals, or in the supernatants of homogenized mosquitoes. Briefly, VERO cells were seeded in to 96-well plates at a cell count of 2.25×10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/100 μL/well and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> overnight to allow a cell monolayer to form. The serially diluted samples were added into wells for one hour at 37°C. Infected VERO cells were overlayed with 1% methylcellulose mixed with DMEM medium supplemented with 2% FBS, and incubated at 37°C for 32 to 36 hours. The methylcellulose overlays were discarded by washing with 1X PBS, and the infected VERO monolayers were fixed with 75% acetone in PBS for 20 minutes. The fixed cells were air-dried and stained with mouse anti-JEV polyclonal antibody (provided by Dr. Gwong-Jen J. Chang from CDC, USA), followed by staining with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The foci were developed after the addition of Vector-VIP (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) into each well. The viral titer was calculated by the average number of foci-forming unit (ffu) per ml or per mosquito.
