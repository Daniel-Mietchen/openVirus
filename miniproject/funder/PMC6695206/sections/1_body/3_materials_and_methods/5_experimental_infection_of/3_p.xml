<p>Eighty 1-day old chickens (16 per viral group) and eighty 2-day old ducklings (16 per viral group) were subcutaneously inoculated with one dose of PBS or 10
 <sup>4</sup> ffu of GIII CH1392 virus, GIII T1P1 virus, GI YL2009-4 virus, or GI TC2009-1 virus. The daily activity and clinical signs of infection for chickens and ducks were monitored after JEV infection. We collected blood from four infected chickens or ducklings 1 day prior to infection and at 1, 2, 4, and 6 DPI. Plasma was mixed with anticoagulant at a final concentration of 0.33% sodium citrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.85% sodium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich), and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 15 minutes. The ten-fold diluted plasma was recovered from the supernatant and stored at −80°C until used.
