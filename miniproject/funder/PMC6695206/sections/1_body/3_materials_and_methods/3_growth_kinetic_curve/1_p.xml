<p>JEVs or rJEVs were inoculated onto C6/36, CTR209, PK-15, DF-1, CER, DE, and VERO cells at an MOI of 0.5 at 28°C for mosquito cells and at 37°C for mammalian cells. Infected cells were washed three times with 1X PBS after a one-hour incubation, and then subsequently incubated at 28°C or 34°C for mosquito cells and at 37°C or 41°C for mammalian cells. The supernatants from infected cells were collected and stored at −80°C until used. All experiments were conducted in triplicate, and the viral titers in the supernatants were determined by the micro-antigen focus assay.</p>
