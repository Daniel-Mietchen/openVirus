<p>In this study, we investigated the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> replication characteristics of emerging GI virus and previously dominate GIII virus in 
 <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> mosquito vector and amplifying hosts (pigs, young chickens, and ducklings). We did not include dead-end hosts in this study because of the remote possibility of the involvement of dead-end hosts in the transmission of JEV. More importantly, we constructed, generated and applied various genotypic chimeras of recombinant JEVs from infectious cDNA clones to determine the viral genetic determinants that enhanced and increased the replication efficiency of GI virus over GIII virus. These genetic determinants would be critically important for selection of viral hosts and genes to monitor GI virus activity and evolution in a natural transmission cycle.
