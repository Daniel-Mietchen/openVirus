  <title>Effect of introduction of GIII virus-specific NS2B/NS3 substitutions into GI virus.</title>
  <p>(A) The schematic diagram shows the location of sixteen GIII virus-specific substitutions on NS1-3 proteins. (B-E) The sixteen mutant rGIII/ GI NS1-3 viruses encoding single NS1, NS2A, NS2B, or NS3 substitutions are respectively colored with orange, purple, green, and blue. The rGIII and rGIII/ GI NS1-3 virus controls are shown colored with white and yellow. These rJEVs were infected into C6/36 (B), VERO (C), PK-15 (D), and DF-1 (E) cells at 0.5 MOI and replicated at 28°C (C6/36) or 41°C (VERO, PK-15, and DF-1). The viral titer in each supernatant was detected at 48 HPI by micro-antigen focus assay. Mean with SEM for the triplicate samples is shown. (F) 10
   <sup>4</sup> ffu of the selected rJEVs were subcutaneously inoculated into one-day old chickens (n = 6 per group). The viral titer in collected plasma was detected at 60 HPI and measured by micro-antigen focus assay. A horizontal dot line represents an individual animal and mean of a group respectively. Error bars indicate SEM. A horizontal dot line indicates the detection limit. The statistical analysis was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s Multiple Comparison Test utilizing rGIII/ GI NS1-3 virus as a control. A significant difference is indicated by an asterisk (B-E) or shown as a red dot (F) (P&lt; 0.05).
