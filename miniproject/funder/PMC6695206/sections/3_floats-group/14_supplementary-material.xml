  <title>Comparison of RNAemia in experimentally-infected pigs and poultry using GI and GIII JEVs.</title>
  <p>(A-C) The viral RNA in the plasma of JEV-infected pigs (A), chickens (B), and ducklings (C) was measured by real-time RT-PCR at 2 DPI. The detection limit is indicated as a dotted line. A dot plus a horizontal line represents an individual animal and a mean RNA-copy number of the group, respectively. The statistics comparing either two or four viruses were determined by a Student’s two-tailed 
   <italic>t</italic>-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey’s Multiple Comparison Test. The statistical difference is noted by an asterisk (P&lt; 0.05).
