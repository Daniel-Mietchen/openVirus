  <title>The indistinguishable infectivity of GIII and GI JEVs in 
   <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic>.
  </title>
  <p>Female 
   <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> mosquitoes (n = 12 per group) were fed with the pig blood meal mixed with 8×10
   <sup>6</sup> ffu/ml of JEVs (CH1392, T1P1, YL2009-4, or TC2009-1). (A) The viral infection rate was calculated by the number of JEV-positive mosquitoes divided by the number of feeding mosquitoes. (B) The viral titer (ffu) for each whole mosquito body was detected by micro-antigen focus assay at 14 days post-feeding. Each dot represents an individual mosquito. The mean value is shown as a horizontal line. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey’s Multiple Comparison Test.
