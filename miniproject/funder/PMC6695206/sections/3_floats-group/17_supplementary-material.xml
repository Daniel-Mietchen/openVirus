  <title>The NS2B/NS3 substitutions influence the development of RNAeima in rJEV-infected chickens.</title>
  <p>(A and B) The viral RNA in collected plasma was detected at 60 HPI (A) or 48 HPI (B) and measured by real-time RT-PCR. A horizontal dot line represents an individual animal and mean of a group respectively. Error bars indicate SEM. A horizontal dot line indicates the detection limit. The statistical analysis was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnettâ€™s Multiple Comparison Test utilizing rGIII/ GI NS1-3 virus (A) or rGIII virus (B) as a control. A significant difference is showed as a red dot (P&lt; 0.05).</p>
