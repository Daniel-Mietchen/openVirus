  <title>Western blot analysis of viral NS3 protein in JEV-infected cells.</title>
  <p>(A-L) The cell lysates of JEV-infected C6/36 cells at 28°C (A and D), CTR cells at 28°C (B and E) or at 34°C (C and F), VERO (G and J), PK-15 (H and K), and DF-1 (I and L) cells at 41°C were collected at 48 HPI. The viral NS3 protein and cellular α-tubulin or β-actin were detected by Western blot using mouse anti-NS3 protein, anti-α-tubulin or anti-β-actin antibodies. (D-F and J-L) The ratio of band intensity (NS3/α-tubulin) or (NS3/β-actin) was estimated by ImageJ version 1.44 with Mean and SEM calculated from triplicates. The difference in relative intensity was calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by Turkey’s Multiple Comparison Test. A significant difference is indicated by an asterisk (P&lt; 0.05).</p>
