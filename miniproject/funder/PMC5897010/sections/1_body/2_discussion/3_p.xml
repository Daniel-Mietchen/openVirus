<p>While the susceptibility of a novel host is correlated to its relatedness to the pathogensâ€™ original host, it is also common to find exceptions to this pattern. This is seen both in nature when pathogens shift between very distant hosts [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and in laboratory cross-infection experiments [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This pattern is also seen in our data where we also observe parallel genetic changes occurring between more distantly related hosts. For example, a mutation at position 8072 was not only near fixation in most of the lineages infecting two closely related species, but also occurred at a high frequency in replicate lineages in a phylogenetically distant host (
