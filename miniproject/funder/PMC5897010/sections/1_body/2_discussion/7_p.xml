<p>In conclusion, we have found that host relatedness can be important in determining how viruses evolve when they find themselves in a new host. This study suggests that while some genetic changes will be found only in specific hosts, we frequently see the same changes occurring in closely related host species. These phylogenetic patterns suggest that mutations that adapt a virus to one host may also adapt it to closely related host species. Therefore, there may be a knock-on effect, where a host shift leaves closely related species vulnerable to the new disease.</p>
