<p>The function of these mutations is unknown, but in other systems adaptations after host shifts have been found to enhance the ability of the virus to bind to host receptors [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], increase replication rates [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or avoid the host immune response [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Of the high frequency significant SNPs (shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006951.g001">Fig 1</xref> with red asterisk) nine occur in the non-structural proteins (ORF1: RNA dependant RNA polymerase, the putative protease and helicase proteins), and eleven occur in the capsid proteins (ORF2). Interestingly, none were in DCV-1A, which suppresses the host antiviral RNAi defences [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. It will be of interest to examine the functions of the parallel mutations we detected, and characterise phenotypically how they affect viral infectivity and replication.
