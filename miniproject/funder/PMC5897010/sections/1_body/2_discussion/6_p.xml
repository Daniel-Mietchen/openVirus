<p>Previous studies have elegantly demonstrated parallel evolution following host shifts (eg [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). However, these are often in cell culture, and so do not reflect the heterogeneity of tissue and cell types in whole animals that occur in studies 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (although see [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] that suggests otherwise). The complex nature of different tissue types 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> coupled with a limited number of generations may explain why some parallel SNPs have remained at a low frequency in this study. Following a host shift, viruses must sometimes acquire specific mutations that allow them to be transmitted in their new host [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As we artificially inoculated the virus, this aspect of adaptation to a new host is missing from our study.
