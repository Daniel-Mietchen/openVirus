<p>Phylogenetic patterns of host adaptation may in part explain why pathogens tend to be more likely to jump between closely related host species. This pattern is seen in nature, where host shifts tend to occur most frequently between closely related hosts, and in laboratory cross-infection studies, where viruses tend to replicate more rapidly when the new host is related to the pathogens natural host [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For example, in a large cross-infection experiment involving Drosophila sigma viruses (Rhabdoviridae) isolated from different species of

 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This suggests that these viruses had acquired adaptations to their host species that benefitted them when they infected closely related species. Our results demonstrate that this pattern is apparent at the level of specific nucleotides, and can arise very shortly after a host shift.
