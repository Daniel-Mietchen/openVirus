<p>When a pathogen infects a novel host species, it finds itself in a new environment to which it must adapt [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. When DCV was passaged through different species of Drosophilidae, we found the same genetic changes arose repeatedly in replicate viral lineages in the same host species. Such repeatable parallel genetic changes to the same host environment are compelling evidence that these changes are adaptive [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We then examined whether these same genetic changes might occur in closely related host species, as these are likely to present a similar environment for the virus. We found that viruses evolved in closely related hosts were more similar to each other than viruses that evolved in more distantly related species. Therefore, mutations that evolve in one host species frequently arise when the virus infects closely related hosts. This finding of parallel genetic changes in closely related host species suggests that when a virus adapts to one host it might also become better adapted to closely related host species.
