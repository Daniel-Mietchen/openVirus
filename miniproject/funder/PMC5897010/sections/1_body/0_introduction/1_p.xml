<p>Host shifts–where a pathogen jumps into and establishes in a new host species–are a major source of emerging infectious diseases. RNA viruses seem particularly prone to host shift [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These adaptations may allow a pathogen to enter host cells, increase replication rates, avoid or suppress the host immune response, or optimise virulence or transmission [

For example, in the 2013–2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa, a mutation in the viral glycoprotein gene that arose early in the outbreak and rose to high frequency was found to increase infectivity in human cells and decrease infectivity in bats, which are thought to be the source of Ebola virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Likewise, a switch of a parvovirus from cats to dogs resulted in mutations in the virus capsid that allowed the virus to bind to cell receptors in dogs, but resulted in the virus losing its ability to infect cats [
