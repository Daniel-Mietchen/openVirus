<p>The host phylogeny is important for determining a pathogens ability to infect a novel host, with pathogens tending to replicate most efficiently when they infect a novel host that is closely related to their original host [

We experimentally evolved replicate lineages of an RNA virus called Drosophila C Virus (DCV; Discistroviridae) in 19 species of Drosophilidae that vary in their relatedness and shared a common ancestor approximately 40 million years ago [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We then sequenced the genomes of the evolved viral lineages and tested whether the same genetic changes arose when the virus was evolved in closely related host species.
