<p>In some instances adaptation to a novel host relies on specific mutations that arise repeatedly whenever a pathogen switches to a given host. For example, in the jump of HIV-1 from chimps to humans, codon 30 of the 
 <italic>gag</italic> gene has undergone a change that increases virus replication in humans, and this has occurred independently in all three HIV-1 lineages [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similarly, five parallel mutations have been observed in the two independent epidemics of SARS coronavirus following its jump from palm civets into humans [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similar patterns have been seen in experimental evolution studies, where parallel genetic changes occur repeatedly when replicate viral lineages adapt to a new host species in the lab. For example, when Vesicular Stomatitis Virus was passaged in human or dog cells, the virus evolved parallel mutations when evolved on the same cell type [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Likewise, a study passaging Tobacco Etch Potyvirus on four plant species found parallel mutations occurred only when the virus infected the same host species [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These parallel mutations provide compelling evidence that these genetic changes are adaptive, with the same mutations evolving independently in response to natural selection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These studies have only used a limited number of hosts, and so do not provide information on how viral evolution occurs across a wide phylogenetic breadth of host species.
