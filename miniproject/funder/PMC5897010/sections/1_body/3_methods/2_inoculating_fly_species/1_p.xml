<p>We passaged the virus through 19 species of Drosophilidae, with 6–10 independent replicate passages for each species. We selected species from across the phylogeny (that shared a common ancestor approximately 40 million years ago [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]), but included clades of closely related species that recently shared common ancestors less than 5 million years ago (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006951.g001">Fig 1</xref>). All fly stocks were reared at 22°C. Stocks of each fly species were kept in 250ml bottles at staggered ages. Flies were collected and sexed, and males were placed on cornmeal medium for 4 days before inoculation. Details of the fly stocks used can be found in the supplementary materials.
