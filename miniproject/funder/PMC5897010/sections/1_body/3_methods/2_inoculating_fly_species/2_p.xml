<p>4–11 day old males were infected with DCV using a 0.0125 mm diameter stainless steel needle (26002–10, Fine Science Tools, CA, USA) dipped in DCV solution. For the first passage this was the cloned DCV isolate in cell culture supernatant (described above), and then subsequently was the virus extracted from the previous passage (described below). The needle was pricked into the pleural suture on the thorax of flies, towards the midcoxa. Each replicate was infected using a new needle and strict general cleaning procedures were used to minimise any risk of cross-contamination between replicates. Species were collected and inoculated in a randomised order each passage. Flies were then placed into vials of cornmeal medium and kept at 22°C and 70% relative humidity. Flies were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen 3 days post-infection, homogenised in Ringer’s solution (2.5μl per fly) and then centrifuged at 12,000g for 10 mins at 4°C. The resulting supernatant was removed and frozen at -80°C to be used for infecting flies in the subsequent passage. The remaining homogenate was preserved in Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and stored at -80°C for RNA extraction. The 3 day viral incubation period was chosen based on time course and pilot data showing that viral load reaches a maximum at approximately 3 days post-infection. This process was repeated for 10 passages for all species, except

Experimental evolution studies in different tissue types have seen clear signals of adaptation in 100 virus generations [

 <sub>2</sub> change in RNA viral load we estimate that we have passaged DCV for approximately 100–200 generations.
