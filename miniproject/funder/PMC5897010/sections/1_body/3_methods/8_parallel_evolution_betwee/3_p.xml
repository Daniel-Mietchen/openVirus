<p>To test whether there were systematic differences in the types of mutations occurring in the different host species, we classified all the SNPs into the six possible types (A/G, A/T, A/C, G/T, G/C and C/T). We then counted the number of times each type of SNP arose in each host species at a frequency above 5% and in at least one biological replicate (SNPs in multiple biological replicates were only counted once). This resulted in a contingency table with 6 columns and 19 rows. We tested for differences between the species in the relative frequency of the 6 SNP types by simulation [
