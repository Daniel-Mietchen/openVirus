<p>We confirmed there was no relationship between rates of molecular evolution (SNP frequency) and either genetic distance from the host DCV was isolated from (

 <italic>melanogaster</italic>) or estimated viral population size (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006951.s001">supplementary S1 and S2 Figs</xref>) using generalised linear mixed models that include the phylogeny as a random effect in the MCMCglmm package in R [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We also examined the distribution of SNPs and whether they were synonymous or non-synonymous (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006951.s001">supplementary results</xref>).
