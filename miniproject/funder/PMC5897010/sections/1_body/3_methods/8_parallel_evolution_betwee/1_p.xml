<p>We next examined whether viral lineages that had evolved in different fly species tended to be more similar if the fly species were more closely related. Considering all pairs of viral lineages from different host species, we correlated pairwise 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ST</italic>
 </sub> with the genetic distance between the fly species. To test the significance of this correlation, we permuted the fly species over the 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> phylogeny and recalculated the Pearson correlation coefficient. This was repeated 1000 times to generate a null distribution of the test statistic, and this was then compared to the observed value. To identify individual SNPs whose frequencies were correlated with the genetic distance between hosts we repeated this procedure separately for each SNP.
