<p>After passaging the virus, we sequenced evolved viral lineages from 19 host species, with a mean of 9 independent replicate lineages of the virus per species (range 6–10 replicates). cDNA was synthesised using Invitrogen Superscript III reverse-transcriptase with random hexamer primers (25°C 5mins, 50°C 50mins, 70°C 15mins). The genome of the evolved viruses, along with the initial DCV ancestor (x5) were then amplified using Q5 high fidelity polymerase (NEB) in nine overlapping PCR reactions (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006951.s001">supplementary Table S2</xref> for PCR primers and cycle conditions). Primers covered position 62-9050bp (8989bp) of the Genbank refseq (NC_001834.1) giving 97% coverage of the genome. PCRs of individual genomes were pooled and purified with Ampure XP beads (Agencourt). Individual Nextera XT libraries (Illumina) were prepared for each viral lineage. In total we sequenced 173 DCV pooled amplicon libraries on an Illumina MiSeq (Cambridge Genomic Service) v3 for 600 cycles to give 300bp paired-end reads.
