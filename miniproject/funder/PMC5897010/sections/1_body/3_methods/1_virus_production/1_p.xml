<p>DCV is a positive sense RNA virus in the family Discistroviridae that was isolated from 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>melanogaster</italic>, which it naturally infects in the wild [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. To minimise the amount of genetic variation in the DCV isolate we used to initiate the experimental evolution study, we aimed to isolate single infectious clones of DCV using a serial dilution procedure. DCV was produced in Schneider’s Drosophila line 2 (DL2) cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] as described in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Cells were cultured at 25°C in Schneider’s Drosophila Medium with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all Invitrogen, UK). The DCV strain used was isolated from 
 <italic>D</italic>. 
 <italic>melanogaster</italic> collected in Charolles, France [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. DL2 cells were seeded into two 96-well tissue culture plates at approximately 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells in 100 μl of media per well. Cells were allowed to adhere to the plates by incubating at 25°C for five hours or over-night. Serial 1:1 dilutions of DCV were made in complete Schneider’s media, giving a range of final dilutions from 1:10
 <sup>8</sup>–1:4x10
 <sup>14</sup>. 100 μl of these dilutions were then added to the cells and incubated for 7 days, 8 replicates were made for each DCV dilution. Each well was then examined for DCV infection of the DL2 cells, and a well was scored as positive for DCV infection if clear cytopathic effects were present in the majority of the cells. The media was taken from the wells with the greatest dilution factor that were scored as infected with DCV and stored at -80°C. This processes was then repeated using the DCV samples from the first dilution series. One clone, B6A, was selected for amplification and grown in cell culture as described above. Media containing DCV was removed and centrifuged at 3000 x g for 5 minutes at 4°C to pellet any remaining cell debris, before being aliquoted and stored at -80°C. The Tissue Culture Infective Dose 50 (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of the DCV was 6.32 x 10
 <sup>9</sup> infectious particles per ml using the Reed-Muench end-point method [
