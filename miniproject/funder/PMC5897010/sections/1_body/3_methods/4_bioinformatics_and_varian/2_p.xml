<p>To generate a reference ancestral Drosophila C Virus sequence we amplified the ancestral starting virus by PCR as above. PCR products were treated with exonuclease 1 and Antarctic phosphatase to remove unused PCR primers and dNTPs and then sequenced directly using BigDye reagents (ABI) on an ABI 3730 capillary sequencer in both directions (Source Bioscience, Cambridge, UK). Sequences were edited in Sequencher (version 4.8; Gene Codes), and were manually checked for errors. Fastq reads were independently aligned to this reference sequence (Genbank accession: MG570143) using BWA-MEM, version 0.7.10 {Li, 2009 #1605} with default options with exception of the parameterâ€“M, which marks shorter split hits as secondary. 99.5% of reads had mapping phred quality scores of &gt;60. The generated SAM files were converted to their binary format (BAM) and sorted by their leftmost coordinates with SAMtools, version 0.1.19 (website:
