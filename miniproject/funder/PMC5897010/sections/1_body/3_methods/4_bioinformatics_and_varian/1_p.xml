<p>FastQC, version 0.11.2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] was used to assess read quality and primer contamination. Trimmomatic, version 0.32 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] was used to removed low quality bases and adaptor sequences, using the following options: MINLEN = 30 (Drop the read if it is below 30 base pairs), TRAILING = 15 (cut bases of the end of the read if below a threshold quality of 15), SLIDINGWINDOW = 4:20 (perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within a 4bp window falls below a threshold of 20), and ILLUMINACLIP = TruSeq3-PE.fa:2:20:10:1:true (remove adapter contamination; the values correspond in order to: input fasta file with adapter sequences to be matched, seed mismatches, palindrome clip threshold, simple clip threshold, minimum adapter length and logical value to keep both reads in case of read-through being detected in paired reads by palindrome mode).
