<p>The variant calling was then performed for each individual BAM using UnifiedGenotyper tool from GATK, version 3.3.0. As we were interested in calling low frequency variants in our viruses, we assumed a ploidy level of 100 (-sample_ploidy:100). The other parameters were set to their defaults except—stand_call_conf:30 (minimum phred-scaled confidence threshold at which variants should be called) and—downsample_to_coverage:1000 (down-sample each sample to 1000X coverage)</p>
