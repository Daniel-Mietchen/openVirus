<p>To examine whether there had been parallel evolution among viral lineages that had evolved within the same fly species, we calculated the mean 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ST</italic>
 </sub> between lineages that had evolved in the same fly species, and compared this to the mean 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ST</italic>
 </sub> between lineages that had evolved in different fly species. We tested whether this difference was statistically significant using a permutation test. The fly species labels were randomly reassigned to the viral lineages, and we calculated the mean 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ST</italic>
 </sub> between lineages that had evolved in the same fly species. This was repeated 1000 times to generate a null distribution of the test statistic, and this was then compared to the observed value.
