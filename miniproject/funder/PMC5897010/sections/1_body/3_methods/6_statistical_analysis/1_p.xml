<p>We examined the frequency of alternate alleles (single nucleotide polymorphisms: SNPs) in five ancestral virus replicates (aliquots of the same virus stock that was used to found the evolved lineages). SNPs in these ancestral viruses may represent pre-standing genetic variation, or may be sequencing errors. We found the mean SNP frequency was 0.000923 and the highest frequency of any SNP was 0.043 across the ancestral viruses. We therefore included a SNP in our analyses if its frequency was &gt;0.05 in any of the evolved viral lineages. For all analyses we included all three alleles at triallelic sites.</p>
