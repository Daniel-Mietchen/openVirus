<p>We used a trimmed version of a phylogeny produced previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This time-based tree (where the distance from the root to the tip is equal for all taxa) was inferred using seven genes with a relaxed molecular clock model in BEAST (v1.8.0) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The tree was pruned to the 19 species used using the Ape package in R [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].
