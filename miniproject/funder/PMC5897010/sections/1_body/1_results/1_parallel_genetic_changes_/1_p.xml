<p>To examine how viruses evolve in different host species we serially passaged DCV in 19 species of Drosophilidae. In total we infected 22,095 adult flies and generated 173 independent replicate lineages (6â€“10 per host species). We deep sequenced the evolved virus genomes to generate over 740,000 300bp sequence reads from each viral lineage. Out of 8989 sites, 584 contained a SNP with a derived allele frequency &gt;0.05 in at least one viral lineage, and 84 of these were tri-allelic. None of these variants were found at an appreciable frequency in five sequencing libraries produced from the ancestral virus, indicating that they had spread though populations during the experiment (
