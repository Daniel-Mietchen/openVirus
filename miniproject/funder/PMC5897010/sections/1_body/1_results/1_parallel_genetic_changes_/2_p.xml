<p>We next examined whether the same genetic changes occur in parallel when different populations encounter the same host species. Of the 584 SNPs, 102 had derived allele frequencies &gt;0.05 in at least two viral lineages, and some had risen to high frequencies in multiple lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006951.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We estimated the genetic differentiation between viral lineages by calculating

 <sub>ST</sub>. We found that viral lineages that had evolved within the same host were genetically more similar to each other than to lineages from other host species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006951.g002">Fig 2</xref>; 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). Furthermore, we found no evidence of differences in substitution biases in the different host species (Fisher Exact Test: 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.14; see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">methods</xref>), suggesting that this pattern is not driven by changes in the types of mutations in different host species.
