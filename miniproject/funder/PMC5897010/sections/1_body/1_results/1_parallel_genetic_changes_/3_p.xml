<p>To examine the genetic basis of parallel evolution, we individually tested whether each SNP in the DCV genome showed a signature of parallel evolution among viral lineages passaged in the same host species (i.e. we repeated the analysis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006951.g002">Fig 2</xref> for each SNP). We identified 56 polymorphic sites with a significant signal of parallel evolution within the same host species (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; significantly parallel sites are shown with a red asterisk in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006951.g001">Fig 1</xref>; the false discovery rate is estimated to be 17% [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006951.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]).
