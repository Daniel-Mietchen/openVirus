<p>We investigated if viruses passaged through closely related hosts showed evidence of parallel genetic changes. We calculated 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> between all possible pairs of viral lineages that had evolved in different host species. We found that viral lineages from closely related hosts were more similar to each other than viral lineages from more distantly related hosts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006951.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). This is reflected in a significant positive relationship between virus 
 <italic>F</italic>
 <sub>ST</sub> and host genetic distance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006951.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, Permutation test: 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.15, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.002). We lacked the statistical power to identify the specific SNPs that are causing the signature of parallel evolution in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006951.g003">Fig 3</xref> (false discovery rate &gt;0.49 for all SNPs).
