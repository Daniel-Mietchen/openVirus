<p>Two of the most striking examples of parallel evolution in related species are in 
 <italic>Scaptodrosophila pattersoni</italic> and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>lebanonensis</italic>, which show two high frequency parallel mutations. These are a synonymous mutation in the 2C replicase protein at position 1901 and a triallelic non-synonymous mutation in a viral capsid protein at position 8072. However, the wider pattern of parallel evolution is not driven by these two examples, as the results remained significant after viruses that had evolved in these two species were removed from the dataset (within species parallelism: 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; between species parallelism: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.013).
