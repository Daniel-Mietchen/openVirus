  <title>Viral lineages from more closely related host species are genetically more similar.</title>
  <p>(A) The correlation between the genetic differentiation of viral lineages and the genetic distance between the species they have evolved in. Linear regression line is shown in red. Genetic distances were scaled so that the distance from the root to the tip of the tree was one. (B) Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient (
   <italic>r</italic>) of 
   <italic>F</italic>
   <sub>
    <italic>ST</italic>
   </sub> between pairs of viral lineage and the genetic distance between the host species they evolved in. The observed value is in red and the grey bars are the null distribution obtained by permutation.
