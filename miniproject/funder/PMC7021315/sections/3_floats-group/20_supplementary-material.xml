  <title>Zika virus IgG and IgM ELISA after IgG depletion of serum pools.</title>
  <p>Serum pools were depleted with protein G columns as described in Methods. (A) Zika virus IgG ELISA showing more than 99% depletion of IgG. (B) Zika virus IgM ELISA to control for loss of IgM antibodies during this procedure. Colored columns: mock depletion, empty columns: IgG depletion. The dotted line indicates the cut-off (c.o.) of the assay. Mean values were calculated from two independent experiments and error bars represent the range.</p>
