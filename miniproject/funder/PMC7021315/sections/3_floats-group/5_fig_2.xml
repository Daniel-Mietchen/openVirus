  <title>Zika virus-specific and broadly cross-reactive antibody titers of four serum pools (colored columns) and the individual serum samples of these pools (black circles).</title>
  <p>The mean values of individual sera are shown as red open circles. (A) Zika virus IgM ELISA units, (B) Rio Bravo virus IgM ELISA absorbance values (cross-reactive antibodies), (C) Zika virus IgG ELISA titers, (D) Rio Bravo virus IgG ELISA titers (cross-reactive antibodies), (E) relative Zika virus IgG avidities (%), (F) Zika virus NT
   <sub>50</sub> titers. The cut-off is indicated by a dotted line. Mean values were calculated from at least three independent experiments except panel B (two independent experiments). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM; A, C-F) or the range (B). The statistics shown in the figure refer to the pool data. Statistical comparisons of pool data and mean values of individual sera are given in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s010">S1 Table</xref>. (A, C, D, F): One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett´s test, (E): General linear model and Wald’s test. Significant differences between the naïve pool and the pre-immune pools are indicated; *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001. ZIKV, Zika virus; RBV, Rio Bravo virus; naïve, flavivirus naïve serum pool; YF+, yellow fever pre-vaccinated serum pool; TBE+, tick-borne encephalitis pre-vaccinated serum pool; YF+TBE+: yellow fever and tick-borne encephalitis pre-vaccinated serum pool.
