  <title>Analysis of the recombinant Zika virus E protein used in this study.</title>
  <p>(A) Rate zonal ultracentrifugation of untreated Zika virus E protein (red solid line), and after SDS-treatment (red dotted line). The monomeric WN virus E protein (blue solid line) served as a control. M and D indicate positions of monomers and dimers, respectively. (B) Size-exclusion chromatograms of Zika virus E (upper panel) and the monomeric WN virus E (lower panel). (C) ELISA with Zika virus E protein and EDE-specific monoclonal antibodies (C8 and C10), reacting with E dimers but not monomers [
