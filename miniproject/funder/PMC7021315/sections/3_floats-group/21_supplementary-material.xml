  <title>Zika virus IgM and IgG ELISA after IgM depletion of serum pools.</title>
  <p>Serum pools were depleted with anti-IgM agarose beads as described in Methods. (A) Zika virus IgM ELISA showing more than 99% depletion of IgM. (B) Zika virus IgG ELISA to control for loss of IgG antibodies during this procedure. Colored columns: mock depletion, empty columns: IgM depletion. The dotted line indicates the cut-off (c.o.) of the assay. Mean values were calculated from two independent experiments and error bars represent the range.</p>
