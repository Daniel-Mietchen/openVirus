  <title>Quantification of Zika virus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies and broadly cross-reactive IgG antibodies using single serum samples from Zika cases.</title>
  <p>(A) Zika virus IgM ELISA units, (B) Zika virus IgG ELISA titers, and (C) Rio Bravo virus IgG ELISA titers of individual samples are plotted against days after disease onset. Data points represent means from two to three (A) or three (B, C) independent experiments. Flavivirus pre-immune patients are color-coded in blue, flavivirus naïve patients in red. Dotted lines indicate the cut-off of each assay. The significance of differences between the extents of naïve and pre-immune antibody responses were calculated based on the maxima reached, applying a general linear model as described in Methods. p-values are indicated in the graphs. ZIKV, Zika virus; RBV, Rio Bravo virus.</p>
