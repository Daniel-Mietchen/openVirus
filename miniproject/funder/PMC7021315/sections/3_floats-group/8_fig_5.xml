  <title>Effect of IgM and IgG depletion on ADE of Zika virus infection.</title>
  <p>The four serum pools were depleted from IgM or IgG as described in Methods. Fcγ receptor-positive K562 cells were infected with Zika virus in the presence of a 1:1000 dilution of each pool, either non-depleted (non dep), IgM depleted (IgM dep), IgG depleted (IgG dep) or a reconstituted sample, i.e. a mixture of the IgM and IgG-depleted pools (mixt). Data are shown as mean values +/- SEM from three independent experiments. Dotted line indicates no enhancement of infection. Statistical comparisons (with the original and reconstituted samples) were performed by applying a GLM with linear contrasts and a Bonferroni-Holm adjustment and are indicated at the top of the figure. ns, not significant; *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001.
