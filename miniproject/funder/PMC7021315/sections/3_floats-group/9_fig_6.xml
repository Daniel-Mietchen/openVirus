  <title>Effect of depletion of cross-reactive antibodies from serum pools with Rio Bravo virus E on Zika virus antibody titers.</title>
  <p>(A) Zika virus IgG ELISA titers, (B) relative avidity of Zika virus-specific IgG, and (C) Zika virus NT
   <sub>50</sub> titers. Colored columns: mock depletion, empty columns: RB depletion. Percentages in the empty columns of (A) and (C) indicate residual ELISA reactivity and neutralizing activity after depletion, respectively. Data are shown as mean values +/- SEM from three independent experiments. The dotted line indicates the cut-off of the assay. Significant differences between mock depletion and RB depletion are indicated by asterisks (2-way ANOVA with linear contrasts); *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001. ZIKV, Zika virus; mock dep, IgM and mock-depleted serum pool; RB dep, IgM and Rio Bravo virus E-depleted serum pool.
