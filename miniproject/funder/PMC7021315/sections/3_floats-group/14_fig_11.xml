  <title>Zika and dengue virus neutralization tests using single serum samples from Zika cases.</title>
  <p>(A) Zika virus and (B) dengue virus NT
   <sub>50</sub> titers from individual serum samples were plotted against days after disease onset. Data points represent mean NT
   <sub>50</sub> titers from at least three independent experiments. Color code as in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g010">Fig 10</xref>. Dotted lines indicate the cut-off of each assay. The significance of differences between the extents of na√Øve and pre-immune antibody responses were calculated based on the maxima reached, applying a general linear model as described in Methods. p-values are indicated in the graphs. ZIKV, Zika virus; DENV1, dengue virus serotype 1.
