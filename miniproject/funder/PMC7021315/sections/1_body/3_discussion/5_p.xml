<p>Although Zika virus was not enhanced by broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies in our study, infection enhancement of this virus was readily demonstrable with Zika virus-specific antibodies at sub-neutralizing concentrations, consistent with the generally accepted ADE mechanism [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. An extremely important finding of our study is the fact that this infection enhancement can be potently suppressed by the presence of IgM antibodies (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g004">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g005">5</xref>), and this ability may be crucial in the early phase of flavivirus infections, when potentially enhancing antibodies already pre-exist or are strongly boostered. The in vivo relevance of an anti-ADE effect of IgM antibodies was recently shown in a mouse study with Zika virus, demonstrating that IgG-mediated ADE can be weakened by the presence of IgM [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Mechanistically, low-avidity Zika-virus specific IgG (as present early after infection, see also 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) might be sterically blocked by large pentameric IgM antibodies. IgM do not bind to Fcγ receptors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], and can thus prevent virus complexes from binding to Fcγ receptors.
