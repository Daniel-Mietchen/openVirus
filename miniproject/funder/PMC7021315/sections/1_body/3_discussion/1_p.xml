<p>Pre-existing cross-reactive immunity can affect the antibody response upon infection with antigenically related viruses, both with respect to the kinetics and extent of the IgM response and to the specificities of populations of IgG antibodies induced. In our study, we analyzed the effect of prior TBE and/or YF vaccination on antibody responses to primary Zika virus infections and observed a strong anamnestic response in pre-vaccinated individuals, resulting in a high proportion of broadly cross-reactive IgG antibodies that accounted for 84 to 94% of the total E-response (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), the decisive effect of pre-immunity was a change in the proportion of IgG specificities that make up the antibody populations in post-infection sera, in favor of broadly cross-reactive antibodies. It can be assumed that these antibodies react with the FL epitope, since this site comprises the only patch of amino acid residues in E that is conserved across the viruses analyzed [
