<p>The different properties of infectious Zika and dengue viruses with respect to the exposure of broadly cross-reactive epitopes are not only reflected in NTs but also in analyses of ADE of infection of FcÎ³ receptor-expressing cells (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g009">9</xref>). Like neutralization, this phenomenon requires the binding of antibodies to infectious virus particles, albeit at sub-neutralizing concentrations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Broadly cross-reactive antibodies boostered by Zika virus in the TBE and YF pre-vaccinated individuals only enhanced dengue but not Zika virus in our in vitro assays, consistent with a better accessibility of their epitopes in dengue viruses. Our data thus corroborate studies that have shown differences in conformational dynamics as well as maturation levels among different flaviviruses (and even strains of flaviviruses) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which have implications for virus neutralization and deserve further intensive research in the area of flavivirus vaccinology. It is therefore important to emphasize that the results obtained with dengue viruses (i.e. neutralization and strong ADE by cross-reactive antibodies, in contrast to Zika virus) may be biased by the specific properties of the virus strain used in the in vitro analyses. In particular, the results can be affected by a pronounced breathing behavior and partial immaturity, both of which result in a higher exposure of the conserved FL and thus may lead to an overestimation of the contribution of cross-reactive antibodies in these activities [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consistent with this notion, recent studies with dengue virus serotype 1 have shown that virus specimens taken directly from human plasma are predominantly mature (in contrast to cell culture grown virus) and are only poorly neutralized by antibodies recognizing the FL [
