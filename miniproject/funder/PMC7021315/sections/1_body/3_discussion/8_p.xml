<p>Overall, our study highlights the potential effect of flavivirus vaccine-induced pre-immunity on the patterns of antibody responses in early stages of primary infection with a distantly related flavivirus, in this case Zika virus. The modulation observed, albeit with relatively small groups (especially the YF pre-vaccinated group) of adults, includes both the primary IgM response as well as the anamnestic booster of broadly cross-reactive IgG antibodies that are capable to mediate ADE of dengue virus infections in vitro. Considering the importance of IgM for protection early after infection and its ability to block IgG-mediated ADE, further studies on these phenomena in the context of different combinations of flavivirus infections and vaccinations appear to be warranted.</p>
