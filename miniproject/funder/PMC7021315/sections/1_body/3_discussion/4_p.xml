<p>In our analyses we used a stable Zika virus E dimer (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) which has a native antigenic structure and displays quaternary, E dimer-specific epitopes ([

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Although more complex quaternary epitopes (generated by the herring-bone-like arrangement of E at the surface of mature viruses) have been identified by cryo EM analyses of Fab-virion complexes (reviewed in [
