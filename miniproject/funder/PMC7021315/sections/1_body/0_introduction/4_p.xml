<p>The immune response to primary flavivirus infections is usually characterized by a rapid rise of specific IgM antibodies, which appear to play an important protective role in the early phase of infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In sequential flavivirus infections, however, the extent of IgM antibody formation may be reduced and/or delayed [
