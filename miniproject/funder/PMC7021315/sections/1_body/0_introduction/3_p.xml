<p>The main target of flavivirus neutralizing and protective antibodies is the envelope protein E [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], which covers the surface of mature virions and forms a herringbone-like icosahedral shell [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Although the amino acid sequences of E diverge up to 60% among distantly related flaviviruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), the overall structure of this protein is similar in all instances, with an ectodomain that is connected to the transmembrane anchor via a stem region containing two or three helices (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The ectodomain consists of three individual domains (DI, DII, DIII) and forms an antiparallel homodimer (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The fusion loop (FL), located at the tip of DII (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), is the most conserved sequence element in E and therefore the major inducer of broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In ‘closed-shell’ models of flavivirus particles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), the FL appears to be buried at the dimer interface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). However, flavivirus particles were shown to exhibit dynamic motions (‘virus breathing’) that can lead to the exposure of such cryptic antigenic sites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].
