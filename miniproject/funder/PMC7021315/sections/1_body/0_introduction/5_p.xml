<p>Since the modulation of antibody responses by pre-existing immunity can have profound biological consequences, we investigated the effect of pre-existing vaccine-induced immunity on IgM and IgG profiles after recent primary Zika virus infection. For this purpose, we analyzed samples from Zika patients, who were either flavivirus naïve or had previously been vaccinated against TBE and/or YF. We demonstrate that virus-specific IgM antibodies contribute substantially to Zika virus neutralization in the early phase of infection and play an important role in the prevention of IgG-mediated enhancement of Zika virus infection of Fcγ receptor-positive cells. Importantly, the formation of IgM antibodies is reduced in individuals with pre-existing cross-reactive flavivirus immunity. Pre-vaccinated individuals displayed a strong anamnestic response of cross-reactive IgG antibodies, which caused ADE of dengue but not of Zika virus infection in vitro. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the complex interplay of antibody populations in transient early stages of flavivirus infections, which can affect the clinical outcome of infections and the efficacy of vaccines.</p>
