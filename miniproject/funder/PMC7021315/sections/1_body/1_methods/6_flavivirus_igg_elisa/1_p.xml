<p>25 ng/well strep-tagged E protein were added to Strep-Tactin-coated microplates (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany) and incubated for 1.5 h at 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH 7.4, 2% sheep serum, 2% Tween 20. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS pH 7.4, serial dilutions of samples were added and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Serial dilutions of bound human antibodies (mabs, polyclonal serum samples) were detected with goat anti-human IgG labeled with HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The starting dilution for ELISAs with single serum samples was 1:100 and that with pools 1:300. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Titers were determined by curve fitting with a four-parameter logistic regression with GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc.). A positive control serum was included on each ELISA plate. This control serum was obtained from a Zika patient with YF and TBE pre-immunity and yielded similar titration curves with Zika, RB, TBE and dengue serotype 2 virus E proteins (
