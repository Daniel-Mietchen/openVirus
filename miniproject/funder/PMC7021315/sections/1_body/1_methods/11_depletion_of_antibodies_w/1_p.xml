<p>For the depletion of Zika virus-specific or flavivirus broadly cross-reactive antibodies, 200 μg Zika or RB virus E protein were bound to Strep-Tactin XT spin columns (IBA GmbH, Göttingen, Germany), equilibrated with binding buffer (50mM NaH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0). Columns were spun down for 30 s at 700 g and the flow-through was reloaded six times. After a wash step with binding buffer, the column was equilibrated with depletion buffer (PBS pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA). Pre-diluted serum samples (1:10–1:15) were loaded onto the columns and incubated for 10 min at RT. To deplete completely Zika or RB virus-reactive antibodies a minimum of eight rounds was necessary. Depletion was verified by IgG ELISA with the respective E protein as antigen as described above. Mock depletion was performed with Strep-Tactin XT spin columns in the absence of E protein.
