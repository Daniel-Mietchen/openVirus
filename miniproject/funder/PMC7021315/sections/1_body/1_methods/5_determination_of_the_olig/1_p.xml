<p>Zika and WN virus E proteins were analyzed by rate zonal ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The monomer control for the Zika virus E protein was prepared by incubation with 1% SDS for 30 min at 65°C. 3–5 μg E protein were applied to the gradients and centrifuged for 20 h at 38,000 rpm at 15°C in a Beckman SW40 rotor. The gradients were fractionated and the amount of antigen in each fraction was quantified by ELISA using Strep-Tactin-coated plates for capturing the strep-tagged antigen and the broadly cross-reactive FL-specific monoclonal antibody (mab) A1 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] together with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-horse radish peroxidase (HRP) (Nordic Biosite). E protein was quantified using the corresponding purified protein as a standard.
