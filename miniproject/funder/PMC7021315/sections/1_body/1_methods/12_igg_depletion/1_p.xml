<p>IgG depletions were performed with Ab SpinTraps (GE Healthcare) containing Protein G Sepharose following the manufacturer’s instructions. For mock depletions, empty spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific Pierce) were loaded with Sepharose 4B beads (Sigma). Columns were equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>, pH 7.0) and centrifuged for 30 s at 100 g and 30 s at 300 g. 100 μl of 1:2 pre-diluted serum samples were loaded onto the columns and incubated for 75 min at RT under gentle shaking. The columns were then centrifuged for 30 s at 100 g. The IgG depleted eluate was collected and the column was washed twice with 75 μl binding buffer. The eluates were pooled resulting in an IgG-depleted serum with a final dilution of 1:10. Depletion was verified by the flavivirus IgG ELISA (described above), using the Zika virus E protein, and the presence of IgM in the final eluate was confirmed by Zika IgM ELISA (described above).
