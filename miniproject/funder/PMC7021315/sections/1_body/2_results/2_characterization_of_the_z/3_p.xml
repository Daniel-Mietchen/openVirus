<p>In addition, we analyzed whether our Zika E dimer is recognized by the human EDE-specific mabs C8 and C10 [

To further analyze the functional activity of polyclonal antibodies detected with the Zika virus E dimer, we depleted three of the four pools listed in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, approximately 90% or more of NT activity was removed, indicating that the dimeric Zika antigen allows the measurement of most of the functionally important antibodies.
