<p>There is evidence that the neutralizability by broadly cross-reactive antibodies can vary between different flaviviruses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We therefore analyzed the four pools before and after depletion with the RB E protein in TBE and dengue virus NTs. As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, TBE virus was only neutralized by the pools from TBE-vaccinated individuals, and depletion of cross-reactive antibodies had no significant effect on this neutralizing activity. In contrast, dengue virus serotypes 1 and 2 were neutralized with similar titers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s009">S9 Fig</xref>) by all three pools from flavivirus pre-immune individuals, and this neutralizing activity was abolished by RB depletion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). No cross-neutralization was observed with the na√Øve pool (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). These data suggest that the epitopes recognized by broadly cross-reactive antibodies are more accessible in infectious dengue than in TBE and Zika viruses (compare 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). This conclusion is also confirmed by the results of ADE assays with dengue virus serotype 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g009">Fig 9</xref>), which showed that most of the enhancing activity could be removed by RB depletion with all four serum pools and therefore was due to cross-reactive antibodies.
