<p>Our analyses included the quantification of Zika virus-specific and flavivirus cross-reactive IgM and IgG antibodies in ELISA and NT, as well as the determination of in vitro ADE of Zika and dengue virus infections. Because these experiments required relatively large volumes for the depletion of antibody subsets (IgM, IgG, cross-reactive antibodies), these analyses were first carried out with pools of equal aliquots of serum samples (one sample per patient) for which at least 500 μl were available. The number of patient samples included in these pools from the different groups are shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, with the YF pool (n = 4) being disproportionally smaller than the other three groups (n = 9 or 10) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008034.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). For this reason, we used 300 μl aliquots for the YF pool, and 200 μl aliquots for the three other pools.
