Many people at risk are flavivirus pre-immune due to prior infections with other flaviviruses (e.g. dengue virus) or flavivirus vaccinations. Since pre-existing cross-reactive immunity can potentially modulate antibody responses to Zika virus infection and may affect the outcome of disease, we analyzed fine-specificity as well as virus-neutralizing and infection-enhancing activities of antibodies induced by a primary Zika virus infection in flavivirus-na&#x000ef;ve as well as yellow fever- and/or tick-borne encephalitis-vaccinated individuals.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methodology</title><p>Antibodies in sera from convalescent Zika patients with and without vaccine-induced immunity were assessed by ELISA with respect to Zika virus-specificity and flavivirus cross-reactivity. Functional analyses included virus neutralization and infection-enhancement. The contribution of IgM and cross-reactive antibodies to these properties was determined by depletion experiments.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Principal findings</title><p>Pre-existing flavivirus immunity had a strong influence on the antibody response in primary Zika virus infections, resulting in higher titers of broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies and slightly lower levels of Zika virus-specific IgM. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of Zika virus was mediated by sub-neutralizing concentrations of specific IgG but not by cross-reactive antibodies. This effect was potently counteracted by the presence of neutralizing IgM. Broadly cross-reactive antibodies were able to both neutralize and enhance infection of dengue virus but not Zika virus, indicating a different exposure of conserved sequence elements in the two viruses.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data point to an important role of flavivirus-specific IgM during the transient early stages of infection, by contributing substantially to neutralization and by counteracting ADE. In addition, our results highlight structural differences between strains of Zika and dengue viruses that are used for analyzing infection-enhancement by cross-reactive antibodies. These findings underscore the possible impact of specific antibody patterns on flavivirus disease and vaccination efficacy.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>The explosive spread of Zika virus, a flavivirus, to South- and Central America underscores the potential threat of newly emerging arthropod-borne viruses. Zika virus infection can cause congenital birth defects and neurological complications. Many people at risk are flavivirus pre-immune because of prior infections with other flaviviruses (e.g. dengue virus, which co-circulates in Zika outbreak regions) or vaccinations (e.g. against yellow fever or tick-borne encephalitis) and have non-protective cross-reactive antibodies at the time of infection. Since pre-existing immunity can modulate the specificity and functional activity of antibody responses, and cross-reactive antibodies have been implicated in disease enhancement, we compared the specificities of serum samples from flavivirus-na&#x000ef;ve and vaccinated individuals after primary Zika virus infections. Prior immunity led to a strong booster of cross-reactive antibodies that did not neutralize Zika virus. Importantly, we could also show that newly formed IgM antibodies contributed significantly to virus neutralization and prevented infection enhancement by other antibodies. Our data thus show how pre-existing cross-reactive immunities can alter the specificities and functional activities of antibody responses in flavivirus infections, which may affect flavivirus-induced disease and the efficacy of vaccinations.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P27501-B21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7191-4331</contrib-id><name><surname>Heinz</surname><given-names>Franz X.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P29928-B30</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1902-8674</contrib-id><name><surname>Stiasny</surname><given-names>Karin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The study has been funded by the Austrian Science Fund FWF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fwf.ac.at">https://www.fwf.ac.at</ext-link>; grant P27501-B21 to FXH; grant P29928-B30 to KS).

Especially in the case of sequential infections with the four serotypes of dengue viruses, the presence of such cross-reactive antibodies at the time of infection has been implicated to contribute to severe forms of disease [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In sequential infections with different flaviviruses, anamnestic responses to shared epitopes can lead to the phenomenon of original antigenic sin, resulting in a strong boost of cross-reactive antibodies at the expense of type-specific antibodies to the newly infecting virus [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This situation can occur in regions where two or more flaviviruses co-circulate, such as the four dengue viruses in all tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world or dengue and Zika viruses in South and Central America or Southeast Asia [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], or as a result of immunization with different flavivirus vaccines [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Pre-existing cross-reactive immunity has thus the potential to affect the antibody response in different combinations of flavivirus infections and vaccinations, which not only includes the modulation of IgG specificities but may also impair the development of newly formed IgM antibodies [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Although the amino acid sequences of E diverge up to 60% among distantly related flaviviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), the overall structure of this protein is similar in all instances, with an ectodomain that is connected to the transmembrane anchor via a stem region containing two or three helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The ectodomain consists of three individual domains (DI, DII, DIII) and forms an antiparallel homodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The fusion loop (FL), located at the tip of DII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), is the most conserved sequence element in E and therefore the major inducer of broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

For this purpose, we analyzed samples from Zika patients, who were either flavivirus na&#x000ef;ve or had previously been vaccinated against TBE and/or YF. We demonstrate that virus-specific IgM antibodies contribute substantially to Zika virus neutralization in the early phase of infection and play an important role in the prevention of IgG-mediated enhancement of Zika virus infection of Fc&#x003b3; receptor-positive cells. Importantly, the formation of IgM antibodies is reduced in individuals with pre-existing cross-reactive flavivirus immunity. Pre-vaccinated individuals displayed a strong anamnestic response of cross-reactive IgG antibodies, which caused ADE of dengue but not of Zika virus infection in vitro. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the complex interplay of antibody populations in transient early stages of flavivirus infections, which can affect the clinical outcome of infections and the efficacy of vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Human serum samples from 62 Zika patients were sent to the Center for Virology of the Medical University of Vienna for diagnostic purposes.

In our study, we analyzed the effect of prior TBE and/or YF vaccination on antibody responses to primary Zika virus infections and observed a strong anamnestic response in pre-vaccinated individuals, resulting in a high proportion of broadly cross-reactive IgG antibodies that accounted for 84 to 94% of the total E-response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In na&#x000ef;ve individuals, however, this proportion was much lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Since the magnitude of the newly formed Zika virus-specific IgG response was similar in na&#x000ef;ve and pre-vaccinated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), the decisive effect of pre-immunity was a change in the proportion of IgG specificities that make up the antibody populations in post-infection sera, in favor of broadly cross-reactive antibodies. It can be assumed that these antibodies react with the FL epitope, since this site comprises the only patch of amino acid residues in E that is conserved across the viruses analyzed [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The FL appears to be cryptic in the cryo-EM (electron microscopy) structures of mature flaviviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Consistent with this picture, broadly cross-reactive antibodies did not neutralize Zika and TBE viruses to a significant extent (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g008">8A</xref>).

The differential behavior observed can be related to stronger dynamic motions of the dengue virus envelope or incomplete maturation of viral particles, both of which can lead to a better exposure of the FL epitope [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>The different properties of infectious Zika and dengue viruses with respect to the exposure of broadly cross-reactive epitopes are not only reflected in NTs but also in analyses of ADE of infection of Fc&#x003b3; receptor-expressing cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g009">9</xref>). Like neutralization, this phenomenon requires the binding of antibodies to infectious virus particles, albeit at sub-neutralizing concentrations [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Broadly cross-reactive antibodies boostered by Zika virus in the TBE and YF pre-vaccinated individuals only enhanced dengue but not Zika virus in our in vitro assays, consistent with a better accessibility of their epitopes in dengue viruses. Our data thus corroborate studies that have shown differences in conformational dynamics as well as maturation levels among different flaviviruses (and even strains of flaviviruses) [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], which have implications for virus neutralization and deserve further intensive research in the area of flavivirus vaccinology. It is therefore important to emphasize that the results obtained with dengue viruses (i.e. neutralization and strong ADE by cross-reactive antibodies, in contrast to Zika virus) may be biased by the specific properties of the virus strain used in the in vitro analyses. In particular, the results can be affected by a pronounced breathing behavior and partial immaturity, both of which result in a higher exposure of the conserved FL and thus may lead to an overestimation of the contribution of cross-reactive antibodies in these activities [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consistent with this notion, recent studies with dengue virus serotype 1 have shown that virus specimens taken directly from human plasma are predominantly mature (in contrast to cell culture grown virus) and are only poorly neutralized by antibodies recognizing the FL [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].</p><p>In our analyses we used a stable Zika virus E dimer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s004">S4 Fig</xref>) which has a native antigenic structure and displays quaternary, E dimer-specific epitopes ([<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008034.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

An extremely important finding of our study is the fact that this infection enhancement can be potently suppressed by the presence of IgM antibodies (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g005">5</xref>), and this ability may be crucial in the early phase of flavivirus infections, when potentially enhancing antibodies already pre-exist or are strongly boostered.

Mechanistically, low-avidity Zika-virus specific IgG (as present early after infection, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) might be sterically blocked by large pentameric IgM antibodies.

The virus neutralizing and anti-ADE activity of IgM (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g005">5</xref>) highlight the general importance of IgM antibodies for controlling flavivirus clearance early after infection, also deduced from animal studies with West Nile virus and IgM-deficient mice [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>It appears that the prominent role of IgM antibodies in virus neutralization in the early phase of human flavivirus infections and its function in protecting from severe forms of disease has been underappreciated so far. This is especially important in the context of sequential flavivirus infections in which IgM responses may be delayed and/or strongly diminished [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the case of sequential dengue virus infections, IgM levels may even be reduced to non-detectable levels [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Animal studies suggest that this suppressive effect depends on the degree of antigenic relationship in such scenarios [<xref rid="pntd.0008034.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the specific situations analyzed in our study, the impairment of Zika virus-specific IgM responses was not very strong but demonstrated to be significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008034.g010">Fig 10A</xref>). It is apparent that the effects described are transient due to dynamic changes of the proportions and avidities of IgM and IgG antibodies in the early phase of infection. Whether and/or how the differences observed can affect durable immunity may be the subject of future studies performed with samples collected more than one year after infection.</p><p>Overall, our study highlights the potential effect of flavivirus vaccine-induced pre-immunity on the patterns of antibody responses in early stages of primary infection with a distantly related flavivirus, in this case Zika virus. The modulation observed, albeit with relatively small groups (especially the YF pre-vaccinated group) of adults, includes both the primary IgM response as well as the anamnestic booster of broadly cross-reactive IgG antibodies that are capable to mediate ADE of dengue virus infections in vitro. Considering the importance of IgM for protection early after infection and its ability to block IgG-mediated ADE, further studies on these phenomena in the context of different combinations of flavivirus infections and vaccinations appear to be warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec030"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008034.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Controls for the flavivirus IgG ELISA.</title><p>(A) Titration curves of the positive control serum (described in Methods) and (B) results of 32 negative control sera (dilution 1:100) in ELISA with Zika, dengue serotype 2, RB and TBE virus E proteins.
