<p>Studies in human cell culture and animal models suggest that both innate and adaptive immune responses are important for protecting the host from WNV infection. PRR-mediated innate immune responses are critical for the control of WNV dissemination and viral clearance in the CNS, modulation of BBB integrity, and regulation of the effector functions of innate and adaptive immune cells. Adaptive immunity provides long-lasting protection against WNV. Newly developed animal models have provided important insights into the mechanism underlying neurocognitive impairment in patients recovering from WNV neuroinvasive disease and WNV persistence in the CNS.</p>
