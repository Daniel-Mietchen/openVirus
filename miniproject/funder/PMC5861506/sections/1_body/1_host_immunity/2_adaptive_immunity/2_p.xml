<p>PRR-mediated innate immunity plays an important role in regulating T- and B-cell responses during WNV infection. For example, both TLR3- and MyD88-dependent signaling pathways contribute to the development of WNV-specific antibody and B-cell memory responses following immunization with a single-cycle WNV vaccine

 </sup>. MAVS and TLR7 are both required for T-cell priming but are dispensable for recall T-cell responses following an attenuated WNV strain infection. Instead, the TLR7-independent MyD88 signaling pathways, such as IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling, are involved in memory T-cell development

 </sup>. Lastly, although the intrinsic MAVS signaling is dispensable for Treg proliferation and suppressive capacity, the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines generated in MAVS-deficient mice contributes to a failure of Treg expansion
