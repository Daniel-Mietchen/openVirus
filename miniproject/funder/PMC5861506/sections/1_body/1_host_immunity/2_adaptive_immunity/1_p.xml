<p>Mature B cells and WNV-specific antibodies are critical in the control of WNV infection and dissemination. However, a recent study suggests that immature B cells present in B-cell-activating factor receptor-deficient mice also contribute to antiviral immunity and protect the host in passive and active immunizations

 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated in WNV-infected mice that the regulatory T cell (Treg)-dependent production of transforming growth factor beta is required for the induction of CD103 expression on CD8 
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, thereby generating and maintaining a large pool of WNV-specific resident memory CD8

 </sup>. Aging is a known risk factor for WNV-induced encephalitis in mice and humans. Old mice display an enhanced vulnerability to WNV infection, partially due to cell-trafficking defects in the draining lymph nodes, which result in delayed T cell recruitment and antigen recognition and an impaired IgM and IgG response
