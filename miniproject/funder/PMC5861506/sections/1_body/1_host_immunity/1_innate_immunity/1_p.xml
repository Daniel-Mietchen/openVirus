<p>WNV activates the signaling pathways of several pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 7, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors containing pyrin domain (NLRPs), in order to boost innate immunity and culminate in the synthesis of antiviral cytokines, including type I interferons (IFNs), proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines
