<p>IFN responses contribute to host defense mainly in two ways. First, IFNs and IFN-stimulating genes (ISGs), including 
 <italic>Ifit2</italic>, 
 <italic>Ifi27l2a</italic>, and 
 <italic>Ifitm3</italic>, participate in the control of WNV infection, prevent the virus from invading the central nervous system (CNS), and restrict its spread in the brain 
 <sup>

  <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
 </sup>. Second, both type I and type III IFNs (IFN-λ) are implicated in promoting blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity, which may prevent WNV entry to the CNS. Studies in murine models suggest that type I IFNs are directly involved in the permeability of the endothelium and the formation of tight junctions through balanced activation of Rac1 and RhoA—small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases)—interactions and indirect suppression of the compromise effects of proinflammatory cytokines

 </sup>. More recently, Daniels 
 <italic>et al</italic>. reported that type I IFNR signaling in astrocytes regulates BBB permeability and protects the cerebellum from WNV infection and immunopathology 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, the activation of TAM receptor Mertk synergizes with IFN-β to tighten cell junctions and prevent WNV transit across brain microvascular endothelial (BMVE) cells. As a consequence, mice deficient of Mertk were highly vulnerable to a neuroinvasive WNV strain infection 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
 </sup>. IFN-λ signaling also modulates tight junction protein localization in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-independent manner in mouse BMVE cells, which leads to a rise in transendothelial electrical resistance and a fall in the movement of virus across the BBB during WNV infection 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 </sup>. Multiple host and viral factors have been reported to be involved in regulating IFN signaling during WNV infection. For example, IRF-3, -5, and -7 are the key transcription factors responsible for mediating type I IFN and ISG responses downstream of RLR signaling in WNV-infected myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
 </sup>. Another transcription factor, ELF4, is recruited by STING following WNV infection and interacts with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)–TBK1 complex, which is critical for further induction of type I IFN responses 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
 </sup>. Both PI3K/Akt and microRNA miR-34a inhibit WNV infection by positively regulating type I IFN signaling 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
  <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
 </sup>. Several factors also contribute to the negative regulation of IFN responses. Among them, the activating signal cointegrator complex 3 (ASCC3) protein functions to suppress ISG expression in an IRF3- and IRF7-dependent manner 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
 </sup>. UBXN1, a UBX-domain-containing protein family member, can bind to MAVS, the central adaptor protein to RLR signaling, and disrupt IFN-mediated antiviral immune responses 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
 </sup>. The nonstructural protein NS1 of WNV is secreted upon infection and associates with and represses TLR3-induced IFN responses in both human and mouse cells 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
 </sup>. Among the proinflammatory cytokines induced during WNV infection, interleukin (IL)-1β was shown to synergize with type I IFN and suppress WNV replication in mouse cortical neurons 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
 </sup>. Systems immunology studies in cohorts of human subjects with a history of WNV infection also reveal IL-1β induction as a predictive signature of susceptibility to WNV infection 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
 </sup>. Several chemokines and their receptors have been demonstrated to play an importantrolein facilitating immune cell infiltration to the CNS for WNV clearance. The CCR2 chemokine ligands CCL2 and CCL7 are both involved in monocytosis and monocyte accumulation in the brain. However, CCL7 seems to play a larger role in WNV-induced monocytosis and is involved in the efficient recruitment of neutrophils and CD8 
 <sup>+</sup> T cells into the CNS 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
 </sup>. CCR5 is required for virologic control, specifically within the CNS cortex. WNV-infected CCR5 
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice had a significant decrease in immune cell infiltrates, increased BBB permeability, and elevated levels of CCR5 ligands 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
 </sup>. Several factors are important for promoting chemokine-mediated leukocyte migration. For example, CD22 is essential in the control of WNV infection. It was expressed on a subset of splenic DCIR2 
 <sup>+</sup> DCs in mice, which rapidly expanded early after WNV infection, produced CCL3, and promoted CD8 
 <sup>+</sup> T cell migration into the CNS 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
 </sup>. Another study reported that receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) promotes the production of the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10 in neurons following WNV infection in mice and this helps to recruit T lymphocytes and inflammatory myeloid cells to the CNS for viral clearance 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
 </sup>. Finally, studies in horses infected with a newly emerging WNV strain, WNV 
 <sub>NSW2011</sub>, suggest that early IFN and inflammatory cytokine responses in circulating leukocytes and lymphoid organs are associated with subclinical WNV infection
