<p>PRR-mediated signaling pathways are also involved in regulating the effector activities of innate immune cells. γδ T cells are important for the early control of WNV dissemination and regulation of adaptive immunity against WNV infection. Following WNV infection, TLR7 provides co-stimulatory signals during TCR activation of γδ T cells
