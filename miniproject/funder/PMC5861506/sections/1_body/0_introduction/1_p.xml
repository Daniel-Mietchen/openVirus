<p>West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne, single-stranded, positive-sense flavivirus, has been a significant public health concern in the United States for nearly two decades. It was originally isolated in Uganda in 1937 and later caused epidemics in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia. The virus was introduced to the United States in 1999, and since then it has caused more than 46,000 confirmed human cases and about 2,000 deaths

 </sup>. While the majority of human infections are asymptomatic, about 20% of infected individuals become symptomatic and develop flu-like symptoms such as rash, headache, myalgia, and gastrointestinal discomfort. Less than 1% of all infected people develop severe neurological disease, including encephalitis, meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and death. Up to 50% of WNV convalescent patients develop persistent neurological sequelae or chronic kidney diseases
