<p>Following natural transmission to the host via mosquito bites, WNV replicates in keratinocytes and the skin residential DCs, Langerhans cells (LCs). Activated LCs then migrate to local draining lymph nodes from the epidermis, after which viremia begins and WNV disseminates to the kidneys, spleen, and other visceral organs

 </sup>. Although how WNV enters the CNS is not clearly understood, both hematogenous and transneural pathways have been proposed

 </sup>. It has also been suggested that WNV crosses the BBB in the hematogenous pathway. WNV PAMPs orchestrate endothelial responses to WNV via competing PRRs, including TLR3-mediated innate immune cytokine signals at the BBB. While proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β increase the permeability of endothelial barriers, type I and type III IFNs promote and stabilize the BBB

  <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
 </sup>. Another proinflammatory cytokine, osteopontin (OPN), compromises BBB integrity by recruiting WNV-infected polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) infiltration and facilitates WNV entry via a Trojan horse mechanism

 </sup>. WNV most likely propagates within the CNS transsynaptically by both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport

 </sup>. WNV-induced CNS diseases are caused partially by bystander damage from the immune response to virus infection in CNS-resident cells and/or infiltrating leukocytes following systemic immune responses. The trafficking of Ly6C 
 <sup>hi</sup> monocytes into the brain was pathogenic, as blocking these cells using anti-very late antigen 4 integrin antibody at the time of observation of the first weight loss and leukocyte influx resulted in long-term survival in mice with lethal encephalitis

 </sup>. In an 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> spinal cord slice culture (SCSC) model, it was shown that CNS-resident cells had the capacity to initiate a robust innate immune response against WNV infection in the absence of infiltrating inflammatory cells and systemic immune responses 
 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, treatment with minocycline in WNV-infected SCSC induced the expression of genes associated with the anti-inflammatory activation of microglia while inhibiting the expression of genes associated with proinflammatory microglia activation, and this was protective for multiple CNS cell types
