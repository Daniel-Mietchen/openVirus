 <italic>et al</italic>. recently developed a novel mouse model of human WNV neuroinvasive disease by using a WNV isolate with a point mutation in the NS5 protein (WNV-NS5-E218A), which induces infection with similar survival rates and cognitive dysfunction compared to humans. They demonstrated microglial engulfment of hippocampal CA3 presynaptic terminals via complement during acute WNV infection and after recovery

 <italic>et al</italic>. subsequently found that mice that had recovered from West Nile neuroinvasive disease exhibited fewer neuroblasts and increased astrogenesis without recovery of hippocampal neurogenesis. Preferential generation of IL-1 in astrocytes impaired the homeostasis of neuronal progenitor cells
