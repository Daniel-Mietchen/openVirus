<p>Increasing evidence suggests that persistent WNV infection also contributes to long-term morbidity. WNV antigen, RNA, or virus particles have been detected in the brain and/or urine of WNV patients ranging from a few months to several years after the initial acute illness

 </sup>. Small animal models have been developed to study persistent WNV infection. We and others have shown that the inbred C57BL6 mice infected with either the wild-type WNV strain or an isolate cultured from the urine of a persistently infected hamster share some similarity and discrepancy in symptoms and tissue tropism compared to the clinical findings in some WNV convalescent patients with long-term morbidity, including chronic kidney diseases and long-term neurological sequelae

 </sup>. More recently, the collaborative cross, a population of recombinant inbred mouse strains with high levels of fixed genetic variation, were used to investigate WNV persistence in the brain. Results from this model suggest that the Treg response sufficiently restrains the immune response and leads to WNV persistence in the CNS
