 <p>West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has been a significant public health concern in the United States for nearly two decades. The virus has been linked to acute viral encephalitis, neurological sequelae, and chronic kidney diseases. Neither antiviral drugs nor vaccines are currently available for humans. 
  <italic>In vitro</italic> cell culture and experimental animal models have been used to study WNV infection in humans. In this review, we will focus on recent findings and provide new insights into WNV host immunity and viral pathogenesis.
