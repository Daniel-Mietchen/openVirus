<p>Factors associated with treatment initiation among eligible patients were identified using a Cox model that took into account the delay in initiating treatment from the date the subject is eligible. Patients who were not put on treatment during follow-up were censored at the date of the last follow-up visit to the center. The choice of the variables to include in the model was based on the literature and their availability in the ESOPE database. The interaction terms between the time periods and the different variables were tested in order to identify the covariates whose effects varied with time. As several interactions with time periods were identified at a 0.05 p-value threshold., models were built separately for each time period. The model selection was based on a backward selection using a p-value threshold of 0.20. In the models the variable age was dichotomized to &lt;40 and ≥40 years old, 40 years being the median. The association with region was assessed by comparing Dakar to any other regions because sample size was reduced in some regions. As clinical stage and CD4 count were not independent, the association with clinical stage and CD4 level is assessed using a single variable that divides the eligible population into 5 groups: clinical stage 1 or 2 and CD4 ≥200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; clinical stage 3 or 4 and CD4 ≥200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; clinical stage 3 or 4 and CD4 not measured; clinical stage 1 or 2 and CD4 &lt;200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; and clinical stage 3 or 4 and CD4 &lt;200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>.
