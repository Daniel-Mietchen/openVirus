<p>In 2011, the ESTHER (Ensemble pour une Solidarité Thérapeutique Hospitalière en Réseau) hospital partnership initiative has supported the implementation of ESOPE, an electronic medical software system used to monitor the care of people living with HIV, at several care sites in Africa, including the Dakar CTA. This software makes it easier to manage individual patients by creating electronic records of their data that can be easily accessed, searched or shared between treatment centers. ESOPE also provides a powerful means of evaluating HIV / AIDS treatment programs through the automated production of synthetic reports. As of 2012, medical records of all new CTA patients were entered into the software. At the same time, a retrospective entry of all the medical files since 1998 has been carried out, thus expanding the electronic database that can be used for evaluation. The database was also cleaned and updated with active search of people lost-to follow-up prior to the data extraction used for the analysis presented here.</p>
