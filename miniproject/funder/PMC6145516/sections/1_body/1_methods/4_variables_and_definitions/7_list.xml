   <bold>Not eligible but started on ART</bold>—patients treated before eligibility. This group corresponds to individuals for whom the initiation of treatment was decided on the basis of criteria (such as AIDS stage during follow-up, co-infections (tuberculosis, hepatitis B), pregnancy, serodiscordance, belonging to key populations, viral load, etc.) that were not taken into account in our definition of eligibility. This group represents less than 10% of the population analyzed and is not integrated into the group of treated patients for the sake of simplification.
