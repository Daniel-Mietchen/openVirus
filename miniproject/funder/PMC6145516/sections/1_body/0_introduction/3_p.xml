The Programme National de Lutte contre le SIDA (PNLS) was established to coordinate the government’s anti-AIDS activity in 1986 and was later renamed the Conseil National de Lutte contre le SIDA (CNLS). CNLS’s goals for 2030 include zero new infections, zero deaths tied to AIDS, and zero discrimination against HIV-positive Senegalese citizens. Senegal, like most of the international community, adopted UNAIDS "90-90-90" strategy when establishing TATARSEN (Test All, Treat All and Retain) in 2016. Senegal’s long experience in antiretroviral drugs use, dating back to 1998 and which has followed the evolution of various changes in therapeutic recommendations proposed by WHO, provides an excellent opportunity for evaluating the consequences of changing recommendations in order to better understand and anticipate obstacles to achieving the second "90", i.e. 90% of all people with diagnosed HIV infection receiving ART.
