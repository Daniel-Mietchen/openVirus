<p>Over the entire study period, the median time to ART was 2.0 months, with a significant decrease from 5.6 months to 0.8 months between the first and last periods (
 <xref rid="pone.0202984.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In the last period, 78% received treatment within 3 months after documented eligibility, whereas it represented only a quarter of the patients in the first period. The reduction in the time to treatment initiation was not accompanied by a reduction in the number of pre-ART visits after becoming eligible. The proportion of people put on treatment immediately after becoming eligible increased little over time, from 5% to 9% between the first and last periods. The proportion of eligible patients making at least 5 pre-ART visits after becoming eligible was stable between the first and last periods (11% to 12%).
