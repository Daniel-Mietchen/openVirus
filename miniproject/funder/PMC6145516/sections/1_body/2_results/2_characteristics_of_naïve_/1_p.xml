<p>The median patient age at entry over the entire study period was 40 years (
 <xref rid="pone.0202984.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The median age decreased over time. Over the study period, 56% of patients were women, peaking at 59%% in the period 2004–2010. There was a change in the distribution of the reported marital status of patients, with an increase in the proportion of single persons, who represented 27% of the population in the last period and a significant decrease in the proportion of widowers over time. The proportion of WHO stage 1 patients at entry into care increased from 11% in the first period to 34% in the last period. However, the proportion of patients in stages 3 and 4 remained high in the last period, representing almost half of the patient population. There was a significant improvement in the availability of CD4 counts for evaluation at entry: while only 42% of people had a CD4 count at the opening of their file in the first period, this proportion increased to 92% in the last period. The median CD4 count increased slightly over time (169 [68–307] in 1998–2003 and 240 [97–398] in 2014–2015, p-value = 0.02). The proportion of people with CD4 &lt;200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> still accounted for 45% of the population with available CD4 in the last period.
