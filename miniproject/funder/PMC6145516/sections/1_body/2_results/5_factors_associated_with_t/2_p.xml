<p>The influence of disease progression, measured by taking into account both the CD4 count and the clinical stage, was observed at all periods. Within eligible subjects, those who presented with CD4&lt;200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> regardless of clinical stage were more likely to be treated compared to those with CD4≥200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> with a clinical stage 3 or 4 in the first two periods from 1998 to 2010. In periods 3 and 4, in which ART eligibility expands to CD4 &lt;350 and to &lt;500 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, patients with CD4&lt;200 were also more likely to be treated compared to those with CD4≥200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> and clinical stage 1 or 2 as well as patients with CD4≥200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> and clinical stage 3 or 4, with smaller risk, however.
