<p>As of June 30, 2016, the ESOPE database had 4173 files associated with 51076 visits. We excluded a total of 522 patient files, corresponding to 70 duplicates, 141 outpatients, 36 patients under 15 years of age, 233 patients who were not ART naïve at the opening of the case, 39 patients with files opened between 30 December 2015 and 30 June 2016, and 3 cases for which no visits had been recorded. The population analyzed thus contains 3651 ART-naïve patients for whom a file was opened at CTA between 1998 and 2015 (
