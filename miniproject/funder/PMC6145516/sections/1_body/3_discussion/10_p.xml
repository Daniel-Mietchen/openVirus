<p>The strength of this work lies in the fact that it was carried out in one of the largest reference centers in Senegal, which has seen patients throughout the historical periods of therapeutic treatment of HIV since 1998. Today, CTA is the only center in Senegal, set up 12 years after the start of therapeutic management, with a computerized medical monitoring tool of the patient. Significant resources were deployed to ensure the retrospective entry of patient data prior to 2012 and in follow-up that enabled us to carry out this work.</p>
