<p>We showed that among eligible people, those with more advanced disease were more likely to initiate timely treatment. This was observed at all periods, with stronger effects after ART eligibility criteria expanded to CD4&lt;350 and CD4&lt;500. These findings showed that in the clinic, ART eligibility expansions did not affect negatively ART initiation among those with more advanced diseases. These findings are consistent with other studies and meta-analysis, showing large increases of ART initiation among newly eligible patients with less advanced disease, without any decrease of rate of ART initiation among those with low CD4 count or advanced clinical stage (24,25). This prioritization is likely due to the influence of WHO recommendations and programs advising caregivers in resource-constrained countries to prioritize the most highly immunosuppressed patients, in whom delays in initiation of ART is associated with high risk of mortality. Unlike what has been observed in a systematic review of African studies, we did not find neither a sustainable effect of age nor an effect of sex indicating that men and young people were less likely to initiate ART after enrollment into care [
