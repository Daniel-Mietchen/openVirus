<p>This improvement in initiation of ART is observed in other countries notably Kenya, where a study found that among eligible patients, the percentage those starting ART increased from 29% in 2007 to 61% in 2012 [

A meta-analysis of programmatic data from 22 countries examined the changes in timely ART initiation after ART eligibility criteria were expanded to CD4≤350 and CD4≤500. This study showed that ART eligibility expansions were followed by substantial increases in rates of timely ART initiation after enrollment in the clinic. Larger increases were observed among newly eligible patients but significant increases were also observed among previously eligible patients as shown in the present study [

These results are a consequence of the commitment of the international community and countries in the fight against HIV with free access to treatment, the WHO 3x5 initiative, and universal access. However, efforts to improve access to treatment centers and treatment are still needed in resource-limited countries. According to the latest UNAIDS report, while globally 54% [40–65%] of adults aged 15 years old and older accessed treatment, in sub-Saharan Africa, this value falls to 36% [
