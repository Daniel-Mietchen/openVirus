<p>This work has several limitations. The information in the medical file was entered into ESOPE at the time of the patient visit only since 2012; all visits prior to 2012 were retrospectively entered, resulting in a loss of some information and missing data for the first periods. The definition of eligibility used in this analysis did not take into account specific situations, such as pregnant women, persons living with a partner who are serodiscordant, men who have sex with men, sex workers, or drug users for whom treatment is routinely offered regardless of CD4 count or clinical stage. It also did not take into account the passage to a higher clinical stage during follow-up. Lastly, the analysis focused on data from a referral treatment center specializing in the management of HIV, meaning that results cannot be generalized across the countryâ€™s various HIV care structures.</p>
