<p>The degree of immunosuppression characterizing our study population at entry into care was relatively constant over time. For period 1, nearly 58% of files had missing CD4 count data, making interpretation of the median value difficult. From period 2 until the end of the study period, the median CD4 counts increased slightly over time but remained low in the last period (2014–2015) with a median of 240 [97–398] cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> and 45% of patients with CD4 count below 200 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>. This means that most HIV-infected persons present to care at CD4 counts far below the applicable threshold at this time (i.e. &lt;500 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>). A meta analysis of 56 studies from Sub-Saharan Africa found no significant change in CD4 count at entry into care from 2002 to 2013, with a mean CD4 count of 309 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (95% confidence interval, 237–381 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>) in 2012 [

In 2018, an analysis of IeDEA and COHERE database including 951855 patients from 55 countries showed that median CD4 cell count at ART initiation increased in all countries with the smallest increase observed in West-African countries (118 to 186 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>) [
