<p>Finally, we investigated cleavage of HA in lung homogenates on day 2 p.i. after infection with PR8, PR8_HA(HK), PR8_HA(MVEKT) and PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8</xref>). In line with our previous results, HA of PR8 was cleaved in WT mice, but only slightly in

  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>). The difference to previously published data is most likely due to a higher infection dose used in this study [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Out of three blots of the same lung samples, the ratio between HA
 <sub>1</sub> to HA
 <sub>1</sub>+HA
 <sub>0</sub> was calculated and the mean depicted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8c</xref>). After infection with PR8, 22 % of HA was cleaved in WT mice, but only 7  % in 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice. As described above, HA of HK was cleaved in WT (31 %) and 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice (15  %) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8b</xref>). Likewise, the HA of PR8_HA(D-MVEKT) was cleaved in both WT (19  %) and 
 <italic>Tmprss2
  <sup>−/−</sup>
 </italic> mice (14  %), which correlates with its high replication rate and pathogenicity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8a</xref>). These results were confirmed in the Western blots of viral proteins from bronco-alveolar lavages (BAL; Fig. S3).
