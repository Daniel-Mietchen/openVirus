<p>Phylogenetic analyses show that ZIKV can be classified into 2 main lineages: the African lineage and the Asian lineage, the latter of which is responsible for the recent epidemics. Because recent ZIKV infections were associated with the development of congenital and neurological disorders, a key question was raised as to whether Asian-lineage ZIKV strains were phenotypically different from the African lineage strains. It is well described that mutations acquired during 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> evolution can alter their virulence and/or tropism [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. Several studies show that vector transmission can differ between ZIKV strains, as the overall ZIKV infection prevalence and transmission rates of African strains may be higher in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> than Asian strains [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], suggesting that viral adaptation may have occurredâ€”similar to a single mutation in the chikungunya virus envelope protein that affected vector specificity and epidemic potential.
