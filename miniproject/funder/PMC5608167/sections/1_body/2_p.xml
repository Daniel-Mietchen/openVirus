<p>During the recent outbreak, it became clear that ZIKV is sometimes able to cause a prolonged infection. Numerous studies showed that Asian-lineage strains isolated in South America replicate at low levels in tissues months after the initial infection. For example, viral genome can be found in stillborn babies who were infected early during gestation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], weeks after initial infection in sperm, and in rhesus monkeys, ZIKV can be found in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) 42 days after infection, weeks after the virus was cleared from the blood [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, to date, no data are available on the ability of African-lineage strains to cause prolonged infections, but early studies in 2016 suggested that an African ZIKV strain was highly pathogenic and led to cell death; when the first reports on a potential link between microcephaly and ZIKV emerged, laboratories started to study the effect of ZIKV on human neural precursor cells (hNPCs)/human neural stem cells (hNSCs) with MR766, the most available strain at the time (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005821.t001">Table 1</xref>). These first studies showed strong tropism and deleterious effects on NSC homeostasis and growth (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). However, some inconsistencies between this rather strong virulence and the long-term developmental effects associated with ZIKV infections led researchers to question the biological validity of this strain, which has been passaged many times in animals and in cells and acquired mutations and deletions at multiple positions during passaging (

 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The relevance of this strain was also questioned in a study that showed reduced toxicity and long-term persistence in human neural progenitors of an Asian-lineage ZIKV strain from Puerto Rico, which seemed more consistent with clinical manifestations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Consequently, we compared the neurovirulence 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> of 2 low-passaged African- and Asian-lineage ZIKV strains [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The African ArB41644 strain was isolated in Central African Republic in 1989, whereas the Asian H/PF/2013 strain was isolated in 2013 during the French Polynesian epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005821.t001">Table 1</xref>). We showed that the African ZIKV strain displayed a higher infectivity and replication rate in hNSCs than the Asian ZIKV strain. ArB41644 triggered more defects in proliferation and more apoptosis, which correlated with a stronger induction of the antiviral response [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In a subsequent study, we compared 2 Asian-lineage ZIKV strains (H/PF/2013 and ZIKVNL00013, isolated during the current epidemic in 2015) with 2 African-lineage ZIKV strains (MR766 and Uganda 927) in human neural progenitor cells and confirmed the phenotypic differences between ZIKV strains from the Asian and African lineages [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Both African strains infected more cells, replicated to higher titers, and induced early cell death more frequently than the Asian-lineage ZIKV strains [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The milder virulence of the Asian strains in these studies could be consistent with a persistent infection and effect of the Asian ZIKV lineage in developing neural cells. In addition, in dendritic cells, infection by African (MR766 and Dakar-1984) and Asian (PR-2015) strains led also to a difference in pathogenicity, as African strains triggered more cellular death [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Notably, this study also showed that despite differences in viral replication rates between the extensively passaged MR766 strain and the more recently isolated Dakar-1984 strain, the inductions of cell death were similar, suggesting that the ability to cause cell death seen in various cellular models with MR766 could still in certain circumstances be representative for African ZIKV lineage strains [
