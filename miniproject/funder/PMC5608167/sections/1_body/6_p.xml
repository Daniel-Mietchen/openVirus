<p>In conclusion, the data reviewed here indicate that there are intrinsic differences in the pathogenicity/virulence of African- and Asian-lineage ZIKV strains. Whether these differences are responsible for differences in clinical presentations should be confirmed, but one can speculate that the phenotype of Asian ZIKV strains (lower infection rate, less virus production, and poor induction of early cell death) might contribute, at least in part, to the ability to cause persistent infections within the CNS of fetuses, while African-lineage ZIKV strains could result in more acute infection. However, even though 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> data point towards a stronger virulence for African strains, it is still premature to conclude that if an African epidemic declares itself (due to an African ZIKV strain), neurological symptoms with similar or worse gravity than those observed in South America will be found. If confirmed, recent reports of African ZIKV strain infection and potential microcephaly in Guinea Bissau may be proof of what could be expected in this continent [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Determining the virulence factors for ZIKV using reverse genetic systems that have now been developed for both African and Asian strains will be crucial to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind differences in ZIKV pathogenicity and also those of other emerging arboviruses.
