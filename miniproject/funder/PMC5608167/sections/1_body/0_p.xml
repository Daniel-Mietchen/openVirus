<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a small enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family that has reemerged in recent years as a human pathogen with epidemic potential. To date, the ongoing epidemic in the Americas has led to tens of thousands of confirmed cases in Brazil alone (Pan American Health Organization Zika-Epidemiological Report, 2 March 2017). More concerning are the reports of severe neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and congenital Zika syndrome (microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental defects), which led the World Health Organization to declare the ZIKV epidemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in 2016.
