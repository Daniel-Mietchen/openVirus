<p>Since infection with ZIKV strains from the Asian lineage is associated with microcephaly in humans, it is likely that ZIKV crosses the placental barrier early in gestation, when the brain is starting to develop. Some studies showed that cells of the placenta are susceptible to ZIKV infection, in line with the congenital infections and neurological symptoms associated. Because infections early in gestation seem to be more linked to microcephaly [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005821.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], it was hypothesized that the placenta vulnerability could differ depending on the gestational stage. While the placental syncytiotrophoblast, which is found in mature placenta, appears mostly resistant to ZIKV, a study that compared an African strain (MR766) to an Asian strain (FSS13025, Cambodia) showed that embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived trophoblasts, which recapitulate primitive placenta cells during implantation, are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection [

These data might indicate that infection with African-lineage ZIKV strains—if they enter the fetus—could result in an early termination of pregnancy, while infection with an Asian-lineage ZIKV strain would be less destructive and more chronic, thereby allowing the pregnancy to continue, leading to the development of congenital malformations [
