<p>However, one major challenge in interpreting and comparing the data from these studies is the lack of harmonization of the virus strains used. In this review alone, in which we focused on studies that compared multiple ZIKV strains, at least 12 African and 13 Asian strains were found (

While most studies include the African lineage MR766 strain, this strain cannot be considered as a standard, as it has been extensively passaged and at least 3 MR766 strains exist with genetic differences, including a 4â€“6 codon deletion in the envelope (E) protein [

Therefore, when comparing ZIKV lineages, the strains should be sequenced and experiments more standardized to allow proper comparison between studies. Ideally, more recent African ZIKV strains should become available (as the most recent isolate so far is from 1991) (
