 <title>Data Availability</title>
 <p>Unfortunately, making data publicly available would breach compliance with the protocol approved by our IRB, and thus the IRB will not approve public access to our data. Data are from the Sociocultural Aspects of Ebola in Sierra Leone study whose authors may be contacted at
