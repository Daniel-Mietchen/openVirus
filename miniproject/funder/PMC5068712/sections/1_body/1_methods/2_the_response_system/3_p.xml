<p>There were three ways to meet the “suspected Ebola case” definition: 1) a temperature of greater than 100.4°F (38.0°C) and three or more Ebola symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, joint pain, fatigue, or unusual bleeding); 2) a fever and contact with a confirmed case in the preceding three weeks; or 3) unexplained bleeding [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005077.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Ambulance workers dressed in personal protective equipment (PPE) arrived to transport suspected cases to holding centers. The ambulance workers also sprayed chlorine at homes of suspected cases in order to inactivate the virus [
