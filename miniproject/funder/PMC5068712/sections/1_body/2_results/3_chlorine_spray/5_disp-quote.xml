  <italic>One day the team came to pick up a female patient … She was strong enough to walk from the house to the ambulance but when they arrived at the treatment center the lady became so weak and couldn’t walk because of the chlorine sprayed in the ambulance. It was the chlorine. She didn’t have Ebola. The chlorine weakened her. The effect of chlorine is just like when one is locked up in a newly painted room. It suffocates people just like Shelltox (insecticide spray)</italic>.
