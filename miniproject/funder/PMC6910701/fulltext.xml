In circumstances where it is possible to monitor the infection status of certain people, transport hubs, or hospitals, early detection of the disease allows interventions to be implemented before most of the damage can occur, or at least its impact can be mitigated. This paper addresses the question of which nodes we should select in a network of individuals susceptible to some infectious disease in order to minimize the number of casualties. By simulating disease outbreaks on a collection of empirical and synthetic networks we show that the best strategy depends on topological characteristics of the network. For highly modular or spatially embedded networks it is better to place the sentinels on nodes distributed across different regions. However, if the degree heterogeneity is high, then a strategy that targets network hubs is preferred. We further consider the consequences of having an incomplete sample of the network and demonstrate that the value of new information diminishes as more data is collected. Finally we find further marginal improvements using two heuristics informed by known results in graph theory that exploit the fragmented structure of sparse network data.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>In a network of individuals susceptible to some infectious disease, what are the best locations to monitor in order to detect the infection before most damage can be done?

In the effort to limit the damage caused by infectious diseases, governments often have to resort to costly vaccination schemes or suffer the human and economic consequences of implementing quarantine programmes. Naturally, there is much to be gained from initiatives that detect outbreaks during their early stages as it allows public health officials to locally contain the spread and prevent it from reaching the wider population. Such <italic>sentinel surveillance</italic> schemes may involve the detection of influenza in airports [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], receiving data from specially selected healthcare centres [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], or monitoring users of intravenously taken drugs [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Given that in most situations of this type it is only possible to monitor a fraction of the population at risk, deciding exactly <italic>which</italic> individuals to target is a question that could have significant economic and public health benefits.</p><p>This question is similar to the problem of disease control through immunization. A significant literature already exists addressing this problem through mathematical and computational modelling, with the main objective to find the <italic>herd immunity threshold</italic>; defined as the proportion of the population one would need to immunize to ensure that local outbreaks do not develop into epidemics [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Much of this work is concerned with the networks of potential transmission pathways for the infectious diseases within a population [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since well connected nodes in such networks are both more likely to receive the infection, and to pass it on to others once they become infectious, it is prudent to locate these nodes and vaccinate them [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Various heuristic approaches to find such nodes have been shown to be cost-effective [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Unlike targeted vaccination, which remains a theoretical problem, sentinel surveillance is in active use, and, while vaccination strategies on networks have been studied in some depth, much less is known about sentinel surveillance. Moreover, recent results show the best candidates for vaccination are not necessarily the same as those for sentinel placement [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. While methods have been developed to find the optimal placement of <italic>n</italic> sentinels on a given network whose structure is known [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], fewer studies consider heuristic approaches that do not require perfect data [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While incomplete or unreliable information has been investigated in the context of influence maximization and other centrality measures [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], questions still remain about sentinel placement in the disease context.</p><p>The premise of our investigation is that a good strategy is one that selects nodes that have many connections but are also not too close to each other. While previous work in this area has focused on locating well connected individuals [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], here we ask whether a strategy that also distributes the sentinels across different regions of the network can be better than one that simply targets the highest degree nodes.</p><p>The first part of this paper addresses the question of how network topology affects the performance of different strategies for sentinel placement. We generate networks with varying amounts of degree heterogeneity as well as varying assortativity, in one case, and spatial structure in another. We simulate the spread of disease on these networks and introduce three sentinel placement strategies that utilize different aspects of the network topology. We then present results for a wide range parameter combinations to show that the best strategy for a given network depends on its topology.</p><p>The second part of this paper deals with the issue of incomplete data. We introduce three sentinel placement strategies and show that, in addition to the network structure, the performance depends also on the size of the sample. We discuss how the value of additional data decreases as the sample size increases. We finally explore the hypothesis that a known result from random graph theory can be used as a guide to help decide which strategy to employ.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Network topology and sentinel performance</title><p>We start from the intuitive hypothesis that nodes with the largest degree are the best candidates for placing sentinels since these nodes are typically the most likely to receive and propagate the disease. We will compare this idea to strategies that distribute the sentinels in such a way that each one covers a different region of the network. We test each strategy on a range of networks with different levels of degree heterogeneity, and different levels of either spatial or modular structure. We start by describing how these networks were generated and then describe the process of simulating epidemics on the networks. We then explore the consequences of implementing three strategies for sentinel placement and introduce two measures of efficacy for a sentinel placement based on the results of disease simulations.</p><sec id="sec004"><title>Generating synthetic networks</title><p>Our approach to generating networks with tunable degree heterogeneity and group assortativity (or spatial structure) is a modified version of the <italic>configuration model</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the basic model, <italic>N</italic> nodes are considered, and each node, <italic>i</italic>, is given a degree, <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. We can think of the node <italic>i</italic> as having <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> adjacent half edges (or stubs) attached to it. Each stub is then paired with another stub to create an edge. The pairs are randomly selected with the following conditions: (a) that the two stubs must belong to different nodes (no self-loops), and (b) the stubs must belong to pair of nodes that are not already connected (no multi-edges).</p><p>The goal is to create a degree distribution with a specified mean degree <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>, and standard deviation <italic>&#x003c3;</italic>, which will be our measure of degree heterogeneity. To achieve this we first assign <italic>&#x003bc;</italic> stubs to every node (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> = <italic>&#x003bc;</italic> for all <italic>i</italic>). We then begin a procedure of preferential rewiring: in each iteration two nodes, <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>, are selected. The first (<italic>i</italic>) is chosen randomly from all nodes that have degree greater than 1, and the second (<italic>j</italic>) is selected with probability proportional to its degree. A stub is then removed from the first node (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> :&#x02192; <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &#x02212; 1) and attached to the second (<italic>k</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> :&#x02192; <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> + 1). This process is repeated until the standard deviation of the node degrees is larger than the specified value <italic>&#x003c3;</italic>. The degree distributions generated through this process are compared with those of real networks described in the <italic>Data</italic> section.</p><p>We consider two classes of modified configuration model.

Initially the entire population is in the susceptible state except for one randomly selected seed node that is in the infectious state. Nodes that are in the infectious state infect their susceptible neighbours at a rate of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> per unit of time. When this occurs the susceptible neighbour will transition to the infectious state for a given infectious period duration before transitioning to the recovered state. We consider two possible ways to terminate the simulation:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><bold>Single seed</bold>: The simulation ends when all individuals are in either the susceptible or recovered state.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold>Multiple seed</bold>: After all individuals infected directly or indirectly from the initial seed are in the recovered state, a new seed is randomly selected from the remaining susceptible population and made to transition to the infectious state, thus allowing disease propagation to continue between the remaining susceptible nodes. This process repeats until the entire population is in the recovered state.</p></list-item></list><p>The multiple-seed simulation corresponds to diseases that remain hidden as they spread through a population; without the aid of sentinel surveillance they will reoccur indefinitely. The single-seed version, on the other hand, is more appropriate for diseases that result in the infected individual very quickly going to hospital where the disease will be diagnosed (and thus detected). Note that for the multiple-seed simulation it is not required that we specify the amount of time between the end of one outbreak and the beginning of the next.</p><p>For our analysis here we use an infectious period of duration 1 (without loss of generality since there are no units of time imposed) and transmission rate <italic>&#x003b2;</italic> = 0.5.

We have chosen two measures to give different results that complement each other. One drawback of the first measure is that when outbreak goes undetected we have &#x003a6;<sub><italic>A</italic></sub> = 0. Hence, the mean of &#x003a6;<sub><italic>A</italic></sub> over many simulations is deceptively small in sparse or fragmented networks where outbreaks tend to be very small. On the other hand, &#x003a6;<sub><italic>B</italic></sub> takes into account the small outbreaks, but the assumption that the disease will reappear in the population (after an unspecified amount of time) is unrealistic for diseases with considerable symptomatic burden that are likely to reveal themselves in other ways.

Consequently, the majority of the nodes are individuals who were referred by others but did not themselves participate in the survey. To create a network that realistically represents the potential pathways of transmission, we removed all nodes of degree one and took the largest connected component of the remaining network. In one case this component consisted of only a single node and so we omitted this dataset.</p><p>In addition to the 16 empirical networks described above, we created 200 synthetic networks using the processes described in the section <italic>generating synthetic networks</italic>.

The first 100 networks were generated using the modular model with the number of modules chosen uniformly at random between 3 and 8, the module size between 10 and 30, and the assortativity parameter between 0.4 and 1. The second 100 were generated using the spatial model with the number of nodes drawn uniformly between 100 and 200, and the connection radii between 10 and 60.

As the sample size increases all three of our strategies are able to exploit the additional data to their advantage and performance improves well above these baselines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007517.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Notably, most of the improvement results from increasing the sample size from 1% to 10%.

The rest of our analysis focuses on achieving additional improvements using strategies that exploit fragmentation.</p><p>Focusing on &#x003a6;<sub><italic>B</italic></sub>(Component) we immediately see that the performance improvement is not monotonic. The reason is as follows: as the sample size approaches a certain value, the small components begin to coalesce into a single large component, leaving many very small components made up mostly of peripheral nodes that typically have very few edges. By design the component strategy will select these peripheral nodes despite it being smarter to choose multiple sentinels from the large component (we discuss this further in the following section).

Thus, the proportional strategy can be considered to be the best option in cases where modularity is relatively high. In the cases where this strategy outperforms the global strategy, however, there are ranges of sample sizes over which the performance decreases; a situation we would clearly like to avoid. In the following section we introduce a method to approximate the sample size at which this behaviour occurs.</p><p>The equivalent results for the node sampling regime are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g004">Fig 4</xref>. At small sample sizes the largest components tend to consist of the highest degree nodes that were sampled directly and all of their neighbours (which all have a degree of 1 in the sample). Thus, in many cases the nodes chosen by the component strategy are the same as those chosen by the global strategy. For slightly larger sample sizes, nodes that have high degree in the sample are likely to be linked, directly or indirectly, to other high degree nodes, leaving one component containing many of the high degree nodes and a few smaller peripheral components containing only small degree nodes. Consequently, node sampling is notably worse than edge sampling for the component strategy.</p><fig id="pcbi.1007517.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007517.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Node sampling.</title><p>Strategy performance as a function of the number of nodes in the sample under the <italic>node</italic> sampling regime.

Hypothetically, a node could be connected to every other node in the network and not be selected as a focal node; if the number of focal nodes selected is smaller than the number of sentinels, then the hub will definitely be selected as a sentinel; if the number of focal nodes is higher, then it is possible that only the focal nodes will become sentinels and the best node, i.e. the hub, is rejected and the performance is worse than it was at a slightly smaller sample size.</p><p>We found the same conclusions can be made looking at the other performance measure &#x003a6;<sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, however, these results are more affected by characteristics of the network data. To test the robustness of our results we repeated the analysis using 3 and 10 sentinels (instead of 5) and found nothing that disagreed with the results as they are presented here. The corresponding figures for both sampling methods, performance measures, and number of sentinels, can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007517.s005">S5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007517.s016">S16</xref> Figs.</p><p>The important question to ask here is whether the component or proportional strategies should be chosen by policy-makers. Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g004">4</xref> show in some networks at particular ranges of sampling percentages that the global strategy is not the best choice on average. We find, however, that the distribution of values, &#x003a6;<sub><italic>A</italic></sub> and &#x003a6;<sub><italic>B</italic></sub>, over all performed simulations have large standard deviations. Hence, the values shown in these figures do not give a good indication of which strategy would give a better outcome for one particular network sample; as this is all we would expect to have in reality. The following section proposes a way to deal with this issue.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Connection to criticality in the configuration model</title><p>It appears that the component and proportional strategies perform best when the number of edges is large enough to give information about degrees of nodes, yet not so large that one component dominates the network. Following this, we pose that a result from graph theory that links degree heterogeneity to the percolation threshold in configuration model networks can be used to find this optimum sample size. The particular result, first found by Molloy and Reed [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and also found through different methods by Newman [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], connects the degree distribution of a network to the emergence of a giant component. Suppose we have a configuration model network with a large number of nodes, and <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> is the probability that a node has degree <italic>k</italic>, then the network has a giant component (defined as one that contains a finite fraction of the nodes in an infinite network) when

The previous result indicates that situations may occur for which the component strategy would be a preferable choice to the global strategy. While the Global strategy is the best option in the majority of circumstances, we might wish to know if circumstances also exist for which this is not the case. Based on our findings so far, we know that these cases are most likely to occur when the network is sufficiently fragmented (which is indicated by &#x02211;<sub><italic>k</italic></sub>
<italic>k</italic>(<italic>k</italic> &#x02212; 2)<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>k</italic></sub> &#x02264; 0), and also when modularity is high and heterogeneity is low.</p><p>To demonstrate this we take each individual sample over all sampling percentages and removed all those for which &#x02211;<sub><italic>k</italic></sub>

For those remaining <italic>sufficiently fragmented samples</italic> we used both the global and components strategies to find the sentinels. If the sentinels identified were exactly the same using both strategies then we omit these cases. If they are different then we compute the difference in their performance. We find that all the differences computed are significantly different to zero with extremely small p-values (Wilcoxon signed rank test with the Pratt method for dealing with zeros [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]).</p><p>The mean for &#x003a6;<sub><italic>B</italic></sub> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g006">Fig 6</xref> plotted against the heterogeneity and modularity of the underlying network (computed from the full data set, not the sample). We see that there are a considerable number of samples for which the component strategy would be preferred to the global strategy, and these are those for which heterogeneity is low and modularity is high.

Here we have explored just one of these challenges: the question of how to choose susceptible individuals for frequent monitoring in a way that is both effective and cheap. We have demonstrated through simulations on a range of networks, both empirical and synthetic, that network topology plays a significant role in determining the overall efficacy of a sentinel placement strategy. We have asked the question of whether a strategy that distributes sentinels across different regions of a network could outperform one that simply targets the most well connected nodes, and when should either strategy be applied.</p><p>We have demonstrated in the section <italic>Network topology and sentinel performance</italic>, the difference that network topology makes to the optimal choice of strategy. We observed that the segregation of nodes into different communities or spatial regions drives the performance of any given strategy, particularly in networks with low heterogeneity. This is most clearly the case when the standard deviation of the degree distribution is lower than a threshold somewhere around <italic>&#x003c3;</italic> &#x02248; 6. When we express this heterogeneity in same way as we have for the empirical networks, we get <italic>&#x003c3;</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>&#x003bc;</italic> = 7.2; a value that is larger than that found in any of the real networks.</p><p>From this we should expect that segregation, rather than heterogeneity, ought to be the principal reason why the performance of each strategy varies from one network to another. In fact, we do observe that modularity, here used as a measure of segregation, serves as a more reliable guide for choosing a strategy than heterogeneity; note that there are 4 networks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g003">Fig 3</xref> for which the global strategy is best at all sample sizes, and these are precisely the 4 for which modularity is lowest. Similarly, the component-based strategies perform best in those with highest modularity. While heterogeneity may have some effect, its influence is less apparent.</p><p>Finally, we have shown that the amount of data we have could also be informative in choosing the best strategy. Perhaps our most useful discovery is the result that the value of information decreases greatly as sample size increases, meaning that a 10% sample of the network can be almost as good as the whole thing. For networks that have a considerable amount of subdivision within the population, we have shown that the component-based strategies will perform better than the global strategy but only when the sample size is suitably small. Moreover, we can estimate by computing the left hand side of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007517.e003">Eq (3)</xref>, when this will be the case; a positive result suggests that the sample is larger than it needs to be to optimize the effectiveness of the component strategy (and possibly the proportional strategy).</p><p>While component based strategies can be worthwhile, it is usually the case that the most effective strategy is to simply target the highest degree individuals in the sample. This is more likely to be true when the node-sampling method is used such as when data was obtained through surveys of selected individuals (see [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] for an example). Link tracing and snowball sampling have also been found to be an effective way to obtain network contacts when privacy is an issue, as it would be in a community of drug users or a network of sexual relationships [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For this type of sampling component strategies would not be applicable as we would only have information from one component.</p><p>We have measured the success of each strategy by counting firstly, the number of cases that could potentially be prevented after detection; the advantage of this measure is that it is highest when (a) large outbreaks are detected, and (b) they are detected early; and secondly, the number of cases that occur before the disease becomes detected by a sentinel; this measure is most relevant to diseases that do not have extreme symptoms and can go undetected in the population for some time. Neither measure, however, takes into account the difficulties of actually preventing these cases. The method of prevention, for example vaccination, quarantine, or dissemination of information to the community, will take some amount of time and is unlikely to be 100% effective.</p><p>In some cases it may be possible to incorporate other sources of data. For example, we have assumed that all nodes are equally likely to be patient zero in our simulations whereas in many cases we might have a general idea about where the disease will originate from. For zoonotic disease like influenza it would be worth examining the benefits of placing sentinels close to farms or wildlife populations where such diseases are endemic. Questions also remain about whether our results apply to larger networks. In conclusion, the strategies and results we have presented here are not, in general, directly applicable real-world scenarios, but they may serve as guidelines for building more customized approaches.</p><p>We end this paper by commenting on the wider applicability of our results, and indeed all similar work in this area. Throughout the paper we have focused on the problem of infectious diseases, however, almost everything that has been said could equally be applied to several other contagion processes on networks such as computer viruses [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Another example is the spread of viral content on social media [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Here the question is which online accounts should be monitored to predict the online trends of the future. Lastly, these analyses could be applied to the spread of information in criminal networks [<xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The objective here would be to intercept the communications of individuals who are likely to be involved in the diffusion of information about a planned drug deal or terrorist attack.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec019"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1007517.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Empirical degree distributions.</title><p>The degree distributions for all the empirical networks.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1007517.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1007517.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Synthetic degree distributions.</title><p>The degree distributions for 16 arbitrarily selected synthetic networks from the collection of randomly parameterized networks.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1007517.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1007517.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Outbreak size distributions.</title><p>Outbreak size distributions for the single seed disease simulations for all the empirical networks.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1007517.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1007517.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Random strategies.</title><p>Comparison of benchmark strategies. results are presented for the percentage of cases before detection in the multi-outbreak simulation with 5 sentinels.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pcbi.1007517.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pcbi.1007517.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>CAD 3 sentinels node sampling.</title><p>Cases after detection for the single seed simulation with 3 sentinels over a range of subsamples generated by sampling nodes in the network.
