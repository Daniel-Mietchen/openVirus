<p>Unlike targeted vaccination, which remains a theoretical problem, sentinel surveillance is in active use, and, while vaccination strategies on networks have been studied in some depth, much less is known about sentinel surveillance. Moreover, recent results show the best candidates for vaccination are not necessarily the same as those for sentinel placement [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], fewer studies consider heuristic approaches that do not require perfect data [
