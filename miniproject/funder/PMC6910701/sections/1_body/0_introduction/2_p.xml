<p>This question is similar to the problem of disease control through immunization. A significant literature already exists addressing this problem through mathematical and computational modelling, with the main objective to find the 
 <italic>herd immunity threshold</italic>; defined as the proportion of the population one would need to immunize to ensure that local outbreaks do not develop into epidemics [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Much of this work is concerned with the networks of potential transmission pathways for the infectious diseases within a population [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since well connected nodes in such networks are both more likely to receive the infection, and to pass it on to others once they become infectious, it is prudent to locate these nodes and vaccinate them [
