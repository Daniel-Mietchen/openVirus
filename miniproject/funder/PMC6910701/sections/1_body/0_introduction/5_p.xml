<p>The first part of this paper addresses the question of how network topology affects the performance of different strategies for sentinel placement. We generate networks with varying amounts of degree heterogeneity as well as varying assortativity, in one case, and spatial structure in another. We simulate the spread of disease on these networks and introduce three sentinel placement strategies that utilize different aspects of the network topology. We then present results for a wide range parameter combinations to show that the best strategy for a given network depends on its topology.</p>
