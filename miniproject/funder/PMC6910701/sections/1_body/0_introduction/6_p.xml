<p>The second part of this paper deals with the issue of incomplete data. We introduce three sentinel placement strategies and show that, in addition to the network structure, the performance depends also on the size of the sample. We discuss how the value of additional data decreases as the sample size increases. We finally explore the hypothesis that a known result from random graph theory can be used as a guide to help decide which strategy to employ.</p>
