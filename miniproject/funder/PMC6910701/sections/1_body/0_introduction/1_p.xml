<p>Preventing epidemics is one of the major challenges in public health. In the effort to limit the damage caused by infectious diseases, governments often have to resort to costly vaccination schemes or suffer the human and economic consequences of implementing quarantine programmes. Naturally, there is much to be gained from initiatives that detect outbreaks during their early stages as it allows public health officials to locally contain the spread and prevent it from reaching the wider population. Such 
 <italic>sentinel surveillance</italic> schemes may involve the detection of influenza in airports [
