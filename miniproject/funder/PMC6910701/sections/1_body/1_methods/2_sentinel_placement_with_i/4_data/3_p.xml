<p>Furthermore, we obtained 8 networks created from surveys of individuals thought to be at risk of becoming infected with diseases through sexual or drug-taking contact [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A fraction of the participants in these studies were found through healthcare clinics while the remainder were found by referral from other participants; a process which is known to introduce biases in the data and is likely to give higher values of degree heterogeneity and lower levels of modularity than would a random sample [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Consequently, the majority of the nodes are individuals who were referred by others but did not themselves participate in the survey. To create a network that realistically represents the potential pathways of transmission, we removed all nodes of degree one and took the largest connected component of the remaining network. In one case this component consisted of only a single node and so we omitted this dataset.
