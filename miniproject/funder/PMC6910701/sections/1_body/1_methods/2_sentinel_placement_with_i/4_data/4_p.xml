<p>In addition to the 16 empirical networks described above, we created 200 synthetic networks using the processes described in the section 
 <italic>generating synthetic networks</italic>. These were generated with a range of randomly selected topological characteristics. The first 100 networks were generated using the modular model with the number of modules chosen uniformly at random between 3 and 8, the module size between 10 and 30, and the assortativity parameter between 0.4 and 1. The second 100 were generated using the spatial model with the number of nodes drawn uniformly between 100 and 200, and the connection radii between 10 and 60. In both the spatial and modular networks, the mean degree was chosen uniformly at random between 4 and 9, and the standard deviation of the degree distribution between 0 and 5.
