<p>We obtained 6 freely available datasets from the Sociopatterns project. This data was collected by providing participants with RFID technology that logged every instance in which two participants were within a short distance of each other. The settings in which these experiments were conducted are a conference [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], a hospital [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a primary school [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], a high school [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], an office workplace [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and a collection of households in rural Kenya [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A precise description of each experiment can be found in these references. In each case the data included contacts between pairs of participants and the time that the contact happened. From these data we constructed unweighted static (time-aggregated) networks in which nodes are participants and edges exist between any pair of participants who shared at least one contact.
