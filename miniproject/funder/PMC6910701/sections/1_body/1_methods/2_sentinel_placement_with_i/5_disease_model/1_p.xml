<p>The disease simulation was performed as described earlier. To adjust for the varying levels of connectivity across different networks we chose 
 <italic>β</italic> = 2/
 <italic>μ</italic> where 
 <italic>μ</italic> is the mean degree of the particular network. Thus, at the beginning of the outbreak, the randomly selected seed node is expected to infect 2 other individuals. For each network 10
 <sup>2</sup> outbreaks were simulated. Distribution of outbreak sizes are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007517.s003">S3 Fig</xref>. The three strategies were applied to 10
 <sup>3</sup> different random samples of each network using the edges sampling method, and again using node sampling. To evaluate the performance of each strategy we again use the same measures as before. The values presented for Φ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> and Φ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub> are the mean over all 10
 <sup>5</sup> combinations of edge sample and simulated outbreak.
