<p specific-use="continuation">Edge sampling is typically used when the available information is in the form of an interaction. For example, flights between airports, messages sent on social media and, potentially, proximity interactions recorded through mobile phones. Node sampling occurs when survey respondents are asked to name the people that they have interacted with; this is more typical for the hidden communities of, for example, drug users.</p>
