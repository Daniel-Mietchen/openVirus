<p>In both cases we expect that an incomplete sample network would be fragmented into a number of disconnected components, where a 
 <italic>component</italic> is defined as a set of nodes which are connected through a sequence of edges. Here we introduce strategies that take advantage of this fragmentation by exploiting the fact that different components are likely to belong to different regions of the complete network such as modules or spatial areas.
