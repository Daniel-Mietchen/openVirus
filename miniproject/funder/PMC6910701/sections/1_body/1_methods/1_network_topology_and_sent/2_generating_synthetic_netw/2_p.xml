<p>The goal is to create a degree distribution with a specified mean degree 
 <italic>μ</italic>, and standard deviation 
 <italic>σ</italic>, which will be our measure of degree heterogeneity. To achieve this we first assign 
 <italic>μ</italic> stubs to every node (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> = 
 <italic>μ</italic> for all 
 <italic>i</italic>). We then begin a procedure of preferential rewiring: in each iteration two nodes, 
 <italic>i</italic> and 
 <italic>j</italic>, are selected. The first (
 <italic>i</italic>) is chosen randomly from all nodes that have degree greater than 1, and the second (
 <italic>j</italic>) is selected with probability proportional to its degree. A stub is then removed from the first node (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> :→ 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> − 1) and attached to the second (
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sub> :→ 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sub> + 1). This process is repeated until the standard deviation of the node degrees is larger than the specified value 
 <italic>σ</italic>. The degree distributions generated through this process are compared with those of real networks described in the 
 <italic>Data</italic> section.
