<p>Our approach to generating networks with tunable degree heterogeneity and group assortativity (or spatial structure) is a modified version of the 
 <italic>configuration model</italic> [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the basic model, 
 <italic>N</italic> nodes are considered, and each node, 
 <italic>i</italic>, is given a degree, 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>. We can think of the node 
 <italic>i</italic> as having 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> adjacent half edges (or stubs) attached to it. Each stub is then paired with another stub to create an edge. The pairs are randomly selected with the following conditions: (a) that the two stubs must belong to different nodes (no self-loops), and (b) the stubs must belong to pair of nodes that are not already connected (no multi-edges).
