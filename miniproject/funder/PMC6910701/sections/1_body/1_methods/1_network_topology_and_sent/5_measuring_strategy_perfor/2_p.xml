<p>The second measure is applied to the multiple-seed disease simulation outcomes and counts the proportion of cases that occurred before the outbreak was detected, i.e. before it reached any of the sentinels.

 </disp-formula> We have chosen two measures to give different results that complement each other. One drawback of the first measure is that when outbreak goes undetected we have Φ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> = 0. Hence, the mean of Φ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> over many simulations is deceptively small in sparse or fragmented networks where outbreaks tend to be very small. On the other hand, Φ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub> takes into account the small outbreaks, but the assumption that the disease will reappear in the population (after an unspecified amount of time) is unrealistic for diseases with considerable symptomatic burden that are likely to reveal themselves in other ways. A range of alternative measures has been considered in [
