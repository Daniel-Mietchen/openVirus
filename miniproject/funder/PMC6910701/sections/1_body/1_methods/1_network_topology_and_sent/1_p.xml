<p>We start from the intuitive hypothesis that nodes with the largest degree are the best candidates for placing sentinels since these nodes are typically the most likely to receive and propagate the disease. We will compare this idea to strategies that distribute the sentinels in such a way that each one covers a different region of the network. We test each strategy on a range of networks with different levels of degree heterogeneity, and different levels of either spatial or modular structure. We start by describing how these networks were generated and then describe the process of simulating epidemics on the networks. We then explore the consequences of implementing three strategies for sentinel placement and introduce two measures of efficacy for a sentinel placement based on the results of disease simulations.</p>
