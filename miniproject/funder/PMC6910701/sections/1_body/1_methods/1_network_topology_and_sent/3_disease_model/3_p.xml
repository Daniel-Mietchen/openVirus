<p>The multiple-seed simulation corresponds to diseases that remain hidden as they spread through a population; without the aid of sentinel surveillance they will reoccur indefinitely. The single-seed version, on the other hand, is more appropriate for diseases that result in the infected individual very quickly going to hospital where the disease will be diagnosed (and thus detected). Note that for the multiple-seed simulation it is not required that we specify the amount of time between the end of one outbreak and the beginning of the next.</p>
