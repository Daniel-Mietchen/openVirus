   <bold>Multiple seed</bold>: After all individuals infected directly or indirectly from the initial seed are in the recovered state, a new seed is randomly selected from the remaining susceptible population and made to transition to the infectious state, thus allowing disease propagation to continue between the remaining susceptible nodes. This process repeats until the entire population is in the recovered state.
