<p>We use a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model of disease propagation. Initially the entire population is in the susceptible state except for one randomly selected seed node that is in the infectious state. Nodes that are in the infectious state infect their susceptible neighbours at a rate of 
 <italic>Î²</italic> per unit of time. When this occurs the susceptible neighbour will transition to the infectious state for a given infectious period duration before transitioning to the recovered state. We consider two possible ways to terminate the simulation:
