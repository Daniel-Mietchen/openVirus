<p>While component based strategies can be worthwhile, it is usually the case that the most effective strategy is to simply target the highest degree individuals in the sample. This is more likely to be true when the node-sampling method is used such as when data was obtained through surveys of selected individuals (see [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] for an example). Link tracing and snowball sampling have also been found to be an effective way to obtain network contacts when privacy is an issue, as it would be in a community of drug users or a network of sexual relationships [
