<p>We have demonstrated in the section 
 <italic>Network topology and sentinel performance</italic>, the difference that network topology makes to the optimal choice of strategy. We observed that the segregation of nodes into different communities or spatial regions drives the performance of any given strategy, particularly in networks with low heterogeneity. This is most clearly the case when the standard deviation of the degree distribution is lower than a threshold somewhere around 
 <italic>σ</italic> ≈ 6. When we express this heterogeneity in same way as we have for the empirical networks, we get 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>/
 <italic>μ</italic> = 7.2; a value that is larger than that found in any of the real networks.
