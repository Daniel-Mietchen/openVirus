<p>Finally, we have shown that the amount of data we have could also be informative in choosing the best strategy. Perhaps our most useful discovery is the result that the value of information decreases greatly as sample size increases, meaning that a 10% sample of the network can be almost as good as the whole thing. For networks that have a considerable amount of subdivision within the population, we have shown that the component-based strategies will perform better than the global strategy but only when the sample size is suitably small. Moreover, we can estimate by computing the left hand side of
