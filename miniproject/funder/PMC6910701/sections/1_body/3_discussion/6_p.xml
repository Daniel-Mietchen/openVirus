<p>We have measured the success of each strategy by counting firstly, the number of cases that could potentially be prevented after detection; the advantage of this measure is that it is highest when (a) large outbreaks are detected, and (b) they are detected early; and secondly, the number of cases that occur before the disease becomes detected by a sentinel; this measure is most relevant to diseases that do not have extreme symptoms and can go undetected in the population for some time. Neither measure, however, takes into account the difficulties of actually preventing these cases. The method of prevention, for example vaccination, quarantine, or dissemination of information to the community, will take some amount of time and is unlikely to be 100% effective.</p>
