<p>In some cases it may be possible to incorporate other sources of data. For example, we have assumed that all nodes are equally likely to be patient zero in our simulations whereas in many cases we might have a general idea about where the disease will originate from. For zoonotic disease like influenza it would be worth examining the benefits of placing sentinels close to farms or wildlife populations where such diseases are endemic. Questions also remain about whether our results apply to larger networks. In conclusion, the strategies and results we have presented here are not, in general, directly applicable real-world scenarios, but they may serve as guidelines for building more customized approaches.</p>
