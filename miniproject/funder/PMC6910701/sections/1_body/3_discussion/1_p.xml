<p>There are many obstacles in the effort to prevent future epidemics. Here we have explored just one of these challenges: the question of how to choose susceptible individuals for frequent monitoring in a way that is both effective and cheap. We have demonstrated through simulations on a range of networks, both empirical and synthetic, that network topology plays a significant role in determining the overall efficacy of a sentinel placement strategy. We have asked the question of whether a strategy that distributes sentinels across different regions of a network could outperform one that simply targets the most well connected nodes, and when should either strategy be applied.</p>
