<p>From this we should expect that segregation, rather than heterogeneity, ought to be the principal reason why the performance of each strategy varies from one network to another. In fact, we do observe that modularity, here used as a measure of segregation, serves as a more reliable guide for choosing a strategy than heterogeneity; note that there are 4 networks in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g003">Fig 3</xref> for which the global strategy is best at all sample sizes, and these are precisely the 4 for which modularity is lowest. Similarly, the component-based strategies perform best in those with highest modularity. While heterogeneity may have some effect, its influence is less apparent.
