<p>For the modular networks, when the degree distribution is relatively homogeneous, 
 <italic>σ</italic> ≲ 6, we see that the nodes selected using the global strategy are no better than when 
 <italic>σ</italic> = 0 and the sentinels are essentially random. This is also true for nodes selected by the modular strategy when 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.5, when edges are equally likely to appear within modules as they are between modules. We see that in disassortative networks, when 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.5, that the global strategy performs better than the modular strategy, whereas when 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.5 the opposite is the case. As we look at networks with higher degree heterogeneity 
 <italic>σ</italic> ≳ 6 we see that the global strategy starts to beat the modular strategy even in assortative networks (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.5) until eventually, at 
 <italic>σ</italic> ≈ 18, the global strategy dominates for all levels of assortativity.
