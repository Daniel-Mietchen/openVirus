<p>A similar story can be told for the spatial networks. In networks with homogeneous degree distributions, the spatial strategy is preferred for when the connection radius is small. We have chosen only to plot values of 
 <italic>r</italic> up to 10
 <sup>2</sup> since beyond this point edges can potentially appear between any two nodes making the network equivalent to the original configuration model. However, the threshold value for which the spatial strategy is no longer preferred to the global strategy appears at around 
 <italic>r</italic> â‰ˆ 50. Again, the spatial strategy becomes increasingly redundant as we look at networks with larger degree heterogeneity.
