<p>The proportional strategy improves on the component strategy by eliminating the possibility of choosing nodes from very small, peripheral, components. Since it retains the advantages of the component strategy at small sample sizes, we observe that it is always at least as good as the component strategy. Thus, the proportional strategy can be considered to be the best option in cases where modularity is relatively high. In the cases where this strategy outperforms the global strategy, however, there are ranges of sample sizes over which the performance decreases; a situation we would clearly like to avoid. In the following section we introduce a method to approximate the sample size at which this behaviour occurs.</p>
