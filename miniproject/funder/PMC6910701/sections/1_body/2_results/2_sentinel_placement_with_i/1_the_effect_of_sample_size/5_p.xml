<p>To see how network topology influences the outcomes we computed the maximum modularity, 
 <italic>Q</italic>, of each network using the Louvain method [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] (hereafter referred to simply as modularity), and the normalized heterogeneity of the degree distribution 
 <italic>σ</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>/
 <italic>μ</italic> where 
 <italic>μ</italic> and 
 <italic>σ</italic> are the mean and standard deviation of the degree distribution respectively. These values are shown in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. We observe in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g003">Fig 3</xref> that the networks for which the component strategy is, at small sample sizes, better than the degree strategy, are those for which modularity is highest. Heterogeneity, on the other hand, does not appear to influence the relative performance of the strategies as strongly, nor do the number of nodes and the number of edges despite their known effects on modularity.
