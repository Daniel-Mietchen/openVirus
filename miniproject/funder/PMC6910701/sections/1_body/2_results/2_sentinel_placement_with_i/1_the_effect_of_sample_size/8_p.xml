<p>There are a few cases when node sampling is applied and the performance of the global strategy does not monotonically increase with sample size. One possible reason is as follows: at small sample sizes, the sentinel nodes are those selected as focal nodes during the sampling process (their degree is highest due to the sampling procedure). Hypothetically, a node could be connected to every other node in the network and not be selected as a focal node; if the number of focal nodes selected is smaller than the number of sentinels, then the hub will definitely be selected as a sentinel; if the number of focal nodes is higher, then it is possible that only the focal nodes will become sentinels and the best node, i.e. the hub, is rejected and the performance is worse than it was at a slightly smaller sample size.</p>
