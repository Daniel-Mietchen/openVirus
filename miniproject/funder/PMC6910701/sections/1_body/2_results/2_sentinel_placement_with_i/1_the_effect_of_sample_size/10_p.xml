<p>The important question to ask here is whether the component or proportional strategies should be chosen by policy-makers. Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g004">4</xref> show in some networks at particular ranges of sampling percentages that the global strategy is not the best choice on average. We find, however, that the distribution of values, Φ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> and Φ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub>, over all performed simulations have large standard deviations. Hence, the values shown in these figures do not give a good indication of which strategy would give a better outcome for one particular network sample; as this is all we would expect to have in reality. The following section proposes a way to deal with this issue.
