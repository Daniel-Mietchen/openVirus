<p>The equivalent results for the node sampling regime are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g004">Fig 4</xref>. At small sample sizes the largest components tend to consist of the highest degree nodes that were sampled directly and all of their neighbours (which all have a degree of 1 in the sample). Thus, in many cases the nodes chosen by the component strategy are the same as those chosen by the global strategy. For slightly larger sample sizes, nodes that have high degree in the sample are likely to be linked, directly or indirectly, to other high degree nodes, leaving one component containing many of the high degree nodes and a few smaller peripheral components containing only small degree nodes. Consequently, node sampling is notably worse than edge sampling for the component strategy.
