<p>When the sample size is 0, the strategies are equivalent to simply choosing random nodes. When the number of edges is approximately the same as the number of sentinels, all three strategies act in a way that is similar to acquaintance selection, whereby sentinel nodes are selected by following a random edges of a randomly selected node (this method has been demonstrated to be better than a purely random strategy) [
