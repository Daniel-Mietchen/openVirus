<p>Focusing on Φ

 </sub>(Component) we immediately see that the performance improvement is not monotonic. The reason is as follows: as the sample size approaches a certain value, the small components begin to coalesce into a single large component, leaving many very small components made up mostly of peripheral nodes that typically have very few edges. By design the component strategy will select these peripheral nodes despite it being smarter to choose multiple sentinels from the large component (we discuss this further in the following section). Finally, as the large component begins to account for the entire network, Φ

 </sub>(Component) begins to decreases again as it starts to choose multiple sentinels from the large component.
