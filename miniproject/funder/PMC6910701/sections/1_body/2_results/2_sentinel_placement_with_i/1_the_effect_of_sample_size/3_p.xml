<p>Notably, most of the improvement results from increasing the sample size from 1% to 10%. Beyond 10% the value of information, i.e. the performance gained with each additional edge sampled, is significantly lower. We conclude then, that in many situations it may not be efficient to gather information about the entire networkâ€”a relatively small sample may be more cost-effective. The rest of our analysis focuses on achieving additional improvements using strategies that exploit fragmentation.</p>
