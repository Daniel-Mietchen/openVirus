<p>Our final analysis addresses the question of whether these results relevant or useful in any way. The previous result indicates that situations may occur for which the component strategy would be a preferable choice to the global strategy. While the Global strategy is the best option in the majority of circumstances, we might wish to know if circumstances also exist for which this is not the case. Based on our findings so far, we know that these cases are most likely to occur when the network is sufficiently fragmented (which is indicated by ∑
