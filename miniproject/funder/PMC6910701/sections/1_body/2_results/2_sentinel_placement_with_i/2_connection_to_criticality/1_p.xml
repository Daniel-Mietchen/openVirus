<p>It appears that the component and proportional strategies perform best when the number of edges is large enough to give information about degrees of nodes, yet not so large that one component dominates the network. Following this, we pose that a result from graph theory that links degree heterogeneity to the percolation threshold in configuration model networks can be used to find this optimum sample size. The particular result, first found by Molloy and Reed [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and also found through different methods by Newman [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007517.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], connects the degree distribution of a network to the emergence of a giant component. Suppose we have a configuration model network with a large number of nodes, and

 <italic>k</italic>, then the network has a giant component (defined as one that contains a finite fraction of the nodes in an infinite network) when
