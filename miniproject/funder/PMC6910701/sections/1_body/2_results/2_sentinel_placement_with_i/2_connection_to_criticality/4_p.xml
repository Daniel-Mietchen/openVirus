<p>We see in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g005">Fig 5</xref> that the sample size calculated from 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007517.e003">Eq (3)</xref> corresponds very closely to the sample size that minimizes the number of cases before detection for the component strategy. If one was to use this as a guide for deciding how much data to collect, given that they are using the component or proportional strategy, they will on average be within 2% of the optimum. For the samples generated using the node sampling method we find that this result is not applicable. The increased degree heterogeneity of the sample causes the left hand side of 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007517.e003">Eq (3)</xref> to always be greater than 0.
