<p>The mean for Φ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub> is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g006">Fig 6</xref> plotted against the heterogeneity and modularity of the underlying network (computed from the full data set, not the sample). We see that there are a considerable number of samples for which the component strategy would be preferred to the global strategy, and these are those for which heterogeneity is low and modularity is high. The corresponding figures for Φ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> for different sampling methods and numbers of sentinels are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007517.s017">S17</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007517.s018">S18</xref> Figs.
