<p>To demonstrate this we take each individual sample over all sampling percentages and removed all those for which ∑
 <sub>
  <italic>k</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>k</italic>(
 <italic>k</italic> − 2)
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>k</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 0. For those remaining 
 <italic>sufficiently fragmented samples</italic> we used both the global and components strategies to find the sentinels. If the sentinels identified were exactly the same using both strategies then we omit these cases. If they are different then we compute the difference in their performance. We find that all the differences computed are significantly different to zero with extremely small p-values (Wilcoxon signed rank test with the Pratt method for dealing with zeros [
