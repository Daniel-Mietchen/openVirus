<p>This formula connects to our approach to sentinel placement in the following way: for any given sample of edges we can infer a value of 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>k</italic>
 </sub> by dividing the number of nodes that have degree 
 <italic>k</italic> in the sample by 
 <italic>N</italic>, the total number of nodes. If the sample of the empirical network shows some level of similarly to the configuration model, then it is likely that a dominant component will form when 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007517.e003">Eq (3)</xref> is satisfied. Moreover, we postulate that the sample size for which this is most likely to be true will also be the sample size that yields the best results for the component-based strategies.
