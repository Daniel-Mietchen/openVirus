  <title>Edge sampling.</title>
  <p>Strategy performance as a function of the number of edges in the sample under the 
   <italic>edge</italic> sampling regime. Each plot corresponds to a different empirical network. Each line represents a different strategy. Results are given as the mean percentage of the nodes in the network infected before at least one sentinel was infected. The vertical red line corresponds to the threshold value found using the method described in the section 
   <italic>Connection to criticality in the configuration model</italic>.
