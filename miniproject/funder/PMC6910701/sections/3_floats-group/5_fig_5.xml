  <title>Theory as a predictor of optimal sample size.</title>
  <p>(a) Upper: The grey line represents the component strategy when applied to the high school network data as seen in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007517.g003">Fig 3</xref>. The solid red line represents the left hand side of 
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007517.e003">Eq (3)</xref> as a function of the sample size. The dashed lines indicate the sample size for which 
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007517.e003">Eq (3)</xref> is satisfied. Lower: The size of the largest connected component in the sample and the number of components. (b) Each point represents one network. The dashed line represents where both these values are the same. The optimal value is the location of the first local minimum as we look at increasing sample sizes. The error value presented is the mean absolute error.
