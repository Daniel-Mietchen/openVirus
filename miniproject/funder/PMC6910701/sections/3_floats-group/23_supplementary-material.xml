  <title>CAD MR method.</title>
  <p>Difference in the number of cases after detection for sufficiently fragmented samples. Each marker represents one network. Empirical networks are represented by star shaped markers, synthetic networks are represented by circles. The edge sampling method was used and only samples that were evaluated to be sufficiently fragmented contribute to the results shown here. Red markers show where the global strategy performs better, i.e. prevents a larger number of cases, than the component strategy.</p>
