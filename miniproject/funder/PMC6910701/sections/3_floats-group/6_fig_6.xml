  <title>Difference in the number of cases before detection for sufficiently fragmented samples.</title>
  <p>Each marker represents one of the networks described in the Data section. Empirical networks are represented by star shaped markers, synthetic networks are represented by circles. The edge sampling method was used and only samples that were evaluated to be sufficiently fragmented contribute to the results shown here (the corresponding figure for node sampling is presented in the supplement). Red markers show where the global strategy performs better, i.e. yields a smaller number of cases, than the component strategy.</p>
