<p>All measurements were done at baseline (day before start of fasting) and at the end of therapy (day after last fasting day). Anthropometrical measurements (height, weight, and waist circumference) and blood samples for laboratory assessments were taken between 7.00 and 10.00 a.m. Glucose was measured using the hexokinase 3 method (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany; coefficients of variation (CV) 11%; normal range 3.9–5.5 mmoL/L); HbA1c by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC; Tosoh Bioscience, Griesheim, Germany, CV 10%, normal &lt;42 mmoL/moL); total cholesterol (TC) by enzymatic color reaction (Siemens; CV 7%; normal &lt;5.2 mmoL/L); triglycerides (TG) by glycerol phosphate oxidase (GPO)/Trinder enzymatic color reaction (Siemens; CV 9%; normal &lt;1.7 mmoL/L); high density lipoprotein (HDL) by a two step catalase–elimination reaction (Siemens; CV 9%; range 1.2–3.1 mmoL/L); and low density lipoprotein (LDL) by a two–step catalase–elimination reaction (Siemens; CV 6.2%; normal &lt;4.1 mmoL/L). Glutamate–oxalacetate transferase (GOT), glutamate–pyruvate transferase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (AP), and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) were measured by standard methods. </p>
