<p>Additionally, a binary logistic regression model was applied for a positive outcome (defined as FLI ≤60 after intervention) only for the subjects who had a baseline FLI &gt;60. Independent variables were gender, age, number of fasting days, GOT, GPT, total cholesterol, diabetes, and baseline FLI. Receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis of predicted probabilities was performed, and the area under curve (AUC) with 95% CI was calculated to measure the accuracy of the model. The discrimination of this model was assessed by comparing the predicted probabilities with the binary outcomes (FLI ≤ 60) of each patient in the ROC analysis.</p>
