<p>The data were presented as means ± standard deviation (SD), if not otherwise indicated. D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus normality test was used to verify the normal data distribution. Changes between baseline and end of intervention were compared by the paired test for normally distributed data and the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test for non-parametric data. To determine possible differential effects in diabetic patients, all participants (group all) were clustered in non-diabetic subjects (fasting glucose &lt;7 mmoL /L and HbA1c &lt;47 mmoL/moL) and patients with T2DM (fasting glucose ≥7 and/or HbA1c ≥47 mmoL/moL). Group differences were calculated with the unpaired test for parametric data or Mann Whitney U test for non-parametric data. Correlations analyses were performed by the Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients, depending on the normal distribution of the data.</p>
