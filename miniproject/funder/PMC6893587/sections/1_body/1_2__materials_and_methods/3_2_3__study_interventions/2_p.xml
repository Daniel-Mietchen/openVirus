It was recommended to drink at least 2 liters of water/day. The duration of fasting was adapted to the individual therapeutic goal and tolerance, and was then followed by stepwise reintroduction of food. The latter consisted of ovo-lacto-vegetarian food increasing from 800 kcal/day to 1800 kcal/day over at least 3 days. The fasting therapy was accompanied by a physical exercise program with moderate walking and gymnastics as group activities, paralleled by group sessions in mindfulness, and relaxation techniques as autogenic training and meditation.</p>
