<p>There is a large body of evidence on the beneficial effects of carbohydrate restriction and hypocaloric diets on NAFLD [
 <xref rid="B33-nutrients-11-02601" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It has also been shown that-at equal levels of weight reduction-a carbohydrate-restricted diet leads to a significantly greater intrahepatic triglyceride reduction than low-calorie diet alone [
 <xref rid="B34-nutrients-11-02601" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The metabolic advantage of carbohydrate restriction appears to be related to a more pronounced lipid oxidation and enhanced ketogenesis. In recent years, intermittent and periodic fasting has gained popularity as an alternative to continuous caloric restriction. In addition to the weight loss effects, periodic fasting is associated with several metabolic benefits, including the improvement of lipid profiles [

The key mechanism responsible for many of these beneficial effects is the metabolic switch from the utilization of glycogenolysis-derived glucose to fatty acids and fatty acid-derived ketones, i.e., a fundamental switch from lipid synthesis and fat storage to mobilization of fat in the form of free fatty acids and fatty acid-derived ketones. This occurs between 12 and 36 hours after cessation of food consumption [
