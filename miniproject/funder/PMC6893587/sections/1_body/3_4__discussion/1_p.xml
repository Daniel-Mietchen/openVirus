<p>Diet interventions are well-established strategies to reduce body weight and improve glucose metabolism, however no evidence exists about the effects of periodic fasting on NAFLD. This study is the first to show the beneficial effects of periodic fasting on fatty liver. The results of our study supported the hypothesis that FLI, a surrogate parameter of fatty liver, significantly decreases in individuals with and without T2DM after a fasting intervention of at least 6 days. The prospective study design according to a standardized protocol with a well-established fasting technique and a close clinical monitoring was a strength of this study.</p>
