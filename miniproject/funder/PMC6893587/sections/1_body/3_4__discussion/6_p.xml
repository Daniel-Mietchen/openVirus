<p>Our data provided first evidence that periodic fasting leads to a clearance of liver fat: fasting significantly reduced FLI and increased the proportion of patients without NAFLD (FLI &lt; 30 units; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="nutrients-11-02601-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The effects of fasting therapy were stronger in males and in individuals with higher baseline FLI, higher GOT, and higher cholesterol levels. Each additional fasting day further decreased the FLI. The binary logistic regression showed that every day of fasting increase by 40% the chance to improve a manifest fatty liver (FLI &gt; 60) and switch to a lower category of risk. This implies that the duration of fasting must be sufficient to influence fatty liver positively. This should be taken into account when periodic fasting is considered as treatment for NAFLD.
