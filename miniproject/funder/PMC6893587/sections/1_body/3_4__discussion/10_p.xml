<p>Our observational study has some limitations. The analyses were carried out as pre- to post intervention changes, without a control group, and were focused on FLI as surrogate parameter for NAFLD, which have been shown to correlate with MRI assessments of fatty liver [

MRI assessments are regarded as the gold standard for the diagnostics of NAFLD, but this type of external control was not feasible in this large observational study. There was also no significant difference in fasting duration between diabetic and non-diabetic patients, but we did not match the groups before intervention because of the very different numbers of individuals in each group. Finally, we could not collect data on long-term effects after the fasting intervention, therefore a prediction of sustainability of the fasting effects on hepatic changes is not possible. Lean et al. reported that at 12 months almost half of T2DM patients achieved remission to a no-diabetic state and off antidiabetic drugs after intervention with 3–5 months of formula diet (825–853 kcal/day). It is reasonable to expect that periodic fasting gains similar effects in shorter time with good tolerance [
