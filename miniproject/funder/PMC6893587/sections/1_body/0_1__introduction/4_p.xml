<p>The amount of liver fat can be determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or biopsy, but it can also be calculated by the fatty liver index (FLI), which has been shown to closely correlate with the results of the MRI [
 <xref rid="B12-nutrients-11-02601" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The FLI is calculated on the basis of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, triglycerides (TG), and gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) [
 <xref rid="B13-nutrients-11-02601" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], a calculation that permits an easy detection of NAFLD and also allows a non-instrumental monitoring of treatment effects. The FLI score ranges from 0 to 100, with FLI &lt;30 excluding and â‰¥60 confirming a diagnosis of fatty liver (including NAFLD).
