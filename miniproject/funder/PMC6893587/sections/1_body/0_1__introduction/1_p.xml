 <xref rid="B1-nutrients-11-02601" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and consists of a disease spectrum including fatty liver, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis. The least advanced stage of disease, the non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL, or simple steatosis), is characterized by an excess of fat in the liver and is mostly asymptomatic [

 <xref rid="B3-nutrients-11-02601" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The burden of disease is rapidly increasing, mainly due to the rising prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyle, considering that as many as 50% of patients with simple steatosis proceed to develop a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [
