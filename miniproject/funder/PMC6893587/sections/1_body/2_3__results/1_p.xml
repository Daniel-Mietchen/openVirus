<p>Of 1500 screened subjects, 741 were included in the study as per inclusion/exclusion criteria. Of these, 44 dropped out due to: periodic fasting days &lt;6 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 27), recently diagnosed liver disease (
 <italic>n</italic> = 12), or non-compliance (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5). Thus, 697 subjects completed the study and were analyzed per protocol. The mean fasting duration was 8.5 ± 4.0 days (range 6–38), with no significant difference (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.261) between subjects with T2DM (9.3 ± 4.8 days, range 6–31) or without T2DM (8.4 ± 4.0 days, range 6–38).
