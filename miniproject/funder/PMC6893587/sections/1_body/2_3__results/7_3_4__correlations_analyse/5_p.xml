<p>Predictors of changes in FLI were analyzed in a multivariate linear regression model with gender, age, number of fasting days, GOT, GPT, total cholesterol, diabetes, and baseline FLI as independent variables. FLI decreased on average by 0.48 points with each additional fasting day (regression coefficient beta: −0.48, 95% CI −0.665 to −0.295, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). FLI reduction was also nearly 4 points higher for males (−3.94, 95% CI −5.780 to −2.10, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) than for females. GOT (10.61, 95% CI 4.77 to 16.46, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), baseline FLI (−0.139, 95% CI −0.169 to −0.110, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and total cholesterol (0.027, 95% CI −0.044 to −0.010, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) were also significant predictors in this model. A ROC curve was calculated to test the performance of this model (input variables: gender, age, number of fasting days, GOT, GPT, total cholesterol, diabetes, and baseline FLI) in discriminating the capability to shift from a FLI &gt; 60 to a FLI ≤ 60 due to periodic fasting (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
