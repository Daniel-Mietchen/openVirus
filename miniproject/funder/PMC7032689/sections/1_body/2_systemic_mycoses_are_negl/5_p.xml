<p>The fact that there are no licensed antifungal vaccines underscores another clear failure in science. Similarly, reliable diagnostic methods are available for a very limited number of mycoses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and therapeutic options are restricted to a few classes of drugs that too frequently are associated to both intrinsic and acquired resistance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], toxic, and expensive [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In fact, innovative tools to combat invasive mycoses are rare and of slow development. For illustration, the most recently developed antifungals (echinocandins) were approved for clinical use in 2002 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], reinforcing a major science failure in the area. It is noteworthy that this class of drugs is ineffective against various high-mortality mycoses [
