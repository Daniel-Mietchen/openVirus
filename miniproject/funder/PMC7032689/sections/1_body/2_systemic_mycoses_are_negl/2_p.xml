<p>The number of diseases that meet the above criteria is regrettably higher than would be expected for the second decade of the current millennium. This number, however, is underestimated, as several important syndromes fit these criteria but are not formally recognized as such, including systemic mycoses. Indeed, most high-mortality mycoses remain ignored by public health authorities and decision-makers. The financial support for fungal disease research is incredibly lower than the funding available for other infectious diseases that cause similar mortality [

Investment per death corresponds to US$334 for tuberculosis, US$276 for diarrheal diseases, and only US$31 for cryptococcal meningitis [

For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recently included mycetoma, chromoblastomycosis, and “other deep mycoses” in the list of neglected tropical diseases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but specific information on WHO plans to combat fungal diseases is not yet available. Research on histoplasmosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, and sporotrichosis receives negligible funding [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although these diseases are associated with high rates of mortality or the generation of conditions that hinder the performance of professional functions and social integration [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], none of them has been formally recognized as neglected diseases by WHO.
