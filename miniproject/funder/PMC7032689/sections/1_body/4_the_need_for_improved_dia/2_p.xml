<p>The impact of this condition on human health is clear. For example, 
 <italic>Exserohilum</italic> diseases before the 2012 United States outbreak manifested as rare systemic, cutaneous, corneal, and subcutaneous infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As the causative agent of the meningitis outbreak, 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>rostratum</italic> was identified 1 month after the first meningitis case was reported, when the CDC announced that 
 <italic>E</italic>. 
 <italic>rostratum</italic> was recovered from unopened vials of steroid injections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Similar problems occurred with necrotizing mucormycosis, a devastating complication of wounds caused by 
 <italic>Apophysomyces</italic> sp., 
 <italic>Saksenaea</italic> sp., and 
 <italic>Lichtheimia</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Late laboratory diagnosis of cases of necrotizing mucormycosis caused by 
 <italic>Apophysomyces trapeziformis</italic> resulted in 5 deaths in Missouri in 2011 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Addressing the epidemic of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>auris</italic> has also been impeded by inherent deficiencies with classical laboratory methods utilized by many clinical laboratories as well as public health institutions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These cases reinforce the notion that tests rapidly identifying infecting fungi have the potential to impact the course of fungal diseases beneficially.
