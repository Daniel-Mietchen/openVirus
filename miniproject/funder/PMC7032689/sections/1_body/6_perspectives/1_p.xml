<p>There are ongoing initiatives to develop antifungal vaccines and drugs with the potential to control invasive mycoses [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, the distance between promising laboratory results and the translation of knowledge into benefits to the general population is unquestionably long. In fungal diseases, this distance is apparently longer, considering the lack of investment in science and technology in association with the science, market, and public health failures discussed here. The situation is even more complex if one considers the emergence of multiresistant and still largely unknown pathogens such as 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>auris</italic>. The impact of emerging infections of this nature on human health is still hard to predict, but, as 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>auris</italic> is now spread across the globe, the reality is that such infections can lead to significant morbidity and mortality as well as have vast economic consequences. Thus, it seems clear that public health authorities and decision-makers need to more thoughtfully and closely consider invasive fungal diseases as a real and contemporary problem to avoid disasters historically observed in other models of infectious diseases. The fact that fungal diseases are not spread at the same rate as other microbial transmissible diseases causing epidemics does not mean they are less relevant in terms of the number of attained individuals. Furthermore, the fact that they are less studied represents an enormous risk given the new potential threats as a consequence of environmental deterioration and global warming.
