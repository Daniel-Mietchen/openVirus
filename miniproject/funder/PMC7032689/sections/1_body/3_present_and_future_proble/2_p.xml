<p>There is also a growing perception that climate change directly impacts the ability of fungi to cause damage to the human host. Recently, the multiresistant pathogen 
 <italic>Candida auris</italic> has emerged as a serious global threat to human health, causing infections resistant to all major classes of antifungal drugs in immunocompromised patients [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>auris</italic> differs from most other 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species in several aspects. As recently reviewed by Lockhart, 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>auris</italic> colonizes the skin rather than the gastrointestinal tract and is extremely resilient in the environment [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This resiliency has led to the fungus being associated with healthcare outbreaks, which have been exceedingly difficult to control due to the remarkable difficulty in eradicating the fungus from both patients and the environment [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Also of great concern, antimicrobial resistance in 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>auris</italic> is more common than susceptibility to antifungals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The spread of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>auris</italic> disease is linked to clonal isolates recovered from India, Venezuela, and South Africa between 2012 and 2015. Widespread use of antifungal drugs has been suggested as a determining factor for the emergence of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>auris</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Another hypothesis for the emergence of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>auris</italic> suggests that the fungus has recently acquired the virulence characteristics required to cause damage to human hosts. Although these explanations cannot be ruled out, it is unlikely that these changes occurred simultaneously on 3 continents. In this sense, it has recently been proposed that isolates of 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>auris</italic> adapted to the human body temperature through selection from high-temperature regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, this would be the first example of a novel human fungal pathogen that emerged as a result of global warming, which would explain several of its pathogenic characteristics. This observation demonstrates an important link between climate change and infectious diseases. Importantly, new threats to human health might still occur through climate adaptation mechanisms of zoonotic fungi, as proposed for 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>auris</italic>.
