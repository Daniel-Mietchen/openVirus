<p>Funding for research on fungal diseases is unquestionably small compared to funding available for other infectious diseases that cause similar mortality [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As an illustration, funding for research on cryptococcal meningitis, the fifth deadliest infectious disease, receives 4.3-fold less funding than the disease caused by the bacterial pathogen

 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Of concern, reports submitted between 2008 and 2017 on funding for neglected diseases show that cryptococcal meningitis was the only measurably funded fungal disease, accounting for 0.5% of the total invested [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007964.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Tuberculosis, for comparison, had a 34-fold higher investment. Other fungal diseases were not even included in these reports. Specifically, neglected mycoses of unquestionable clinical importance—such as paracoccidioidomycosis, mycetoma, sporotrichosis, and chromoblastomycosis—have not even been mentioned in the report, suggesting that these research areas have received negligible funding. These observations were fully confirmed by direct analysis of scientific articles declaring financial support from major international agencies with a history of supporting neglected disease research [
