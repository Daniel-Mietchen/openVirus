<p>The main point that we wish to address is how to interpret different trajectories of an intrinsic stochastic process. To illustrate this point, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows 100 realizations of the simple stochastic pure birth model with rate parameter α = 0.1 time-unit
 <sup>−1</sup> measured without error at integer times. If we use a naive deterministic approach (top of Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), we fit 
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) = 
 <italic>e</italic>
 <sup>α
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sup> to each trajectory (data set) and estimate α independently, obtaining a distribution for this parameter (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, bottom panel). If this process were observed at time 25, it would be tempting to conclude that there is a high degree of heterogeneity in the growth rates of these epidemics. Even by time 75, when the expected population size is over 1,000, we still see a large heterogeneity in the estimated rates.
