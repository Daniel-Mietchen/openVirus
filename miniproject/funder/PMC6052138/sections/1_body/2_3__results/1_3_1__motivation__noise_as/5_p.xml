<p>Another possible deterministic fitting approach is to allow for random effects, where we assume an underlying distribution (e.g., normal) for the growth rate parameter (Î±) and allow each trajectory to be the realization of a pure birth process with parameter drawn from that distribution (Gelman and Hill, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In this case, the estimation method yields the parameters of the distribution (i.e., the mean and variance). This is a mixed effects approach, where we still assume no stochasticity and that all differences are due to parametric variability.
