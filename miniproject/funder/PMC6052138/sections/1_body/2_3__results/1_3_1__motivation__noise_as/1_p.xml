<p>Traditional inference is based on maximum likelihood estimates of some well-defined functions. For instance, for the cases considered here (pure birth and birth-death) an ODE-based deterministic approximation provides differential equations that, upon solving, can be fit to the data to determine the parameters (μ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> = α and μ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub> = γ) that best describe the data (see Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, and Appendix 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">B</xref> for a succinct derivation for the pure birth case). Similarly, the stochastic version of those models can be solved and in that case one could also fit the mean and variance of a given observable (last two rows in Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), and indeed higher moments.
