<p>In these cases, as the models are linear, both deterministic and stochastic predictions for the average are the same (because averaging and integrating the evolution equation are exchangeable operations). However, the latter has the benefit that it also allows to fit the variance of the data (thus, in principle, increasing the reliability of the inferred parameters).</p>
