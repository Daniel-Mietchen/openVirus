<p>As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, the deterministic CIs do not include the real value of σ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub>, albeit the estimate of μ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> is accurate enough. To test the ability of different methods to quantify the relevance of parametric variance vs. noise (through 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>), we use the estimation of σ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> from the different methods with Equation (5), at the final observation, 
 <italic>t</italic> = 20. The results are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>. Note that the stochastic prediction, at least, is able to include the real 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> inside the whisker, especially at low values of parametric variability. This means that this fitting method is able to capture (in a probabilistic way) the cases where parametric variance is not as relevant as fluctuations.
