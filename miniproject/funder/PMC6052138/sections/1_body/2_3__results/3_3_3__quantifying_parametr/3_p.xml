<p>While Equation (5) was derived under the assumption of an unerlying stochastic process, and traditional methods ignore the stochasticity of the underlying process, we can still use hybrid information to obtain a 
 <italic>rough</italic> estimate the relative weight between noise and parametric variance. We can mix both approaches (linear mixed-effect models and stochatic predictions) in two ways: In the first one (corresponding to the red empty squares in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) we use μ

  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> and σ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> from the linear mixed-effects model fit to the data in Equation (5). The second method, consists in calculating the empirical variance of the data and the expected value of the noise variance from Equation (8) and calculate 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> using Equation (4). Remarkably, inspection of Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref> (green empty diamonds) suggest that using this second method, the estimated value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> is sometimes closer to the original one.
