<p>We have used throughout simulation-based inference, because it allows us to compare directly likelihood profiles between stochastic and deterministic implementations of the models. Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that traditional methods (based, loosely speaking, on regression) are usually the preferred way to estimate parameters from the data. This is not a matter of taste but of computational efficiency. Even for the simple models in the present work, simulation-based inference is computationally expensive (and, as such, not suitable as of writing for models with many parameters). Thus, for the sake of completeness we discuss briefly the role of regression-based methods in our framework and fit the data in Experiment 4 using a standard linear mixed-effect model (Gelman and Hill,
