<p>The effects of increasing the number of observations per units was similar to increasing the number of units in the panel. For both the stochastic and deterministic fits, the mean growth rates where correctly estimated. As before, the deterministic fit consistently overestimated the standard deviation in the growth rates and increasing the number of observations per unit led to narrower but wrong CIs. Increasing the number of observations per unit is more efficient at improving the accuracy of the estimation compared to increasing the number of units in the panel for the stochastic model. Results are shown in Figure
