<p>When fitting the birth-death data with a birth-only model, we found that, in both the stochastic and deterministic fits, the estimate of the growth rate is close to the net growth rate (i.e., birth rate minus death rate). However, if we allow random effects on the growth rate, the deterministic fits finds a very high level of heterogeneity in the growth rate when none actually exists. The CI for the standard deviation of the parameter in the stochastic fit correctly contains 0, suggesting limited evidence for heterogeneity in growth rates.</p>
