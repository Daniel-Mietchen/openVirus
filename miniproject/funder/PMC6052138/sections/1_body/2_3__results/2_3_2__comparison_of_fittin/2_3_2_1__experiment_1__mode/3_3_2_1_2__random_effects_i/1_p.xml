<p>When the fit attempts to estimate random effects when no parametric variability is actually present, the CIs for the estimated standard deviation of the parameters in the stochastic fits contain 0, while the deterministic CIs do not. That is, the deterministic model finds evidence for population-level heterogeneity when none actually exists.</p>
