<p>When there is population-level heterogeneity in the data but the model assumes that there is none, the stochastic fit still obtains correct point estimates and CIs of the mean effects for both the birth-only and birth-death models. However, in the deterministic fits the CIs for the mean effects did not contain the true values of the growth rates.</p>
