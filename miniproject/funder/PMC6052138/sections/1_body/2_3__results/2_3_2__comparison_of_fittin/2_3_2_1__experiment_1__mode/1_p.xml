<p>We fit 4 models (birth-only and birth-death, with and without random effects) using both deterministic and stochastic model formulations allowing us to consider the effect of both model structure misspecification and other model assumptions. Parameter estimates for each data set are given in Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">I</xref> in Appendix. Also, in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> we summarize succinctly the main conclusions of this section.
