<p>When the data are generated without population heterogeneity (i.e., σ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> = σ
 <sub>
  <italic>B</italic>
 </sub> = 0) and fit with the correct structural model, both the deterministic and the stochastic fits have reasonable point estimates and their confidence intervals (CIs) contain the true parameter value (shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">I</xref> in Appendix). However, CIs on the death rates are very broad suggesting that the incidence data are only weakly informative. When we introduce population heterogeneity into both the data and fits, the stochastic fit still contains the true parameter values in its CIs; although fitting all 4 parameters leads to very broad estimates for the mean and standard deviation of the death rate. The deterministic model, however, is unable to estimate either the mean or standard deviation of the growth rates correctly.
