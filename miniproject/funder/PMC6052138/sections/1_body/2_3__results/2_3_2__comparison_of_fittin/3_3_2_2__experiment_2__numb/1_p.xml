<p>Results for data generated by a pure birth process, with different number of units in the panel, are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Using the stochastic or the deterministic fits resulted in point estimates for the mean growth rates that were very close to the mean value and the CIs contain the true value for all cases. Increasing the number of units in the panel causes slightly narrower CIs for the mean growth rate as well. The standard deviation of the growth rates was correctly estimated in the stochastic model for all but one case; however, the deterministic model overestimated the population-level heterogeneity in all cases. Also, as the number of units in the panel increases, the CIs narrow suggesting a higher degree of certainty in an incorrect conclusion.
