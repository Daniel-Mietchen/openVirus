<p>We also analyzed the effect of different values for the heterogeneity of the parametric variability. As before, the deterministic fit consistently overestimated the level of heterogeneity regardless of the actual value of the standard deviation of the growth rate, however, these estimates became closer to the true value with increasing heterogeneity in the data. In the stochastic fits, when the heterogeneity was less than 0.04, the estimated CIs included the true parameter and increasing heterogeneity led to a narrower CI. At the highest heterogeneity levels the CI did not contain the true value; we found that using a stochastic fit to data with high levels of parametric heterogeneity leads to numerical instability making estimation of the CIs difficult. Results are shown in Figure
