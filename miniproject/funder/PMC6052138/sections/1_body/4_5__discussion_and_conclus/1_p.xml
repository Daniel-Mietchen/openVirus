<p>The aim of modeling is not to capture every specific feature of the system under consideration but, rather, to describe succinctly the main mechanisms of the process and, ideally, to be able to differentiate among competing hypotheses (Ganusov, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). The art of modeling involves balancing multiple levels of complexity to achieve predictability, accuracy, and tractability. In this context, here we have added another concern: is the methodological approach suitable? Following an approach of keeping things simple, we have shown that even for the most basic cases, deterministic fitting methods, which assume that all variability is either error or parametric, provide misleading results. Although, not all aspects of the models were sensitive to the assumption of determinism, since for example the mean of a parameter was usually reasonably estimated.
