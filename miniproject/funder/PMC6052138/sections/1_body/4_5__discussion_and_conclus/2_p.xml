<p>This study is not a purely academic exercise on the role of fluctuations for small populations because our results point to important practical implications. A case in point is our example of the initial spread of the Ebola epidemic. Although different counties seem to have different growth rates, our fitting indicates that the variability is also well explained by stochastic (i.e., non-systematic) differences among the counties. This does not mean that there are no differences in epidemic spread among the counties, only that stochasticity alone is a statistically better and more parsimonious explanation. That is, when stochasticity is taken into account the evidence for differences in early growth rates is negligible.</p>
