<p>The ability to accurately detect and measure heterogeneity is an important topic with practical implications. Take, for example, the expanding field of personalized medicine, where individual treatment plans may be designed under the potentially faulty assumption that there is heterogeneity in response to treatment regimes. Likewise, scientific resources may be wasted in a quest to search for individual-level correlates of heterogeneity that may not exist. Our results suggest that measuring heterogeneity in panel data time series is prone to bias and misinterpretation and that including more data in terms of additional observations per unit or increasing the number of units will not alleviate this bias caused by methodological misspecification.</p>
