<p>In this regard, it is important to note that the simulation-based stochastic fits, generally speaking, appropriately partitioned variability into stochastic and parametric components even with relatively short time series. This means that such methods should be preferred for fitting data. However, there are practical issues with implementing stochastic fitting methods when the models are complex (e.g., multiple populations or many parameters) or the populations involved are large. This is because the computational resources needed and the time to fit a given model would be, in most cases, prohibitive. As an alternative, if a fully stochastic model is not possible, one could explore the possibility of using stochastic models for a limited time window (for instance, early on). Although, this will need the development of hybrid fitting methodologies. Generally, one should be cautious when interpreting the fit of deterministic models to panel data, since the observation of parametric heterogeneity or even structural heterogeneity in terms of model selection may be the result of overfitting stochastic fluctuation. Also, the term
