<p>In summary, here we analyzed the effect of neglecting stochastic noise (i.e., in addition to the error term) in panel data of biological time series. We found that deterministic approaches usually overestimate the parametric variability, although (at least in our simple models) the parameter average is less difficult to estimate. On the other hand, stochastic fitting, in general, did a good job of dividing variability between stochastic and parametric.</p>
