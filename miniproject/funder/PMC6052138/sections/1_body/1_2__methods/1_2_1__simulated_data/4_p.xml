<p>We set up four sets of simulated experiments to explore the effects of (1) model misspecification, (2) the number of observations per unit, (3) the number of units in the panel, and (4) the heterogeneity in parameters (growth rates) between units (see Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref> for reference).
