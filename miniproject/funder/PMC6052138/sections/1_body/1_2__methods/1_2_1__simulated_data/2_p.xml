<p>The code used to generate the data and fit the models is given in Appendix 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">A</xref>. We simulate panel data according to the following process 
 <graphic xlink:href="fmicb-09-01529-i0001.jpg" position="float" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/> where 
 <italic>U</italic> is the number of units in the panel, 
 <italic>O</italic> is the number of observations (time points) per unit, and 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>j,k</italic>
 </sub> is the number of new infected cases in each time period 
 <italic>k</italic> for unit 
 <italic>j</italic>â€”this is the output of the simulation used for the fits described below. If the number of deaths exceeds the infected population size, 
 <italic>I</italic>, this variable is set to 0. These simple models capture both the initial exponential growth phase when infected population sizes are small and stochastic die out that is common in many epidemiological processes. For simplicity, we focus only on the early stages of the epidemic, i.e., the approximately exponential phase in the growth of infected individuals. Note that throughout we use arbitrary time units.
