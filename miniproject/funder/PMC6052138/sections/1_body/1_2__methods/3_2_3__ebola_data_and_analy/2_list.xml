  <p>(i) For every county, we define time = 1 as the first week where the total number of cases is larger or equal to 1.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>(ii) We truncated the data at 10 weeks after that time, in order to have homogeneous sets (same number of points) during the approximately exponential initial growth of the epidemic. To emphasize this latter point, we re-plot the data in linear-log scale.</p>

  <p>(iii) Finally, we removed those counties where the data does not include at least 10 data points.</p>
