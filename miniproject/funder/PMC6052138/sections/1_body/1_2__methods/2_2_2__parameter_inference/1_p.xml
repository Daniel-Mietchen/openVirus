<p>To infer the parameter values, we use a fitting scheme based on simulations that can account both for the intrinsic stochasticity of the process and the potential variation among individuals. Here all model formulations (both stochastic and deterministic versions) are fit using the iterated filtering method implemented in the R library 
 <monospace>pomp</monospace> (King et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). This approach allows us to fit all the models to the data using the same framework and likelihood functions, such that the model fits are all comparable. We specifically use the iterated filtering for panel data (IFPD) formulation detailed in Romero-Severson et al. (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Code used to specify the 
 <monospace>pomp</monospace> process are given in Appendix
