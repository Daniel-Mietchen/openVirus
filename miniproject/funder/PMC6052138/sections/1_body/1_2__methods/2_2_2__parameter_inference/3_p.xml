<p>To obtain confidence intervals (CIs) for the parameters, we used a profile likelihood method (Romero-Severson et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) where the parameter of interest was varied over a grid of values and the likelihood was calculated, by refitting the data allowing all other parameters to be free. We used the 
 <monospace>mif2</monospace> method (King et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) in 
 <monospace>pomp</monospace>. A local regression (loess) curve was fitted to the profile likelihood curve and both the MLE and CIs were calculated from the interpolated curve (King et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
