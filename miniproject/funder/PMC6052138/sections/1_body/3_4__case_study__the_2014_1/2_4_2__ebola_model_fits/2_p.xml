<p>Overall, these results show that, while deterministic fitting is as good as stochastic fitting to estimate the mean growth rates, it performs poorly as a predictor of the parametric variability. Specifically, using our definition of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>, and the MLE of σ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> = 0.03, obtained with the stochastic method, we can estimate the contribution of parametric variability to overall variability in the data. Using Equation (5) results in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≃ 0.21. This analysis would suggest that, in the case of Ebola, 10 weeks after the start of the epidemic, around 79% of the measured variability could be attributed to noise rather than to inter-county differences. Taking into account that, as we showed in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>, this empirical way to calculate 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> overestimates the true coefficient, the conclusion is even more substantiated. Doing the same calculation with the value obtained in the deterministic fitting, σ
 <sub>
  <italic>A</italic>
 </sub> = 0.16, we get 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> ≃ 0.88, so we would conclude that 88% of the variability is due to true differences among counties.
