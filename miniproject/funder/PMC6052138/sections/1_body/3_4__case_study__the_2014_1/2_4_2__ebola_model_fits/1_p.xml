<p>We fitted both deterministic and stochastic versions of a birth-only model with random effects to the Ebola data, allowing for negative binomial measurement error (see section 2.3 for details). The stochastic model was, in terms of the likelihood values, objectively better than the deterministic model (−556.4 vs. −565.0) despite being identical in all respects except stochasticity. The estimate of the mean growth rate was nearly identical in both models, 0.62, with CI (0.53, 0.73) deterministic and 0.59, with CI (0.52, 0.67) stochastic (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). However, the deterministic model found a very high level of heterogeneity, 0.16 CI (0.11, 0.25), while the stochastic model found low levels of heterogeneity, 0.03 CI(0, 0.15). In the stochastic model, the profile likelihood for the standard deviation in growth rates, σ

 </sub>, suggests that the likelihood surface is virtually flat around very small values of σ

 </sub> (see Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref> right). However, in the deterministic model—even when we allow variable levels of overdispersion—the likelihood rapidly drops off as the heterogeneity decreases from the MLE.
