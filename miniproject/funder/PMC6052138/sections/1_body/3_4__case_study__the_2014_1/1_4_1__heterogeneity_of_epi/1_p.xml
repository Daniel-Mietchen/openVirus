<p>In Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> we show the total number of cases reported for the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. In each case, the solid line is the fit of an exponential function to the data for the first 29 weeks. Despite the fluctuations (specially in the first days) the fit provides an (apparently) accurate account for the growth during those early weeks. Note that the estimated slopes are highly variable among countries. Since for simple models, the slope in the exponential fit (α) is proportional to the basic reproductive number minus one (

 <sub>0</sub> − 1) (Heffernan et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), with this approach one would conclude that the severity of Ebola in different countries is highly variable. Indeed, this variability has been reported for the 2014-15 epidemic (with
