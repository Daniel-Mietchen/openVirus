<p>Now, the conclusions that can be drawn are more nuanced and perhaps contrary to the picture of uniform growth suggested by Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>. On the one hand, the starting dates of the epidemic in different counties are highly variable, and the initial slopes (the plot is in logarithmic scale) also display a large variability. This suggests that assigning a simple value per country (and, consequently a single

 <sub>0</sub>) can be misleading and lead to erroneous interpretations and, more importantly, interventions or policies. On the other hand, and this is what we are interested in, this fine grained view of the data begs for a stochastic approach to fitting. Even when the data is aggregated (which tends to smooth the underlying stochasticity), the initial part of the curves are reminiscent of the trajectories in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> (left panel).
