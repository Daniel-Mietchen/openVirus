<p>From a traditional deterministic approach we might come to two conclusions: (1) The Ebola epidemic is well described by a deterministic model that predicts accurately the initial exponential growth and (2) the epidemic was more aggressive in Guinea, followed by Sierra Leone and Liberia. However, a closer inspection of the data (collected by counties) before the aggregation shows a different picture. In Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>, we plot the same dataset (for Liberia and Sierra Leone) but separately for the different counties.
