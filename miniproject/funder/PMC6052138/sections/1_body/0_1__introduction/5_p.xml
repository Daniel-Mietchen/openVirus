<p>The potential problems in applying the deterministic framework can become even more pronounced when we have data that represent multiple realizations of a heterogeneous stochastic process. For example, a set of viral load profiles in different infected individuals (e.g., primary HIV infection; Ribeiro et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) or epidemic curves in different regions (e.g., cases of Ebola in multiple counties of the same country; Krauer et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), that is, any data that can be represented as a panel over discrete units. In those scenarios, an important question is whether the variability seen between units can be attributed to a genuine difference in the process that generated the data (e.g., some parameters of the dynamics are different for each unit), simple stochastic fluctuation, or a mixture of the two, in addition to measurement error. Given a common error model across the units, the deterministic framework assumes that all deviation that cannot be explained by error must be due to parametric variability between units, that is the units are fundamentally different from one another. For this reason, the deterministic framework is ill-suited to tackle the question of stochastic effects.
