 <sub>0</sub>), are often invoked to quantify the aggressiveness of a pathogen and to determine the conditions under which a pathogen will go extinct (Dietz, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Heffernan et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) or to create public health information such as risk maps (Hartemink et al.,
