<p>One of the central challenges of using the deterministic framework is to delineate its limitations (Roberts et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). If the world and its data truly are stochastic, then how much of a problem is it to conflate noise with error? Likewise, how much information in the data are we neglecting by treating all deviation as uninformative error? To what extent is the assumption of deterministic dynamics plus error providing misleading results?
