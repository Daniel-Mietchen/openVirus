<p>Mathematical models play an increasingly central role in the analysis of infectious disease data at both the within-host and epidemiological levels (Perelson et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Heesterbeek, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Molina-Par√≠s and Lythe, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The traditional modeling approach involves formulating a set of structural assumptions about the processes involved, such as infection, recovery, death, etc. Often, these structural assumptions are then implemented in terms of differential equations, predominantly ordinary (ODE), but sometimes partial (PDE), or delayed (dODE) differential equations. The advantage of this approach is its amenability for both analytical treatment and powerful numerical and fitting algorithms even for non-linear problems. We will refer to those approaches collectively as
