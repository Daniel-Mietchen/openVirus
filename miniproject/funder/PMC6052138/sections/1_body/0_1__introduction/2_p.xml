<p>However, stochasticity is an intrinsic feature of infections at multiple levels from the cellular/molecular world to the level of epidemics (SÃ¼el et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Bressloff and Newby, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The deterministic framework conceptualizes all deviation from the model prediction as 
 <bold>error</bold>. For example, in a simple univariate linear regression we say that the data are equal to a linear predictor plus some error. Put another way, we can say that error is the density of the data conditional on the model. However, stochasticity generates intrinsic fluctuations in the underlying dynamics of a system (for instance, in the number of secondary cases an incident case generates), even when the process follows the structural model envisaged. That is, stochasticity generates 
 <bold>noise</bold>, which we define as the set of outcomes that are consistent with a fixed set of assumptions (i.e., a model).
