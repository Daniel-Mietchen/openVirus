<p>We address in this paper two related questions regarding modeling of panel data: (i) can we use a stochastic modeling approach to partition variability into stochastic and parametric components? and (ii) can we quantify the bias induced by modeling the data by a deterministic approach with error? Put in other words, is there a 
 <underline>best</underline> and a 
 <underline>good-enough</underline> fitting method for the practitioner? In section 2.1, we consider two simple structural models that will help us emphasize the essence of the problem without having to invoke unnecessary complexities that may cloud our main arguments. In section 3.1, we present our approach to analyze those models, which will then be used to benchmark comparisons between traditional (deterministic) fitting methods and more sophisticated stochastic ones, that we explore in section 3.2. As a case study, in section 4, we compare deterministic and stochastic modeling approaches to data from the 2014-2015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We use epidemic data from multiple counties of those countries that were most heavily affected. If one thinks of each county as a realization of some epidemic generating process, then the relevant question is whether differences between the counties can be accounted for by stochastic variability or if it is possible to detect a signal for different growth rates of the epidemic in different counties. Finally, in section 5 we summarize our results and discuss the implications of our work.
