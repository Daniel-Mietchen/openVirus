The horizontal short dashed lines indicate the parameter values used in the data generation. The left panel corresponds to the stochastic fits and the right panel to the deterministic fits, where the vertical whiskers are the 95% CI obtained in the fits. The red empty squares in the right panel stand for the value of

   <sup>2</sup> using the empirical data variance and the theoretical (stochastic) noise variance, Equation (8). In each case, the number of observations per unit was
