  <p>Stochastic realizations of a pure birth process and distributions of deterministic estimation of the growth rate at different times. Top figures show 100 trajectories from a continuous time pure-birthh process with parameter Î± = 0.1 over two time scales. The only difference between each trajectory is intrinsic stochastic variability. The red line shows the expected population size assuming a deterministic process, which is also the mean number of infected of the stochastic process if there is no parametric variability. The bottom plot shows the distribution of estimated growth rates obtained by fitting a linear model to the log
   <sub>10</sub> of the population size for each of the 100 trajectories from time 0 to times 25, 75, and 125. The red dots indicate the mean of the estimated growth rates, which are all close to the true value of 0.1.
