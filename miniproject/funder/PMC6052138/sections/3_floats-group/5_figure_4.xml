  <p>Results of fits when there is a variable number of units. The data in all cases was generated by a pure birth process with parametric variability and fit with a birth-only model. The top row shows the estimates for the mean growth rate with stochastic or deterministic fits, and the bottom row the estimate of the standard deviation of the growth rate. The horizontal dashed blue lines indicate the parameter values used in the data generation. The vertical whiskers are the 95% CI obtained in the fits. In each case, the number of observations per unit was 
   <italic>O</italic> = 20, the growth rate was α = 0.15 and the standard deviation of the growth rate was σ = 0.02.
