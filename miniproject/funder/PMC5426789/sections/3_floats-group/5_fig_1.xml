  <title>DENV seroprevalence, Papua New Guinea and West Papua 1959–1963.</title>
  <p>Previous DENV infection was largely identified in Sabron and East Sepik on the northern coast, with a single case in the Eastern Highlands. All sera from the southern coast were seronegative. Stars indicate origin of serum samples collected between 1959–1963. Circles depict number of sera collected at each site, and proportion of sera anti-DENV seropositive and anti-DENV seronegative. Dashed line represents border between New Guinea (now known as Papua New Guinea) to the east, and Dutch New Guinea (now known as West Papua) to the west.</p>
