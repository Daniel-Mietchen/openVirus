<p>Of the 39 positive samples, a minority (6/39, 15%) demonstrated a monotypic neutralizing antibody response to DENV-1 (4 sera), DENV-2 (1 sample), or DENV-4 (1 sample). The remaining 33/39 sera (85%) neutralized multiple DENV serotypes. Of these 33 samples, 20 (61%) sera neutralized all four DENV, 10 (30%) neutralized 3 serotypes, and 3 (9%) neutralized 2 serotypes. Anti-DENV-2 was detected in 32/33 samples closely followed by anti-DENV-1 (30 sera) and anti-DENV-4 (30 sera) with anti-DENV-3 positive sera least frequent (24 sera). Among DENV-seropositive sera anti-DENV-2 titers were generally highest with titers up to 160 and DENV-2 GMT of 24.2 was higher than for the other serotypes. In comparison, responses for the other three serotypes demonstrated lower magnitude titers with anti-DENV-1 GMT of 16.3; anti-DENV-3 GMT 18.9; and anti-DENV-4 MN GMT 17.1. (
