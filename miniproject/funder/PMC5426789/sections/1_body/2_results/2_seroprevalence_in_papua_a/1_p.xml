<p>Anti-DENV neutralizing antibodies were detected in 39 of 98 (40%) sera from PNG; the remaining 59 were seronegative for all four DENV serotypes. All seropositive sera, with the exception of one sample, were from villages in East Sepik. The additional positive sample was from Po village in the southern border area of Eastern Highlands with Morobe, where villagers were known to hunt and maintain gardens at lower altitudes. Since we do not know the travel history of the 22-year-old man from whom the sample was obtained we cannot be sure that he acquired his DENV infection in the southern lowlands.</p>
