<p>Anti-DENV antibody was detected exclusively in 20 of 25 sera (80%) collected in Sabron on the northeast coast. These sera accounted for 25% (20/81) of West Papuan samples. Sabron serum samples showed monotypic anti-DENV-2 (9/20; 45%) and anti-DENV-4 (1/20; 5%) responses, with the remaining 10 of 20 (50%) positive samples showing evidence of multiple previous infections: 3 sera neutralized all 4 DENV serotypes, 5 sera neutralized 2 serotypes, and the remaining 2 sera neutralized 3 serotypes. Anti-DENV-2 responses were identified most frequently, with 19 of the 20 positive sera showing some evidence of previous infection with this serotype. Anti-DENV-2 GMT was 16.1, whereas anti-DENV-1 GMT was higher (21.8) despite the lack of monotypic anti-DENV-1 neutralizing capacity. Lower magnitude responses were seen for the 8/20 sera with anti-DENV-4 responses where MN titers were always 10, regardless of the responses detected to other serotypes. Anti-DENV-3 responses were the least frequent and were detected (with MN titers of 10 or 20) in the 3 serum samples which were positive for all 4 serotypes, suggesting that this anti-DENV-3 response was cross-neutralization by antibody to the other 3 prevalent serotypes. The lack of monotypic anti-DENV-3 supports this contention; it does not exclude the possibility that individuals with previous DENV-3 infection were not sampled. These data are summarized in
