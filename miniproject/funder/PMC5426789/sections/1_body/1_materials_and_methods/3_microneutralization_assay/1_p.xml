<p>A serum microneutralization (MN) assay was developed, based on approaches described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and used to measure anti-DENV antibodies in the archival serum samples. This approach was selected to allow simultaneous assessment of antibody to all four reference DENV serotypes (DENV-1
 <sub>Hawaii-2001</sub>; DENV-2
 <sub>NGC;</sub> DENV-3
 <sub>H-87</sub> and DENV-4
 <sub>H-241</sub>) in samples with limited volumes (&lt;0.1 mL). Vero cells at a concentration of 5 x 10
 <sup>5</sup>/mL in in DMEM medium (DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with L-glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (DMEM-10 growth medium) were prepared and 0.1 mL was added to all wells of 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture plates (BD Falcon) for a final input of 5 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well, and the plates were incubated in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 48 hours until wells were confluent. Test sera were diluted 1:10 in DMEM medium and heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes, then serially diluted two-fold to a dilution of 1:1280 in 96-well round-bottom plates. An equal volume of titrated virus was added to the prepared sera, for a final dose of 50 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>, and the plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 1 hour. Growth medium was removed from the Vero cell monolayer and replaced with the serum-virus mixture. Sera were tested in duplicate against all four DENV serotypes simultaneously. Plates were incubated in a humidified 37°C incubator in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 9–10 days during which time cell monolayers were monitored; appearance of the cells was compared to media-only wells on the same plates. At the end of the incubation culture supernatant was removed, cells were fixed in cold PBS:acetone (1:1), and virus replication was assessed by fixed-cell ELISA. Absence of infectivity, indicated by OD
 <sub>415/490</sub> values approaching background (cell-only control well) levels, indicated the presence of DENV-specific antibodies in the serum sample and thus constituted a positive neutralization reaction. The assay cutoff value for neutralization was established as the mean OD
 <sub>415/490</sub> of serum only (no virus) control wells plus 2 standard deviations. Wells with higher values were deemed negative for neutralization and the neutralization titer was the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution with a mean OD below the cutoff value. OD
 <sub>415/490</sub> for cell-only control wells was &lt;0.3 and for virus control wells was &gt;1.0. Data were presented as Geometric Mean Titers (GMT).
