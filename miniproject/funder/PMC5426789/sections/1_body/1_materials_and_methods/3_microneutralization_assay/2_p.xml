<p>Standard anti-DENV-1-4 sera NIBSC 05/248 (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control [NIBSC], Potter’s Bar, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom) tested against homologous reference DENV consistently produced MN titers of 10–20 (

Cross-neutralization experiments in which Standard DENV-1-4 sera were each tested against heterologous reference DENV consistently produced negative results; each Standard serum was tested against all four DENV reference viruses used in the MN assay (
