 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005488.s001">S1 Table</xref>). There was insufficient archival sample volume to perform MN tests against JEV, MVEV and KUNV. Serum samples from 20 individuals with no history of DENV infection, designated as negative controls, who were anti-DENV seronegative by NS1 ELISA (Platelia Dengue NS1 Antigen ELISA kit; Bio-Rad, Australia) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay (PathWest Laboratory Medicine WA) consistently produced MN titers less than 10.
