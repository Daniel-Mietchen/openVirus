<p>Dengue transmission has been documented in the Asia-Pacific region since the 1940s when the four prototype DENV were identified in Japan (DENV-1
 <sub>Mochizuki</sub>,1943), and Hawaii (DENV-1
 <sub>Hawaii</sub>, 1944), New Guinea (DENV-2
 <sub>NGC</sub>, 1944), and the Philippines (DENV-3
 <sub>H-87</sub> and DENV-4
 <sub>H-241</sub>, 1956) [

 <sub>NGC</sub> was isolated from US soldiers who fought in New Guinea in 1942–1944 [

In the years following the Second World War dengue transmission was identified in serosurveys conducted on the island of New Britain in 1971 [

Although dengue surveillance is not conducted in PNG, genetic analysis of serum samples collected from febrile travelers entering northern Australia from PNG between 1999 and 2010 has identified importation of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 [
