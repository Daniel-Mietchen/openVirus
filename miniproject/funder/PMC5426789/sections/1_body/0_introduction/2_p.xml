<p>Dengue is caused by infection with any one of four dengue viruses (DENV), RNA viruses which form their own antigenic complex within the Flaviviridae family [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The four serotypes, DENV-1 –DENV-4, are further classified into genetically distinct groups or genotypes with sequence divergence of up to 6% [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Infection is believed to confer lifelong immunity to the homologous DENV serotype and short-lived cross-protective immunity to the other three serotypes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and people who live in endemic areas may be infected up to four times in their lifetime. Symptomatic DENV infection typically presents as a non-specific acute febrile illness (dengue fever, DF) which usually develops 3–8 days following a bite from an infected

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. Severe dengue (previously known as dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF, and dengue shock syndrome, DSS) is an acute vascular permeability syndrome which occurs in a subset of patients with DF; mortality rates in severe dengue range between 2.5%-20% [
