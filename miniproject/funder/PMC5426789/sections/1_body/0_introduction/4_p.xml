<p>Dengue epidemics occur frequently in the Asia-Pacific region and DHF/DSS-associated epidemics have been recorded in many countries in this region since the 1950s [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A recent analysis of dengue surveillance data collected between 1968 and 2013 in Indonesia, a country which experiences frequent, large-scale dengue epidemics and shares geographic borders with PNG, found that the incidence of DHF has increased substantially over the past 45 years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Severe dengue has not been reported in PNG despite the likely transmission of multiple DENV serotypes and the potential for introduction of DENV circulating in neighbouring countries such as Indonesia, and the reasons for this are not understood. We undertook a retrospective analysis of DENV seroprevalence in PNG using serum samples collected between 1959 and 1963 in order to identify the DENV serotypes which circulated before that time, and their geographic distribution. These findings will clarify the length of time dengue has been present in PNG, inform our understanding of the natural history of dengue in PNG, and provide a basis for future surveillance and control efforts.
