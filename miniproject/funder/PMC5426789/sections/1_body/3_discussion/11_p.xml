<p>In summary we have identified serological evidence for transmission of dengue along the northern coastline of New Guinea island as measured by neutralizing antibody to multiple DENV serotypes in adults up to 72 years of age, sampled between 1959â€“1963. These findings confirm that multiple DENV serotypes circulated in this region at different times in the decades prior to the sampling period and support the notion that dengue has been a significant yet neglected tropical disease in PNG for more than 70 years. Dengue burden needs to be quantified, and molecular epidemiological studies need to be undertaken to assess the origins and distribution of DENV genotypes so as to develop an understanding of disease transmission and pathogenicity in PNG, particularly in the context of emerging dengue vaccines.</p>
