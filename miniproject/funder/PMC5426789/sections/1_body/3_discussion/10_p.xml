<p>The reasons for the apparent lack of severe dengue in PNG are unclear and require further investigation. The pathogenesis of severe dengue disease is not well understood though DHF incidence is clearly associated with sequential infection with multiple DENV serotypes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and in-vitro studies in humans have identified immune enhancement as a mechanism for DHF immunopathogenesis [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In this model DENV genetic heterogeneity resulting in B- and T-cell-specific epitope antigen variation, the sequence of DENV infections, host HLA profiles, and host genetic variation are among the major virus and host factors which influence clinical outcome. A long history of transmission of multiple DENV serotypes as suggested in our present study would predict a higher incidence of severe dengue than has been observed to date. Similar findings have been reported for Haiti [
