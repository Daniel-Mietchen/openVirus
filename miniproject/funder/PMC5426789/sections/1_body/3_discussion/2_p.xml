<p>Monotypic infection with DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4 was identified in 16 of 59 (27.1%) seropositive individuals. Our findings are consistent with the work done by Sabin [

The majority of seropositive sera (43/59; 72.9%) neutralized multiple DENV serotypes, suggesting that most exposed individuals had been infected more than once before the time of sampling.
