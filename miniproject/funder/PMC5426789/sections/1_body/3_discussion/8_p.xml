<p>Antibody preservation in serum samples stored for many decades is a major limitation of this study. Serum specimens analyzed in the present study were collected in New Guinea between 1959–1963. The samples were kept cool until they were transferred for storage at -15 deg C [

Immunoglobulin deterioration over more than five decades of transport and storage might reduce the sensitivity of our assays, and thus our findings may represent an underestimation of the true prevalence of anti-DENV neutralizing antibodies in the study areas.
