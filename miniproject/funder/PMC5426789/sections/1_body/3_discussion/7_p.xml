<p>Despite the large number of dengue cases among US soldiers deployed along the northern PNG coast in the 1940s there are no reports of severe dengue among the soldiers. The lack of dengue surveillance in PNG in the decades since then has meant that incidence and prevalence data are lacking. Awareness of the disease may not be high throughout PNG but it is nevertheless surprising that severe dengue has not yet been identified in the more than six decades since DENV was first isolated from New Guinea, especially since our present findings indicate that residents of the northern New Guinea coast had experienced multiple DENV infections in the years prior to 1963.</p>
