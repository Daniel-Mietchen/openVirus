<p>Assessment of prior DENV infection using serum neutralization assays is subject to well-recognized limitations associated with the relatively high degree of homology among the four DENV serotypes. Anti-DENV antibody epitopes may be unique to each serotype, or they may be shared across all four DENV. Primary infection induces cross-neutralizing antibodies to heterologous DENV serotypes which may be detected in the first few weeks following the acute phase of infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Several months after repeat infection with heterologous DENV the breadth of cross-neutralizing responses has stabilized, and the profile of multi-serotype responses is likely maintained for life. The monotypic anti-DENV responses identified in the present study likely reflect a true single DENV infection, whereas the multitypic responses suggest a history of infections with at least 2 DENV serotypes. Our results suggest transmission of at least three DENV serotypes along the northern coast of New Guinea in the years prior to 1962.
