<p>This study has shown that multiple dengue virus serotypes circulated in the northern coastal areas of West Papua and Papua New Guinea prior to 1963. It is not possible to identify when the viruses were introduced into New Guinea or where they originated; however, a large number of dengue-like illnesses occurred in US soldiers deployed in this area during the Second World War [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. There are no reports describing similar illness occurring among local populations in this period and we cannot determine whether DENV was imported into northern New Guinea with troop movements, or if multiple serotypes were already circulating at that time and spread rapidly within susceptible troops. Villagers on the northern PNG coast may have interacted with peoples of neighbouring countries or with visitors from other regions more often compared with inhabitants of the Asmat and Casuarine coasts in the south, who were uniformly seronegative in the present study.
