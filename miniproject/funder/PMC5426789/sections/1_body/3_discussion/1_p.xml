<p>We undertook a retrospective analysis of DENV seroprevalence in what is now Papua New Guinea and West Papua using serum samples collected between 1959 and 1963, and our findings suggest that multiple DENV serotypes circulated prior to this time period. DENV seroprevalence was largely restricted to the northern Pacific coast of PNG and West Papua and there was no evidence of previous infection in the villages along the southern Casuarine Coast, or in the Highlands.</p>
