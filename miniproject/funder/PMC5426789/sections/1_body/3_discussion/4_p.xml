<p>The mountains of the New Guinea Highlands, which reach heights of almost 5000 meters, bisect New Guinea island and separate the northern and southern lowlands and coastal areas. The rugged terrain of the island has contributed to the development of geographically isolated population groups who speak more than 800 distinct languages. Interaction between groups up until the second half of the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century was generally limited [

In addition, continuous contact with colonial authorities and other foreign forces did not occur until around the middle of the 20
 <sup>th</sup> century for many groups; the first permanent Dutch government post and trade operations were established among the Asmat peoples, sampled in the present study, on the Casuarine Coast in 1953. At this time inter-group warfare had not ended and the fierce reputation of the Asmat people [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] assessed measles seroprevalence in this population and identified a virgin soil epidemic in 1961, supporting our finding that the apparent lack, or rarity, of dengue transmission along the southern coast was likely a consequence of the isolation of the Asmat villages; the lack of sustained contact with the outside world limited introduction of DENV from external sources as it did for measles. There are no jungle-dwelling non-human primates in West Papua or Papua New Guinea to act as a dengue reservoir and to sustain a sylvatic cycle that might occasionally spill over into humans, as has been recorded in neighbouring Malaysia [
