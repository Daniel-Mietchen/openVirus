<p>Although DHF has never been reported in Papua New Guinea it occurs in West Papua, where the first reported DHF epidemic occurred in Jayapura in 1993â€“1994 on the northern coast [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], attributed to DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3. Emergence of severe dengue is consistent with the apparent long-term transmission of multiple serotypes in this area identified in the present study, a similar pattern to that seen in other endemic settings. In contrast the first known DHF epidemic on the southern coast of West Papua occurred in Merauke in 2001 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], attributed to DENV-3. Merauke is a town with an estimated population of 78,000 located on the southern coast of West Papua bordering PNG to the east and what is now the Asmat Regency to the west. An historical review of hospital records from 1995 to 2000 revealed no evidence of previous epidemic or sporadic DHF and the authors suggested that the outbreak represented the first instance of epidemic dengue virus transmission. There are no data on DENV transmission in the southern coastal areas of PNG east of Merauke, and no reports of DF or severe dengue, although dengue, including severe dengue, has been reported in the neighbouring Torres Strait Islands [
