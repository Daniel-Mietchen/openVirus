<p>In studies conducted during a DHF epidemic in Central Java in the late 1970s [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, trapped in the rural district of Bantul, were both shown to be competent vectors for DENV-1-4 isolated from DHF patients in Java. There are no published descriptions of

 <italic>albopictus</italic> was first identified on the northern coast in Jayapura in 1962 and Alexishafen in Madang Province in 1972, and on the southern coast in the Western Province of PNG along the southern Fly River coastal fringe in 1992 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Chikungunya and dengue are both vectored by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes and these findings suggest that the potential for dengue transmission existed at the time of sampling for the present study but that transmission did not occur. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is considered to be a relatively inefficient dengue epidemic vector and has a short flight range [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005488.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and these factors may have constrained the introduction of DENV into the geographically isolated people of the Casuarine Coast prior to 1962.
