  <title>Mechanism of action of hemophilia therapies.</title>
  <p>Factor X (FX) can be activated to FXa either via FIXa–FVIIIa complex or the tissue factor (TF) factor–FVIIa complex. FXa and FVa activate prothrombin (FII) to thrombin (FIIa) in order to generate a fibrin clot. Natural anti-coagulants targeted by non-factor therapeutics are represented in red. Protein-based therapeutics are represented in purple, nucleotide-based therapeutics are represented in blue, and antibody-based therapeutics are represented in green. Fitusiran decreases the production of antithrombin (AT), decreasing its inhibition of FIXa, FXa, and FIIa. Concizumab and anti-protein C serine protease inhibitors (serpins) block tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) from inhibiting FXa and TF–FVIIa complex or protein C from inhibiting FVIIIa and FVa, respectively. Emicizumab is a FVIIa mimic that brings together FIXa and FX to generate FXa. Factor-based therapies include adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based liver-directed gene therapy, which results in endogenous factor production, and exogenously given factor therapeutics given intravenously. APC, activated protein C; EHL, extended half-life.</p>
