<p>Currently, the most serious complication of hemophilia therapy is the formation of neutralizing alloantibodies (inhibitors) that preclude the hemostatic effect of factor replacement. In HA, 30% of severe patients and 5–10% of non-severe patients develop inhibitors compared to only 3–5% of severe HB patients

 </sup>. Inhibitors are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, and only a few variably effective and expensive hemostatic options (termed bypassing agents) are available to these patients, such as activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) and recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa). Inhibitors do not respond well to immunosuppressive therapy alone

 </sup>. The most efficacious and cost-effective treatment for inhibitors is immune tolerance induction (ITI), which consists of frequent injections of FVIII or FIX for extended periods of time. The success rate of inhibitor eradication is 60% and 30% for HA and HB patients, respectively
