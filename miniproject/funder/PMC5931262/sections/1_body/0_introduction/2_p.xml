<p>The disease phenotype is characterized by bleeding into the joints (hemarthrosis), skeletal muscle, soft tissues, and enclosed spaces such as the intracranium and retroperitoneum, which can be fatal. Residual factor level correlates directly with bleeding phenotype wherein patients with severe disease (&lt;1%) present with spontaneous bleeds, those with moderate disease (1–5%) bleed with minor trauma and rarely spontaneously, and those with mild disease (6–30%) bleed only secondary to trauma or invasive procedures. Current treatment includes replacement therapy with plasma-derived (pd) or recombinant (r) clotting factor concentrates either “on demand” for acute bleeding or prophylactically to prevent bleeding. However, in the US, only approximately 60% of young adults and adults report adherence to prophylaxis, and the average cost of the recommended dose of prophylactic therapy is estimated at approximately $200,000–300,000/year
