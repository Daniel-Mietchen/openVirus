<p>Preclinical studies suggest that activation of innate immune responses through CpG-mediated Toll-like receptor 9 was a potential underlying mechanism for the stimulation of AAV capsid-mediated CD8 
 <sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxicity. The use of CpG-depleted codon-optimized FIX transgene in preclinical models was aimed at high expression level

 </sup>. Notably, the first AAV liver trial using the same FIX transgene resulted in AAV capsid-mediated immune response in four out of six subjects in the high-dose cohort

It is, therefore, probable that the innate immune responses may differ between humans and other species and that simply removing CpGs will not prevent vector capsid immune responses in patients, though the role of the innate immune response in the anti-AAV capsid cellular immune response deserves continued study
