<p>The reasons why immunosuppression can overcome immune response to the vector capsid in some, but not all, studies is unclear. It is possible that the combination of vector design (codon optimization/CpG content), the ratio of empty and full capsid particles, host-dependent factors such as HLA, and the innate ability to mount cellular immune responses could all contribute. Hopefully, as these vector systems and clinical outcomes will be further characterized in future publications, we will likely have more insights on this safety concern.</p>
