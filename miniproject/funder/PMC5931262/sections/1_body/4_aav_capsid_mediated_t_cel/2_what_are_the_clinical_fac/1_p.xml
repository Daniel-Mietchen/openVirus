<p>Data from clinical studies show that capsid-mediated immune responses occur with all serotypes in a vector dose-dependent manner. The onset and dose dependence varies among distinct serotypes. For example, in AAV-2 and AAV-8, the dose of 2 × 10

 </sup>, only at doses of 6 × 10 
 <sup>13</sup> vg/kg (30-fold higher than AAV-2 and AAV-8 cited above) were immune responses noted. The initial mechanism of elevation of liver enzymes in the trials using AAV-5 was thought to be due to AAV-capsid immune responses. However, in both studies, the dose-dependent increase in liver enzymes was not associated with detectable T cell expansion. Nevertheless, transient immunosuppression was initiated and liver enzymes normalized. The underlying mechanism of this complication is unclear at this point and may be a direct effect of the vector on the hepatocytes. Therefore, this may influence the long-term safety profile of AAV-5. One possibility for these discrepancies is that AAV-5 vectors were produced using a baculovirus system with insect cells lines, whereas, for the other serotypes, plasmid systems in mammalian cell lines were used. It is known that AAV-5 production in insect cell lines resulted in low infectivity per particle; thus, higher therapeutic vector doses were anticipated

 </sup>. Thus, the emerging data suggest that the vector manufacturing process may also influence the safety profile of AAV. To date, a side-by-side comparison of AAV biological activity using distinct manufacturing systems is lacking. Differences in dose needed for therapeutic transgene expression between vectors may account for increased concentration of capsid that is presented to hepatocytes, leading to stimulation of memory T cells.
