<p>With growing numbers of clinical studies using diverse strategies, one important issue is to define a superior approach. The simplest outcome measurement, such as sustained factor levels, is a logical criterion. However, if a very high vector dose is needed to achieve high therapeutic levels, the impact on the vector manufacturing to a large patient population may be hampered by production feasibility issues and raises safety concerns. Another possibility is that of a strategy with minimal or no risk of vector-mediated immune responses yet with factor levels in the mild disease range. This could bring the benefits of prophylaxis to a large population without the time-consuming and labor-intensive monitoring of ALT and factor levels. Preventive immunosuppression could simplify this process, but, as discussed above, it is not always feasible. Furthermore, the lack of normalization on the strategy used to define the vector genome prevents direct comparison among distinct vectors
