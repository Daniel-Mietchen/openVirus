<p>The most common short-term safety concern of AAV gene therapy is the generation of AAV capsid-mediated cellular responses

 </sup>. This complication is restricted to humans, as provocative preclinical studies in small and large animals failed to fully replicate the clinical findings. Encouragingly, this absence of AAV capsid-mediated cellular responses in hemophiliac dogs has resulted in &gt;8 years of sustained expression

 </sup>. In humans, the need for rapid initiation of the immunosuppression therapy to prevent total loss of expression requires a close monitoring of the subjects, which imposes challenging clinical care as studies move beyond early phases. It is not possible to currently identify those who will develop such complications, but some clinical strategies may help to overcome it.
