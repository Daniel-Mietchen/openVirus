<p>As for any other novel therapy for hemophilia, there are concerns regarding the risk of inhibitor formation. To date, the presence or history of inhibitors and minimal exposure to factor concentrates are exclusion criteria in all of these studies. However, preclinical studies in small and large models showed that AAV liver-restricted expression is biased towards transgene-specific immune tolerance

 </sup>. Moreover, in hemophiliac dogs with inhibitor to FVIII or FIX, AAV expression of the transgene was efficacious in inhibitor eradication, mimicking ITI, followed by continuing expression with improvement of the disease phenotype
