<p>Results from recent early phase studies are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. The St Jude Children’s Research Hospital and University College of London (SJCRH/UCL) HB study using AAV-8-FIX-WT at doses of 2 × 10 
 <sup>11</sup> to 2 × 10 
 <sup>12</sup> vg/kg in 10 subjects demonstrated sustained FIX levels ranging from 2–5% in a dose-dependent manner reported over a 3-year period with ongoing observations

 </sup>. The transgene is biologically functional as observed by an approximately 90% decrease in bleeding episodes in the high-dose cohort. However, four out of six subjects presented with increased levels of ALT between weeks 7 and 10 post-vector injection, with some decrease in the FIX levels suggestive of AAV-mediated cellular immune responses. Administration of oral steroids prevented total loss of FIX expression, but prompt (&lt;48 hours) initiation of the drug provided the best outcome. No immune responses were observed in doses ≤6 × 10 
 <sup>11</sup> vg/kg (n=4). In an ongoing study by Spark, an AAV-FIX variant (FIX-Padua) at a low therapeutic dose of 5 × 10 
 <sup>11</sup> vg/kg was delivered to 10 subjects

 </sup>. The hyperactive FIX-Padua is a protein with approximately eightfold higher specific activity

 </sup> trials. FIX activity reached levels of 30% without inhibitor formation to FIX-Padua, and prophylaxis with FIX concentrates was stopped in all subjects for a ≥3-month period; long-term follow-up is ongoing. Notably, the rate of immune responses to AAV was lower, as only two out of 10 subjects required immunosuppression. These results demonstrate that FIX-Padua is safe and allows therapeutic levels with a lower risk of vector capsid immune responses. Evidence of FIX-Padua as an attractive transgene was also observed in a previous study by Shire using AAV-8 for HB

 </sup>. Long-term expression was restricted to a single subject (1 × 10 
 <sup>12</sup> vg/kg) with FIX activity of 20%. In this study, immunosuppression was not effective at preventing the loss of transgene expression. Again, no inhibitors to FIX-Padua were detected, as was predicted in large animal models
