<p>The uniQure study for HB is based on AAV-5-FIX-WT at doses of 5 × 10 
 <sup>12</sup> to 2 × 10 
 <sup>13</sup> vg/kg with resulting FIX levels ranging from 3–12% and nine out of 10 subjects stopped prophylaxis over 1.5 years of observation (ongoing)

 </sup>. However, there was not a clear dose response. An increase in ALT levels occurred in three out of 10 subjects around 10 weeks post AAV injection; all three subjects received steroids and none experienced appreciable FIX activity loss. The HA Biomarin study is based on AAV-5-BDD-FVIII. In the high-dose cohort (6 × 10 
 <sup>13</sup> vg/kg), sustained expression of FVIII of 19–164% of normal over a 12-month period was a rather surprising finding (ongoing)

 </sup>. All subjects are off prophylaxis. While an increase in ALT was documented in all subjects from this cohort, and steroids were initiated in all, there was not a clear relationship among ALT normalization, steroid use, and FVIII level stabilization. An additional safety concern raised by the AAV-5 trials is prolonged vector shedding in body fluids, including semen, where samples tested positive for vector sequences for 48 and 52 weeks (yet not cleared) post vector delivery at doses of 5 × 10 
 <sup>12</sup> vg/kg and 6 × 10 
 <sup>13</sup> vg/kg in FIX and FVIII trials, respectively. It is also important to note that age may also influence the vector shedding kinetics from the semen
