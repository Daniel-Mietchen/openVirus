<p>In the early days of gene therapy, the goal was rather modest: minimal increase of factor levels above 1% could improve the severe phenotype, as noted by both natural history of non-severe disease and prophylaxis. However, in a trial with two subjects with advanced underlying joint disease, FIX levels of 1.5â€“3% were not sufficient to prevent bleeds, and prophylaxis was continued

 </sup>. Thus, strategies with the potential to achieve &gt;5% of normal are likely to be more effective, with some evidence that levels above 12% could be associated with no spontaneous bleeding
