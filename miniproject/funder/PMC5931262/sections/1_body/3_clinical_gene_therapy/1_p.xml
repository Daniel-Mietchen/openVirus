<p>Decades of collective effort on the use of adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a vector for hemophilia have culminated with recent successes in long-term expression of therapeutic FVIII and FIX levels, amelioration of the disease phenotype, and reduction or even discontinuation of factor replacement

 </sup>. The first in-human AAV liver gene therapy for HB paved the way for the current successful strategies by showing that AAV can achieve therapeutic levels of functional FIX in a dose-dependent manner, but pre-existing neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to the AAV capsid can prevent liver transduction

 </sup>. These NAb are present in about 40% of the general population for some AAV serotypes

 </sup>. In addition, an AAV capsid-mediated cellular immune response can limit the duration of the transgene expression and is clinically recognized by an increase in liver enzymes (ALT/AST) and/or decrease in transgene expression levels

 </sup>. Subsequent trials, therefore, excluded subjects with NAb to the vector capsid and closely monitored for the capsid-directed immune response, which was managed by immunosuppression.
