<p>Codon optimization uses synonymous codon changes to increase protein expression without modifying amino acid sequences. The development of numerous codon optimization programs and the commercial availability make this strategy popular. However, there are potential risks, such as the creation of alternative open reading frames and alteration in protein post-translational modifications

 </sup>. As such, for codon optimization, the benefits in gain of expression must be weighed against these safety concerns. To date, the biochemical characterization of a codon-optimized FVIII-BDD that is expressed sevenfold higher than the non-codon-optimized FVIII showed similar, but not identical, biological activity
