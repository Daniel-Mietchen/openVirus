<p>There are several natural AAV serotypes derived from humans and non-human primates as well as synthetic capsids, which are engineered to enhance tissue tropism

 </sup>. All vectors tested in recent clinical trials have high tropism for the liver, which allows delivery via peripheral vein infusion. The expression of the transgene is restricted to hepatocytes by using distinct liver-specific promoters. All studies use codon optimization to enhance transgene expression levels and, in some trials, FIX variants with enhanced biological activity.
