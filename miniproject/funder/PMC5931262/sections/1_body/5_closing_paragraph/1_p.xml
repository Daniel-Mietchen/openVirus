<p>These new therapies will likely transform hemophilia care, providing more efficacious and convenient management options and possibly curative therapies. The largest gains will be accrued by those patients receiving only limited therapeutic benefits from current strategies, such as those with refractory inhibitors and frequent bleeding. However, it is imperative that the excitement over the considerable potential of these drugs to help undertreated patients does not obscure early safety concerns such as potential pathological PEG accumulation, thrombotic complications in NFTs, and irreversible supraphysiological factor levels after gene therapy. Furthermore, the cost of these emerging therapies is not clear; whether these new strategies will expand access to the 80% of worldwide patients who are currently not receiving regular therapy for economic reasons remains unknown. Hemophilia treaters will have to balance efficacy, convenience, price, and patient preferences and lifestyle when developing personalized treatment plans that include these novel therapies. The hemophilia community is entitled to definitive answers to these questions, which will require careful preclinical and clinical studies. As the types of available therapies become more varied, such studies must include assessments of the quality of life (QoL) of patients. The ultimate goal of therapies for hemophilia is to provide a QoL and life expectancy equivalent to those of someone without a bleeding disorder.</p>
