<p>Whether the EHL products alter the immunogenicity profile of rFVIII products and might be safer than pdFVIII–VWF products is an unanswered question. There is only one reported case of inhibitor development to date for EHL products

 </sup>. Early data support the hypothesis that Fc fusion may potentially decrease immunogenicity in previously treated patients, but analogous data for previously untreated patients are not yet available. To date, seventeen patients with inhibitors have been successfully tolerized with rFVIII–Fc, including some who had previously failed ITI with SHL rFVIII

  <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
 </sup>. The success of this strategy is likely due to a longer time with consistent antigen exposure with rFVIII–Fc

 </sup>. A clinical trial for immune tolerance therapy with rFVIII–Fc as first-line therapy is ongoing (NCT03093480). The available data suggest that the immune profile of EHL products is similar to, if not better than, SHL recombinant products. There are no data available comparing recombinant EHL with plasma-derived factors.
