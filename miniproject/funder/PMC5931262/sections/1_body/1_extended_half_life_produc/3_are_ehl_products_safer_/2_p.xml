<p>However, half-life-extending strategies utilizing protein sequence changes in the bypassing agent rFVIIa have proven problematic. Two different EHL rFVIIa products with changes in protein sequence to enhance stability progressed through early trials, but patients in later-phase trials developed inhibitors to the investigational drug that cross-reacted to endogenous FVIIa

 </sup>. These failures underscore the importance of further characterizing the immune response to novel products, especially with amino acid changes, in order to better predict immunogenicity in patients
