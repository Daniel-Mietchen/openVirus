 </sup>. For prophylaxis, patients with severe disease need to be injected with standard half-life (SHL) replacement therapy two to three times per week to minimize spontaneous bleeds by maintaining a factor level &gt;1%. Consequently, pharmaceutical development has focused on the optimization of product pharmacokinetics to decrease infusion frequency. Technologies used to create these extended half-life (EHL) products decrease clearance by fusion to the constant fragment (Fc) of IgG or albumin, PEGylation (the covalent attachment of polymeric hydrophilic polyethylene glycol [PEG] molecules), or protein modifications

 </sup>. Alternative strategies to extend half-life such as carboxy-terminal peptide technology, hydroxyethyl starch, and hyperglycosylation are still in early preclinical phases. Fusion technologies avoid lysosomal degradation of the protein by utilizing the neonatal Fc receptor to salvage factor proteins and recycle them into the circulation
