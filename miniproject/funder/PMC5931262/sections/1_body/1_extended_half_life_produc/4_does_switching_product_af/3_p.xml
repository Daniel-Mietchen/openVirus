<p>In conclusion, clinicians face a litany of challenging choices for factor replacement. They are tasked with prioritizing convenience, cost, compliance, and safety without definitive ability to predict immune or product pharmacokinetic responses. Though it is tempting to “move backwards” to pdFVIII based upon SIPPET and improved viral inactivation techniques, the potential of a novel blood-borne pathogen epidemic should engender caution. As inhibitors occur in only 20–30% of severe patients, the economic impact of widespread use of pdFVIII (as implied by recent risk-stratified SIPPET subanalysis

 </sup>) should be considered as national groups develop guidelines. Further insight into the basic mechanisms underlying FVIII immunogenicity and clearance, the role of VWF in both, and clear risk stratification schema for inhibitor formation will tremendously advance the ability to identify the best product for each patient.
