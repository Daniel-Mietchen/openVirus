<p>The possibility of prophylactic hemostatic coverage while avoiding venipuncture is probably attractive to all patients, but it remains unclear if NFTs will demonstrate better long-term outcomes than factor products for all clinical scenarios. The concerns regarding how best to treat breakthrough bleeding in inhibitor patients receiving NFTs should frame the debate about the role of ITI once NFTs enter clinical practice. ITI is challenging for patients and families; for example, almost 20% of randomized subjects withdrew from a recent ITI clinical trial

 </sup>. However, in the absence of inhibitors, nothing works as well to control and prevent bleeding as factor replacement

Moreover, it is unlikely that NFTs will be able to provide sufficient hemostasis for major surgery or trauma necessitating combination therapy with additional bypassing agents, which are neither as efficacious nor as safe as factor replacement. As such, despite the challenges associated with ITI, successful ITI will likely continue to provide superior long-term clinical outcomes compared to NFT prophylaxis with persistent inhibitors. Better risk stratification algorithms
