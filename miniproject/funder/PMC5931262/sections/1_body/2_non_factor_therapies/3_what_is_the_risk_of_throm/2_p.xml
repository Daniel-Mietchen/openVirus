<p>The risk of thrombotic complications due to unregulated hemostasis is not unique to emicizumab. Though no thrombotic adverse events were observed in the phase I studies, elevated D-dimer levels, a marker of pathological coagulation, were noted in several study participants receiving NFTs targeting AT

 </sup>. Recently, a phase II study evaluating fitusiran was temporarily suspended after a fatal thrombotic complication

 </sup>. The attractive pharmacokinetic parameters of NFTs that allow for weekly to monthly dosing appear to complicate the management of breakthrough bleeding episodes, as they probably necessitate combination therapies, which will likely increase the risk of thrombotic events. How to safely combine therapies will require thoughtful consideration and empiric studies. This concern raises the question of whether hemophilia patients should be evaluated for thrombophilias prior to starting NFTs. Indeed, one of the five subjects who experienced a thrombotic complication while receiving emicizumab was heterozygous for factor V Leiden

 </sup>, the most common inherited thrombophilia with a prevalence of approximately 5% in the Caucasian population

 </sup>. It also suggests the possibility that antidotes for NFTs may be helpful in the treatment of acute bleeds, which are not available currently except for recombinant AT, which should be able to reverse fitusiran.
