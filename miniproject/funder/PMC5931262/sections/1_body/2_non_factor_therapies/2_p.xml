<p>Emicizumab is a bispecific antibody that can simulate the biological function of FVIII sufficiently to produce a pro-coagulant effect in patients with HA

  <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>
 </sup>. One antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of the bispecific antibody recognizes activated FIX (FIXa), while the other Fab recognizes its substrate, factor X (FX); the simultaneous binding of FX and FIXa by emicizumab sufficiently orients these factors to facilitate the proteolytic activation of FX by FIXa without FVIIIa cofactor activity. Clinical studies have demonstrated that emicizumab is efficacious in decreasing, though not eliminating, the bleeding rate in HA patients with and without inhibitors

 </sup>. Encouragingly, the annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of inhibitor patients receiving emicizumab prophylaxis (ABR 2.9) is lower than rates with prophylactic bypassing therapies (ABR 10–36)

 <sup>
  <xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
  <xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>
 </sup> that demonstrate that a decrease in these anti-coagulant pathways may offset the pro-coagulant deficiency in hemophilia and promote hemostasis. Approaches with reported early phase clinical trial results include the AT siRNA therapeutic fitusiran

 </sup>, concizumab; both drugs demonstrated encouraging efficacy data. The hemostatic effect of non-factor therapies (NFTs) is impervious to inhibitors. NFTs can also be administered subcutaneously at weekly to monthly frequencies, which is appealing compared to frequent intravenous administrations of standard factor products, though injection site adverse events have been reported in 15–25% of patients receiving NFTs

 </sup>. These attributes have generated considerable excitement; however, how these new treatments will be integrated into clinical practice depends on the resolution of several ongoing debates.
