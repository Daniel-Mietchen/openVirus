<p id="Par8">Certain rodent-borne arenaviruses are known to cause illnesses in humans. The deadly Lassa fever in West Africa, with up to 5000 fatalities annually [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], is caused by Lassa virus (LASV) which was recently discovered to be maintained by multiple rodent reservoirs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Etiological agents of hemorrhagic fevers in South America include the Junin virus (borne by the drylands vesper mouse 
 <italic>Calomys masculinus</italic> and other rodents), Machupo virus (borne by the larger vesper mouse 
 <italic>Callomys callosus</italic>) and Guanarito virus (hosted by the common cane mouse 
 <italic>Zygodontomys brevicauda</italic>) [
