<p id="Par9">Other arenaviruses which are not currently known to be associated with disease in humans continue to be discovered. Across Africa, for instance, Mobala virus was detected in 
 <italic>Praomys</italic> sp. within the Central African Republic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; Kodoko virus in 
 <italic>Mus minutoides</italic> within Guinea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; and Jirandogo and Natorduori viruses in 
 <italic>Mus baoulei</italic> and 
 <italic>Mus mattheyi</italic>, respectively, within Ghana [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These fast-evolving RNA viruses, though apparently non-pathogenic, are also of epidemiological importance as they possess the potential to emerge in new, possibly harmful ways. Indeed, some of them such as the rodent-borne Gbagroube and Jirandogo viruses were demonstrated to be closely related phylogenetically to LASV lineage I [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Surveys are therefore needed to evaluate the occurrence of these arenaviruses across host species and at wider geographical scales than previously sampled, such as was recently done in Tanzania, eastern Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
