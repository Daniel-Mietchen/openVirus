<p id="Par10">Prevalence data for zoonotic viruses in relation to parameters such as season, sex and age of host animals also contribute insight into how these viruses are transmitted and maintained between individuals. For example, researchers were able to link human epidemics to seasonal cycles of Puumala hantavirus prevalence in the bank vole

In instances where there is significant difference in virus prevalence between sexes, male rodents have usually been found to possess higher infection rates possibly due to their propensity to inflict wounds on each other as they fight and display territorial behavior [
