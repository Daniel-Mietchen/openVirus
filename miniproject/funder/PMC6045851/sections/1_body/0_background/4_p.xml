<p id="Par11">Recent studies have made available some information concerning arenavirus occurrence in small mammals within Nigeria: LASV lineage II and a novel Mobala-like virus were detected in the natal multimammate mouse 
 <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic>, while LASV lineage III was discovered in the Guinea multimammate mouse 
 <italic>Mastomys erythroleucus</italic> and the Kako strain of LASV in the African wood mouse 
 <italic>Hylomyscus pamfi</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Screening antigens and antibodies such as immunoglobin G helps detect acute and previous infections, thus providing further insight into occurrence and prevalence dynamics. Therefore it was our aim in this study to combine PCR detection data from Olayemi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with new serological information including the same animals in order to provide further insight into arenavirus occurrence within small mammals in Nigeria.
