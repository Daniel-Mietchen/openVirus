<p id="Par20">Of all the individual small mammals captured and tested in this study, none were PCR- and IgG-positive at the same time. Because arenavirus infection was most extensive in 
 <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic> populations, we attempted to examine variation in prevalence according to locality, season, and age in this species. However, our analyses did not show prevalence for any of these variables to be statistically significant (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Although not statistically significant, PCR and IgG distribution for key 
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> populations are depicted by season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), sex and age (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
