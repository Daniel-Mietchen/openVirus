<p id="Par18">PCR- and IgG-positive small mammals were detected in both endemic and non endemic zones for Lassa fever (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Overall, PCR and IgG infection were most ubiquitous in 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> (16 and 40 individuals, respectively; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This species tested positive in 5 out of 8 localities where the rodent was trapped. Out of the 5 localities, Eguare Egoro and Ekpoma contained individuals PCR-positive for LASV while Mayo Ranewo contained a Mobala-positive individual. Next in IgG occurrence, 
 <italic>M. erythroleucus</italic> was positive in 3 out of 4 localities (15 individuals). In one of these localities (Onmba Abena) 3 
 <italic>M. erythroleucus</italic> individuals were also LASV-positive.
