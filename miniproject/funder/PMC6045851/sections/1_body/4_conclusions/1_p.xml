<p id="Par29">Our findings reveal arenavirus infection has a much expanded geographical distribution and small mammal host range than has been discovered within Nigeria in the past. Populations of 
 <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic>, 
 <italic>M. erythroleucus</italic> and 
 <italic>Hylomyscus pamfi</italic>, being natural hosts of LASV and a Mobala-like virus, included PCR- and IgG-positive individuals, but several other small mammal species were only IgG-positive. Among the animals exclusively IgG-positive could be natural hosts of other yet-to-be-described arenaviruses or incidental hosts caused by spill-over infections. However, even spill-over infections must be accorded epidemiological importance as challenge by continually evolving viruses may lead to adaptation and eventual emergence in new small mammal species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Further attempts to isolate and characterize arenaviruses should be made in localities where IgG but not PCR-positive animals were detected. In addition, longer investigations (beyond two years as was the scope in this study) and increased sampling (between and within seasons) should be carried out to understand more fully the dynamics of Lassa and other arenaviruses borne by small mammals in order to counter their zoonotic effect in Nigeria.
