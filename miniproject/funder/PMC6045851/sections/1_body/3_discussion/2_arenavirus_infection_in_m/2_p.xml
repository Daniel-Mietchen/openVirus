<p id="Par24">IgG signatures in 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> populations that were not PCR-positive (e.g. Ngel Nyaki) might well represent LASV or some other arenavirus, as antibodies of closely related arenaviruses are known to cross-react with the LASV antigen used in this study [

 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> is a well known carrier of arenaviruses other than LASV such as Mopeia [
