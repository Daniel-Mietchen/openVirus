<p id="Par26">PCR and IgG prevalence were not significantly different between seasons for 
 <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic> in populations sampled longitudinally in this study. On the other hand, a significantly higher LASV prevalence was found in 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> during the rainy season within Guinea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Failure to obtain statistically significant results for season in this study may have been due to our relatively small sample size (
 <italic>n</italic> = 65 for 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> in Eguare and Ekpoma compared to 
 <italic>n</italic> = 553 for 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> in Guinea [
