<p id="Par23">The geographical disparity in seroprevalence for 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> was as high as 52% in Mayo Ranewo, 17â€“36% in Eguare Egoro, Ekpoma, Ngel Nyaki, and as low as 1% in Abagboro. IgG positive 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> individuals in populations where there were also LASV-PCR-positive mice (Eguare Egoro and Ekpoma) probably indicate previous LASV infections. Similarly, the IgG-positive 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> in Mayo Ranewo probably reflect past infection by the Mobala-like arenavirus detected by PCR in this same rodent species.
