<p id="Par28">Combined detection of arenavirus prevalence in small mammals in this study by PCR (representing active infection) and IgG (indicating previous infection) contributes to data already presented in other studies concerning seroconversion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. These studies demonstrate that arenavirus infections in small mammals are normally acute, with the virus clearing quickly to be replaced by antibodies. Therefore, individuals tested usually are either only PCR-positive or IgG-positive, with very few individuals carrying these two markers of infection at the same time. The acute infection model was supported in this study as no individual was jointly PCR- and IgG-positive in 
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> (or any other small mammal tested). This pattern is best illustrated by the Mobala-like arenavirus infection of 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic>, which had the highest IgG prevalence (52%) among all positive 
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> populations but, conversely, the lowest PCR prevalence (3%). However, although virus was absent from blood in IgG-positive individuals, our data does not exclude the possibility that seropositive animals were actively excreting LASV in urine or saliva or contained latent virus in the organs.
