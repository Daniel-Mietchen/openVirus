<p id="Par21">Arenavirus occurrence (as detected by PCR and IgG markers) was widespread across the study area in various small mammal species but was most ubiquitous in 
 <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic> and 
 <italic>M. erythroleucus</italic>. Out of seven non-
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> small mammal species that were IgG positive, four (
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic>, 
 <italic>Praomys daltoni</italic>, 
 <italic>Mus minutoides</italic> and 
 <italic>Crocidura</italic> spp.) occurred where infected 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> were also present. In Guinea, non-
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> species were also detected that were IgG-positive, including 
 <italic>P. daltoni</italic> and 
 <italic>Mus minutoides</italic> (as in this study) but also 
 <italic>P. rostratus</italic> and 
 <italic>Lemniscomys striatus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Up to now, active LASV infections (by virus isolation or PCR) have never been detected in these species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Their IgG antibodies probably indicate temporary, spillover infections caused by their proximity to infected 
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> in areas highly endemic for Lassa fever like Eguare Egoro and Ekpoma.
