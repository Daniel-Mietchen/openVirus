<p id="Par22">Four non-
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> were also arenavirus-postive in Kako and Ilobu, outside the endemic zone for Lassa fever (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These are 
 <italic>Hylomyscus pamfi</italic> (PCR-positive), 
 <italic>Mus baoulei</italic>, 
 <italic>Praomys missonei</italic> and 
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic> (all IgG-positive). 
 <italic>H. pamfi</italic> in Kako was recently discovered to be the natural reservoir of a LASV strain close to lineage I. The IgG signatures detected in 
 <italic>Mus baoulei</italic> and 
 <italic>P. missonei</italic> in Kako could represent spill-over infections from 
 <italic>H. pamfi</italic>. However, in Ilobu there is a high IgG prevalence in 
 <italic>Mus baoulei</italic> (4/5). Interestingly, in nearby Ghana, 
 <italic>Mus baoulei</italic> was also recently detected to be host of the Jirandogo arenavirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which like the lineage found to infect 
 <italic>H. pamfi</italic>, is close to LASV lineage I. Further sampling in Kako and Ilobu will provide increased insight into evolution of LASV in non-
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> in the non endemic area of Lassa fever in south-western Nigeria.
