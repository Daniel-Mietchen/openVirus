<p id="Par17">The weight in milligrams of the eye lens (ELW), dried in an incubator for 2 h at 100 °C, was used as a surrogate for small mammal age [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The statistical analysis was restricted to Eguare-Egoro and Ekpoma, two localities that were sampled longitudinally and where 
 <italic>M. natalensis</italic> had both PCR- and IgG-positive individuals. The effects of locality (2 levels: see above), season (2 levels: dry, rainy) and age (log-transformed ELW as a continuous variable) on arenavirus infection were evaluated by logistic regression using a generalized linear model with logit-link function in R software [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Regressions were performed for each infection, IgG or antigen, including locality and season as fixed effect. We kept the variable “locality” as a fixed effect because one was rural and the other one was periurban. These localities were designated because of the presence of human Lassa cases, and were not chosen randomly. As our data set is small (
 <italic>n</italic> = 65), we introduced only one 2-way interaction “locality × season”. This interaction was chosen because of possible spatial and temporal risk of LASV transmission from rodent to humans. In order to remain in the conditions of validity of the test which stipulates to have at least 5 events by explanatory variable, we kept only 3 independent variables: the locality, the season and the age [
