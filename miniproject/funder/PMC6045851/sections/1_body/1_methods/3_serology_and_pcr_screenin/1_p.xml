<p id="Par15">Small mammals were tested for Lassa virus (LASV) IgG antibody using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). As LASV and other closely related arenaviruses are known to cross-react serologically, IgG-positive samples were interpreted as being indicative of a past infection by LASV or possibly some other arenavirus. Whole blood was diluted at 1:20 in 1% triton-phosphate buffer saline (PBS) solution. Serum from the liver rinsed with 1% triton-PBS was used when blood was not available. Seven microliter drops of this solution were then transferred unto slides spotted with the Bantou strain of LASV grown beforehand in Vero cells (see details of the method in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). Samples showing fluorescence were regarded IgG-positive. Positive samples were confirmed by a second independent viewing. Samples with ambiguous results were further examined on a slide that had the upper row of spots infected with the LASV antigen and the lower row non-infected. Side-by-side comparison of infected and non-infected spots bearing the same sample enabled an eventual decision concerning IgG status.
