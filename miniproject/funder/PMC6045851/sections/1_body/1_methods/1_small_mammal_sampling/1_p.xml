<p id="Par12">A total of 906 small mammal specimens were sampled from 11 localities within Nigeria (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Coordinates for each locality are as follows: Abagboro 7°32'38.0"N, 4°30'47.2"E; Kako 7°41'26.3"N, 4°37'09.8"E; Esira 7°42'04.7"N, 4°39'19.4"E; Ilobu 7°52'23.1"N, 4°31'35.4"E; Eguare Egoro 6°46'22.7"N, 6°05'32.5"E; Ekpoma 6°44'29.1"N, 6°06'17.6"E; Mayo Ranewo 8°49'27.2"N, 10°55'15.2"E; Ngel Nyaki 7°05'30.8"N, 11°05'7.9"E; Onmba Abena 7°38'27.5"N, 8°24'23.6"E; Ndubia 6°21'45.9"N, 8°19'22.7"E; and Abakaliki 6°17'38.9"N, 8°5'54.3"E. Small mammals from 9 of these localities were trapped between 2011 and 2013. Through this period, Abagboro, Eguare Egoro and Onmba Abena were investigated during the dry season (January-March) and rainy season (September-October) in both 2011 and 2012. Ekpoma was investigated in the dry season and rainy season in 2012 only. In addition to these 9 localities, trapping was conducted in 2 sites within eastern Nigeria (Abakaliki and Ndubia) during November 2015. Based on the published research literature [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] 7 of the 11 localities sampled are regarded as sited within the endemic area for Lassa fever within Nigeria, where epidemics are frequent (Fig.
