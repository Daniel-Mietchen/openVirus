<p id="Par13">With regard to sampling habitats, trapping was varied slightly according to whether a locality was relatively rural or urban. Almost all the localities sampled in this study (9 out of 11) are villages in a rural setting (or villages on the outskirts of a larger town). In these areas, trapping indoors (within kitchens, bedrooms and food storage areas) was carried out through a transect running across the village, with 2 traps dispatched per room. Trapping outdoors was carried out in habitats far removed from immediate human habitation (sylvatic vegetation such as forest, savanna or fallow land) in trap-lines containing 20 traps spaced over 100 m with 5 m between individual traps. The two remaining localities (Ekpoma and Abakaliki) are considered relatively urban in terms of size and presence of modern civic infrastructure. Here, instead of a transect, trapping was carried out indoors in various house addresses dotted across the city. In this case, sampling outdoors was in a peridomestic setting: in gardens (sometimes littered with rubbish heaps) not far from human habitations. Therefore, overall, 3 habitat types were sampled in this study: indoors, peridomestic vegetation and sylvatic vegetation. The Osun State Ministry of Environment, the Taraba State Ministry of Health, and the Gwer West Local Government Area office in Benue State granted permission to trap small mammals in the localities under their authority.</p>
