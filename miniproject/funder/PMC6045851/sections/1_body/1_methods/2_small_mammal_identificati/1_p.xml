<p id="Par14">Morphological identification of small mammals was done using external criteria such as fur color, nipple formula, and standard measurements: body weight, head-and-body length, tail length, hindfoot length and ear length [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Molecular identification was facilitated by DNA cytochrome 
 <italic>b</italic> sequencing, especially for the 
 <italic>Mastomys</italic> spp. and other sibling species such as those within 
 <italic>Mus</italic> (
 <italic>Nannomys</italic>) spp. We did not designate specimens from 
 <italic>Crocidura</italic> to species level because, even with the benefit of cytochrome 
 <italic>b</italic> sequencing, the taxonomy of this genus is not well established. For example, the species currently known as 
 <italic>C. olivieri</italic> (for which a large number of specimens were morphologically identified in our collection) has very recently been described as polyphyletic [
