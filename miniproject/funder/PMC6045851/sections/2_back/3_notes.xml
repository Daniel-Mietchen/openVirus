  <p id="Par32">During the research that produced these results, we obtained permits from various states within Nigeria to trap small mammals. Specifically, we were granted permission to carry out our sampling by the Osun State Ministry of Environment, the Taraba State Ministry of Health, and the Gwer West Local Government Authority in Benue State. Our work involved trapping small mammals, euthanizing them and obtaining biopsies from the carcasses for laboratory analyses. The work did not include human subjects or animal experiments, and the rodents we captured are not endangered species.</p>
