<p>The recent expansion of the previously obscure ZIKV beyond its historical endemic range in equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia has piqued scientific and public health interest in emerging viral diseases. Phylogenetic analyses and investigations into recently acquired genetic polymorphisms suggest that recent evolutionary changes may have contributed to the rapid emergence and novel neurological pathogenesis observed in contemporary ZIKV outbreaks in the Americas [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-10-00728" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this study, we selected four ZIKV isolates from different points in its phylogenetic history (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00728">Figure S1</xref>) and compared viral replicative fitness in human lung carcinoma (A549) and human astrocytoma (U-251 MG) cell lines. We compared two ZIKV isolates from the 2015â€“2016 outbreaks in Puerto Rico and Brazil (ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup>) to an earlier Asian lineage isolate (ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup>) and the historical Uganda 1947 reference isolate (ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup>). We found that Asian lineage isolates produce more negative-strand intermediate vRNA, and that the contemporary ZIKV isolates, and in particular ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup>, produce more dsRNA and significantly higher viral titers over a single infectious cycle (which was more pronounced in U-251 MG cells), although these contemporary isolates may be impaired in cell spread over multiple infectious cycles.
