<p>Next, we determined the relative CPEs induced by the four ZIKV isolates over multiple rounds of infection at a low MOI. In contrast to the high MOI condition, where strain-specific differences in CPE were dependent on cell type, at low MOI, the strain-specific trend in CPE was consistent across cell lines (

 <sup>BR</sup> induced the least CPEs in both A549 and U-251 MG cells with approximately 2% and 7% cytopathicity, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f001">Figure 1</xref>D,E). ZIKV
 <sup>PR</sup> and ZIKV
 <sup>CDN</sup> induced intermediate CPE in both cell types (approximately 40% and 20% cytopathicity, respectively). However, ZIKV
 <sup>AF</sup> induced the greatest CPE of all isolates at 72 h post-infection at MOI 0.01, with approximately 60% cytopathicity in both A549 and U-251 MG cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00728-f002">Figure 2</xref>C,D). Taken together, these results suggest that although ZIKV
 <sup>BR</sup> appears to have a replicative advantage that is more pronounced in astrocytoma cells, this advantage is likely due to increased viral replication in the initial infection rather than to increases over subsequent rounds of infection. As this could imply differences in cell spread across the ZIKV isolates, we next wanted to assess the percentage of infected cells across isolates.
