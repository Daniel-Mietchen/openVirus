<p>Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantification of positive- and negative-strand intracellular viral RNA was determined by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time System using the iTaQ Universal Probe One-Step Kit (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON, Canada) with 0.5 μL of PrimePCR GAPDH primers and probe (HEX, Bio-Rad) per reaction. The primers used to detect ZIKV RNA were as follows: forward, 5′-CCG CTG CCC AAC ACA AG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCA CTA ACG TTC TTT TGC AGA CAT-3′; probe, 5′-/56-FAM/AGC CTA CCT/ZEN/TGA CAA GCA ATC AGA CAC TCA A/3IABkFQ/-3′ [

A strand-specific reverse transcription (RT) reaction was carried out by addition of either the forward or the reverse primer during RT at 50 °C for 10 min, after which the other ZIKV primer and ZIKV probe was added to the reaction. The cycling conditions were: 95 °C for 3 min, then 45 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 60 s. The amount of viral RNA was normalized to GAPDH using the ΔCt method, and compared to a standard curve of log
 <sub>10</sub> (PFU equivalents) which was extracted from cell culture supernatants [

 <sup>(−ΔΔCT)</sup> method using GAPDH as the internal control after normalization to the relative PCR efficiencies of the different ZIKV isolates.
