<p>A549 and U-251 MG cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well in eight-well chamber slides the day before infection. Cells were infected with ZIKV at indicated MOI as described above and harvested at the indicated time points. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in 1× PBS, washed three times in PBS, and blocked with 0.3% Triton X-100 and 5% FBS in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were incubated with anti-J2 dsRNA (Scicons) diluted 1:1000 in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h followed by washing three times in PBS. Samples were then incubated with goat anti-mouse Alexafluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted 1:300 in PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 followed by three PBS washes before mounting with VectaShield containing DAPI (Cedarlane, Burlington, ON, Canada). Z-stack images were acquired using a Zeiss AxioObserver inverted microscope with a 63× oil objective. The number of dsRNA foci per cell was quantified using Imaris version 9.1.2 (Bitplane Inc., South Windsor, CT, USA). Foci of size 0.3 × 0.3 × 4 μm above quality 17.0 were automatically detected using the spot detection function and manually verified for at least 100 cells per condition.
