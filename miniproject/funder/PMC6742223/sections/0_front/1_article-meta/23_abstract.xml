 <p>The impact of intrinsic versus external drivers of transmission on long-term dynamics is an open question in complex systems studies. In particular, when and where dynamics become chaotic has crucial implications for control efforts. Here, we extended the well-studied London measles data to include nearly a century of novel data (1897â€“1991) that also contains five major demographic changes: the First and Second World Wars, the wartime evacuation of London, the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the start of a measles mass vaccination program. We found that a simple stochastic epidemic model, with minimal historical specifications, can capture the nearly 100 years of dynamics including changes caused by each of the major perturbations. We further illustrated that the majority of dynamic changes are explainable by the internal nonlinear dynamics of the system, tuned by demographic changes. Notably however, the 1918 influenza pandemic and evacuation acted as external perturbations to this basic epidemic oscillator. Yet, in the wake of these massive shifts, the overall system remained stable (Lyapunov exponent &lt; 0), underlining how long-term ecological and epidemiological dynamics can follow very simple rules, even in a non-stationary population subject to significant perturbations and major secular changes.</p>
