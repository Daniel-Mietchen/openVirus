<p>Although sudden changes in periodicity may appear unpredictable, we show that knowledge of internal and external events, such as changes in birth rates and sudden population changes, is enough to produce accurate forecasts of periodicity and outbreak dynamics. By explicitly incorporating the reduction in contact rates associated with the key demographic perturbations in 20th century London, such as the 1918 pandemic and WWII evacuation, we demonstrate how subtle changes in contact rates, rather than more obvious changes such as a birth pulse, can lead to bifurcations and other changes in the dynamics of this nonlinear system (see also [
