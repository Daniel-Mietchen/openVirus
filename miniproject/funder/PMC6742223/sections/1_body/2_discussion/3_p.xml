<p>Our analysis both contrasts with and complements the work of Hempel and Earn [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], who showed that understanding New York measles dynamics requires consideration of non-stationarities in the underlying nonlinear clockwork. Our London analysis, in contrast, suggests that changes in the dynamics resulted from pulsed perturbations and secular changes in susceptible recruitment rates. The identification of a single seasonality function around a constant

 <sub>0</sub> (with the exception of WWII) for the entire time series, given the scale of the changes observed in population size and schooling dynamics, provides a compelling case for the utility of considering simple mechanistic models when studying predictability of long-term nonlinear dynamics. A crucial difference between the two settings may be as pointed out by [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]: the US measles attractor appears to be more sensitive to small changes in seasonal forcing than that of the UK.
