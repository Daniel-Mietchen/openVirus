<p>Despite these limitations, we have nearly doubled the London measles analysis to include multiple transitions that have not previously been considered in tandem. Using a simple fitted model combined with an estimated CFR, we have shown how robust the nonlinear dynamics produced by the SEIR family of models can be despite multiple perturbations to the system that impact nearly every compartment of the model. Further work on predictability should continue to seek long time series in systems that experience critical dynamic shifts to further test the utility of applying ecological consumer-resource theory in the context of infectious disease dynamics. Finally, given the recent resurgence of measles due to vaccine hesitancy, our study lends itself to the public health importance of understanding the nonlinear dynamics of endemic transmission.</p>
