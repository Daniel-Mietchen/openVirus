<p>A key question in nonlinear ecological dynamics is how a system responds to external changes. Examining measles in London using a stochastic SEIR model, we were able to quantify the impact of external perturbations on the internal clockwork across nearly a century of data. We found strong agreement between the data and the fitted, forward-simulated model, indicating that both temporal dynamics, such as epidemic shape and size, and bifurcations can be accurately predicted. Assessing the stability of the London attractor using Lyapunov exponents, we found remarkable stability (LE &lt; 0) across the time series, with most of the phase plane being highly dissipative (LLEs &lt; 0), thereby accounting for the absence of long-term divergence even in the presence of stochasticity. Additionally, we show that a temporally stable seasonal transmission function is sufficient to reproduce the empirical dynamics despite any possible socio-economic changes during the last century.</p>
