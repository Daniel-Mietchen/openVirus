<p>We used particle filtering to fit a seasonally- and demographically-forced SEIR model to combine weekly measles mortality and incidence data reported in London from 1897–1991 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007305.g001">Fig 1</xref>). We quantified the periodicity of the observed dynamics using wavelet analysis. Biennial dynamics predominate (65% of the weeks), although the time series bifurcated from biennial to annual dynamics multiple times (excluding the post-vaccination transients). Although there was a biennial signature around 1910, there is a clear bifurcation from annual to biennial epidemics in 1920. The dynamics remained biennial until returning to an annual attractor in the early 1940s. In 1950, the well-studied post-WWII ‘Baby Boom’ bifurcation occurred, after which dynamics remained firmly biennial until the transient post-vaccination era starting in 1968. Although both World Wars resulted in large shifts in births (
