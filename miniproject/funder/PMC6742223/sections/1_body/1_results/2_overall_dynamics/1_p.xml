<p>We find that, despite numerous bifurcations in the periodicity of epidemics, a single stochastic SEIR model is able to explain the overall behavior of nearly 100 years of limit cycles. We forward simulated the trajectory using the estimated parameters starting from a single set of initial conditions to produce a 4,877-week ahead prediction to test its ability to capture the observed dynamics. Overall, the re-simulated fitted dynamics show remarkably strong agreement with the data using a number of metrics (visual fit of the forward simulation:

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007305.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Using wavelet spectra, we quantified the time-varying periodicity of each forward simulation. Starting in 1897, the SEIR model is firmly annual until 1910, where a slight biennial signature starts to appear in the majority of simulations. The inferred system returns to an annual attractor until 1920, where a strong bifurcation occurs (discussed below), pushing the simulations predominately onto a biennial phase. The trajectory remains closely matched against the data until the WWII evacuation (discussed below). Consistent with previous analyses, the model further predicts the bifurcations seen in the data in 1950 when the baby boom abated. Finally, we see a strong internal dynamic change in 1968 at the start of vaccination. Although, the system overestimated the annual signature compared to the data in this era, both three-year and above signals emerge and finally become dominant as measles is driven to near extinction by immunization.
