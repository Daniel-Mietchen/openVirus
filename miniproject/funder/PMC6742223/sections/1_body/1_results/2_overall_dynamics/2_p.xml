<p>In order to test the impact of external perturbations on the basic recurrent dynamics, we used the above simulation as a null model purely driven by demographic changes. Variations in demographic rates capture all dynamical shifts except the ones observed in 1920 and 1940 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007305.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). Importantly, demography alone cannot explain the sudden bifurcation observed in 1920 after WWI and the 1918 influenza pandemic. Similarly, demographics alone do not explain the shifts observed during the WWII evacuation.
