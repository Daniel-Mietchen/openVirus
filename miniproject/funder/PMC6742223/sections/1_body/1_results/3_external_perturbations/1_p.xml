<p>To explain discrepancies in the overall forward-simulated trajectory, we incorporated two external perturbations through changes in the contact rates. As hypothesized, our model identified one of the major epidemiological effects of large-scale demographic perturbations to be a change in transmission; we estimate that contact during the 1918 influenza pandemic decreased by 38% (see
