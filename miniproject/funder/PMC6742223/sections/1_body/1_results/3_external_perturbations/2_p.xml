<p>The impacts of WWI did not result in demographic changes large enough to overpower the 1918 effect. The dynamical impacts of WWII, however, were far greater. During the WWII period, the null model fit departs from the data both in outbreak magnitude and periodicity (see Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007305.g003">3</xref>). However, unlike the 1918 pandemic, we were unable to identify parameters for the reduction in contact due to WWII. Since this time period includes the wartime evacuation of school-age children from cities, there were likely key differences in seasonality and mixing patterns associated with the major movement of children in the early 1940s. When we fit the model independently to the six-year war epoch of data and use the difference between maximum and minimum seasonality (normalized by the mean) as a measure of amplitude, we find that the WWII time period is the lowest amplitude epoch across the entire time series. This provides evidence of a strong external impact, indicating a lower influence of term-time forcing while retaining a similar mean basic reproductive ratio
