<p>Previous analyses have suggested that varying patterns of transmission (other than seasonality) may influence the large dynamic shifts observed in these data. However, interestingly, our results show that a constant mean transmission rate (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 29) modulated by a fixed pattern of seasonal variation mirroring the school-term predicts the majority of the data even as the attractor is hit by large internal and external perturbations. This is in contrast to the previous analysis of long-term data from New York city which concluded that a model with secular changes in transmission patterns was required to explain the data [
