<p>To further quantify the stability of the system across 1897 to 1991, we calculated both local and global Lyapunov exponents [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. From the fitted model, we calculated the dominant Lyapunov exponent, and found no evidence of chaotic dynamics, despite multiple dynamical jumps between the attractors (LE = -0.04, range: -0.28–0.11,

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In terms of local dynamics, the LLEs point to stability around two biannual attractors (1920–1935 and 1950–1965, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007305.g005">Fig 5</xref>). However, LLEs in this context may be more qualitative, as we are comparing mean birth rates in an era (
