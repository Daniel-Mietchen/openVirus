<p>Additionally, we performed a wavelet spectra analysis to quantify measles periodicity throughout the time series [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This descriptive analysis yields insight into whether the observed dynamics (as well as the fitted model forward simulations) are annual, biennial, or three-plus year cycles at each time step. Measuring the periodicity over time for multiple stochastic simulations from the fitted model allows for a probabilistic comparison between the observed and predicted dynamics.
