<p>For the entire time series, we used a simple well-mixed Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model with seasonal forcing in transmission (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007305.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Similar to [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we used a stochastic framework with both demographic (epidemic birth-death) stochasticity and white noise environmental stochasticity in the force of infection. To examine whether a year-invariant pattern of transmission,

The shape of seasonality is generally thought of as driven by changing contact patterns during opening and closing of schools. We estimated a single seasonal forcing function except for during the 1918 pandemic (discussed below), where transmission is modulated at a constant rate. We also included an additional parameter, the cohort effect, to capture the possibility that more children may effectively enter the susceptible class at the start of the school year (i.e. an annual susceptible recruitment pulse [
