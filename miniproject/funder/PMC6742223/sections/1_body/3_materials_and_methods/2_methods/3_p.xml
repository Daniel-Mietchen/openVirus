<p>To test the modelâ€™s ability to capture multiple transients across the time series, we specified three main elaborations to the standard SEIR model. First, we explicitly incorporated the reduction in contact due to the 1918 pandemic when schools and theaters were closed as a public health measure. If a reduction in contact is inferred, the pattern of seasonality does not change, simply the magnitude during the pandemic year decreases. Second, we estimated a case fatality rate (CFR) [

To preserve local variability in the measles fatality rate, the CFR was inferred using a Gaussian Process regression between cumulative deaths and cumulative births. Although the estimated CFR impacts the magnitude of predicted epidemics, it does not impact the periodicity and was thus used as a covariate (similar to the population data) in the analysis. Finally, we subtracted vaccines from the susceptible compartment assuming 90% efficacy [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Once parameters are estimated, we can forward simulate the fitted model to compare against the data.
