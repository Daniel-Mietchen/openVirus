<p>To explore the interaction between stochastic and nonlinear dynamics in recurrent epidemics, we evaluated both the global and local Lyapunov exponents (LEs and LLEs, respectively). While LEs give a measure of overall sensitivity to initial conditions and overall dissipativeness (i.e. the ability of a system to return to a steady state) across the measles attractor, the LLEs show where along the attractor noise and/or perturbation are likely to lead to divergent epidemic trajectories (LLE &gt; 0), and where the nonlinear clock-work will contract epidemics onto similar trajectories (LLE &lt; 0) [

To facilitate ease of calculation of the LE and LLEs, we used the discrete-time time series SIR (TSIR) approximation of the SEIR model with time-steps scaled to be biweekly. Predicted LLEs were obtained from calculating the deterministic skeleton of the fitted TSIR model. The R package tsiR [
