<p>Between 1940 and 1947, both measles mortality and case data were available. However, due to the small number of measles deaths in this period (less than 200 notified deaths versus over 100,000 reported cases), we used the case data from 1940 onward to capture the endemic pre-vaccination dynamics. Given that we were only interested in estimating a single set of initial conditions in 1897, we used iterated filtering methods in which parameters of interest take random walks with a fixed standard deviation to maximize the likelihood [
