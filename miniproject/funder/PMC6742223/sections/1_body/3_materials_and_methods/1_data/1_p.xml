<p>We analyzed weekly measles incidence and measles mortality reports in London from 1897 to 1991. In addition to the previously analyzed and published incidence data from 1944–1964 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and mortality data from 1904–1915 and 1922–1932 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], we extended both the incidence (now 1940–1991) and mortality (1897–1940) time series to produce a continuous sequence of monitoring data for the entire period comprising 4,877 weekly data points across the 94 years. Official mortality and incidence notifications (measles cases became notifiable in 1940) were digitized from the Registrar General’s Weekly Reports [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], while estimates of life expectancy were obtained from the Office of National Statistics [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We used country-level averaged vaccination rates in scaling susceptible recruitment rates.
