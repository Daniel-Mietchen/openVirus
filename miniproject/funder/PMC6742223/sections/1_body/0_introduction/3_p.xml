<p>Due to the temporal scale of data required, there have been few analyses examining the direct impact of demographic changes on the underlying dynamics beyond a simple shift in birth rates or the effect of vaccination on susceptible recruitment. A larger range of external perturbations than those previously tested are possible, such as population fluctuations impacting the force of infection and local variation in contact rates (as the result of public health responses). One analysis [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] examined a long New York time series finding agreement between the observed non-resonant peaks and the predicted transient periods. However, recent work has found differences in measles dynamics between the US and UK suggesting that these results may not be universal across all settings [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], making London an excellent case study for additional analysis. Although discrete time approximations of the mass-action epidemic model work well for incidence data [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], even these data are often limited in temporal span. In contrast, mortality data were systematically collected years before incidence data, providing longer periods covering several major demographic perturbations [
