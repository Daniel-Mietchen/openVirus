<p>Measles, in particular, lends itself to analysis using simple host-pathogen epidemic models. From the early work examining the role of the World War II evacuation [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], historic measles notification records have helped illuminate the utility, and intersection, of theory and data. In particular, data from the late 1800s and early 1900s from Copenhagen and New York [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] have revealed recurrent epidemics whose frequency and amplitude change over long-time scales. Although a wide diversity of dynamical regimes has been observed (e.g., regular annual or biennial cycles [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and chaos [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]), the underlying clockwork–susceptible depletion by infection or vaccination and replenishment by births followed by cycles of human aggregation resulting in seasonal fluctuations in transmission–is ubiquitous [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Although both intrinsic (the natural pathogen life history and demography) and extrinsic (local changes to the contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals) processes can drive changes in periodicity, to date few studies have extensively investigated to what extent the dynamics are driven by the internal clockwork versus large external perturbations, and the resulting impact on the frequency and amplitude of epidemics in the long term. Aside from answering core questions in ecology, predicting the epidemic patterns of measles will be important as transient dynamics become more frequent with the continuing measles eradication effort [
