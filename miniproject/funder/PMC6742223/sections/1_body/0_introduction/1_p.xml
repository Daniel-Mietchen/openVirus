<p>Predicting transitions between dynamic attractors is a fundamental question in ecology [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; in particular, how external forcing impacts intrinsic oscillatory dynamics. Phase transitions in nonlinear systems have been extensively studied theoretically [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, examples of systems undergoing multiple shifts are rare due to the time scale of data typically recorded. One exception is the dynamics of fully-immunizing childhood infectious diseases, which have provided an excellent testbed for confronting theory with data [
