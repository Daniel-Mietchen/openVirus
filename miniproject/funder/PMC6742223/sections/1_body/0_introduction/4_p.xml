<p>Here, we use a newly-digitized time series of measles in London to explore how epidemic dynamics respond to perturbations. We find remarkable stability in the measles epidemiological clockwork over nearly 100 years, even in the face of significant demographic shifts and external perturbations. Studying these perturbations in tandem will yield novel insight into how nonlinear ecological systems respond to perturbations in the mid- and long- term, as well as how predictable limit cycles can be maintained. This should, for example, allow the study of whether perturbations result in multiple shifts between annual, biennial, or even exotic transients (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007305.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]) via changes in both the recruitment of susceptible individuals as well as contact rates. Despite the observed broad population-level changes in London, we find that the dynamical transitions and transients are well-predicted using a simple stochastic compartmental model, as long as it accounts for two major external perturbations (1918 influenza and WWII). A surprising result of our analysis is that a single seasonal transmission pattern (allowing for deviations during the WWII evacuation of children) predicts the key bifurcations related to demographic changes and accurate out-of-sample predictions. Finally, we show through local Lyapunov exponent analysis that, despite numerous bifurcations and perturbations, the attractor remains relatively stable and highly dissipative, thus accounting for the remarkable predictability of a century of London measles dynamics.
