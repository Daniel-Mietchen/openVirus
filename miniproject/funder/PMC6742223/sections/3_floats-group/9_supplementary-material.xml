  <title>The inferred local normalized seasonality ranges for six-year windows throughout the time series.</title>
  <p>The red point shows the inferred WWII range, whereas the black star points to the overall inferred range. The box plot then shows the ranges across the other local eras. The WWII pattern has the smallest range across all the local inferences, indicating a lower presence of school-term forcing during the evacuation.</p>
