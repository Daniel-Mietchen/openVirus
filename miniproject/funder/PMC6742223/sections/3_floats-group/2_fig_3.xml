  <title>A comparison of predicted against observed measles dynamics for London 1897–1991 based on periodicity inferred from wavelet analysis.</title>
  <p>A) The observed measles dynamics (death data: 1897–1940, case data: 1940–1991 shown on a square root scale) color coded by the dominant periodicity (in years). B) The density of attractor basins via the simulated stochastic model fitted to the data, also color coded temporally by dominant periodicity. C) The global power spectra of the data (red) against the simulated stochastic model calibrated against the data (blue). Periodicity for all figures is in years (e.g. periodicity 1 in A) and B) refers to annual dynamics). Note, that each simulation shown here is a forward simulation starting from 1897. This figure style is adapted from [
