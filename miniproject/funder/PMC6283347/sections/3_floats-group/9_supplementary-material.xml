  <title>Potential impact of environmental factors on RABV dispersal velocity in Yunnan.</title>
  <p>The results are based on 100 trees sampled from the posterior distribution. “C” and “R” indicate if the considered environmental variable was considered as a conductance ("C") or resistance factor ("R"), and 
   <italic>k</italic> is the rescaling parameter used to transform the initial raster. Estimated 
   <italic>Q</italic> distributions and related Bayes factor (BF) supports are reported here only for those model combinations with &gt;90% of positive 
   <italic>Q</italic> values and a BF support &gt; 3 (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s008">S3 Table</xref> for complete results). BF supports were estimated with the randomisation procedure detailed in Appendix S1 in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Following Kass &amp; Raftery (1995) we consider a BF &gt; 3 and BF &gt;20 respectively as a “positive” and “strong” evidences of the statistical significance of 
   <italic>Q</italic>, i.e. the correlation between environmental distances and dispersal durations (see text for further details).
