<p>In addition to the analyses investigating the impact of environmental factors on dispersal 
 <italic>velocity</italic>, we also investigated the impact of these factors on the dispersal 
 <italic>tendency</italic>, i.e. we investigated if lineage translocation events tended to terminate in particular environmental conditions. Specifically, we compared environmental values at the beginning (oldest node) and end (youngest node) of each branch. Differences between the environmental values at each end of phylogeny branches tested using a randomisation procedure (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and Methods</xref>). This analysis also indicated a possible effect of the “forest coverage” variable (
 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>): RABV lineages tended to spread towards areas associated with lower forest coverage (BF &gt; 20 when considering forest coverage to be a potential negative driver of dispersal). We also note the relative importance of croplands (positive driver, BF = 17.2) and inaccessibility (negative driver, BF = 12.5) factors, meaning that the virus lineages were also more likely to spread towards croplands and accessible areas.
