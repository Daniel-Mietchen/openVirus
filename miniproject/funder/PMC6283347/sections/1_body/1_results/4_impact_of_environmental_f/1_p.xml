<p>Several environmental variables were tested as potential factors that could affect RABV lineage dispersal velocity. As detailed in Materials and Methods, we estimated the correlation between phylogenetic branch durations and environmental distances computed on different rasters (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s002">S1 Fig</xref>). These correlations were then compared to the correlation between branch durations and distance computed on a “null” raster (i.e. an empty raster with no spatial heterogeneity whose cell values are set uniformly to “1”). Finally, the difference between these two correlations was assessed using a randomisation procedure. The rationale of this approach was to investigate which environmental factors can explain dispersal velocity heterogeneity better than simple geographic distances [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007392.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Complete results are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s007">S2 Table</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007392.s003">S2 Fig</xref> reports results for the environmental factors that are most likely to have impacted virus lineage dispersal velocity. Only the forest coverage variable, tested as a potential conductance factor, was associated with a Bayes factor &gt; 20. Although significant, the correlation is weak: using the “forest coverage” raster to compute environmental distances only increases the correlation with branch durations by 3%, relative to the uniform null raster. This means that forest coverage (treated as a conductance factor) would be a minor contributor to the observed heterogeneity in virus lineage dispersal velocity.
