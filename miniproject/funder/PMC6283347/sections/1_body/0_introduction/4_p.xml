<p>In this study, we combine phylogeographic approaches and mathematical modelling to examine the dispersal dynamics of RABV in Yunnan, a rural province of China. We analyse publicly available and newly-generated RABV gene sequences from domestic dogs, cattle, and humans sampled between 2006 and 2015, together with comprehensive rabies epidemiological data dating back to 1999, when the first re-emerging human rabies case in Yunnan was reported (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007392.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Specifically, we aim to use both types of data to reconstruct the demographic and dispersal history of RABV spread in Yunnan, as well as to estimate key epidemiological parameters that can be compared to other previously-studied RABV outbreaks. Finally, we use phylogeographic inference to investigate which environmental factors may have impacted the spatial dispersal dynamics of RABV in Yunnan.
