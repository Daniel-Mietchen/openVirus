<p>This study illustrates how RABV dispersion dynamics can be analysed by two complementary approaches based on genetic and epidemiological data. Overall, our work further highlights that domestic dogs play a key role in transmission and expansion of rabies in rural areas of China. The data reveal a low level of RABV transmission among dogs, and from dogs to humans, with the basic reproductive number estimated at 1.05 during the early stages of the outbreak. Our results indicate that interventions in the dog population would be effective in reducing transmission to humans, in particular because they have the potential to subvert the self-sustaining capacity of epidemics in dogs. A better understanding of RABV spread in terms of spatial and temporal dynamics is necessary to help inform the prevention and control of human rabies in the vast rural areas of China.</p>
