<p>To determine if the anti-DENV transgene conferred a fitness cost, several fitness parameters were evaluated in TADV-A transgenic heterozygous and sibling WT mosquitoes. The evaluations of all experimental and control replicates were performed simultaneously. Insectary conditions were maintained at 28°C and 70 to 80% in relative humidity with a 12 hr light/dark cycle. To assess the larval to pupal development time, the eggs were vacuum hatched, and the larvae were distributed into pans (50 larvae per pan) containing 2.5 L of ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O and 0.6 mL of fish food slurry. To determine the larval to pupal development time of transgenic and WT control mosquitoes, the larvae were allowed to pupate, and pupae were collected and counted every day until no pupae were left. To assess female fertility and fecundity, 90 WT and transgenic females were mated to 20 WT males in a cage. After four days, the females were blood fed and individually transferred into plastic vials filled with water and lined with egg paper. After three days, egg papers were collected, and the eggs were counted and vacuum hatched in nine-ounce plastic cups. Starting on the fourth day, the larvae were counted every day until no larvae were present. Female fecundity refers to the number of eggs laid per female, and fertility reflects the number of eggs hatching to produce larvae. To measure male mating success, fecundity, and fertility, one TADV-A transgenic or WT male was mated to five WT females in a single mesh-covered cup filled with water and lined with egg paper. Three days post blood meal, the cups were checked for the presence of eggs, which were collected, counted, and hatched. Hatched larvae were then counted every day until no larvae were present. Male mating success was calculated as the percentage of single male outcrosses that produced larvae. Fecundity was measured as the number of eggs laid per cup; fertility was determined by the number of hatching larvae in each cup. Finally, to assess mosquito longevity, equal numbers of male and female TADV-A transgenic or WT mosquitoes were placed in medium-sized cages (in triplicate). Mosquitoes that died were counted and removed daily until all mosquitoes had died. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California, USA). The means were compared using unpaired t tests with Welch’s correction, with the exception of male mating success that did not use Welch’s correction. The analyses of mosquito survivorship used the Mantel-Cox test.
