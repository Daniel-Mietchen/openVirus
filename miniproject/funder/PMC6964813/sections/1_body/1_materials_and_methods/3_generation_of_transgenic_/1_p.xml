<p>Germline transformations were carried out largely as described [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> pre-blastoderm embryos were injected with a mixture of vector OA984 or OA984-HA (200 ng/μL) and a source of 
 <italic>PiggyBac</italic> transposase (200 ng/μL)[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; the injected embryos were hatched in deoxygenated H
 <sub>2</sub>O. A total of 127 surviving WT adult G
 <sub>0</sub> males and 115 surviving WT adult G
 <sub>0</sub> females were recovered after the injection. Microinjected WT G
 <sub>0</sub> adults were assigned to 48 pools and outcrossed to WT of the opposite sex in medium-sized cages. Larvae were fed ground fish food (TetraMin Tropical Flakes, Tetra Werke, Melle, Germany) and adults were fed with 0.3 M aqueous sucrose. Adult females were blood fed three to five days after eclosion using anesthetized mice. All animals were handled in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as recommended by the National Institutes of Health, and the methods were supervised by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). A total of 38,177 WT G
 <sub>1</sub>s were screened. G
 <sub>1</sub> larvae with strong positive fluorescent signals (3xp3-tdTomato) were selected under the fluorescent stereomicroscope (Leica M165FC) and were separated into six individual groups characterized by fluorescence patterning and intensity. One single transgenic male from each group was then allowed to separately mate with 10 WT females to isolate each independent line. Three independent lines, TADV-A (vector OA984), TADV-B (vector OA984-HA), and TADV-C (vector OA984-HA) with the strongest fluorescence expression patterns were selected for further characterization. To determine whether these lines represented single chromosomal insertions, we backcrossed single individuals from each of the lines for four generations to WT stock and measured the Mendelian transmission ratios in each generation; in all cases, we observed a 50% transmission ratio, indicating single-chromosome insertion. For one of the three lines (TADV-A), transgenic mosquitoes were inbred for at least 20 generations to generate a homozygous stock. Mosquito husbandry was performed under standard conditions as previously described [
