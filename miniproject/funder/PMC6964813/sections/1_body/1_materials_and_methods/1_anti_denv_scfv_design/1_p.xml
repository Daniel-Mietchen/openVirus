<p>Sequences for the 1C19 variable heavy and light chains were obtained from hybridoma cells expressing the human monoclonal antibody [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] that had been cloned biologically by flow cytometry. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen #74104), and RT-PCR amplification of antibody gene cDNAs was performed using primer sets designed to detect all human antibody variable gene sequences [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The sequence of the antibody cDNAs was determined by automated Sanger sequence analysis. The sequence analysis of the antibody variable gene sequences in the cDNAs was performed using the international ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT).
