<p>The variable regions of 1C19 were joined by a 15-amino-acid repeating glycine-serine [G(4)S]3 linker[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] to encode a scFv form of the antibody[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. These chain regions were codon optimized for 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> expression and then gene synthesized into a vector (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). For OA984-HA, a 3â€™ 30-amino-acid human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag with a G(4)S linker[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] was added to the carboxy terminus of the single chain antibody for protein expression verification.
