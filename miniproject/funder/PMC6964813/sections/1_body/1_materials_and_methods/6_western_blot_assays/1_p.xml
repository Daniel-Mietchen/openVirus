<p>The general western blot protocol was adapted from CSH Protocols: SDS-PAGE of Proteins [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Briefly, 5–7 days post eclosion, midguts from 25 non-blood-fed and 16-hour post-blood-meal heterozygous TADV-A transgenic and WT mosquitoes were dissected and collected in 1x PBS. Protein samples from dissected tissues were extracted with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA buffer; 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 1 mM EDTA). The protein concentration was measured using Protein Assay Dye (Bio-Rad, Cat. No#5000006) and multi-detection microplate readers (Molecular Devices, SpectraMax M2). Next, 40 μg of total protein were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a 0.45 μm Immobilon-P Transfer Membrane (Merck Millipore, Cat. NO#IPVH00010). The membrane was hybridized with a custom antibody at a 1 μg/mL dilution (GenScript, Item number: U3233DA170_2) to directly recognize the 1c19 scFv peptide (26.3KDa) as well as a monoclonal antibody specific to the HA tag for lines TADV-B and C (Cell Signaling, #3724S) at a 1:1,000 dilution; these were subsequently detected by using rabbit IgG antibody (HRP) (GeneTex, Cat. No#GTX 213110–01) at a 1:10,000 dilution. Images were generated by applying the chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore, Cat. No#WBKLS0500) to the blots.
