<p>All experiments were performed under biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) conditions in the insectary at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory. The following DENV strains were used for all viral challenge experiments: DENV-1 (isolate ET243, GenBank EF440432), DENV-2 (isolate ET300, GenBank EF440433), DENV-3 (isolate ET209, GenBank EF440434), DENV-4 (isolate ET288, GenBank EF440435). The virus was passaged in Vero cell monolayer cultures before use for mosquito infections. WT or transgenic (confirmed by red fluorescence in the eye) mosquitoes were exposed to DENV as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Briefly, female mosquitoes were challenged with an infected blood meal (TCID
 <sub>50</sub> /mL) through membrane feeding using chicken blood and skin. For infection frequency and virus titer, mosquito midguts were collected at 4 dpi. For dissemination and transmission frequency, mosquito saliva, midguts, and carcasses were collected at 14 dpi. Mosquito saliva was used to determine viral titers using a TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay on Vero cell monolayer cultures. Midguts and carcasses were used to determine the presence of viral RNA using RT-qPCR against NS5. Mosquito viral challenge, processing, saliva testing, and molecular analyses of infection and dissemination were carried out as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. DENV infection frequency was defined by the number of midguts (day 4) found positive for viral nucleic acid. Similarly, the dissemination frequency was calculated by the number of carcasses (day 14) found positive by qPCR. Transmission frequency was defined by the number of TCID
 <sub>50</sub>-positive saliva samples over the number tested. These different frequencies and average TCID
 <sub>50</sub> values were compared by the Studentâ€™s two-tailed t-test.
