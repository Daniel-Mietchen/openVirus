<p>Broadly neutralizing antibodies may be especially promising as anti-DENV effector gene candidates because of their ability to neutralize antigenically diverse viruses[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, while engineered monoclonal antibodies that confer resistance to 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, a protozoan parasite that causes malaria, have been expressed in 
 <italic>Anophelene</italic> mosquitoes[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], none targeting a virus have been described in any mosquito species. Previously, a DENV-targeting 1C19 monoclonal antibody (MAb) was identified from a large panel of naturally occurring MAbs from human subjects following vaccination or natural infection[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrated that this antibody neutralized viruses from all major DENV serotypes and was capable of significantly reducing viremia in a mouse model after DENV-1 and DENV-2 infection[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Here, we engineer 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> to express a 1C19-based, broadly neutralizing, single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that is capable of neutralizing all four DENV serotypes[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Crucially, we demonstrate that mosquitoes expressing this anti-DENV scFv cannot be infected with or transmit any of the four DENV serotypes and have few significant fitness costs conferred by the presence of the antibody. These results provide a promising route for developing effective DENV control strategies using genetically engineered mosquitoes.
