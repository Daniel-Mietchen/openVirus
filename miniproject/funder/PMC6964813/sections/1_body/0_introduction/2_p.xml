 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], the main vector of DENV and other epidemiologically significant viruses such as chikungunya (CHIKV), yellow fever (YFV), and Zika (ZIKV), is a domestic endophilic mosquito[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] that has expanded its habitable range in recent decades[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and will likely continue to spread[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Current control measures including the removal of standing water and the use of chemical insecticides have had limited success in reducing 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> populations [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and, thereby, incidences of DENV[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and can instead cause insecticide resistance and behavioral changes such as a shift in biting times[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, novel vector control strategies[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], like the use of genetically modified mosquitoes to either suppress mosquito populations or render mosquitoes unable to transmit pathogens[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], are increasingly needed. For example, the development and deployment of a genetic Sterile Insect Technique (SIT)-like system termed Release of Insect Dominant Lethal (RIDL) has had some success in reducing 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito populations in the wild[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, releases of mosquitoes artificially infected with the intracellular endosymbiont 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, which can make infected males incapable of successfully mating with uninfected females in an SIT-like manner and can inhibit mosquito infection with pathogens such as DENV and ZIKV[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], have also been carried out. These have been intended to either suppress mosquito populations or make them less likely to transmit pathogens, and may hold promise for reducing the incidence of disease [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, these technologies require releases of large numbers of insects—and must be carried out on an ongoing basis for RIDL and 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based SIT—for continued vector control, which is laborious and expensive.
