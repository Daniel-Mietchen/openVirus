<p>Dengue fever is a devastating viral disease caused by several antigenically distinct dengue viral (DENV) serotypes that are all dangerous to humans but cannot be readily controlled using broad-spectrum techniques [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Transmitted by infected mosquitoes, DENV infection typically manifests as severe fever, headaches, and myalgia[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and can advance to the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Global incidences of DENV and its associated economic burden have increased dramatically in recent years [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], with over 50% of the world’s population now at risk of infection[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and 390 million documented infections per year[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] for an estimated $40 billion in economic losses annually[
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, there are currently no specific treatments nor preventive prophylactic measures [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] because the single commercially available vaccine [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] is only partially effective [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and due to increased risk of severe dengue illness and hospitalization among certain groups, its use is prevented in many contexts [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, control of the disease-spreading mosquitoes is currently the best option for preventing DENV transmission [
