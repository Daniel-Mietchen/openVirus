<p>To determine whether the anti-DENV 1C19 scFv is broadly inhibitory for other DENV serotypes, the vector competence of TADV-A mosquitoes was assessed using DENV-1 (isolate ET243, GenBank EF440432), DENV-3 (isolate ET209, Genbank EF440434), and DENV-4 (isolate ET288, Genbank EF440435). Tests for infection, dissemination, and transmission were carried out as above, and the results, presented together in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008103.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008103.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, were comparable to those obtained with the DENV-2 serotype. In short, the TADV-A mosquitoes homozygous for the transgene proved to be refractory to infection with all three additional serotypes also showing no infection in their midguts at 4 dpi (DENV-1 n = 28; DENV-3 n = 30; DENV-4 n = 27). Even at 14 dpi, there was no sign of viral replication in the midgut or carcass for all tested specimens, and none of the saliva samples (DENV-1 n = 28; DENV-3 n = 30; DENV-4 n = 28) were positive for the virus. As with DENV-2, the mosquitoes heterozygous for the transgene still tested positive for the virus in most specimens, though the overall DENV titers were significantly lower than compared to the WT in all cases (
