<p>Robust expression and processing of 1C19 scFv transcripts is required for proper neutralization of DENV, and it is important to know if such expression perturbs global gene-expression patterns, which might interfere with the fitness of the mosquito. To confirm this, we sequenced total RNA populations from dissected midgut tissues isolated from both blood-fed and non-blood-fed female Higgs wildtype (WT) or TADV-A, B, or C mosquitoes using an Illumina platform. We detected robust expression of the 1C19 scFv mRNA in both non-blood-fed and 24-hour post-blood-fed transgenic mosquitoes of all three lines, with clearly increased expression levels at 24-hours post-blood meal, while no expression was observed in the midguts of female WT mosquitoes, suggesting that expression of the 1C19 scFv antibody is transgene-dependent and blood-meal-inducible (~2.35–14.45 fold) as was intended. Importantly, while there were some changes in expression of some genes in transgenic mosquitoes when compared to WT, these represented a small fraction of the genome and, with a few exceptions, did not appear to be consistent between the three transgenic lines (
