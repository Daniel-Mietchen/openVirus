<p>To confirm the proper expression of the 1C19 scFv, we performed western blots on dissected midgut tissue from non-blood-fed and blood-fed WT and TADV-A as well as blood-fed TADV-B and TADV-C female mosquitoes using either a custom anti-1C19 scFv antibody, or an anti-HA antibody. Blot analyses revealed that the 1C19 scFv peptide was efficiently expressed following a blood meal exclusively in transgenic mosquitoes (

Altogether, these results suggest that the anti-DENV transgene is stably integrated into the mosquito genome and that the DENV-targeting 1C19 antibody is expressed in an appropriate context (i.e., in the midgut following a blood meal) for DENV suppression.
