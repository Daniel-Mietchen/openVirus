<p>Reviewer #2: The study by Buchman et al generated Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that produce a single chain antibody that is capable of neutralizing all four strains of Dengue virus. The paper is well written and contains necessary controls and experiments for the conclusions they are drawing. They engineered the antibody expression to coincide with blood meal digestion to limit expression and find it had little impact on mosquito fitness. Mosquitoes homozygous for the antibody appear completely refractory for virus whereas heterozygotes tested positive for virus, but contained significantly lower quantities of virus. They include Wolbachia infected mosquitoes to compare their results with other well-established strategies to decrease mosquito competence for Dengue transmission. They find that the heterozygotes carrying the antibody decrease viral quantities similar to Wolbachia infected mosquitoes and homozygotes are more effective. While outside of this particular study, I cannot help but wonder how quickly Dengue will be able to escape neutralization from a single antibody. This is a very provocative study demonstrating a new method to decrease dengue spread. Future work would require incorporating antibody expression with a potent gene drive.</p>
