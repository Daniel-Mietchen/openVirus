<p>Reviewer #3: This is a very elegant study where transgenic Aedes aegypti expressing an engineered single-chain variable fragment derived from a broadly neutralizing dengue virus human monoclonal antibody are refractory to all four dengue virus serotypes. As such the study can be considered a significant advance that paves the way to develop transgenic mosquito-based dengue control. One weakness is the lack of basic biological insight.</p>
