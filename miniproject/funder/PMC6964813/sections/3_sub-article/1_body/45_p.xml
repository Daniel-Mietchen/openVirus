<p>3. It is unclear where this scFv is expressed. Is it secreted, membrane bound or cytosolic? There was no mention of its localization. If it is secreted how does the antibody bind the virus prior to infection? Presumably, transcripts will be translated upon bloodfeeding (see above comment), but temporally how does this align with the rate of midgut infection? Can the antibodies still block infection after internalization into early endosomes? I am not suggesting this paper needs to be converted into a mechanistic paper, but it should discuss these questions.</p>
