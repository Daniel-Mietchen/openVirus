<p>Reviewer #3: The authors could have elaborated more on biological aspects, such as the RNAseq data (unlikely that no endogenous mosquito gene were not regulated). The authors should also elaborate on the fitness data that did show some interesting patterns especially for dengue virus 1.The comparison between the transgenic mosquitoes and Wolbachia only involved one virus strain (a lab strain) so one should be cautious with the interpretation of that data.</p>
