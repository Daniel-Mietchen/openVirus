  <title>Effect of anti-dengue virus (DENV) single-chain variable fragment (scFv) on DENV titers of TADV-A, 
   <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected (
   <italic>w</italic>Mel), and wildtype (WT) mosquitoes.

  <p>(A) Schematic of experiment. TADV-A mosquitoes were generated via transgenesis with the anti-DENV construct, and TADV-A, 
   <italic>w</italic>Mel, and WT mosquitoes were then challenged with a blood meal infected with one of four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, isolate ET243; DENV-2, isolate ET300; DENV-3, isolate ET209; or DENV-4, isolate ET288). After the infected blood meal enters the mosquito midgut, there are two potential outcomes: in the first (applies for all tested strains), the virus replicates and disseminates past the midgut to become transmissible; in the second (applies to TADV-A mosquitoes), the anti-DENV transgene expresses scFv antibodies in the midgut that bind to the virus and neutralize it. (B) Plots depicting viral titers. To determine if the anti-DENV transgene confers resistance to all four DENV serotypes, we determined viral titers in extracted midguts, carcasses, and saliva from WT, TADV-A (homozygous [Hm] and heterozygous [Ht]), and 
   <italic>w</italic>Mel infected mosquitoes. Viral genome equivalents (GE) from mosquito midguts (at 4 days post infection [dpi]) and carcass (at 14 dpi) were determined using RT-qPCR and calculated using previously published methods. Viral titers in the saliva were determined using the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>) on Vero cells. For each experiment, data from three replicates is pooled. Red horizontal bars represent the mean GE/viral titer. **
