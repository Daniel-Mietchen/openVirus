  <title>Effect of the anti-DENV scFv on DENV GE in three independent transgenic mosquito lines.</title>
  <p>DENV GE in WT and transgenic mosquito lines (TADV-A, TADV-B, or TADV-C) following a blood meal infected with DENV-2 (ET300 strain) are shown. DENV GE from mosquito midguts (at 4 dpi) of WT or transgenic mosquitoes were determined using real-time qPCR and calculated using previously published methods. Circles represent WT mosquitoes; black diamonds represent anti-DENV homozygous transgenic mosquitoes; red colored diamonds represent anti-DENV heterozygous transgenic mosquitoes. Horizontal bars represent the mean viral titer. The Mantel-Cox test was used for statistical analysis. **
