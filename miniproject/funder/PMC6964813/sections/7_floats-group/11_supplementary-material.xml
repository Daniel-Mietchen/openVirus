  <title>Differential RNA expression by a two-factor DESeq analysis in WT, TADV-A, TADV-B, TADV-C mosquito midguts prior to blood meal (NBF) and 24-hours post-blood feeding (PBM).</title>
  <p>Statistics such as p-value and p-adj are included. Gene expression changes (in terms of log2FoldChange) describe the genes that are upregulated in either the WT (negative values) or transgenic mosquitoes (positive values).</p>
