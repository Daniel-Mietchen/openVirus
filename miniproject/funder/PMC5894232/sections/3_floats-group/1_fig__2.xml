  <p>Dissemination of 
   <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> in BALB/c-flu infected mice. Sequential IAV (250 PFU per mouse) and meningococcal infection (10
   <sup>7</sup> CFU per mouse) were performed by the intranasal route. Bacterial infection was analysed by bioluminescence at the indicated times. Images depict photographs overlaid with colour representations of luminescence intensity, measured in total photons/s and indicated on the scales, in which red is the most intense and blue the least intense.
