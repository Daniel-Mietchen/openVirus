<p id="Par32">Here, we further show that feeding mice 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> CNCM I-1518 not only improves the health status of mice infected with IAV, but also improves the health status of mice infected with 
 <italic>N. meningitis</italic> after IAV infection. The reduction in the severity of secondary meningococcal infection may be mainly due to better control of the primary flu infection, allowing better control of the secondary bacterial infection. However, better direct clearance of 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> may also be possible through higher recruitment of neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, and DCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). We previously suggested that 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> consumption induced early recruitment of immune cells, including alveolar macrophages, which may allow better control of the flu infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A role of alveolar macrophages in the protection against secondary pneumococcal infection after flu was suggested by the association between the early depletion of alveolar macrophages in the lungs and lethal pneumococcal pneumonia in flu-infected mice [
