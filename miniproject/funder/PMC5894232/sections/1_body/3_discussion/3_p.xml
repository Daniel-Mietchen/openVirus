<p id="Par33">Indeed, we have previously reported that mice fed 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> CNCM I-1518 prior to flu infection showed early activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β) and the massive recruitment of immune cells to the lungs (mainly DCs, macrophages, monocytes, and eosinophils) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Such early recruitment may also be responsible for the faster clearance of meningococci 24 h after a secondary meningococcal infection. Moreover, we also observed differential modulation of the immune response in the lungs 48 h after secondary bacterial infection in mice fed 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> CNCMI-1518 relative to control mice, represented by larger numbers of dendritic cells, inflammatory monocytes, and neutrophils. This may have also contributed to the control of the secondary meningococcal infection. Recent data supports a role for monocytes/macrophages in susceptibility to meningococcal sepsis in a murine model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, nasal priming with viable 
 <italic>Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum</italic> 090104 differentially modulated the TLR3-mediated innate antiviral immune response in the respiratory tract of infant mice. This improved resistance to primary infection by the 
 <italic>respiratory syncytial virus</italic> (RSV) and secondary pneumococcal pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Oral administration of the probiotic 
 <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> to mice with simultaneous vaccination with pneumococcal protective protein A was shown to reduce lung colonisation by 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Feeding mice the probiotic 
 <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> CRL1505 (Lr05) has been reported to decrease the number of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> in the lung and prevent dissemination in the blood. This decrease was associated with increased IL6 and IL10 levels in bronchoalveolar lavages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], consistent with our results. Mice treated with 
 <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG showed significantly better seven-day survival than saline-treated control mice in another experimental model of 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>-induced pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This model also reveal the gut-lung axis and suggests that probiotic (
 <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG) consumption may help to maintain the homeostasis of mucosal barriers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Indeed, the gut microbiota has been reported to improve the outcome of experimental pneumococcal pneumonia in mice, as suggested by increased bacterial dissemination, inflammation, organ damage, and mortality in microbiota-depleted mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This beneficial effect of the gut microbiota may be due to the enhancement of primary alveolar macrophage function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].
