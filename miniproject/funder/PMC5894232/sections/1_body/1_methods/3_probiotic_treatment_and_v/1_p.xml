<p id="Par15">Three experiments were separately conducted. In each experiment, two groups of 10 and nine mice received 200 μl containing 2 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU)/mouse of 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> CNCM I-1518 or 200 μl PBS (control), respectively, daily by oral gavage. Mice were infected by intranasal infection with IAV on day 0 with 50 μl H3N2 virus (260 plaque forming units, PFU) as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For this purpose, mice were first anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with a mixture of xylazine and ketamine (MERIAL, Villeurbanne, France). Seven days after IAV infection (day 7), mice were superinfected in the airways with 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> (10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/ mouse in 50 μl of a bacterial suspension at 2 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> CFU/ml). The infection was performed by the strain LNP24198lux, a serogroup C strain belonging to the hyperinvasive clonal complex ST-11 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Oral gavage with 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> CNCM I-1518 was performed during the entire period of viral and secondary infection.
