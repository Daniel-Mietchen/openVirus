 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) revealed a significantly more dendritic cells, neutrophils, and inflammatory monocytes in the lungs of 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic>-fed mice sacrificed at day 9 (48Â h after 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> infection) than those of the control group (PBS-fed mice). Although, there were more interstitial macrophages, patrolling monocytes, and eosinophils in the lungs of
