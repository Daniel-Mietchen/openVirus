<p id="Par28">Innate and adaptive immune responses play a key role in controlling infection. We assessed the effect of 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> on immune responses by quantifying total cell counts in the lungs at day 9, 48 h after 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> infection, using trypan blue. The cell counts in the lungs of the mice fed 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> were significantly higher than those of the PBS-fed mice (Fig.
