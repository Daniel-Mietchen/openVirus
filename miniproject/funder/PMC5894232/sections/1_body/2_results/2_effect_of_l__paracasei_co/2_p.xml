<p id="Par25">Dynamic bioluminescence imaging 0.5 h after intranasal inoculation showed the bacteria to be present in the upper respiratory tract of infected mice and already starting to reach the lower respiratory pathways and lungs. The infection signal increased 3 and 6 h after 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> infection for both groups of mice (
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic>-fed and PBS-fed mice). The infection appeared to become established in the lower respiratory tract and lungs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), with no significant difference between the two groups of infected mice. The bioluminescent signals decreased after 24 and 48 h of meningococcal infection. However, the signals were significantly lower in the 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> fed-mice than the PBS-fed mice after 24 h of meningococcal infection. The bioluminescent signal was also lower, although not significantly, in the 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> fed-mice than the PBS-fed mice after 48 h of infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). These data suggest gavage with 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> was associated with faster clearance of the secondary meningococcal infection.
