<p id="Par26">We next investigated the effect of 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> on the inflammatory status by quantifying the levels of several cytokines (MCP1, IL10, KC, IL12p70, and IL6) in the lungs of mice fed 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> or PBS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) sacrificed on day 9 (48 h after 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> infection). The cytokine levels in the lungs are expressed as the amount of cytokine per mg of total protein of the tested lungs.
