<p id="Par27">The levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL6, MCP1, KC, and IL12p70 were higher in the lungs of 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic>-fed than PBS-fed mice. However, only the differences in the levels of IL6 and MCP1 reached significance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). In addition, although the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 were higher in the 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> than PBS group, the difference was not significant (Fig.
