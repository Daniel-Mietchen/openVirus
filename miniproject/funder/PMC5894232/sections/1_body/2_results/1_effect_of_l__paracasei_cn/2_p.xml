<p id="Par23">After infection with influenza virus, the infected mice rapidly lost weight, but mice fed 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> lost significantly less weight than those given PBS, as measured on days 1, 4, 6, and 7 post-infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The mice also appeared to be ill, according to the clinical score based on the appearance of their fur. The clinical scores for the mice fed 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> were significantly better than those of the PBS-fed mice at days 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 post-infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Following 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> infection (on day 7), the weight loss continued in both groups until day 9. However, the weight loss was less in the 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> group and their general health was better (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">c</xref>). Moreover, the 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> group showed better survival (90%) at day 9 that the PBS group (75%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Theses data suggest that consumption of 
 <italic>L. paracasei</italic> before 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> infection is associated with an improvement in the health of the mice.
