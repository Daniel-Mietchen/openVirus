<p id="Par10">Bacterial and viral respiratory infections are responsible for severe morbidity and mortality in children and adults worldwide. Among them, influenza virus is a major source of severe viral respiratory infections in adults, causing annual epidemics that result in significant morbidity and mortality. Flu pandemics during the twentieth century killed more than 100 million people [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Flu morbidity is often due to secondary respiratory infections by bacteria, such as 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Epidemiological studies have clearly shown a spatiotemporal association between influenza A virus (IAV) and invasive 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Both infections show a seasonal pattern with most of the cases in winter. Moreover, the winter peaks of invasive meningococcal disease usually follow the peak of influenza-like syndromes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This sequential pattern of flu infection and invasive meningococcal infection has been reproduced in a murine animal model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The mechanisms that enhance bacterial superinfection appear to be multifactorial. Alterations in physical and immunological barriers, as well as changes in the microenvironment, have been shown to contribute to the development of secondary bacterial infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has also been suggested that the neuraminidases (NA) of IAV enhance the adhesion process of 
 <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> to the respiratory epithelium by direct interaction with the sialic-acid containing capsules that constitute a substrate for the NA of IAV. Cleavage of capsular sialic acid at the bacterial surface may unravel sub-capsular meningococcal adhesins and enhance meningococcal adhesion to epithelial cells [
