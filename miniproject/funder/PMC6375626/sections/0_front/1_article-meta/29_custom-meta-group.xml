  <meta-value>Access to national HIV data in Australia is governed by the National HIV Registry data release policy (available at 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://kirby.unsw.edu.au/report/surveillance-evaluation-and-research-program-standard-operating-procedures-national-hivaids" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://kirby.unsw.edu.au/report/surveillance-evaluation-and-research-program-standard-operating-procedures-national-hivaids</ext-link>). Access to National HIV Registry that are not in the public domain requires approval by the Australian Communicable Diseases Network of Australia, and the data are provided on the proviso that they are used for the described purposes only, and only aggregate data are presented in any published documents. Given the sensitive nature of HIV data, this condition is imposed to minimise the risk of reidentification and to ensure no individual, organisation or community can be identified from provided data. Only the lead author (PG) and co-authors who were also data custodians of National HIV registry (MJ, SM) had access to the specified dataset for the purposes of this analysis. These authors were all subject to the same access criteria and used the same access method as described above.
