<p>Migration patterns and the epidemiology of HIV in countries of origin may partially explain these changes. With respect to male-to-male sexual exposure, increases in the number of new arrivals were significantly correlated with increases in new HIV diagnoses for those from North Africa and the Middle East, North-East Asia, Southern and Central Asia and the Americas. In relation to heterosexual exposure, increases in new arrivals were associated with increases in new HIV diagnoses in men from Sub-Saharan Africa, and decreases in new HIV diagnoses for men and women from South-East Asia.</p>
