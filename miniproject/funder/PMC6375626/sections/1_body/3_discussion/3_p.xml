<p>These trends are consistent with the presence of concentrated epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) in countries in North-East Asia, Southern and Central Asia and the Americas; and with changes in South-East Asian countries such as Thailand and Cambodia from generalised to concentrated epidemics amongst populations such as MSM [

Findings are also consistent with other high-income countries in Europe, where decreases in heterosexually acquired HIV amongst Sub-Saharan Africa born men and women and increases in new HIV diagnoses among MSM from other regions such as Central Asia, corresponding with migration patterns, have also been observed [

However for HIV findings are mixed, with a recent study comparing migration intensity and peak national HIV prevalence in 141 countries finding no association, and highlighting the limitation of ecological analyses which do not distinguish between infection acquired prior to or after arrival in host country [
