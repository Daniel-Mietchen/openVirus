<p>The epidemiology of HIV in Australia is changing. While HIV diagnosis rates for Australian-born men and women in all exposure categories have been stable, rates attributed to male-to-male sexual exposure among men born in South-East Asia, North-East Asia and the Americas increased significantly between 2006–2010 and 2011–2015, and are higher than those of Australian-born men. In 2011–2015 Asian-born men (from South-East Asia, North-East and Southern and Central Asia) accounted for over 15% of all new HIV diagnoses attributed to male-to-male sex in Australia. Diagnosis rates attributed to heterosexual exposure amongst men and women born in South-East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, and men born in Southern and Central Asia, decreased over the ten years but remained higher than rates in Australian-born people.</p>
