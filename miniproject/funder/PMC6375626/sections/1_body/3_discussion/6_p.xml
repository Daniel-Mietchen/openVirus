<p>The strength of this study is the use of population-wide data on new HIV diagnoses and new arrivals, and high level of completeness of key variables such as country of birth in the National HIV Registry. Limitations include first, the use of the overall male population as the denominator in analyses for diagnoses in men attributed to male-to-male sex, as there are no population estimates for MSM disaggregated by region of birth. HIV diagnosis rates attributed to male-to-male sex across all regions of birth have therefore been underestimated. The analysis of association with migration patterns also assumes MSM from different regions of birth are as likely to migrate as are heterosexual men.</p>
