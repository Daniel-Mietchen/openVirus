<p>Under procedures described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0212268.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], all new HIV diagnoses in Australia are first notified by laboratories and/or doctors to State and Territory health authorities, who analyse and report this data to the National HIV Registry, maintained by the Kirby Institute at UNSW Sydney on behalf of the Australian Government Department of Health [
 <xref rid="pone.0212268.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Data was de-identified before provision to the lead author for this analysis, with name code (full name is converted to 2x2 code before reporting by states and territories to the national registry) removed and date of birth converted to age at diagnosis. Consent was not sought from individuals as this would have involved re-identification of data and individuals in order to contact them, which in itself could constitute a breach of privacy.
