<p>To understand the relationship between migration patterns and new HIV diagnoses, we used linear regression models for each region of birth and mode of exposure, with number of HIV diagnoses per year as the dependent variable and permanent and long-term arrivals as the independent variable. Models were adjusted by including age as a covariate in the multivariate analysis. This analysis provides a more sensitive measure of any relationship between migration patterns and HIV diagnoses than using ERP alone, as ERP is based on population projections whereas permanent and long-term arrivals are real-time data.</p>
