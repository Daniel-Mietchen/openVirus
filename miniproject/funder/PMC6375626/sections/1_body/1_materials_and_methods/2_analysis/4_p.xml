<p>The difference in the average annual age-standardised HIV diagnosis rate between 2006–2010 and 2011–2015 for each region of birth was analysed using univariate Poisson models, with number of diagnoses as the outcome and time interval as the independent variable. Summary rate ratios (SRRs) for each region of birth and exposure category were calculated, using the 2006 to 2010 time period as the reference.</p>
