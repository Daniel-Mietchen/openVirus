<p>The study period was divided into two equal five-year intervals for comparison of changes over time–(i) 2006 to 2010 and (ii) 2011 to 2015. Descriptive analysis was conducted to calculate the proportions of HIV diagnoses by region of birth, by sex and mode of exposure (male-to-male sex or heterosexual). The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare median age at diagnosis by region of birth and exposure, using people born in Australia as the comparison. Pearson’s chi-squared test was used to compare overseas-born diagnoses by likely place of acquisition and reported exposure.</p>
