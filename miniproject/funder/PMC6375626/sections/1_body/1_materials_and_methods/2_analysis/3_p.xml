<p>Average annual HIV diagnosis rates per 100,000 population were calculated by region of birth for each time period, with stratification by exposure (male-to-male sex, heterosexual males and heterosexual females), and age standardisation using the 2001 ABS standard population [
 <xref rid="pone.0212268.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as a reference. Average annual age-standardised HIV diagnosis rates by region of birth were compared using univariate Poisson models, with the age-standardised number of diagnoses as the outcome, region of birth as the independent variable and ERP as the population offset. Results are presented as an incidence rate ratio (IRR) for each region of birth compared with Australia.
