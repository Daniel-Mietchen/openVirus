<p id="Par26">CRP is an acute-phase protein that is rapidly synthesized by hepatocytes in response to inflammatory stimuli. It binds to a number of intrinsic and extrinsic ligands, including many constituents of eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens, enabling activation of the classical complement pathway and playing a possible role in alternative-pathway regulation [

While the mechanism of association between elevated CRP and dengue remains unclear, immune enhancement is a known feature of dengue pathogenesis, and it may be that severity of disease manifestation is determined by overall magnitude of the immune response. The observed association between higher CRP and increased probability of increased disease severity should serve to inform future clinical trial design, both by enriching study populations and by encouraging exploration of potential anti-inflammatory host-directed therapeutics.
