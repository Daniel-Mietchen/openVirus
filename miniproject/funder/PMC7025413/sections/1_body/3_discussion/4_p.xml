<p id="Par27">Aside from CRP, several other components of the immune response have been identified as potential prognostic biomarkers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Nascimento et al. found associations between markers of dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway and the development of dengue haemorrhagic fever [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and Juffrie et al. reported levels of the proinflammatory molecules, IL-6 and sPLA2, to be predictive of dengue-associated hypotensive shock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additional proposed prognostic indicators include a range of proinflammatory cytokines, markers of endothelial activation and microvascular disruption, and acute-phase proteins, but the evidence base to support these associations is limited to small studies with multiple possible confounding sources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The major distinguishing feature that separates CRP from other potential immune biomarkers, however, is its well-established use as a clinical test, with cheap point-of-care (POC) kits readily available across the majority of healthcare settings. It is this ease of access, which makes it a highly attractive option for implementation as a prognostic tool in the resource-limited areas of greatest dengue disease burden.
