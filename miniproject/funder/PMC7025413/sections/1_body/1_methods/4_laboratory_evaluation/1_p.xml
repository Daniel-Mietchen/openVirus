<p id="Par13">A full blood count was performed daily, while biochemistry tests were only performed at enrollment and then subsequently if clinically indicated. A research sample of EDTA plasma was stored every other day. All research samples were processed at the different sites within 1 h of collection, centrifuged at 500
 <italic>g</italic>/min for 10 min, and then stored at − 20 °C. All the samples were transferred on dry ice to OUCRU laboratory. CRP was measured on these stored samples at two time points: enrollment sample (illness day 1–3) and follow-up (day 10–21 post-symptom onset) using the same commercial assay according to the manufacturer’s specifications (magnetic bead panel, cat. no. HCVD3MAG-67 K, Merck, Millipore, UK) on a Luminex 200 analyzer.
