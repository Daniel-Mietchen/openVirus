<p id="Par15">Plasma CRP levels were transformed to base-2 logarithm (log 2) before analysis. Cox regression model was used to investigate fever clearance time while logistic regression model was used for other outcomes. The model comparing CRP levels between dengue and OFI groups was adjusted for age and day of illness (DOI) at enrollment. Other models for association between CRP levels and dengue severity were adjusted for age, DOI at enrollment, plasma viremia levels at enrollment, and immune status. Other factors, such as fluid infusion, bacteria coinfection, antibiotic usage, and comorbidity, had unclear potential relationship with either CRP level and clinical outcome, and therefore, they were not considered for the adjustment. As the sample size was unbalanced between day of illness and DOI 1 was unlikely to have a clinical event, we decided to adjust for DOI rather than to conduct a stratification analysis on this factor. The potentially non-linear effect of CRP levels on the outcomes was investigated using restricted cubic splines for log 2 of CRP levels with three knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles [

As the effect of CRP levels on the outcome could differ by age, we then performed a sensitivity analysis by subgroups of children (&lt; 15 years of age) and adults (≥ 15 years of age), using similar statistical method as described above. Because the OFI group included both viral and bacterial infections, this group was further categorized into two subgroups using the level of neutrophil counts: cases with neutrophil counts of &lt; 8 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/mL (upper limit of normal) were classified as potential viral infection, and the others were classified as potential bacterial infection. CRP levels between dengue and these two subgroups were also explored using similar model. The association between CRP in dengue patients at enrollment and other clinical and biochemical markers (platelet nadir, maximum hematocrit (HCT) change, liver transaminases, creatinine kinase (CK), albumin, white blood cell (WBC) count, percentage of neutrophils and lymphocytes) were explored using scatter plots and Pearson’s correlation coefficients. All analyses were performed using the statistical software R version 3.4.4.
