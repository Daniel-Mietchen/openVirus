<p id="Par10">A nested case-control study was performed using the clinical data and blood samples already collected from patients recruited to the observational study entitled “Clinical evaluation of dengue and identification of risk factors for severe disease” (IDAMS study, NCT01550016), for which the protocol has been published [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Briefly, this prospective multi-center observational study enrolled 7428 participants aged 5 years or more, presenting with a febrile illness consistent with dengue to outpatient health facilities in 8 countries across Asia and Latin America. Patients at the participating sites were eligible for enrollment if they met the following criteria: fever or history of fever for less than 72 h and clinical symptoms consistent with possible dengue, and had no localizing features suggesting an alternative diagnosis, e.g., pneumonia. Participants were then followed daily until resolution of their acute illness, with a standard schedule of blood samples obtained during the illness course. Hospital admission and individual case management were determined according to clinical need, with all interventions documented in the case report forms. Subsequently, each participant was assigned an overall severity grading using all available information; the system used is described in detail in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> and is in line with the recent recommendation to use standardized endpoints for severe and intermediate dengue to ensure reproducibility and comparability of research findings [
