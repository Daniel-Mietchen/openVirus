<p id="Par11">Samples from participants enrolled at five study sites were selected, including Hospital for Tropical Diseases (HTD) (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam), National Hospital for Tropical Diseases (NHTD) (Hanoi, Vietnam), Angkor Hospital for Children (Siem Reap, Cambodia), University of Malaya Medical Centre (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), and Hospital Nacional de Ni√±os Benjamin Bloom (El Salvador). Stored samples from patients who progressed to severe or intermediate dengue severity were selected as well as a comparison group of uncomplicated dengue and other febrile illnesses (OFI). This cohort included 38 severe and 243 intermediate severity cases (combined primary outcome of 281 cases). The 281 cases were compared to 839 uncomplicated dengue patients as controls (1:3), based on similar geographic and demographics and day of illness (DOI) making a total sample size of 1120 dengue cases. Confirmed dengue cases were compared to 400 patients with OFI, again from the same locations and with the same demographics and DOI. The study flowchart is shown in Fig.
