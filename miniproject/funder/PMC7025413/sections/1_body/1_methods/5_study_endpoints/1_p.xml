<p id="Par14">To compare CRP levels between dengue and OFI groups, the outcome was laboratory-confirmed dengue or not. To investigate the association between CRP levels and severity in dengue patients, the primary outcome was severe or intermediate dengue, which was defined as any of severe or intermediate plasma leakage, bleeding, neurology involvement, liver involvement, or other major organ failure; all definitions were in accordance with current standard definition for use in dengue interventional trials [

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Severe dengue events were rare, and the combined endpoint of severe or intermediate dengue is relevant for clinical practice, since less severe manifestations that require medical intervention contribute disproportionately to disease burden. The decision to hospitalize is very subjective, so we included this as a secondary outcome. Other secondary outcomes included severe dengue or dengue with warning signs according to WHO 2009, and fever clearance time. Fever clearance time was defined as the number of days from symptom onset to the day of defervescence (for patients still febrile at hospital discharge, fever clearance time was censored at the day of discharge).
