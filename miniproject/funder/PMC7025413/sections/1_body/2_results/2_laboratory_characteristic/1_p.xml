<p id="Par18">In patients with dengue infection, median CRP level at enrollment was 30.2 mg/L, similar to the OFI group (median CRP of 31.3) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In comparing DOI at enrollment, CRP level was highest in patients enrolled on DOI 2 and lower in patients enrolled on DOI 3 or at follow-up. This trend is similar across dengue severity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There were 30 patients in the OFI group and 896 patients in the dengue group who had CRP measurements at follow-up (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The follow-up days ranged from 10 to 31 days; however, 94% follow-up samples were within 10–20 days since onset. For the OFI group, while the same trend was seen in patients clinically diagnosed with bacterial infection, CRP level among patients with viral diagnosis was lower for those enrolled at a later time point. Considering the other laboratory parameters, dengue patients had higher levels of liver transaminases and CK, but lower WBC, and comparable levels of albumin (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Dengue patients had higher maximum HCT change, but lower PLT nadir. Among patients with dengue, plasma viremia levels were highest in the severe group.
