<p id="Par19">The OFI group was separated into potential viral or bacterial infections, using the clinical diagnosis and a neutrophil cutoff of 8 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/mL. The boxplots (lower part of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) suggest that CRP levels in dengue patients are slightly higher than in patients with probable viral infection (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test) but lower than in patients with probable bacterial infection (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test). These differences resulted in a non-linear relationship between dengue diagnosis and CRP levels, as depicted in the upper plot in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. CRP levels of less than 30 mg/L (approximately the median CRP levels in dengue patients) showed that higher CRP levels associated with higher odds of dengue diagnosis (OR for each two times increase in CRP level was 1.28, 95% CI 1.18–1.40). However, in patients with CRP levels ≥ 30 mg/L, higher CRP associated with lower odds of dengue diagnosis (OR for each two times increase in CRP level was 0.64, 95% CI 0.55–0.73). The subgroup analysis of age &lt; 15 and age ≥ 15 years showed similar results (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). A sensitivity analysis showed that including the 9 cases with CRP values above the upper range of the assay did not affect the results (ORs [95% CIs] in patients with CRP levels &lt; 30 and ≥ 30 mg/L were 1.28 [1.18–1.40] and 0.63 [0.55–0.72], respectively).
