<p id="Par21">The subgroup analysis by age, regarding severe or intermediate dengue, showed similar results in children (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.04–1.35); however, the magnitude of effect was less in adults (OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.96–1.27) (see Additional files 5 and 6). The strong association between higher CRP level and longer fever clearance time and hospitalization when CRP level ≥ 30 mg/L was still apparent in adults (HR of fever clearance was 0.78, 95% CI 0.68–0.89; OR of hospitalization was 1.59, 95% CI 1.25–2.04) but not in children (see Additional files 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM7" ref-type="media">7</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">8</xref>). A sensitivity analysis including 9 cases with CRP values above the upper range of the assay also showed similar results (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">9</xref>).
