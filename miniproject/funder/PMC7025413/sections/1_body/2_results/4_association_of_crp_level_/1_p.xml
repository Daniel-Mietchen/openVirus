<p id="Par20">The median (IQRs) DOIs of developing the outcomes of intermediate and severe dengue were 5 (4; 6) and 5 (5; 6), and median (IQR) times from the CRP test to these outcomes were 3 (2; 4) and 3 (2; 4) days, respectively. CRP levels at enrollment in patients with severe or intermediate dengue were higher than in patients with uncomplicated dengue, with median levels (interquartile range) of 34.0 (17.4–71.8 mg/L), and 28.6 mg/L (10.5–58.9 mg/L), respectively. Higher CRP levels in the first 3 days of illness were associated with increased odds of severe or intermediate dengue, after correcting for age, DOI at enrollment, plasma viremia levels, and immune status (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). For each twofold increase in CRP level, the OR (95% CI) of having severe or intermediate dengue was 1.17 (1.07–1.29). Patients with higher CRP level also had higher odds of severe dengue with OR of 1.05 (95% CI 0.85–1.32), but this did not reach statistical significance. Higher CRP levels in patients with CRP ≥ 30 mg/L were strongly associated with longer fever clearance time (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76–0.93) and hospitalization (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.14–1.64) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). When categorizing CRP levels into 3 groups (&lt; 15, 15–30, and ≥ 30 mg/L), the 2 latter groups had significantly higher risk of severe or intermediate dengue compared to the lowest CRP level group (ORs [95% CIs] were 1.66 [1.07–2.56] and 1.59 [1.10–2.32], respectively), after correcting for age, DOI at enrollment, plasma viremia, and immune status.
