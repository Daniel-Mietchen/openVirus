<p id="Par17">Due to the selection procedure, median age, gender, and DOI at enrollment were very similar between the OFI and dengue group (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The age range of all patients was 5 to 64 in the OFI group, and 5 to 73 in the dengue group. The number of adults and children enrolled by site can be seen in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. Patients with severe dengue were younger (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test) than those with other severity grades, and were more likely to be enrolled on day 3 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, chi-squared test). In the dengue patients, the percentage of secondary infections was highest in the severe dengue group 33/38 (86.8%) and lowest in the uncomplicated dengue group 542/836 (65.2%) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, chi-squared test). Fewer patients with OFI were hospitalized (76/394, 19.3%, versus 421/1120, 37.6%) (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, chi-squared test). Within the OFI group, 131/394 (33.2%) of cases were clinically diagnosed as bacterial infection, while in the dengue group, there were 54/1120 (4.8%) of cases with clinical diagnosis of bacterial coinfection (see Additional file
