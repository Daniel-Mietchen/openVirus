<p id="Par7">Several small studies have attempted to identify biomarkers for dengue that will be cost-effective in resource-limited settings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests that markers of inflammation may be useful as biomarkers. Studies have shown higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in severe dengue versus non-severe dengue, with a CRP cutoff level of 30.1 mg/L (AUC, 0.938; 100% sensitivity, 76.3% specificity) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In adult patients in Indonesia on the third day of fever, CRP was higher in those who developed plasma leakage, 10.1 (IQR 4.3–36.5) vs. 6.3 (IQR 3.0–21.6) mg/L (
