<p id="Par5">Dengue, caused by one of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1–4), is globally the most important arboviral infection, in terms of geographic spread and number of infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. An estimated 390 million infections now occur annually in over 100 countries, of which 96 million manifest as symptomatic dengue cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The clinical phenotype can vary from a relatively mild self-limiting febrile illness, to severe and occasionally life-threatening symptoms of bleeding, organ impairment, and vascular leakage leading to shock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These severe manifestations occur sufficiently late in the course of the disease around defervescence, which occurs usually on day 4–6 following illness onset, to allow a potential window of opportunity to identify patients who may progress.
