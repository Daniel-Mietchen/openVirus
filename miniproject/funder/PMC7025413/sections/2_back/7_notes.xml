 <title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title>
 <p id="Par31">Ethical Committee approval was obtained from Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC) in the UK, and from all the local IRBs at each site for the original observational study. Further minimal risk applications were obtained for use of stored samples from OxTREC, and all other participating hospitals from which residual samples were selected. All patients signed an informed consent form in the original study, which included permission for future use of stored blood samples.</p>
