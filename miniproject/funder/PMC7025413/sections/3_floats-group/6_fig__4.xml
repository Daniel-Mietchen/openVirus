  </p>
  <p>The log odds (or log hazard for fever clearance time) of the outcomes (the black line) and its 95% confidence interval (the gray region) are estimated from multivariable logistic regression models (or multivariable Cox model for fever clearance time) allowing for non-linear effect of log 2 of CRP levels using restricted cubic splines and adjusted for age, DOI at enrollment, viremia levels at enrollment, and immune status. The rug plot on the 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis represents the distribution of individual cases. The 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis is transformed using base-2 logarithm. CRP, C-reactive protein
