  <p>Association between plasma CRP level and patients diagnosed with dengue or OFI</p>
  <p>The log odds of having dengue (the black line) and its 95% confidence interval (the gray region) by CRP level were estimated from multivariable logistic regression models with non-linear effect of log 2 of CRP levels, which modeled using restricted cubic splines with 3 knots, and adjustment for age and DOI at enrollment. The red region highlights the range of CRP of 15–30 mg/L, which corresponds to the highest probability of having dengue. The rug plots on the 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis represent the distribution of CRP value of individual cases. Horizontal plots described distribution of CRP levels among dengue group (in red) and OFI group (the OFI group was further separated into potential bacterial infection [in blue] and potential viral infection [in green] based on clinical diagnosis by treating doctor [clinical diagnosis] or number of neutrophil). There are significant differences between CRP levels in the dengue group with the potential bacterial infection group (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) and with the potential viral infection group (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.003) (Mann-Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic> test). The 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis was transformed using base-2 logarithm. CRP, C-reactive protein; DOI, day of illness; OFI, other febrile illnesses
