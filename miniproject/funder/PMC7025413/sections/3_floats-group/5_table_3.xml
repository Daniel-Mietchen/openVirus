  <p>The estimates (OR and HR) and 95% CI were reported for each one log 2 increase of CRP level, i.e., for each 2 times increase of CRP level</p>

   <italic>CI</italic> confidence interval, 
   <italic>CRP</italic> C-reactive protein, 
   <italic>DOI</italic> day of illness, 
   <italic>HR</italic> hazard ratio, 
   <italic>OR</italic> odds ratio
  </p>
  <p>*We use hazard ratio (HR) to report the results of Cox model for fever clearance time outcome. All other outcomes are reported by odds ratio (OR) estimated from logistic regression model. All adjusted estimates are derived from multivariable models adjusted for age, DOI at enrollment, plasma viremia level, and immune status</p>
  <p>
   <sup>1</sup>The models for severe or intermediate dengue and severe dengue were performed with linear effect of log 2 of CRP (the non-linear effect of log 2 of CRP was not statistically significant: 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.209 for severe or intermediate dengue outcome, and 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.679 for severe dengue outcome)
  </p>
  <p>
   <sup>2</sup>The models for fever clearance time and hospitalization were performed with two separated linear effect of log 2 of CRP (for CRP &lt; 30 and CRP ≥ 30 mg/L). The non-linear effect of log 2 of CRP was statistically significant: 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.004 for fever clearance time outcome, and 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.011 for hospitalization outcome. These models had a quadratic effect with the peak CRP level of approximately 30 mg/L
