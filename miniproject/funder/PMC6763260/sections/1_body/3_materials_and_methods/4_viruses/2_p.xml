<p>Recombinant MCMV was generated by the ‘‘en passant mutagenesis”, essentially as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In brief, we generated a construct containing an antibiotic resistance cassette coupled with the insertion sequence and the restriction site Sce-I. This construct was flanked by sequences homologous to the target region of insertion within the MCMV BAC genome. Then, the fragment containing the insertion sequences was integrated into the MCMV BAC genome by homologous recombination. In a second step, Sce-I was induced to linearize the BAC followed by a second round of induced homologous recombination to re-circularize it and select for clones that discarded the antibiotic selection marker but retained the inserted sequence.
