 <sub>2</sub> inhalation, whole lungs were excised and mechanically homogenized using a tissue homogenizer. Tissue homogenates were spun down and supernatants were stored at -70°C. Lung virus titers were determined by using the focus-forming assay (FFA), as described before [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>] with minor modifications. Briefly, MDCK cells were cultured in MEM, supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Supernatants of lung tissue homogenates were serially diluted in DMEM, supplemented with 0.1% BSA and N-acetylated trypsin (NAT; 2.5 μg/ml) and added to the MDCK cell monolayers. After 1h, cells were overlaid with DMEM supplemented with 1% Avicel, 0.1% BSA and NAT (2.5 μg/ml). After 24h cells were fixed with 4% PFA and incubated with quenching solution (PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mM Glycin). Cells were then treated with blocking buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.5% Tween20). Focus forming spots were identified using primary polyclonal goat anti-H1N1 IgG (Virostat), secondary polyclonal rabbit anti-goat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (KPL) and TrueBlue
 <sup>™</sup> peroxidase substrate (KPL). Viral titers were calculated as FFU per ml of lung tissue homogenate.
