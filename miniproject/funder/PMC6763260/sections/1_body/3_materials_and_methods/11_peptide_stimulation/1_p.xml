<p>T cells were stimulated with peptides (1 μg/ml) in 85 μl RPMI 1640 for 1h at 37°C, supplemented with brefeldin A (10 μg/ml in 15 μl RPMI 1640) and incubated for additional 5h at 37°C. Cells incubated without any peptide in the same condition were used as negative controls. Cytokine responses were detected by intracellular cytokine staining.</p>
