 </sub>-tetramer-PE and surface antibodies for 30 min, washed with FACS buffer and analyzed. For intracellular cytokine stainings, the cells were first stained with cell surface antibodies for 30 min, washed and fixed with 100 μl IC fixation buffer (eBioscience) for 5 min at 4°C. Following this, cells were permeabilized for 3 min with 100 μl permeabilization buffer (eBioscience) and incubated with anti-IFNγ antibody for 30 min. Afterwards, cells were washed with FACS buffer and acquired using an LSR-Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Bioscience).
