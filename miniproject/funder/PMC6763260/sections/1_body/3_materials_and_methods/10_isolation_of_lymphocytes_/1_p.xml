<p>Blood, spleen and mLNs were prepared as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Lungs were perfused by injecting 5–10 ml PBS into the right heart ventricle. The lungs were cut into small pieces, resuspended in 1 ml RPMI1640 (0.5% FCS), and digested with 1 ml of RPMI1640 with DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie) and Collagenase I (ROCKLAND
 <sup>™</sup>) in a shaker at 37°C for 30 min. Digested tissue was passed through cell strainers and single cell suspensions were washed with RPMI1640, centrifuged at 500x g for 10 min. Subsequently, the cells were resuspended in 7 ml of 40% Easycoll solution (Biochrom), overlayed onto 6 ml of 70% Easycoll solution in a 15 ml Falcon and centrifuged at 25 min at 1000x g at room temperature. The interface layer was transferred to a 5 ml tube, washed, and resuspended in RPMI1640 (10% FCS).
