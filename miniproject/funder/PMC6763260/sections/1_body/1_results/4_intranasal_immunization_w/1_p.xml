<p>We assumed that intranasal MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> immunization may control the IAV replication by inducing CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cell responses in the lungs. In order to test this hypothesis, we identified the CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cell compartment by staining cells with the CD69 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the CD103 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] marker at times of MCMV latency (&gt; 3 months p.i.). It is known that resident memory T cells reside in the mucosal tissue layer and are non-migratory [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In this study, intravenous (i.v.) injection of a fluorescent anti-CD45 antibody prior sampling allows for the discrimination of circulating leukocytes (fluorescence-positive) from emigrated or tissue-resident leukocytes (fluorescence-negative). The CD69
 <sup>+</sup>CD103
 <sup>+</sup> cells from lungs were virtually absent from the CD45-labelled fraction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Barely CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> could be detected in the spleen and blood regardless of the route of immunization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> (CD69
 <sup>+</sup>CD103
 <sup>+</sup>) cells were solely induced in the lungs and the frequency was significantly higher when i.n. immunized with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> than via the i.p. route (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Approximately forty percent of these lung CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells were IVL-tetramer
 <sup>+</sup> which is significantly higher than the i.p. immunization group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Similar results were observed when gated reversibly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) and when analyze these tetramer
 <sup>+</sup> CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cell numbers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells were also induced in the group that was i.n. immunized with MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup>, but not IVL-specific (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). In addition, there was an overall higher percentage of the CD69
 <sup>+</sup>CD103
 <sup>-</sup>CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs of i.n. immunized mice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s003">S3B Fig</xref>), although the absolute cell numbers did not show a significant difference (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). Since CD69 and CD103 are imperfect markers of tissue residence, we validated if the CD69
 <sup>+</sup>CD103
 <sup>+</sup> and CD69
 <sup>+</sup>CD103
 <sup>-</sup> populations in lungs are truly CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> by staining them for Eomesodermin (Eomes) expression, because CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells show low expression of Eomes. Low levels of Eomes were observed in CD69
 <sup>+</sup>CD103
 <sup>+</sup> CD8 T cells, whereas CD69
 <sup>+</sup>CD103
 <sup>-</sup>CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells showed high expression of Eomes which is consistent with primed CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s003">S3D Fig</xref>). Hence the data suggested the CD69
 <sup>+</sup>CD103
 <sup>-</sup> cell subset show distinct transcription profile from the CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cell. According to the expression of CD62L and KLRG1, IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are classified into three subsets: effector (T
 <sub>EFF</sub>: KLRG1
 <sup>+</sup>CD62L
 <sup>-</sup>); effector memory (T
 <sub>EM</sub>: KLRG1
 <sup>-</sup>CD62L
 <sup>-</sup>) and central memory (T
 <sub>CM</sub>: KLRG1
 <sup>-</sup>CD62L
 <sup>+</sup>) cells. The fractions of each subset in the mucosal (CD45
 <sup>-</sup>) and circulation (CD45
 <sup>+</sup>) in the blood, spleen and lung were analyzed (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s004">S4A &amp; S4B Fig</xref>). While the fraction of CD8T
 <sub>CM</sub> cells remained relatively low in all compartments irrespectively of the route of administration, i.p. infection resulted in a response polarized towards T
 <sub>EFF</sub> cells, whereas i.n. immunization induced a larger fraction of T
 <sub>EM</sub> cells in all analyzed organs both in circulating and mucosal CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell subsets (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s004">S4A &amp; S4B Fig</xref>). Majority of the IVL-specific CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells show an EM phenotype (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s004">S4C Fig</xref>).
