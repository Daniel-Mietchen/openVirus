<p>We showed recently that MCMV vector expressing a single optimally positioned MHC-I restricted antigenic epitope provides a more efficient immune protection than vectors expressing the full-length protein [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, we constructed an MCMV influenza vaccine vector by inserting the coding sequence for the H-2K
 <sup>d</sup> MHC-I restricted peptide 
 <bold>IYSTVASSL</bold> from the hemagglutinin (HA) of the H1N1 (PR8) IAV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] into the C-terminus of the MCMV 
 <italic>ie2</italic> gene. The resulting recombinant virus was called MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To test if the recombinant virus retained its capacity to replicate in host cells, virus replication was assessed by multi-step growth kinetics assays in NIH-3T3 cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and by 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> quantification of virus titers in livers, lungs and spleens 5 days post-infection (dpi) and in salivary glands 21 dpi. MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> showed identical replication properties as the MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup>, both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), indicating that the insertion of the IVL

 </sub> epitope does not impair virus replication and spread.
