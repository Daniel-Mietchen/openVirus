<p>To test whether immunization with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> protects against IAV infection, latently immunized BALB/c mice were i.n. challenged with IAV. IAV titers in the lungs were quantified 5 dpi. Viral loads in mice that were immunized with MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup> via either the i.p. or the i.n. route were comparable to those detected in mock-immunized mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In contrast, mice immunized with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> via the i.n. route showed significantly lower IAV titers than in any other group. Interestingly, i.p. MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> immunization also resulted in reduced IAV loads, but to a lower extent than the i.n. immunization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Similarly, animals immunized with MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup> suffered the most severe weight loss whilst i.n. immunization of MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> led to the least pronounced body weight loss. I.p. immunization with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> displayed an intermediate level (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Numerous studies have reported that CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells play an important role in protecting against influenza infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and it was reasonable to assume that our vector provided immune protection by eliciting CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses. To formally prove that efficient immune control of IAV observed in the MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> (i.n.) immunized group depends on CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, we depleted these cells by systemic treatment of mice with a depleting anti-CD8α antibody (depletion efficiency is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s002">S2A Fig</xref>) one day prior to IAV challenge and quantified viral titers in lungs 6 dpi. While the virus titer was below the detection limit in mice that were i.n. immunized with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> and received isotype control antibodies, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion indeed resulted in a significant increase of the IAV titer to levels comparable to the groups that were i.p. immunized with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> and to control mice immunized with MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup> by i.n. route (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion also slightly increased virus titers in both control groups—MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> (i.p.) and MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup> (i.n.), but not as pronounced as in the MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> i.n. immunized group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Similar to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, animals of all experimental groups showed a comparable body weight loss post-challenge, whereas i.n. MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> immunized mice showed a faster recovery than the i.p. immunized mice (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Of note, this difference disappeared in the groups lacking CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that IAV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells induced by the mucosal (i.n.) administration of MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> confer protection against IAV in the lungs of vaccinated mice.
