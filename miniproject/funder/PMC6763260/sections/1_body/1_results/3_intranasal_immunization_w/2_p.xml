<p>We further compared the lung pathology upon IAV challenge by histology. A moderate perivascular inflammation was observed in the lungs of most mice (stars) and to a lesser degree surrounding the bronchioles (arrows) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). The CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell depleted group showed more severe pathology than isotype-treated controls, but the difference was not very pronounced (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Taken together, these data imply that intranasal immunization with the MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> vector can limit IAV growth in the lungs by inducing IAV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses, whereas the clinical outcome is only moderately improved.
