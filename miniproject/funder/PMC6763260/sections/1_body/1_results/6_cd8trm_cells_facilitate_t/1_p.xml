<p>Since i.n. immunization induced stronger chemokine responses in comparison to the i.p. immunization route, we decided to define whether CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells induced by MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> promoted the accumulation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs. We first analyzed the total IVL-specific and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell numbers (CD45
 <sup>+</sup> plus CD45
 <sup>-</sup>) in the MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> i.n. immunization group. IVL-specific and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell numbers increased from day 2 to day 4 post-challenge, but only in mice that were not depleted for airway CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). Both IVL-specific and total CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts increased significantly in the BALF of i.n. immunized mice by day 4 post IAV challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>), However, in the mice which CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were depleted prior to challenge, very few IVL-tetramer
 <sup>+</sup> CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, filled dots) and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, filled dots) could be detected in the BALF, both on day 2 and at day 4 post-challenge. These data indicate that CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells accumulate in the lungs and migrate to the lung tissue and bronchoalveolar space upon IAV challenge. In addition, IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts in the lung tissue and BAL were slightly higher in the MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> i.n. group than in the i.p. immunized group (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). This differs from results prior to IAV challenge, where significantly larger amounts of IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were detected in the i.p. group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g002">Fig 2G</xref>).
