<p>CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lung tissue were further analyzed by 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> labeling with anti-CD45 antibodies in the presence or absence of airway CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. The IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell population failed to expand upon airway CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion, with significantly lower numbers in CD45
 <sup>-</sup> subset on day 4. However, IAV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts showed an increasing trend both in the CD45
 <sup>+</sup> and in the CD45
 <sup>-</sup> subsets on day 4 post-challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Airway CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion prevented also the expansion of total CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells counts on day 4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, only the CD45
 <sup>-</sup> fraction of the total CD8 pool expanded on day 4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g006">Fig 6F</xref>), suggesting that bystander CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were also accumulated within the lungs. The depletion effects were more pronounced later upon antibody administration. Hence, direct depletion of incoming cells appears an unlikely scenario. Together with the increased chemokines in the BAL, these data indicate that the increase of IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells upon challenge is not due to 
 <italic>in situ</italic> proliferation or differentiation but most probably by recruiting CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from circulating system.
