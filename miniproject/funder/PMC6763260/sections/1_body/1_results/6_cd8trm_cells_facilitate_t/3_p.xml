<p>We also checked whether CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells expanded upon IAV challenge that may contribute to the accumulation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. We found that the number of CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in the lungs did not expand from day 2 to day 4; if anything, their frequency decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). Likewise, IVL-Tetramer
 <sup>+</sup> CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cell counts were also slightly reduced from day 2 to day 4 post-challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), although IVL-Tetramer
 <sup>+</sup> CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts increased at the same time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). It seems that the effect of the i.n. depletion was local, since the frequencies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s006">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>) and counts (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s006">S6E and S6F Fig</xref>) of IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the blood and spleen did not significantly differ upon Î±CD8 or isotype-control antibody i.n. administration. In addition, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell numbers showed no difference upon IAV challenge when airway CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were depleted compared with the control group (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), suggesting that CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cell do not promote CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells trafficking into the lungs. Therefore, our data indicated that CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells confer protection by recruiting circulating CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells upon IAV challenge.
