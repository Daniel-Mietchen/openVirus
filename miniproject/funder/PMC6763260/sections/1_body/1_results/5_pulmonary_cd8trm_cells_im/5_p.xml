<p>To determine whether i.n. immunization with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> induced inflammatory chemokines expression upon IAV challenge, a series of inflammatory chemokines were measured in the BALF on day 2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g005">Fig 5E</xref>) and day 4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g005">Fig 5F</xref>) upon IAV challenge. Airway depletion of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells reduced CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 levels on day 2. On day 4, CCL3 and CCL4 levels were significantly higher in the MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> i.n. group than in the MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> i.p. and in the MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup> i.n. immunization groups. Airway CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion reduced the level of CCL3 and CCL4 to values in the i.p. MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> immunization group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). CXCL9 levels were comparable between the MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> i.n. and i.p. immunization groups, but dramatically lower in the MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup> immunization group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g005">Fig 5F</xref>), which was consistent with the low IFNγ level in the BALF, as IFNγ is known as an inducer of CXCL9, which then acts as a T cell-attracting chemokine. Together, these data indicate that CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells induced by i.n. immunization with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> promote the induction of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL3, CCL4, CCL5 and CXCL9, along with a reduction of IL-6 in the lungs.
