<p>Therefore, we measured the production of IFNγ in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) early upon challenge. IFNγ levels were generally low on day 2 post-challenge and no difference could be observed between groups regardless of airway CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells depletion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). On day 4, the IFNγ level was significantly increased compared to the level on day 2, but more IFNγ was induced in the control group than in the one lacking CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cell in the lungs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). IFNγ was also induced in the MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> i.p. immunization group and extremely low level of IFNγ could be detected in the MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup> control group (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). These data suggest that primary cognate antigen immunization is needed for the rapid IFNγ secretion and that resident CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells may not be the major IFNγ producer. In contrast to these effects, depletion of lung airway CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells increased the concentration of IL-6 as compared to the group that was intranasally immunized with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> and treated with isotype control antibodies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Similarly, a higher concentration of IL-6 was also detected in the i.p. immunization group, whereas the MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup> control group displayed the highest IL-6 levels (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s005">S5B Fig</xref>). Very low levels of other cytokines could be detected in all groups, both on day 2 and 4 post-challenge and regardless of the depletion of the airway CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s005">S5C Fig</xref>), suggesting that the presence of pulmonary CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells does not affect the Th1, Th2 and Th17 immune profile during early IAV infection.
