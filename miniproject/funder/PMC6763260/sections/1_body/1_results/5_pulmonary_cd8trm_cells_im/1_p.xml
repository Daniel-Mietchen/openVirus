<p>Resident memory T cells reside in the epithelial barrier of mucosal tissue [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] that is in close proximity to the airways. Hence, they reactivate rapidly to a virus challenge at the site of infection upon encountering cognate antigens [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To define the relevance of lung CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in protection against IAV challenge, we specifically depleted the airways CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells by i.n. administration of Î±CD8 antibodies one day before challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Upon depletion, tetramer
 <sup>+</sup> CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cell number reduced significantly while the circulating CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell number did not change a lot in the lungs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). The local depletion did not affect the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts in the blood (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). An earlier day was chosen (4 days post-challenge) to assess whether CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cell could rapidly confer protection. The IAV titers in the lungs of i.n. MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> immunized mice were quantified. Targeted depletion of pulmonary CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells was associated with a significantly higher viral burden during IAV infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). These data indicate that CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells induced by i.n. immunization with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> promote the clearance of IAV.
