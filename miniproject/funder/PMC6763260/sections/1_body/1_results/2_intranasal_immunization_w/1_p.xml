<p>We have shown that mucosal infection with MCMV by the i.n. route induces memory inflation, although to a lower extent than upon the i.p. infection route [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To define if this pattern would hold true for the artificially incorporated influenza epitope as well, we compared the magnitude of the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses to MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> and MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup> induced via the i.n. and i.p. route, respectively. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008036.s001">S1 Fig</xref> shows the gating strategy of flow cytometry analysis. The kinetics of antigen-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses in peripheral blood was determined by IVL-tetramer staining. While we did not observe striking difference at early times post immunization, i.p. immunization induced an overall higher magnitude of inflationary CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell response during latency (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). This pattern was observed both in relative terms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and in absolute cell counts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We next analyzed the IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses in spleens, lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes (mLNs) at times of latency (&gt;3months post infection (p.i)). Similarly, i.p. immunization induced higher levels of IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells than the i.n. immunization in the spleen and lungs, both in relative (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>) and in absolute terms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g002">Fig 2F and 2G</xref>). There were no significant differences in the mLNs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008036.g002">Fig 2E and 2H</xref>). In sum, mucosal (i.n.) immunization with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> induces a systemic inflationary IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell response, whereas the overall magnitude of the IAV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell response is less pronounced compared to that induced in i.p. immunized mice.
