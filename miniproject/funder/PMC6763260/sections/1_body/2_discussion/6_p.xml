<p>We have shown in this study that concentration of CCL3, CCL4 and CXCL9 in the BALF of the MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> i.n. immunization group is significantly higher than in MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> i.p. or MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup> i.n. immunized mice. Intravital CD45 labeling showed that CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells accumulating in the lungs are sequestered from the bloodstream, but not CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub>, arguing that circulating antigen-specific cells were attracted into the lungs under the presence of mucosa-resident CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. This is in line with the work of 
 <italic>Schenkel</italic> et al. showing a rapid local induction of chemokines CXCL9 and CCL3/4 in the FRT upon re-infection, and recruitment of memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from the periphery [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Depletion of mucosal CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells depressed chemokine levels in the BALF to levels seen in the i.p. immunization group. This, together with the high levels of IFNγ in the MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> i.n. immunization group and extremely low IFNγ in MCMV
 <sup>WT</sup> i.n. immunization points to a putative model where antigen-specific re-stimulation induces IFNγ, which drives chemokine responses that recruit CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from the bloodstream to the lungs. We observed a surprising lower level of IL-6 upon challenge in mice that controlled influenza, because IL-6 is known as a cytokine that is involved in controlling virus infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It is not clear if IL-6 reduction was a consequence of lower virus titers or of negative regulation by T
 <sub>RM</sub>. 
 <italic>McMaster et al</italic>. showed a reduced IL-6 production accompanied with lower virus titer in the appearance of lung airway CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and this was similar to a report by 
 <italic>Lee et al</italic>. in a clinical study in human patients [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].
