<p>Influenza-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are known to contribute to virus elimination, as the clearance of influenza virus is delayed in T cell-deficient mice [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, previous evidence did not clarify whether vaccines solely inducing influenza-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses improve immune protection. To avoid confounding humoral immune responses and focus on the potential of optimally primed CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in protecting against influenza, we generated a new MCMV based vaccine vector. CMV vaccine vectors expressing exogenous antigenic peptides fused to a CMV gene induce CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses of unparalleled strength [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We show here that robust CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses against a single MHC-I restricted epitope derived from the HA protein of IAV, promote the clearance of IAV from lungs, but only upon i.n. immunization. While some pathology was observed even in immunized mice, arguing that the protection was not complete, depletion assays confirmed that CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are crucial for the immune protection observed in our model. 
 <italic>Morabito et al</italic>. showed that the volume of MCMV inoculum affects the magnitude of T cell responses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Hence, a larger inoculum volume could have resulted in even stronger lung CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses and protection. Remarkably, immunization with the same virus dose by the i.p. route induced even higher magnitude of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses, but conferred poor protection.
