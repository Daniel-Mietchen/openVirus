<p>Former studies have described that the inflationary MCMV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells induced by intraperitoneal infection display an effector phenotype (KLRG1
 <sup>+</sup>CD62L
 <sup>-</sup>CD127
 <sup>-</sup>) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Mucosal immunization of MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> affects not only the magnitude but also the quality of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells skewing cells towards an effector memory phenotype. Since KLRG1 is assumed a marker for terminally differentiated cells which usually are short-lived [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], the low expression of KLRG1 may contribute to a longer life-span of these cells. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that KLRG1
 <sup>-</sup> CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>EM</sub> cells traffic and migrate more rapidly to non-lymphoid tissues than the KLRG1
 <sup>+</sup> CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T
 <sub>EFF</sub> cells, which mostly remain in the circulation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Accordingly, this may give us a clue that CD8T
 <sub>EM</sub> cells induced by mucosal immunization may rapidly migrate to the lungs and exert immune functionality there. Nonetheless, further studies need to be done to prove this hypothesis.
