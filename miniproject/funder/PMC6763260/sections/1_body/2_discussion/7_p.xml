<p>In summary, our data demonstrate that CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells promote the induction of chemokines, which help to drive the recruitment of IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and facilitates the elimination of IAV. Furthermore, the optimal induction of CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in the lungs by the MCMV vector can be only achieved after i.n. vaccination. Therefore, immunization with an MCMV vector at the local site provided CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell-based protection against IAV infection. Our results, therefore, demonstrate that CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell induction, and CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> in particular, contribute to vaccination outcomes in influenza infection independently of humoral immune responses, and the selection of the adequate immunization route plays a critical role in terms for promoting superior protective efficacy.
