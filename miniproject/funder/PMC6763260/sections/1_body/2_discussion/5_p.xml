<p>Early upon IAV challenge, not only the IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells but also the bystander CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lung tissue increased significantly, indicating that the accumulation was not due to 
 <italic>in situ</italic> proliferation but probably due to recruitment from circulating system. In addition, IAV challenge expanded IVL-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell counts in the blood and spleen of i.n. immunized mice to levels observed in the i.p. immunized controls, although the levels were significantly lower in the i.n. immunization group before IAV challenge. Overall, these results indicated that i.n. immunization facilitated CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses upon challenge, both locally in the lungs and systemically in the blood and spleen. It is unclear if this apparent alarming function of T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells is exclusive to the lung tissue.
