<p>It has been assumed that CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells have poor proliferative capacity upon challenge. Previous work has demonstrated that airway CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells fail to expand 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> upon intratracheal transfer [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and that CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells induced by MCMV infection display a limited proliferative capacity in salivary glands [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, this is in contrast to two recent studies demonstrating that CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in the skin [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and FRT [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] maintain the capacity of 
 <italic>in situ</italic> proliferation upon cognate antigen stimulation. Such stimulation differentiates circulating effector memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells into CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells without displacing the pre-existing CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> population [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In our study, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells accumulated in the lungs upon IAV challenge, but the CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> population did not expand and the number of antigen-specific CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells even displayed a reduction trend. This appears unrelated to apoptosis, because CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells showed less caspase3 expression than circulating CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells upon challenge. It is possible that CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells downregulated CD103 from the cell surface upon activation, and this intriguing question needs to be addressed in future studies. Therefore, our data argued that either lung CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> in general or CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> induced by MCMV i.n. immunization in particular, may behave differently from CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> in other organs. This distinction, however, goes beyond the scope of our current work and remains to be addressed in future studies.
