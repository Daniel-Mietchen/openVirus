<p>CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> are found in the salivary glands of MCMV-infected animals [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], but not in their lungs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We showed that i.n. infection with MCMV induces inflationary CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses, but also that memory inflation is more pronounced in relative and absolute terms upon i.p. infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The i.n. administration of an MCMV vaccine vector induced CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> responses in the lungs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and only i.n. immunization restricted the replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) upon challenge [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], indicating that CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> elicited by i.n. administration of MCMV vectors might provide immune protection against respiratory virus infections, yet this evidence remains correlative. Upon antigen encounter, CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells quickly reactivate at the mucosal site and secrete cytokines and chemokines or support the release of inflammatory mediators by other immune cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Lung airway CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells provide protection against respiratory virus infection through IFNγ and help to recruit circulating memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells to the site of infection in an IFNγ-dependent way [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, to understand if CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cell may provide immune control of respiratory infections may help to refine strategies for tissue-targeted vaccine design.
