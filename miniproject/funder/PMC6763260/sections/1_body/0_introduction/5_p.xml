 <sup>IVL</sup> under the transcriptional control of the

 <sup>+</sup> T cells that confer protection against a lethal IAV challenge. We showed that i.n., but not i.p. immunization with MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> resulted in robust protection against an IAV challenge. Protection following i.n. MCMV
 <sup>IVL</sup> immunization was associated with high levels of antigen-specific CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells in the lungs, and targeted depletion of lung-CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells revealed that the control of the IAV in the lungs depended on these cells.
