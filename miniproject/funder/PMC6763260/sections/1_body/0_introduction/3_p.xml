<p>Both CD8T
 <sub>EM</sub> and CD8T
 <sub>CM</sub> subsets recirculate between the blood, the lymphoid organs, and the peripheral tissues. A special subset of memory CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells (CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub>) resides in non-lymphoid tissues such as lungs, the female reproductive tract (FRT), the skin, the brain or the small intestine [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These cells lose the capacity of recirculating, maintain themselves at the site of infection, and their phenotype and transcriptional profile differ from classical memory T cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The well-characterized CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> cells express C-type lectin CD69 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and the integrin αEβ7, also known as CD103 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They provide rapid and superior protection against pathogens at the site of infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A recent publication argued that a vaccine formulation adjuvanted by IL-1β enhances the immune control of IAV by improving mucosal T cell responses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], but IL-1β improved both humoral and cellular responses in their study. Hence, the contribution of CD8T
 <sub>RM</sub> to IAV immune control remains unclear.
