  <title>Intranasal immunization with the MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> induces antigen-specific tissue-resident CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs.
  </title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were i.n. (◌) or i.p. (●) infected with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU of MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> virus. During latency (&gt; 3 months p.i), anti-CD45 antibodies were injected intravenously 3–5 min before mice euthanasia. Leukocytes were isolated from peripheral blood, spleen and lungs, stained with antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8α, CD11a, CD103, CD69, IVL-tetramer and measured by flow cytometry. (A) CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells were gated as CD45
   <sup>-</sup>CD69
   <sup>+</sup>CD103
   <sup>+</sup>. (B) Percentage of CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells among CD45
   <sup>-</sup> CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in the peripheral blood, spleen and lungs. (C) IVL-tetramer
   <sup>+</sup> cells were gated on the CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cell subset and percentages of IVL-specific cells among CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells in blood, spleen and lungs are shown. (D) CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells were gated within the IVL-tetramer
   <sup>+</sup> cell subset and the percentages of CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells among tetramer
   <sup>+</sup> CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in blood, spleen and lungs are shown. (E) The number of lung CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells in spleen, lungs and blood of different groups. Two independent experiments were performed and pooled data are shown. Each symbol represents one mouse, n = 5. Group means +/- SEM are shown. Significance was assessed by One-way ANOVA.
