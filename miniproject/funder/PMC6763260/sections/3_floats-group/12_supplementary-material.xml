  <title>Mucosal immunization with MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> induced vigorous CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell responses in blood, spleen and lungs.
  </title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> by the i.n. or i.p. route or with MCMV
   <sup>WT</sup> by the i.n. route. During latency (&gt; 3 months p.i), mice were challenged with IAV (PR8) (i.n., 1100 FFU) one day after airway CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion. On day 4 post-challenge, anti-CD45 antibodies were injected intravenously 3–5 min before mice euthanasia. Leukocytes were isolated from lung, BAL, blood and spleen. (A-B) Count of IVL-specific CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs (A) and BAL (B). (C-D) Percentage of IVL-specific CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells among CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in the blood (C) and spleen (D). (E-F) Count of IVL-specific CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell in the blood (E) and spleen (F). Two independent experiments were performed and pooled data are shown. Each symbol represents one mouse, n = 5–7. Group means +/- SEM are shown. Significance was assessed by One-way ANOVA test.
