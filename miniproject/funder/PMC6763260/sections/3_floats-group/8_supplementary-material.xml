  <title>Efficiency of 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion.
  </title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> by the i.n. route. (A) During latency (&gt; 3 months p.i), mice were injected 200 μg αCD8 antibody (i.p.) to deplete total CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells. Same amount of IgG2b antibody was given as isotype control. Leukocytes from blood, spleen and lungs were analyzed by flow cytometry and representative flow cytometric panels in blood, spleen and lungs on day 1 post-depletion are shown. (B-C) Mice were administered with 10 μg αCD8 antibody (i.n.) to deplete airway CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs or IgG2b as a control. (B) The number of IVL-tetramer
   <sup>+</sup> CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells and circulating CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells (CD45
   <sup>+</sup>) in the lungs on day 1 post airway CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion. (C) The number of IVL-specific and total CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in the peripheral blood on day 1 post airway CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion. Bars indicate means, error bars are SEM.
