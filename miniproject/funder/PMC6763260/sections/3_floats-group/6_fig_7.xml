  <title>CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells do not expand upon IAV challenge.

  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> via the i.n. route. During latency (&gt; 3 months p.i), mice were i.n. treated with αCD8 (black circle) or IgG2b (white circle) antibodies and challenged with IAV (PR8) (i.n., 1100 FFU) one day after. Anti-CD45 antibodies were injected intravenously 3–5 min before mice euthanasia. Leukocytes were isolated from lung tissue to analyze the CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell response on day 2 and day 4 post-challenge. CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells were gated within the CD45
   <sup>-</sup>unlabeled population. (A) Percentage of CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells among CD45
   <sup>-</sup> CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell. (B) Counts of CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells in the lungs. (C) Counts of IVL-specific CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells in the lungs. Two independent experiments were performed and pooled data are shown. Each symbol represents one mouse, n = 5–7. Group means +/- SEM are shown. Significance was assessed by One-way ANOVA test.
