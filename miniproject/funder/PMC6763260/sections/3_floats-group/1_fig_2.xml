  <title>Intranasal immunization of MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> induces lower magnitude of CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell response than intraperitoneal immunization.
  </title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were infected with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> via the i.n. or i.p. route or with MCMV
   <sup>WT</sup> via the i.n. route. IVL-specific CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell responses were analyzed by IVL-tetramers staining and flow cytometry. (A, B) Blood leukocytes were analyzed at indicated time points upon infection to define the (A) percentage of IVL-specific (Tet
   <sup>+</sup>) cells among CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells and (B) cell counts of IVL-specific (Tet
   <sup>+</sup>) cells in peripheral blood. Two independent experiments were performed and results were pooled and shown as group means +/- SEM (n = 8–10). (E-H) IVL-specific CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in spleen, lungs and mLNs were quantified by IVL-tetramer staining 120 dpi as relative cell percentages among CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells (C, D, E) or absolute cell counts (F, G, H) per organ. Two independent experiments were performed and pooled data are shown. Each symbol represents one mouse, n = 7–10. Group means +/- SEM are shown. Significance was assessed by Two-way ANOVA test (panels A, B) or one-way ANOVA test (Panels C-H).
