  <title>The phenotype of IVL-specific CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells.
  </title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> via the i.p. or i.n. route. During latency (&gt; 3 months p.i), anti-CD45 antibodies were injected intravenously 3â€“5 min before mice euthanasia. Leukocytes from blood, spleen and lungs were stained with cell surface markers CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11a, KLRG1, CD62L, IVL-tetramer and analyzed by flow cytometry. T
   <sub>EFF</sub> cells are defined as KLRG1
   <sup>+</sup>CD62L
   <sup>-</sup>, T
   <sub>EM</sub> as KLRG1
   <sup>-</sup>CD62L
   <sup>-</sup>and T
   <sub>CM</sub> as KLRG1
   <sup>-</sup>CD62L
   <sup>+</sup>. (A) The percentages of each phenotype subset among CD45
   <sup>-</sup> tetramer
   <sup>+</sup> CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs and spleen. (B) The percentages of each phenotype subset among CD45
   <sup>+</sup> tetramer
   <sup>+</sup> CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells and tetramer
   <sup>+</sup> CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells in the lungs, spleen and blood. (C) The percentages of each phenotype subset among tetramer
   <sup>+</sup> CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells in the lungs. Two independent experiments were performed and pooled data are shown, n = 5. Each symbol represents one mouse. Group means +/- SEM are shown. Significance was assessed by One-way ANOVA and Two-way ANOVA test. ****P &lt;0.0001.
