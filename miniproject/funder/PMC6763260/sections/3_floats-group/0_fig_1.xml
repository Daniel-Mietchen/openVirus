  <title>Generation of the recombinant MCMV expressing the 
   <sub>533</sub>IYSTVASSL
   <sub>541</sub> epitope.

  <p>The sequence of IAV epitope 
   <sub>
    <bold>533</bold>
   </sub>AAIYSTVASSL
   <sub>
    <bold>541</bold>
   </sub> (IVL
   <sub>
    <bold>533-541</bold>
   </sub>) was introduced at the C-terminus of the MCMV 
   <italic>ie2</italic> gene, and the growth of the recombinant virus MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> was tested 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>. (A) The location of the 
   <italic>ie2</italic> gene within the MCMV genome at ~186-187kb position is shown; the insertion site of the peptide IVL
   <sub>
    <bold>533-541</bold>
   </sub> and the corresponding nucleotide sequences are magnified. (B) MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> and wild-type MCMV (MCMV
   <sup>WT</sup>) growth at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 was compared in NIH-3T3 cells. Virus titers in supernatants expressed as plaque-forming units (PFU) were established at indicated time points. Group means +/- standard error of the mean (SEM) are shown. The dashed line indicates the limit of detection. (C) BALB/c mice were i.p. infected with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU of MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> or MCMV
   <sup>WT</sup> virus. Spleen, lung and liver homogenates were assayed for virus titers 5 days post-infection (dpi). Salivary-gland (SG) homogenates were assayed 21 dpi. Each symbol represents one mouse. Group means +/- standard error of the mean (SEM) are shown. The dashed line indicates the limit of detection.
