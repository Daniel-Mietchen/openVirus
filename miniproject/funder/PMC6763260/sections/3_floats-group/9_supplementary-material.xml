  <title>MCMV
   <sup>WT</sup> mucosal immunization induces IVL-unspecific CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> and CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells express low Eomes and caspase3/7.
  </title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU MCMV
   <sup>WT</sup> via the i.n. route. During latency (&gt; 3 months p.i), leukocytes were isolated from lungs, stained with cell surface markers against CD4, CD8, CD69, CD103 before flow cytometry. (A) Representative dot plots of CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> and IVL-specific CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> cells. (B, C) BALB/c mice were immunized with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> via the i.n. or i.p. route. (B) Percentage of CD69
   <sup>+</sup>CD103
   <sup>-</sup>CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs. (C) The number of CD69
   <sup>+</sup>CD103
   <sup>-</sup>CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs. (D) Eomes expression on different subsets of CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lungs. (E) Percentage of caspase3/7
   <sup>+</sup> cells among CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> and circulating CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T (CD45
   <sup>+</sup>) cells. (F) Percentage of caspase3/7
   <sup>+</sup> cells among tetramer
   <sup>+</sup> CD8T
   <sub>RM</sub> and circulating CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T (CD45
   <sup>+</sup>) cells. Two independent experiments were performed and pooled data are shown. Each symbol represents one mouse, n = 5â€“9. Group means +/- SEM are shown. Significance was assessed by Mann-Whitney U test.
