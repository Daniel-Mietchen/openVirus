  <title>Airway CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion does not affect CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells upon IAV challenge.
  </title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> by the i.n. route. During latency (&gt; 3 months p.i), mice were challenged with IAV (PR8) (i.n., 1100 FFU) one day after airway CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell depletion. On day 2 and day 4 post-challenge, anti-CD45 antibodies were injected intravenously 3–5 min before mice euthanasia. Leukocytes were isolated from lungs and BAL. CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cell numbers in the lungs are shown. (A) The number of total CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells. (B) The number of CD45
   <sup>-</sup> CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells. (C) The number of CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in the BAL. Two independent experiments were performed and pooled data are shown. Each symbol represents one mouse, n = 5–7. Group means +/- SEM are shown.
