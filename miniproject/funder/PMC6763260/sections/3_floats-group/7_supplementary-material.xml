  <title>Gating strategy of flow cytometry.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> via the i.p. or i.n. route. During latency (&gt; 3 months p.i), Leukocytes from blood, spleen and lungs were stained with cell surface markers CD3, CD4, CD8, CD11a, CD69, CD103, KLRG1, CD62L, IVL-tetramer and analyzed by flow cytometry. For 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> labeling, anti-CD45 antibodies were injected intravenously 3â€“5 min before mice euthanasia. Gating strategy of each cell subset is shown.
