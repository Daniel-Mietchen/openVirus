  <title>Inflammatory cytokines in the BALF upon IAV challenge.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 2 x 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> via the i.n. or i.p. route or with MCMV
   <sup>WT</sup> via the i.n. route. During latency (&gt; 3 months p.i), MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> (i.n.) immunized mice were administered with 10 μg αCD8 or 10 μg IgG2b antibody (i.n.). MCMV
   <sup>IVL</sup> (i.p.) and MCMV
   <sup>WT</sup> (i.n.) immunized mice were administered with 10 μg IgG2b antibody (i.n.). One day later, animals were challenged with IAV (PR8) (i.n., 1100 FFU). On day 2 and day 4 post-challenge, BALF was harvested and measured cytokines production by bio-plexing. The concentration of (A) IFNγ and (B) IL-6 in the BALF on day 4 post-challenge. Two independent experiments were performed and pooled data are shown. Each symbol represents one mouse, n = 5–7. Group means +/- SEM are shown. (C) Cytokine concentrations in the BALF in different immunization group on day 2 and day 4 post-challenge. Bars indicate means, error bars are SEM. Two independent experiments were performed and pooled data are shown. Each symbol represents one mouse, n = 5–7. Significance was assessed by One-way ANOVA test.
