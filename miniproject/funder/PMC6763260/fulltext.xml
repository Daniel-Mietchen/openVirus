CMV induces the strongest and most durable CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response known in human clinical medicine. Due to its unique properties, the virus represents a promising candidate vaccine vector for the induction of persistent cellular immunity. To take advantage of this, we constructed a recombinant murine CMV (MCMV) expressing an MHC-I restricted epitope from influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 within the immediate early 2 (<italic>ie2</italic>) gene. Only mice that were immunized intranasally (i.n.) were capable of controlling IAV infection, despite the greater potency of the intraperitoneally (i.p.) vaccination in inducing a systemic IAV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response. The protective capacity of the i.n. immunization was associated with its ability to induce IAV-specific tissue-resident memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T (CD8T<sub>RM</sub>) cells in the lungs. Our data demonstrate that the protective effect exerted by the i.n. immunization was critically mediated by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells promoted the induction of IFN&#x003b3; and chemokines that facilitate the recruitment of antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to the lungs. Overall, our results showed that locally applied MCMV vectors could induce mucosal immunity at sites of entry, providing superior immune protection against respiratory infections.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Vaccines against influenza typically induce immune responses based on antibodies, small molecules that recognize the virus particles outside of cells and neutralize them before they infect a cell. However, influenza rapidly evolves, escaping immune recognition, and the fastest evolution is seen in the part of the virus that is recognized by antibodies. Therefore, every year we are confronted with new flu strains that are not recognized by our antibodies against the strains from previous years. The other branch of the immune system is made of killer T cells, which recognize infected cells and target them for killing. Influenza does not rapidly evolve to escape T cell killing; thus, vaccines inducing T-cell responses to influenza might provide long-term protection. We introduced an antigen from influenza into the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and used it as a vaccine vector inducing killer T-cell responses of unparalleled strength. Our vector controls influenza replication and provides relief to infected mice, but only if we administered it through the nose, to activate killer T cells that will persist in the lungs close to the airways. Therefore, our data show that the subset of lung-resident killer T cells is sufficient to protect against influenza.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001656</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PIE-008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3978-778X</contrib-id><name><surname>&#x0010c;i&#x0010d;in-&#x00160;ain</surname><given-names>Luka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011199</institution-id><institution>FP7 Ideas: European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>260934</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3978-778X</contrib-id><name><surname>&#x0010c;i&#x0010d;in-&#x00160;ain</surname><given-names>Luka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the European Research Council through the ERC Starting Grant 260934 to LCS and the Helmholtz Association through the Helmholtz EU Partnering Grant PIE-008 to LCS.

Influenza virus causes seasonal epidemics, with typically 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness worldwide, according to WHO reports [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and influenza type A viruses (IAV) cause the more severe disease form. Vaccines against influenza are based on the induction of adaptive immunity that targets the projected yearly epidemics. While most vaccines are based on inactivated IAV formulations inducing anti-IAV IgG responses, live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) are also used as formulations for i.n. administration. This is based on the assumption that the induction of local immunity may provide superior immune protection [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether this protection depends on local IgA responses, on cytotoxic T cell responses, or on their combined antiviral activity. Of note, functional T cell responses were shown to substantially contribute to antiviral IAV immunity [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In particular, cytotoxic influenza-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (CTLs) promote viral clearance indirectly by secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN&#x003b3; [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and directly by perforin/Fas-mediated killing of infected epithelial cells in the bronchoalveolar space [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, it remained unclear if T cell responses alone may control IAV, or if Ig responses were the crucial contributor to LAIV-mediated immune protection. We considered that this question could be addressed by developing a vaccine formulation that optimizes T cell responses against IAV while excluding the humoral ones.</p><p>CMV infection induces sustained functional T cell responses that are stronger in the long-term than the immune response to any other infectious pathogen [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Experiments in the mouse model have shown that defined CMV epitope-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells accumulate in tissues and blood and are maintained at stable high levels during mouse CMV (MCMV) latency [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This phenomenon was termed &#x02018;&#x02018;Memory Inflation&#x0201d; [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. While some MCMV derived peptides, as the ones derived from the IE3 (<sub><bold>416</bold></sub><bold>RALEYKNL</bold><sub><bold>423</bold></sub>) and M139 proteins (<sub><bold>419</bold></sub><bold>TVYGFCLL</bold><sub><bold>426</bold></sub>) induce inflationary responses, other peptides, such as the M45-derived (<sub><bold>985</bold></sub><bold>HGIRNASFI</bold><sub><bold>993</bold></sub>), induce conventional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

MCMV<sup>WT</sup> induced robust CD8T<sub>RM</sub> responses in our model, but these were not specific for IAV, and did not provide any protection against IAV in our study. Site-specific anti-CD8&#x003b1; antibody administration depleted CD8T<sub>RM</sub>, and increased IAV titers in immunized mice, indicating that CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells facilitated IAV elimination. Thus, the protection against IAV challenge requires antigen-specific CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells in our model. However, the weight loss was not different in the early days upon challenge and T<sub>RM</sub> depletion affected chemokine expression and T cell influx at later time points.</p><p>Former studies have described that the inflationary MCMV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells induced by intraperitoneal infection display an effector phenotype (KLRG1<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>-</sup>CD127<sup>-</sup>) [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Mucosal immunization of MCMV<sup>IVL</sup> affects not only the magnitude but also the quality of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells skewing cells towards an effector memory phenotype. Since KLRG1 is assumed a marker for terminally differentiated cells which usually are short-lived [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], the low expression of KLRG1 may contribute to a longer life-span of these cells. Additionally, recent work has demonstrated that KLRG1<sup>-</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> cells traffic and migrate more rapidly to non-lymphoid tissues than the KLRG1<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EFF</sub> cells, which mostly remain in the circulation [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Accordingly, this may give us a clue that CD8T<sub>EM</sub> cells induced by mucosal immunization may rapidly migrate to the lungs and exert immune functionality there. Nonetheless, further studies need to be done to prove this hypothesis.</p><p>It has been assumed that CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells have poor proliferative capacity upon challenge. Previous work has demonstrated that airway CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells fail to expand <italic>in vivo</italic> upon intratracheal transfer [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and that CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells induced by MCMV infection display a limited proliferative capacity in salivary glands [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. However, this is in contrast to two recent studies demonstrating that CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells in the skin [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and FRT [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] maintain the capacity of <italic>in situ</italic> proliferation upon cognate antigen stimulation. Such stimulation differentiates circulating effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells into CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells without displacing the pre-existing CD8T<sub>RM</sub> population [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In our study, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells accumulated in the lungs upon IAV challenge, but the CD8T<sub>RM</sub> population did not expand and the number of antigen-specific CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells even displayed a reduction trend. This appears unrelated to apoptosis, because CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells showed less caspase3 expression than circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells upon challenge. It is possible that CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells downregulated CD103 from the cell surface upon activation, and this intriguing question needs to be addressed in future studies. Therefore, our data argued that either lung CD8T<sub>RM</sub> in general or CD8T<sub>RM</sub> induced by MCMV i.n. immunization in particular, may behave differently from CD8T<sub>RM</sub> in other organs. This distinction, however, goes beyond the scope of our current work and remains to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Early upon IAV challenge, not only the IVL-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but also the bystander CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lung tissue increased significantly, indicating that the accumulation was not due to <italic>in situ</italic> proliferation but probably due to recruitment from circulating system. In addition, IAV challenge expanded IVL-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell counts in the blood and spleen of i.n. immunized mice to levels observed in the i.p. immunized controls, although the levels were significantly lower in the i.n. immunization group before IAV challenge. Overall, these results indicated that i.n. immunization facilitated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses upon challenge, both locally in the lungs and systemically in the blood and spleen. It is unclear if this apparent alarming function of T<sub>RM</sub> cells is exclusive to the lung tissue.</p><p>We have shown in this study that concentration of CCL3, CCL4 and CXCL9 in the BALF of the MCMV<sup>IVL</sup> i.n. immunization group is significantly higher than in MCMV<sup>IVL</sup> i.p. or MCMV<sup>WT</sup> i.n. immunized mice. Intravital CD45 labeling showed that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells accumulating in the lungs are sequestered from the bloodstream, but not CD8T<sub>RM</sub>, arguing that circulating antigen-specific cells were attracted into the lungs under the presence of mucosa-resident CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This is in line with the work of <italic>Schenkel</italic> et al. showing a rapid local induction of chemokines CXCL9 and CCL3/4 in the FRT upon re-infection, and recruitment of memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from the periphery [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Depletion of mucosal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells depressed chemokine levels in the BALF to levels seen in the i.p. immunization group. This, together with the high levels of IFN&#x003b3; in the MCMV<sup>IVL</sup> i.n. immunization group and extremely low IFN&#x003b3; in MCMV<sup>WT</sup> i.n. immunization points to a putative model where antigen-specific re-stimulation induces IFN&#x003b3;, which drives chemokine responses that recruit CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from the bloodstream to the lungs. We observed a surprising lower level of IL-6 upon challenge in mice that controlled influenza, because IL-6 is known as a cytokine that is involved in controlling virus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. It is not clear if IL-6 reduction was a consequence of lower virus titers or of negative regulation by T<sub>RM</sub>. <italic>McMaster et al</italic>. showed a reduced IL-6 production accompanied with lower virus titer in the appearance of lung airway CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and this was similar to a report by <italic>Lee et al</italic>. in a clinical study in human patients [<xref rid="ppat.1008036.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>].</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate that CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells promote the induction of chemokines, which help to drive the recruitment of IVL-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and facilitates the elimination of IAV. Furthermore, the optimal induction of CD8T<sub>RM</sub> cells in the lungs by the MCMV vector can be only achieved after i.n. vaccination. Therefore, immunization with an MCMV vector at the local site provided CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-based protection against IAV infection. Our results, therefore, demonstrate that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell induction, and CD8T<sub>RM</sub> in particular, contribute to vaccination outcomes in influenza infection independently of humoral immune responses, and the selection of the adequate immunization route plays a critical role in terms for promoting superior protective efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Mice were housed and handled in agreement with good animal practice as defined by EU directive EU 2010/63 and ETS 123 and the national animal welfare body &#x02018;&#x02018;Die Gesellschaft f&#x000fc;r Versuchstierkunde /Society of Laboratory Animals (GV-SOLAS)&#x0201d;.
