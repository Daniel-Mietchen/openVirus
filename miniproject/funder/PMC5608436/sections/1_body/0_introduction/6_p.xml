<p>For a better response to future EVD and MVD outbreaks in Uganda, there is a need to better understand communitiesâ€™ knowledge and attitudes towards these VHFs. Therefore, our main objective was to describe knowledge and attitudes in two communities affected by outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg viral diseases in Uganda. This information may be critical in designing health education, information, and communication materials in future outbreaks, leading to better control of future epidemics.</p>
