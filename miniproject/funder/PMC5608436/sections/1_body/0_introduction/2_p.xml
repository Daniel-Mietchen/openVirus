<p>Three (3) MVD outbreaks have been reported in Uganda. The first recorded outbreak was in 2007, where three (3) cases and one (1) death were reported in a community associated with mining activities in the districts of Kamwenge and Ibanda, Western Uganda [

 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic> to be the known reservoir for Marburg virus [

In Uganda, this bat species has been found in the Kitaka mine in Ibanda district as well as in Maramagambo “python cave” in the neighboring Rubirizi district, as well as other sites in the surrounding areas. Two tourists visiting python caves were infected with Marburg virus in 2008 with one fatality [
