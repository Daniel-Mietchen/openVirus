<p>Knowledge and attitude questions that were answered correctly were scored one (1) while those that were answered wrongly were scored zero (0). All questions were given equal weight, and missing responses were not scored, whereas “do not know” responses were scored zero (0). The knowledge and attitude score for each study participant were used to compute the percentage scores out of a total score of 34 and 20 respectively. The validity of the knowledge and attitude questions was confirmed by an adequate Cronbach's alpha internal consistency measured at 0.90.</p>
