<p>Data were entered into EpiInfo software, assessed for normality and univariate analysis was done and later exported to Stata (Stata/ SE for Windows, StataCorp, College Station, TX) for further analysis. Results are presented in tables and narratives. A cut-off point was set based on percentage knowledge and attitude distribution, and median scores as was described in other studies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005907.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005907.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. For knowledge score, the median percentage score was 56%; with a bimodal curve distribution of the scores, hence those below a 56% score were categorized as having poor knowledge and those with 56% and above score as having good knowledge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005907.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Further, attitudes were classified as being negative if the percentage score was below the median score of 70% and positive if the median score was 70% and above (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005907.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The relationship between good or poor knowledge and attitude was explored using a univariable logistic regression. Predictors of good versus poor knowledge with a p-value of 0.2 and below were included in a multivariable logistic regression model to determine the predictors of good knowledge towards EVD and MVD. The model was constructed using a backward selection procedure using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) with a p = 0.05 for keeping a variable in the model. Model evaluation was done using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test of goodness of fit and the area under the receiver operating curve (ROC).
