<p>We estimated the necessary sample size using StatCalc, an application in the EpiInfo software, which gave us 768 study participants, 384 in each study area, based on an expected proportion of the population that have knowledge about MVD and EVD at 50% and the desired precision of 5%. However, only 740 completed the questionnaires representing a response rate of 96.4%. We studied the population in Ibanda, Kamwenge and Luweero districts, purposively sampling villages that were affected by Ebola and Marburg virus diseases outbreaks. A multisector team of members from the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI), Ministry of Health Uganda, Makerere University Kampala Uganda and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Uganda working with district health teams visited affected villages to recruit study participants. Through working with local community leaders and health workers, a snowball approach was used to recruit participants. Participants for the questionnaire were chosen using convenient sampling, and both communities were asked the same questions.</p>
