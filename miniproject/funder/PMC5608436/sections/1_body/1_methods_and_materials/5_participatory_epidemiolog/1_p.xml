<p>Qualitative participatory appraisal techniques, also known as Participatory Epidemiology (PE) were used to triangulate the findings of quantitative data collection. Five (5) focus group discussions (FGDs) involving 50 participants were conducted. FGDs were held within rural communities that were affected by outbreaks, drawn mainly from survivors of EVD and MVD and their family members, community and opinion leaders, as well as other members of the community who were 18 years and above. The discussions involved both male and female respondents since gender disaggregation was not the focus of this study.</p>
