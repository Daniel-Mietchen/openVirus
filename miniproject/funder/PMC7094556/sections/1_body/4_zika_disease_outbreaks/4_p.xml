<p id="p0045">Zika virus is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus mosquito bites; however, clinical cases of nonvector transmission, such as sexual transmission from infected males and mother to child transmission, have been well documented.

 </xref> Zika virus has been detected in bodily fluids (eg, semen, urine, saliva, vaginal fluids, breast milk, and tears) following infection; the longest reported period from symptom onset to detection of ZIKV RNA was 9 months following infection in semen from 184 ZIKV-infected men.
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">

 </xref> Data from the largest cohort study to date revealed that infectious ZIKV RNA shedding in semen declines during the first 3 months after symptom onset.

 </xref> Notably, a recently developed synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV premembrane/membrane (prM) and envelope (E) proteins entirely protected mice against ZIKV-induced testis and sperm damage.

 </xref> New research using pregnant rhesus macaques revealed long-standing persistence of ZIKV in both maternal and fetal tissues, enhanced maternal and fetal immune responses, and fetal inflammation.

  <sup>31</sup>
 </xref> It is not yet clear if pathologic effects are different or more severe among immunocompromised persons. Given ZIKV pathogenesis and cell and tissue tropism, there is an urgent need to develop Zika vaccines that have the potential to protect the public—especially pregnant women and their fetuses—from ZIKV infection.
