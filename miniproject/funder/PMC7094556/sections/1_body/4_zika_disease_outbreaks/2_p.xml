<p id="p0035">Zika virus infection typically causes no or mild clinical symptoms (such as mild fever, arthralgia, headache, conjunctivitis, rash, muscle and joint pain) in adults and was not considered a major public health threat until recently. These symptoms usually last for 2 to 7 days and have significant similarities with DENV-like disease. The incubation period of ZIKV is not clear but is likely to range from 3 to 12 days.
