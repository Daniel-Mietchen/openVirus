<p id="p0155">A wide variety of other preclinical-stage vaccine candidates are currently being developed. The Mayo Clinic Vaccine Research Group is using an established mass spectrometry approach to isolate ZIKV-derived peptides from infected cells for use as a peptide-based vaccine. Peptide-based vaccines have a number of significant advantages that would be ideally suited for use as a ZIKV vaccine: inexpensive to manufacture, safe for universal administration, no cold chain requirements, easily stored and administered, can contain T- and/or B-cell epitopes, and have a defined epitope selection in order to avoid ADE. Preclinical studies utilizing such peptides in combination with biodegradable nanoparticles in mice are currently in progress.</p>
