 </xref> This vaccine has been tested with and without alum, utilizing multiple immunization routes, and in both mice and nonhuman primates. Vaccination elicits high-titer neutralizing antibodies as well as cellular immune responses and produces sterile immunity in rhesus macaques.

The results from the first 3 trials indicate that recipients developed robust neutralizing antibody titers that on transfer into miceÂ significantly reduced or eliminated viral titers following ZIKV challenge.
