The antigen sequence has been modified to remove epitopes in regions known to contribute to DENV ADE.

AG129 mice developed neutralizing antibody following a single vaccination, and those titers increased significantly after a booster immunization. Animals receiving 10 ug of vaccine (with or without the booster immunization) were protected against a lethal ZIKV challenge. A lower vaccine dose (2 ug) resulted in 60% protection after a single immunization and 90% protection after a prime-boost immunization. The effects of the vaccine in immunocompetent mice (C57BL/6) were also studied. Neutralizing antibody titers were low but detectable after a single immunization and were significantly increased following the booster immunization. Mice were pretreated with IFNAR-blocking antibody and then challenged with ZIKV (Dakar 41519). Unimmunized mice developed high levels of viremia, lost weight, and experienced a 25% to 30% mortality rate following challenge. In contrast, mice given a prime-boost immunization exhibited no viremia, no weight loss, and 100% survival. These studies also demonstrated that removal of the E-DII-FL epitope thought to be involved in ADE did not affect the development of neutralizing antibodies or vaccine-induced protection.
