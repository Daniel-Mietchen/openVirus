<p id="p0110">The recent outbreaks of ZIKV in the Pacific and South America significantly heightened public health awareness of Zika as well as increased research interest in Zika virology, pathology, epidemiology, and immunology. In March 2016, the WHO reported 18 ZIKV vaccine programs, and the number may have grown since then. A wide variety of formulations are being studied; among those being tested are live virus vaccines, inactivated vaccines, whole-virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, and messenger RNA (mRNA)–, DNA-, protein-, and vector-based formulations. 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> lists the most developed of these candidates. Herein, we will highlight a few of the vaccine approaches.
