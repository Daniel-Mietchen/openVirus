<p id="p0140">The most advanced vaccine candidates to date include VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP, a plasmid-based DNA vaccine encoding the prM and E proteins of a French Polynesian strain of ZIKV (H/PF/2013). It is currently undergoing a phase 2 clinical trial in healthy adults aged 18 to 35 years (

A 2-dose vaccination schedule in rhesus macaques elicited virus-binding and virus-neutralizing antibody responses. The vaccines also reduced—and, in some animals, eliminated—viremia after viral challenge. The study also found a correlation between protection from challenge- and prechallenge-neutralizing antibody titer.
