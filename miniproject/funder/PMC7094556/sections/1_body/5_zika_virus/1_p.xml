<p id="p0050">Zika is an emerging, mosquito-borne, enveloped, nonsegmented, 10-kilobase, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA flavivirus of global significance. Three main genetic lineages of ZIKV (2 from Africa [African I and African II lineages] and 1 from Asia) have been identified.

 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Genetic analyses indicate that its geographic circulation was limited to the areas around Africa and Asia by the 2000s; ZIKV then evolved into 2 distinct lineages with differential pathogenesis—African (ie, African I lineage) and Asian.

 </xref> The Asian strains have been found to activate innate immune interferon (IFN) regulatory factors via NS1, NS4B, and NS5 ZIKV nonstructural proteins while African lineage strains have not, demonstrating evolutionary differences in pathogenesis and molecular responses between Asian and African lineages.
