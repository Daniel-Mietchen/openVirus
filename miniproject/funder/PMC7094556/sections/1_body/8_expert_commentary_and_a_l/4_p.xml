<p id="p0175">Third, more research is necessary to determine what the Zika infection outcomes of interest are that we want vaccine to prevent. Is it GBS? Zika congenital conditions? Latent infection and persistence in gonadal organs? Other? Fourth, issues of vaccine-induced immunity are significant. How many doses will be required and over what time periods? How durable and long-lasting will vaccine-induced immunity be? Are there risks for ADE in humans resulting in inadvertent harm? Fifth, ethical issues such as human challenge studies that include pregnant women in vaccine development clinical trials and include children in clinical trials, among others, must be defined. These and other important questions remain and must be solved. Although we believe they are solvable, it may require considerable time—even decades—to do so. In the meantime, the most advanced candidate vaccine in clinical development appears to be the National Institutes of Health-developed vaccine. It is likely, assuming no safety concerns arise in future phase 3 studies, that this vaccine will be the first licensed. This is likely to be followed by additional vaccines and effective antiviral drugs to treat and prevent infection over the short term.</p>
