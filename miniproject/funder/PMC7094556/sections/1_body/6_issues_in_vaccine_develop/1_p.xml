<p id="p0060">The ideal vaccine against Zika would require a single dose, be capable of being administered to anyone regardless of age or medical condition (including pregnancy), result in durable (if not lifelong) immunity, prevent medically significant outcomes of infection in both the immediate recipient (eg, GBS) and in the fetus (eg, microcephaly and other congenital conditions), be safe and highly effective, and ideally not require either a cold chain or complex logistics to store and administer. Given the observation of intermittent outbreaks thus far, the ability to store vaccine stockpiles for long periods of time is also necessary. Such a product profile has yet to be achieved for any vaccine. The WHO has defined a more limited target product profile (

 </xref> Vaccine development will also face several challenges, including the lack of an established correlate of protection (in children, adults, and the fetus), current unpredictability and lack of outbreaks, the large number of subclinical infections, the marked variability in clinical manifestations during symptomatic illness, the need to test multiple vulnerable populations, the uncertain effects of prior immunity to ZIKV or other flaviviruses (ie, DENV), and the lack of animal models that recapitulate important features of human disease.
