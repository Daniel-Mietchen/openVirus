 </xref> As we learn more details about these virus-host interactions, the results may provide important information regarding appropriate adjuvant selection for vaccine candidates. Many of the animal models used for ZIKV work have defects in innate immune pathways; therefore, results must be interpreted with caution, as they may not reflect what will occur in humans. Nonhuman primate, guinea pig, and chicken embryo models are also being developed, as are models to study vaccine outcomes in pregnancy.
