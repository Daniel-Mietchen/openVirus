<p id="p0070">The adaptive immune response to flaviviruses (including ZIKV) involves both humoral and cell-mediated components. Neutralizing antibody (considered a major contributor to protective immunity) responses target the E protein and are cross-reactive with other flaviviruses.

 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> This cross-reactivity has been an issue for diagnostic tests in areas where diseases such as dengue fever, West Nile virus, and yellow fever are endemic. In these geographic areas, coinfection with multiple flaviviruses is common and represents a complication in terms of immune response analysis that must be considered during the development and deployment of a ZIKV vaccine.
