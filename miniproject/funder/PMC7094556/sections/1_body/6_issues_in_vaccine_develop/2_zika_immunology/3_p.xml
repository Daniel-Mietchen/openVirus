 </xref> These experiments suggest that humoral immunity can protect against disease and that vaccine-induced immunity can be protective. Despite this, there are several questions that remain unanswered: (1) in DENV, suboptimal antibody responses can enhance disease severity—a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and we do not know if ADE could also be an issue for ZIKV vaccines as it has been in the use of DENV vaccines; (2) vaccine responses are likely to be quite different in individuals who have no prior exposure to Zika or other flaviviruses compared with those with preexisting immunity, and these population groups may require fundamentally different vaccine formulations for both safety and optimal protection; and (3) it is likely that optimal humoral responses to ZIKV will require T-cell help, and a solitary focus on antibody titers as the only immunologic end point may be counterproductive.
