<p id="p0105">Although immune responses to ZIKV have been detected in a large number of larger animals (water buffalo, goats, lions, sheep), nonhuman primates are the model of choice for ZIKV research. Rhesus and cynomolgus macaques are most commonly used. Clinical symptoms include erythema, fever, and lymphadenopathy, and virus can be found in multiple body fluids.

 </xref> New World monkeys have more severe clinical symptoms after flavivirus infection than Old World monkeys and may represent a more restrictive animal model.

 </xref> It should be noted that different ZIKV strains induce different symptoms in different animals, suggesting that human disease manifestations may also be strain-dependent. The nonhuman primate studies have provided important insights into ZIKV immunity, as well as efficacy testing for developmental vaccines. Together with the mouse strains, these animal models will continue to be useful platforms for testing and evaluating ZIKV vaccines.
