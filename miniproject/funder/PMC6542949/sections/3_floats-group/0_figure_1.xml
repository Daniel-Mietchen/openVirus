  <p>Assessment of PRRSV-1 neutralization by virus-imprinted hydrogel MIPs. Template virus was prepared by purification of PRRSV-1 virions by continuous density ultracentrifugation. Pools of gradient fractions 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and individual fractions 
   <bold>(B)</bold> containing the highest infectious titers were selected and virion purity and integrity post-dialysis and inactivation confirmed by electron microscopy 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. Three independently produced batches of MIPs were tested for their ability to neutralize PRRSV-1 infectivity 
   <italic>in vitro</italic>
   <bold>(D)</bold>. A suspension of PRRSV-1 was incubated for 1 h with pAA, pNHMA or pNIPAM MIPs (closed bars). Non-imprinted polymers (NIPs; open bars) and PBS (gray bars) were included as negative controls. Post-incubation, MIP/NIPs were removed by centrifugation and the infectious viral titers in supernatants determined by immunoperoxidase staining of inoculated cell monolayers. The mean infectious PRRSV titers, expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>), for technical triplicates of each treatment condition are presented and error bars represent the standard error of the means. The limit-of-detection of the assays are indicated by dashed horizontal lines.
