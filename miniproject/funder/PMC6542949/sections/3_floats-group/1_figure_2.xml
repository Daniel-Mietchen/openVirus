  <p>Characterization of the virus neutralizing properties of hydrogel MIPs. The specificity of PRRSV-1 virus-imprinted MIPs was assessed by evaluating neutralization of BVDV-1 
   <bold>(A)</bold>. A suspension of BVDV-1 was incubated for 1 h with pAA or pNHMA MIPs (closed bars). Non-imprinted polymers (NIPs; open bars) and PBS (gray bars) were included as negative controls. To assess the effect of incubation time on PRRSV-1 neutralization by MIPs, a suspension of PRRSV-1 was incubated for 60, 30, 15, 7.5, 5, 2.5, and 1.5 min with pNHMA MIPs (closed bars) 
   <bold>(B)</bold>. Sixty minute incubation with NIPs (open bar) and PBS (gray bar) were included as negative controls. To assess the effect of MIP concentration PRRSV-1 neutralization by MIPs, a suspension of PRRSV-1 was incubated for 1 h with a 5-fold serial dilution of pAA or pNHMA MIPs, a neat suspension of NIPs or PBS 
   <bold>(C)</bold>. After incubation, MIPs/NIPs were removed and the infectious viral titers in supernatants determined by immunoperoxidase staining of inoculated cell monolayers. The mean infectious titers, expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID
   <sub>50</sub>), for technical triplicates of each treatment condition are presented and error bars represent the standard error of the means. The limit-of-detection of the assays are indicated by horizontal dashed lines.
