<p>Following polymerization, hydrogels were then individually granulated using a 35 μm sieve and conditioned by washing 100 mg of granulated gel with five 0.4 mL volumes of MilliQ H
 <sub>2</sub>O followed by elution of the template, using five 0.2 mL volumes of 10% (w/v):10% (v/v) SDS:acetic acid (pH 2.8) and another five 0.4 mL volume washes of MilliQ H
 <sub>2</sub>O to remove any residual eluent, and finally with a further two washes with PBS to condition the gels. Each wash step was achieved by vortexing followed by a centrifugation for 3 min at 2419 × g. The PBS conditioned hydrogels were then diluted 1:1 (w/v) in PBS (150 mM, pH 7.2 ± 0.2) and stored at room temperature for virus neutralization study purposes.
