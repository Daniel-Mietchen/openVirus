<p>Non-purified PRRSV-1 was diluted to 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/50μl and mixed with an equal volume of MIP or NIP suspension and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with mixing every 5 min. After incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 1,500 ×

The neutralizing capacity of PRRSV-1 imprinted MIPs was also similarly tested on BVDV-1. An experiment was additionally performed by varying the incubation time of the virus with the MIP, from 1 h to 30, 15, 7.5, 5, 2.5, and 1.5 min. The effect of varying the concentration of the MIPs was tested by performing a serial 1:3 dilution of the MIPs in PBS prior to incubation with virus.
