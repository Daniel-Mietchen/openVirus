<p>Polyacrylamide (pAA) MIP was prepared by mixing 13.5 μL of AA (40% (w/v) solution) with 30 μL of MBAm crosslinker. The solution was then added to 50 μL of purified inactivated PRRSV-1 Olot/91 in PBS (10
 <sup>7.4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml) and 2.5 μL of MilliQ water to give 10
 <sup>7.1</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml of virus template in monomer solution. The solution was vortexed for 30 s, before the catalyst, TEMED (2 μL) and initiator, APS (2 μL) were added to give a final volume of 100 μL. The solution was vortexed for a further 30 s and then purged with nitrogen for 5 min. Polymerization was allowed to occur overnight at room temperature (~22°C).
