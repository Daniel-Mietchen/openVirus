<p>Poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM) was prepared using 14 μL of NIPAM [60% (w/v) solution] as functional monomer, and 30 μL of MBAm as crosslinker. The resulting solution was then added to 50 μL of 10
 <sup>7.4</sup> TCID50/ml of purified inactivated PRRSV-1 Olot/91 in PBS and 2 μL of MilliQ H2O. The solution was vortexed for 30 s. TEMED (2 μL) and initiator, APS (2 μL) were then added to give a final volume of 100 μL. The solution was vortexed for a further 30 s and then purged with nitrogen for 5 min and occurred overnight at room temperature (~22°C).
