<p>Poly-N-hydroxymethylacrylamide (pNHMA) was prepared in a similar fashion using 16 μL of NHMA [48% (w/v) solution] as functional monomer, and 30 μL of MBAm crosslinker, which was then added to 50 μL 10
 <sup>7.4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> /ml of purified inactivated PRRSV-1 Olot/91 in PBS. The solution was vortexed for 30 seconds. TEMED (2 μL) and initiator, APS (2 μL) were then added to give a final volume of 100 μL. The solution was vortexed for a further 30 s and then purged with nitrogen for 5 min and polymerization allowed to occur and left overnight at room temperature (~22°C).
