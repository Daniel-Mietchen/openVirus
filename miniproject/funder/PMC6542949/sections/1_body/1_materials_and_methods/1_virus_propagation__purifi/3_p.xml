<p>Infectious titers were determined by log-fold serial dilution of viruses, which were added to 96 well flat bottom tissue culture plate containing MARC-145 or FBT cells (5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cells/well). The plates were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 4 days. Immunoperoxidase staining was performed to determine the number of infected wells and allow calculation of the median 50% tissue culture infective does (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>; Finney, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>). PRRSV-1 was detected using N-protein specific mAb 1AC7 (Ingenasa, Madrid, Spain) and BVDV-1 with the E2-specific mAb WB214 antibody (APHA Scientific, Addlestone, UK).
