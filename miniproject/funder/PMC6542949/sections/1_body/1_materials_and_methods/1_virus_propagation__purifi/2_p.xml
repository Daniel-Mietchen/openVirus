<p>To produce purified PRRSV-1 virions for molecular imprinting, virus propagation was performed in 850 cm
 <sup>2</sup> roller bottles (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Loughborough). Roller bottles were seeded with 2.2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> MARC-145 cells and incubated in a roller incubator at 37°C. As monolayers approached confluence, the growth medium was replaced with PRRSV-1 Olot/91 virus suspended in 50 ml DMEM medium supplemented with 1% FBS at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1. Four days post-infection the culture supernatant was collected, pooled with a freeze-thawed cell lysate, clarified by centrifugation at 524 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and stored at −80°C. PRRSV-1 virions were purified by continuous density ultracentrifugation. Virus-containing supernatants were further clarified by centrifugation at 4,700 rpm (TX-750 rotor, Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) at 4°C for 1 h. Polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-6000 (Sigma, Poole, UK) was slowly added (7% w/v) under stirring, the mixture incubated at 4°C under slow continuous stirring overnight and precipitated virus collected by centrifugation at 4,700 rpm (TX-750 rotor), 4°C for 30 min. The precipitated virus pellet was resuspended in 7 ml TNE buffer (20 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA) and incubated overnight at 4°C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (4,700 rpm, 4°C for 10 min in a TX-750 rotor). The resulting clarified viral supernatants were pelleted through a sterile 30% sucrose in TNE buffer cushion at 28,000 rpm for 4 h at 4°C using a SW50.1 rotor and XPN-100 Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter). Virus pellets were gently reconstituted in low volumes of TNE buffer before being layered over tubes containing a continuous 15–45% sucrose gradient prepared using a Gradient Master 108 (BioComp, New Brunswick, Canada). Tubes were centrifuged at 28,000 rpm, 4°C for 4 h using a SW50.1 rotor and XPN-100 Ultracentrifuge. 1.5 ml fractions were collected and PRRSV-1 infectious titers determined. Those containing the major part of infectious virus were dialyzed into PBS using Slide-A-Lyzer™ Dialysis Cassettes (Thermo Fisher). Infectious titers were confirmed post-dialysis and virus was inactivated by incubation with 0.1% β-propiolactone (Sigma).
