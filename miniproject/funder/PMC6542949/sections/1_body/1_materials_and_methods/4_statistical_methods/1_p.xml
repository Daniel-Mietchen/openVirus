<p>Data were graphically plotted and statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism v7.03 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, United States). A one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparisons tests was performed on log transformed infectious viral titers. For assessment of the neutralizing capacity of MIPs, mean data from 3 independent batches of MIPs were compared. Datasets for other assays were technical replicates within single experiments.</p>
