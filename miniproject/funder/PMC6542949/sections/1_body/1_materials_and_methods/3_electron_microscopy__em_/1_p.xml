<p>Virus suspensions post-dialysis and post-inactivation were prepared for negative stain electron microscopy as follows. Seven microliters of each sample were incubated at room temperature on glow discharged, Formvar coated EM grids (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) for 2 min. Excess sample was gently removed and following a brief water wash, grids were placed onto 3% aqueous uranyl acetate (Agar Scientific, Stansted, UK) droplets for 1 min. Excess uranyl acetate was removed and grids were allowed to dry before being imaged in a FEI T12 transmission EM at 100 kV with a Tietz F214 camera.</p>
