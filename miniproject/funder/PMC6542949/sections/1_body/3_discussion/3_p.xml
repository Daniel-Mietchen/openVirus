<p>The data from this study has demonstrated a highly effective and specific neutralization of virus infectivity with certain hydrogel-based MIPs. Whilst promising, it is possible that the destructive method used to produce these cavity-containing hydrogel-MIPs leads to the majority of the material comprising redundant unselective particles, devoid of template-specific cavities. Further studies will evaluate virus imprinting of nanoparticle-based MIPs (nanoMIPs) for the efficient production of high bioaffinity materials (Canfarotta et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). MIPs imprinted with virions may be produced according to a variety of methods, giving nanoscale shells with cavity populated surfaces.
