<p>This is the first study to demonstrate that MIPs imprinted with a clinically relevant virus can exert potent antiviral effects, reducing the infectious viral titer recovered to below the LoD of the assay used. Both pAA and pNHMA MIP imprinted with PRRSV-1 were consistently able to neutralize a high quantity of infectious PRRSV-1 (&gt; 4 log reduction). A lack of neutralizing effect on BVDV-1 suggests that a specific binding interaction is taking place between the target molecule (virus, in this case PRRSV-1) and the MIP. The concentration and time dependent effect of neutralization further supports a rapid and specific binding. That there was no discernible difference in the neutralization capacity between pNIPAM MIP and NIP is interesting and suggests an alternative non-specific mechanism for virus neutralization. We have shown previously with protein imprinting that pNIPAM is unable to demonstrate selective protein rebinding in either the MIP or NIP form (Reddy et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). That there is a virus neutralization event in this study, regardless of imprinting taking place, points to the potential toxic nature of pNIPAM. Alternatively, pNIPAM MIPs and NIPs may behave the same because they both hydrophobically bind the viruses. It has been established in this study with an animal virus and by others with bacteriophages (Sankarakumar and Tong, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) that MIPs can successfully bind and neutralize viruses under 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions. Whereas we have demonstrated complete neutralization of PRRSV-1 (&gt; 4 log reduction in titer) with a single MIP dose, in contrast, in the bacteriophage studies, it was observed, that a single dose of MIP was not sufficient to completely neutralize viral infection (~1 log reduction in titer at best).
