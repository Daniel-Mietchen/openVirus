<p>The results of our incubation time trial showing that complete neutralization could be achieved in as little as 2.5 min, is very promising from the perspective of clinical application. However, this would need to be re-assessed in the context of plasma proteins and other potentially interfering molecules that would be present 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. In terms of suitability for 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> testing, further work is needed to ensure suitable biocompatibility of our MIPs. Li et al. (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) produced dopamine-based MIPs that showed no significant cytotoxicity on human hepatoma cells (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) but of particular relevance, was the successful systemic application of acrylamide-based MIPs, to mice without notable adverse effects (Hoshino et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The latter demonstrated the ability of MIPs to bind the cytotoxic peptide melittin, the principle component of bee venom, in the bloodstream of mice, which significantly reduced the mortality and morbidity associated with melittin envenomation.
