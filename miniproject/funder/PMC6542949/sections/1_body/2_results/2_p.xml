<p>The specific binding capacity of the pAA and pNHMA MIPs (both imprinted with PRRSV-1) was tested by comparing their neutralizing effects on PRRSV-1 to the effects on BVDV-1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). Neither pAA MIP nor pNHMA MIP showed significant reduction in BVDV-1 infectious viral titer. pNHMA imprinted with PRRSV-1 was selected for an assay evaluating the effect of decreasing incubation time on the neutralizing capacity of the MIP on PRRSV-1 virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). Significant reduction in infectious viral titer to the assay LoD (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) was demonstrated at 60, 30, 15, 7.5, 5, and 2.5 min incubation time, with no significant differences in effect between the different incubation times. A 1.5 min incubation time caused a significant (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but far less pronounced reduction in infectious titer. With a view to assessing the binding capacity of virus-imprinted MIPs, pAA and pNHMA were selected for a trial of the effect of decreasing MIP concentration on neutralizing capacity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>). Both MIPs showed a broadly similar effect with decreasing concentration, providing complete neutralization of infectious virus to the LoD of the assay at both neat and 1:5 dilutions. Lower concentrations of MIP showed a dose dependent reduction in neutralizing effect, which was more pronounced with the pAA MIP.
