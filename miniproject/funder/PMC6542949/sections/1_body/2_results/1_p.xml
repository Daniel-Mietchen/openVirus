<p>To produce a high quality template for this exploratory study, PRRSV-1 virions were purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1A</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">C</xref>). Whilst infectious virus was detected in all sucrose gradient fractions, the highest titers were detected, as predicted, in the central fractions of the gradient, i.e., pools E and F (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Testing of the individual sucrose gradient fractions confirmed the highest titers in fractions 16–18 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>) and these fractions were dialyzed into PBS and inactivated prior to imprinting. Infectious virus titers post-dialysis and post-inactivation were determined (data not shown) and electron microscopy confirmed the structural integrity of the template virus and the absence of significant cellular debris (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). Three separate assays were performed (each in triplicate) to assess the PRRSV-1 neutralizing properties of independently produced batches of MIPs, all imprinted with purified PRRSV-1 virions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Each of the MIPs (pAA, pNHMA, and pNIPAM) were tested alongside their corresponding NIP. A PBS control treatment was used as a further negative control in each assay. Both pAA MIP and pNHMA MIP produced a highly significant reduction in infectious titer of PRRSV-1 (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) when compared with their respective NIPs and the PBS control, both reducing the infectious titer to the point of or below the limit-of-detection (LoD) of the assay. The titers of virus recovered from pAA NIP and pNHMA NIP treatments were statistically comparable to the PBS control treatment. There was no inter-batch variation in this effect suggesting a reproducible imprinting-related neutralization of virus. However, pNIPAM produced a very similar reduction in infectious viral titer in both its MIP and NIP forms, suggesting that molecular imprinting was not entirely responsible for the neutralization event in the case of this polymer.
