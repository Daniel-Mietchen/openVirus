<p>The rationale behind selection of monomers for this study was based on our previous experiences using acrylamide and functionalized acrylamide monomers for protein imprinting (Reddy et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; El-Sharif et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In our studies to date, we have demonstrated that MIP binding affinity and selectivity for target protein increases in the order N-isopropylacrylamide &lt; acrylamide &lt; N-hydroxymethylacrylamide. This order also represents increasing hydrophilicity and hydrogen bonding capability of the monomer, which we understand to be the predominant non-covalent interaction between template and monomer (El-Sharif et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). In extending the use of monomers to virus imprinting, and based on hydrogen bonding interactions with the hydrophilic envelope glycoproteins of the virus, we therefore anticipated a similar order of imprinting capability. It should be noted that cavity selectivity would be based on a combination of virion shape but also intermolecular interactions between surface proteins and hydrogen bonding functional groups (associated with monomer) within the cavity.
