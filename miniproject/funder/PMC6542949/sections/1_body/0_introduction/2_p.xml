<p>Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs), often referred to as synthetic antibodies, offer an alternative approach to biomolecular and viral recognition. Molecular imprinting involves the formation of a polymer comprising selective cavities based on a molecular or biomolecular template (Mayes and Mosbach, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Hawkins et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). It has been demonstrated that polymerization of monomers in the presence of a molecular target causes the formation of corresponding binding sites in the resulting polymer. MIPs for binding small molecules have been extensively researched and successfully commercialized for the solid phase extraction of drugs and pesticides (Sánchez-González et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) and sample clean-up and improvement of chromatographic analysis (Regal et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In recent years there has been an increase in research activity to imprint larger templates using water-based polymers realizing their application for imprinting of more complex biologicals such as proteins and viruses (Stevenson et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). To date, their potential use has been almost entirely focused on bio-extraction/analysis (Stevenson et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) and sensor applications (Saylan et al., 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). More recently, the MIP technology has been applied as a novel nucleant for protein crystallization (Saridakis et al., 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Reddy et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The strategy relies on the MIP cavities possessing complimentary chemical architecture allowing the template biological to lock into the cavity.
