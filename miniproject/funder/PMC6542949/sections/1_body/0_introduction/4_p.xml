<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> the antiviral activity of MIPs imprinted with the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 1 (PRRSV-1) as a model mammalian virus. PRRSV-1 is an enveloped RNA virus of the 
 <italic>Arteriviridae</italic> family (Kappes and Faaberg, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which causes the most economically important infectious disease affecting the global pig industry (Holtkamp et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Paz, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). PRRSV-1 was also selected since it would allow direct follow-on experimental studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MIPs in pigs, which serve as an excellent large animal model.
