<p>The majority of papers published to date on virus imprinting have been in the development of MIP-based virus diagnostics and sensors (Hayden et al.,

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Malitesta et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Altintas et al.,

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Tancharoen et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Typically, a surface stamping method has been used to imprint for example tobacco mosaic virus, parapoxvirus ovis, and human rhinovirus. The stamping approach produces a thin film directly integrated with a sensor such as electrochemical (Malitesta et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Canfarotta et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), optical (Ahmad et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), or acoustic (Hayden et al., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Uludag et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) devices resulting in a concentration dependent signal upon selective binding of virus. Sankarakumar and Tong (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) performed the first study on the potential antiviral use of MIPs. MIPs imprinted with bacteriophage fr were able to reduce phage titers by approximately 1 log which was significantly greater than the neutralization by non-imprinted polymers (NIPs).
