<p>The complex interplay between the environment, the expanding human population and intensified livestock production systems has led to an apparent increase in the frequency of emergence and re-emergence of viral zoonoses. As demonstrated by the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, there is potential for new and emerging viral infections to cause large epidemics with significant mortality and morbidity. Antibodies which neutralize viral infectivity are critical for immunological protection and this may be exploited in the context of both passive and active immunization. However, there is currently an unmet need to be able to rapidly and inexpensively produce therapeutic antibodies for new/emergent viral diseases.</p>
