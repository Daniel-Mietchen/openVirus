<p>Estimates of the transmission rates for the 2-strain model with BL incidence suggest that MERS-CoV transmission in the three locations is dominated by community and hospital transmission (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s009">S9 Table</xref>). The former statement is in good agreement with a previous study that suggested that MERS-CoV infections are essentially produced through both hospital and community based human-human transmission[

In Madina instead, a majority of the models (BL and NM) point to only one active strain,with strain 2 contributing less than 1% to community human-human transmission, see
