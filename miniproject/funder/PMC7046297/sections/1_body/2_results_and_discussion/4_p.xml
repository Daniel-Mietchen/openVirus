<p>The best model, selected on the basis of its capacity to derive skillful predictions, is the model with the SAT incidence function. We used this model to estimate the basic reproduction number, R
 <sub>0</sub>, the community reproduction number, R
 <sub>C</sub>, and the hospital reproduction number, R
 <sub>H</sub>, for the whole period of data available in those three provinces (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s020">S20 Table</xref>). In all three provinces, R
 <sub>0</sub> is estimated to be always greater than unity. In all three provinces, R
 <sub>H</sub> is found out to be larger than R
 <sub>C</sub>. This implies, MERS-CoV transmission triggered from the hospital setting (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2B</xref>). These estimates agree with some previous values reported in the literature[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], while being a result well supported by other R
 <sub>0</sub> estimates[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, previous modeling attempts to model Saudi Arabia MERS-CoV clinical incidence used only a 1-strain model with BL transmission[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In our case, versions of R
 <sub>0</sub> were also estimated from our BL 1-strain model in those same three provinces (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s021">S21 Table</xref>) and they are in good agreement with the previous values provided by Chowell et al.[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. At the same time, though, 1-strain model show less predictive capacity than their similar two-strain counterparts. To further verify the robustness of these estimates, the temporal evolution of R
 <sub>0</sub>, R
 <sub>C</sub>, and R
 <sub>H</sub> are displayed for different time intervals in the three provinces (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s030">S1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s033">S4</xref> Figs). Considering the best model configurations, we additionally computed the temporal evolution of R
 <sub>0</sub>, R
 <sub>C</sub>, and R
 <sub>H</sub> in the three provinces. Temporal changes in R
 <sub>0</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s030">S1 Fig</xref>) indicate that in most of the predicted weeks, R
 <sub>0</sub> stays well above the epidemic threshold (R
 <sub>0</sub> = 1). This fact is well established from the temporal evolution of R
 <sub>C</sub>, and R
 <sub>H</sub> in those three provinces (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s030">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s031">S2</xref> Figs).
