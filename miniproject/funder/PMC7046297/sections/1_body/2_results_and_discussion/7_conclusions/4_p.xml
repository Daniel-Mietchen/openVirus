<p>We estimated R
 <sub>0</sub> using the best 2-strain model in Riyadh and estimates are in good agreement with the findings of Majumdar et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].The finding that R
 <sub>0</sub> is most of the time above 1 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s030">S1 Fig</xref>) is well supported by some previous estimates in literature[
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Lower contribution of community transmission in R
 <sub>0</sub> (See 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2B</xref>) in Riyadh and Macca suggests that MERS-CoV transmission is triggered from hospital settings in those provinces. Most interestingly, in some forecasted periods, R
 <sub>0</sub> attains large values, a fact that denotes that a rapid propagation among the susceptible population is indeed possible. More worrisome is the range of values into which R
 <sub>0</sub> moves, most of the time above 1 and below 2,5, a fact that makes it a dangerous infection in terms of silent and constant potential population spread. Community reproduction number R
 <sub>C</sub> well above unity (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s033">S4 Fig</xref>) in most of the predictive weeks indicate that in a near future a large outbreak may be possible in those provinces. Out-of-fit predictions for the next season totals suggest that there is a high possibility of larger outbreaks in Macca and Riyadh. However, our results instead indicate that there is a very low possibility of larger outbreaks in Madina. The fact that this outbreak did not happen in 2017–2018 does not preclude what may occur in the forthcoming seasons. Under such a scenario, authorities and international health agencies should prepare and actively work towards the prompt implementation of cheap albeit efficient computational platforms ready to assist in the simulation of how a potential outbreak might evolve in the region. More so, given the high probability that another large MERS-CoV outbreak occurs in the Arabian Peninsula or nearby countries. Migration may also play a major role for increased transmission in the provinces of Saudi Arabia and this feature should be properly accounted for in future model configurations. In summary, our findings suggest that in a majority of provinces a single MERS-CoV strain is currently active, conversely to the situation in Riyadh. However, in the near future, it is also possible that more general MERS-CoV transmission occurs from multiple strains in other provinces of Saudi Arabia.
