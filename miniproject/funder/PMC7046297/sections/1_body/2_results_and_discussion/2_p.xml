<p>For each particular region in this study, two strain models are compared among themselves and also with regard to their single-strain counterparts in order to determine the best model (i.e. single, two-strain or a combination of other two-strain models). Results show that in the three locations, 2-strain models provide a better fitting to cumulative cases in comparison to their single strain counterparts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008065.g002">Fig 2</xref>). AIC and BIC values for the 2-strain models suggest that the best model is region specific (best model for Riyadh is a 2-strain model with BL incidence, whereas in Macca and Madina the best models are both the model with a NM incidence function and the one incorporating super-spreaders, respectively; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s019">S19 Table</xref>). We also compare our 2-strain models with a 2-strain model with variable Zoonotic transmission (SI Eq. A2). Comparing AIC and BIC values, we found that the models with variable Zoonotic transmission (SI Eq. A2) did not improve all the previous results (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s019">S19 Table</xref>). Therefore, the best model among all 2-strain models cannot be determined solely from their goodness-of-fit comparison. For this reason, we additionally compared all the two-strain models on the basis of their respective prediction skills. Forecasts for the three models in Riyadh suggest that, a majority of the times, the 2-strain model with SAT incidence can better predict the three targets in comparison to the other two competing 2-strain models (e.g. note that for SAT the average of the mean absolute error, MAE, for peak week is 11.6, whereas for peak maximum is 24.83 and for season totals 55.62) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2A</xref>). For comparison, we also provide predictions in the province of Riyadh of the three targets using the model with super-spreaders. However, prediction with super-spreaders did not improve at all the former results obtained for Riyadh (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008065.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2A</xref>). For Madina, both the peak week and season totals are better predicted by the same SAT 2-strain model (i.e. MAE average for peak week being 14.5 and 9.33 for season totals; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">S22 Table</xref>). However, when predicting the peak maximum in Madina, clearly the best model is the 2-strain model with the NM incidence function (i.e. MAE average for peak maximum being 2.62; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">S22 Table</xref>). For Macca, except for the peak week, the other two targets, namely peak maximum and season totals are better predicted with the 2-strain model with BL incidence (i.e. MAE average of 7.08 for peak maximum and of 63.42 for season totals, respectively; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">S22 Table</xref>). For peak week in Macca, again a better prediction is achieved by the 2-strain model with SAT incidence (i.e. MAE average for peak week being 23.9, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008065.s022">S22 Table</xref>).
