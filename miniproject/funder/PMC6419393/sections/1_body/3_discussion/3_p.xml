<p id="Par35">Regardless of the difference in cfDNA levels between SD and non-SD groups, the underlying mechanism and its role in the SD pathogenesis are not clear. Apoptosis being the major source of cfDNA in bloodstream [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and its presence in various tissues from fatal dengue patients suggests involvement of apoptosis in SD pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The apoptotic microvascular endothelial cells probably play roles in vascular permeability—a hallmark of SD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The level of peripheral mononuclear cell apoptosis around defervescence also well correlated with SD in children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], TGF-beta [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], TNF-alpha, nitric oxide and NS1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] related to apoptosis were reported at increased levels in SD patients’ samples, further supporting the role of apoptosis in SD and cfDNA as its proxy indicator. Undoubtedly, the knowledge on the source of this cfDNA would aid in the further understanding of pathogenesis too.
