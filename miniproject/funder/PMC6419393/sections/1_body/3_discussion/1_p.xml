<p id="Par33">Here, we report the potential of plasma cfDNA as an early predictor of SD along with clinical and laboratory findings in our cohorts. Identification of reliable biomarkers/predictors is crucial in dengue because neither the sole dependency on warning signs described in WHO guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], nor other proposed algorithms are sufficient to predict SD during the early stage of illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].
