<p id="Par34">We found significantly elevated levels of cfDNA (6–48 h before defervescence) in dengue patients who later progressed to SD compared to those who did not. More precisely, in predicting SD, the acute cfDNA alone exhibited a good sensitivity and specificity with an AUC &gt; 0.7 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) which is considered as acceptable predictive performance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Still, warning signs are widely used in recognizing patients at risk of developing SD despite their subjective nature (some signs) and late appearance in the disease course [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This halts early SD detection and timely management, and is also criticized for over-estimation of SD [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In that sense, cfDNA is a simple tool, likely makes the SD prediction more practical and explicit as anticipated in our study previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, the use of cfDNA in combination with other early signs probably further enhance the SD prediction. Several candidates have been studied to explore severity predictors in dengue such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tryptase and chymase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-b), and VEGF receptor-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], cytokines (IL-10, IFN-γ) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and plasma IgE levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For instance, we recently reported the ratio of DENV specific IgE and total IgE (S/T ratio) as a potential candidate predictor (sensitivity/specificity, 75%/68%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In our preliminary analysis, another candidate biomarker TGF-b-induced protein (TGFBIp) has also shown some promising results (data not shown). Therefore, the combination of cfDNA with other potential candidate biomarkers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] or clinical signs is worthwhile when applied to recently proposed prediction models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Yet, none of these this combination was investigated in our cohort partly due to the small number of samples in the severe group, as we enrolled patients at early state which resulted into fewer patients in the SD group.
