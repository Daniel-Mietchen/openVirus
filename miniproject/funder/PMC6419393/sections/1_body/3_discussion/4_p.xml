<p id="Par36">We also found a significant correlation between decreasing platelet count and increasing cfDNA concentration in dengue patients. Probably, it is associated with binding and subsequent platelet activation by DENV as reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Platelet activation is believed to release mitochondria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], leading to elevated mitochondrial DNA in plasma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], which in turn perhaps contributed to high cfDNA levels in dengue patients with decreasing platelet counts. Mitochondrial DNA released from platelet is also a potent inflammatory trigger which causes cytokines release and systematic inflammation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This pro-inflammatory response might also play a role in dengue clinical outcomes.
