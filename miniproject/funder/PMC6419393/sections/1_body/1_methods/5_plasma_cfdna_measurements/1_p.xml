<p id="Par26">The cfDNA levels of acute-phase plasma samples were measured by Quant-iT™ PicoGreen
 <sup>®</sup> dsDNA Reagent and Kits (Invitrogen, USA) with some modifications [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. With PicoGreen, dsDNA can be quantitated with very minimal interference (&lt; 10%) by single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or RNA in the sample [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Briefly, 3 μL of patient’s plasma was added into each micro-well containing 100 μL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) followed by addition of 100 μL of PicoGreen working solution. Reaction mixture was dark incubated for 5 min and fluorescence was measured (at 485 nm excitation, 535 nm emission wavelengths) using a fluorescence microplate reader (Perkin Elmer Wallac 1420). Standard curve (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Fig. S1) was created with known concentrations of Lambda DNA prepared in TE, 3 μL of which was added to well containing 97 μL TE and 3 μL healthy plasma. Healthy plasma (3 μL) in TE buffer (100 μL) was used as background. To resemble the plasma sample physiology, pooled plasma from nine healthy donors (with negligible DNA concentration) was used in TE buffer to prepare the standard curve. Each assay was performed in duplicate. Perfect linearity of the standard curve was observed in a range of 6.9–443.4 ng/mL. Concentrations of unknown plasma samples were determined by using the linear equation.
