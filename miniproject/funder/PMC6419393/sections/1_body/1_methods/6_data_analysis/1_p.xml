<p id="Par27">Patient’s demographic, clinical and laboratory data were entered into spread sheet (master file) and underwent data cleaning/verification. Data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism software version 6.05. The cfDNA levels of each severity group were presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). Differences between two groups were analyzed by using Mann–Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test. Cell counts and cfDNA concentration data were also subjected to Spearman’s correlation test. A 
 <italic>p</italic> value &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant for all analyses. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was made and the area under ROC curve (AUC) was analysed to determine the discriminatory performance of cfDNA in predicting SD.
