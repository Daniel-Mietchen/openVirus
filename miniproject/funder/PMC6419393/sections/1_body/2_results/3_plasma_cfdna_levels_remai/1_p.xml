 <italic>p </italic>= 0.0493) in the SD group [median (IQR): 61.4 ng/mL (38.3–110.5)] compared to the non-SD group [35.4 ng/mL (24.4–51.6)] (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Plasma cfDNA had an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55–0.88;

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). With a cut-off value &gt; 36.85 ng/mL, cfDNA demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 87.5% (95% CI: 47.4%–99.7%) and 54.7% (40.4%–68.4%) respectively, in predicting SD among the total dengue patients.
