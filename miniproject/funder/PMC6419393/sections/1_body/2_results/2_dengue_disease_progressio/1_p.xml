<p id="Par29">Of the eligible dengue patients (n = 61) included in the present study, eight patients developed severe manifestations (shock syndrome) while the rest 53 remained as non-SD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) during the in-patient follow up. Detailed clinical information of each patient has been provided in supplementary materials as Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>. Among the SD patients, defervescence was observed after 4.3 days (95% CI: 3.6–5.0; range: 3–5 days) of fever, and all eight patients developed shock between 3 and 6 days (mean [95% CI]: 4.8 days [3.7–5.4]) after the fever onset. The average time interval between defervescence and shock was 17.2 h (95% CI: 9.2–25.2; range: 8–26 h). All shock patients but one had secondary infection, and the shock patient with primary infection had DENV-1 and -3 co-infection.
