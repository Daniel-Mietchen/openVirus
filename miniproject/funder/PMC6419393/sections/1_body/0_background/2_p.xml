<p id="Par18">No specific treatment is currently available for dengue and the recently licensed vaccine has limited efficacy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, its geographical expansion has resulted in increased frequency and magnitude of epidemics and the escalating number of SD patients led to a huge economic burden worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although the use of ‘warning signs’ has contributed significantly in clinical management, it is difficult to accurately recognize SD patients in early phase of disease using these warnings signs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Apparently, the use of warning signs as proxy indicators for admission has added extra burden to the hospitals, and more importantly, some dengue patients without warning signs may also progress to SD—a serious drawback of this system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, from the patient management point of view, early prediction of dengue severity could be a game changer in reducing hospital burden and mortality while enhancing the quality of care to the severe patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Unfortunately, there is no reliable routine prognostic test available yet [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There have been growing efforts made on the discovery of predictors based on severity biomarkers alone or in combination with dengue clinical signs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], however these are either not validated clinically or the evidence is not adequate for clinical application [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].
