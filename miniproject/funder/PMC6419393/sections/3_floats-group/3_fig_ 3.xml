  <p>Correlation between plasma cfDNA level and leukocyte or platelet count in dengue patients. Leukocyte count (
   <bold>a</bold>) or platelet count (
   <bold>b</bold>) was plotted against the plasma cfDNA concentration (ng/mL) to determine their correlation by Spearman’s method. Correlation coefficient (r) of 1 or − 1 indicates a perfect correlation between two variables, while r = 0 indicates no correlation. In the scatter plot graph, data is presented as correlation line (bold straight line) and 95% confidence interval (CI) (shaded area). cfDNA concentration is expressed on a log scale (X-axis). Statistically significant correlation was considered, when 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. Leukocyte and platelet count data were missing for 4 cases, and hence the correlation was performed using data from 57 cases
