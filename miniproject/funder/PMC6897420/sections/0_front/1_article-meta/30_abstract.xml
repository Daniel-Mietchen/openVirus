 <p>Seasonal influenza outbreaks cause millions of infections and tens of thousands of deaths in the United States each year. Forecasting the track of an influenza season can help public health officials, business leaders, and the general public decide how to respond to an ongoing or emerging outbreak. Our team assembled over 20 unique forecasting models for seasonal influenza and combined them together into a single “ensemble” model. We made predictions of the 2017/2018 influenza season, each week sending real-time forecasts to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the 2017/2018 influenza season, one of the largest seasonal outbreaks in the last 15 years, our ensemble model performed better on average than all individual forecast models in the ensemble. Based on results from this study, the CDC used forecasts from our ensemble model in public communication and internal reports in the subsequent 2018/2019 influenza season.</p>
