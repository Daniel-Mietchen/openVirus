<p>Using the results from the training period, we estimated weights for the chosen 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> ensemble model that would be used for the 2017/2018 real-time forecasting. The 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model assigned non-negligible weight (greater than 0.001) to 8 models for week-ahead targets and 6 models for seasonal targets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007486.g003">Fig 3</xref>). For week-ahead targets, the highest non-zero weight (0.42) was given to the 
 <monospace>Delphi-DeltaDensity1</monospace> model. For seasonal targets, the highest weight (0.26) was given to the 
 <monospace>LANL-DBM</monospace> model. In the weights for the seasonal targets, six models shared over 99.9% of the weight, with none of the six having less than 0.11 weight. All four research teams had at least one model with non-negligible weight in the chosen model.
