<p>We pre-specified five candidate ensemble approaches prior to any systematic evaluation of ensemble component performance in previous seasons and prior to the 2017/2018 season (Table A in

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007486.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The pre-specified ensemble approaches all relied on taking weighted averages of the component models, including two seasonal baseline components, using a predictive density stacking approach (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Methods</xref>). They ranged in complexity from simple (every component is assigned a single weight) to more complex (components have different weights depending on the target and region being forecasted, see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Methods</xref>). The FSNetwork Target-Type Weights (
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace>) ensemble model, a medium-complexity approach, outperformed all other multi-model ensembles and components in the training phase by a slim margin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007486.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model built weighted model averages using 40 estimated weights, one for each model and target-type (week-ahead and seasonal) combination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007486.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In the training period, consisting of the seven influenza seasons prior to 2017/2018, this model achieved a leave-one-season-out cross-validated average forecast score of 0.406, compared with the FSNetwork Target Weights (
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TW</monospace>) model with a score of 0.404, the FSNetwork Constant Weights (
 <monospace>FSNetwork-CW</monospace>) model with a score of 0.400, and the FSNetwork Target-Region Weights (
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TRW</monospace>) model with a score of 0.400 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007486.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Prior to the start of the 2017-18 FluSight Challenge, we chose the target-type weights model as the model that would be submitted in real-time to the CDC during the 2017/2018 season. This choice was based on the pre-specified criteria of the chosen model having the highest score of any approach in the cross-validated training phase [
