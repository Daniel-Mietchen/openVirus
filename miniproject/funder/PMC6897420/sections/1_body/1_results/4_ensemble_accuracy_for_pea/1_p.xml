<p>Forecast accuracy around the time of peak incidence is an important indicator of how useful a given model can be in real-time for public health decision-makers. To this end, we evaluated the scores of the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> ensemble model in each region during the 13 weeks centered around the peak week (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007486.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Forecast scores of the peak percentage 6, 5, and 4 weeks before the peak week were lower than in past seasons, assigning on average 0.05, 0.06, and 0.05 probability to the eventually observed value, respectively. However, at and after the peak week this probability was over 0.70, quite a bit higher than average accuracy in past seasons.
