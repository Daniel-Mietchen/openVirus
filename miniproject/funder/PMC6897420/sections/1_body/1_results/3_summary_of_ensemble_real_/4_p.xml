<p>In the 2017/2018 season, the top models from each contributing research team showed considerable variation in performance across the different prediction targets and regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007486.g005">Fig 5</xref>). However, the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model showed lower variability in performance than other methods. Across all 77 pairs of targets and regions, the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model was the only one of the six selected models that never had the lowest forecast score. Additionally, it only had the second lowest score twice. While our ensemble model did not always have the best score in each target-region pair, its consistency and low variability across all combinations secured it the top average score.
