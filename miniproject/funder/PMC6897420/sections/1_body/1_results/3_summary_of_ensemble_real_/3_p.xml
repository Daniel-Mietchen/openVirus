<p>The 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model showed a higher performance in both training and testing phase than the CDC baseline ensemble model, 
 <monospace>FluSight-unweighted_avg</monospace>. This multi-model ensemble contained forecasts from 28 models submitted to the FluSight competition in 2017/2018. While some of these 28 models submitted to the CDC were or contained versions of the 21 models in our performance-based FluSight Network multi-model ensemble, over two-thirds of the models submitted to the CDC were not represented in the FluSight Network components. In 2017/2018, the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model earned an average forecast score of 0.337 while the 
 <monospace>FluSight-unweighted_avg</monospace> model earned an average forecast score of 0.321 (
