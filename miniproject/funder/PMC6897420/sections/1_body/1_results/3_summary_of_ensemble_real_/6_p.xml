<p>According to the probability integral transform metric [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007486.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model was well-calibrated for all four week-ahead targets (Fig B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007486.s001">S1 Text</xref>). It was slightly less well-calibrated for peak performance, and showed indications of having too narrow predictive distributions over the 2017/2018 season. Over the entire training period prior to the 2017/2018 season, the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model calibration results suggested that in general the model was a bit conservative, with often a too wide predictive distribution (Fig C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007486.s001">S1 Text</xref>).
