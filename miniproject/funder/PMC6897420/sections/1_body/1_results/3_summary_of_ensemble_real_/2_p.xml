<p>In spite of these unusual dynamics, the chosen 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> ensemble showed the best performance among all component and ensemble models during the 2017/2018 season. In particular, we selected the single best component model from each team in the training phase stage and the 
 <monospace>FluSight-unweighted_avg</monospace> model (the unweighted average of all models submitted to the CDC) to compare with the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007486.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The results from 2017/2018 were consistent with and confirmed conclusions drawn from the training period, where the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model outperformed all other ensemble models and components. The 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model had the highest average score in the training period (0.406) as well as the highest average score in the 2017/2018 test season (0.337). This strong and consistent performance by the chosen 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> ensemble model is noteworthy given that our team identified this model prospectively, before the season began, essentially wagering that this ensemble model would have the best performance of any model in the 2017/2018 season, which it did. The 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model consistently outperformed a simpler ensemble model and the seasonal average model across all weeks of the 2017/2018 season (Fig F in
