<p>The 2017/2018 influenza season in the U.S. exhibited features that were unlike that of any season in the past 15 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007486.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). As measured by wILI percentages at the national level, the 2017/2018 season was on par with the other two highest peaks on record since 1997: the 2003/2004 season and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. In some regions, for example HHS Region 2 (New York and New Jersey) and HHS Region 4 (southeastern states), the peak wILI for the 2017/2018 season was more than 20% higher than previously observed peaks. Because all forecasting models rely, to some extent, on future trends mimicking observed patterns in the past, the anomalous dynamics in 2017/2018 posed a challenging “test season” for all models, including the new ensembles.
