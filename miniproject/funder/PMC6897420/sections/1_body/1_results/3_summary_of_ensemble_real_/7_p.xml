<p>A new ensemble using the same components but taking into account their performance in the 2017/2018 season would have different weights. Components that received substantial weight in the original ensemble but did particularly poorly in the 2017/2018 season saw the largest drop in weight (Fig D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007486.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Overall, three components were added to the list of six existing components that received more than 0.001 weight for seasonal targets: 
 <monospace>CU-EAKFC_SEIRS</monospace>, 
 <monospace>CU-EKF_SEIRS</monospace>, and 
 <monospace>ReichLab-SARIMA2</monospace>. One component (
 <monospace>ReichLab-SARIMA2</monospace>) was added to the list of eight existing components that received more than 0.001 weight for week-ahead targets.
