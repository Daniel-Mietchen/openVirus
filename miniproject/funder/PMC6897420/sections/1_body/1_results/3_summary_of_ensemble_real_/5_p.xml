<p>Despite being optimized for high forecast score values, the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> showed robust performance in the 2017/2018 season across other performance metrics that measure forecast calibration and accuracy. Overall, the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model ranked second among selected models in both RMSE and average bias, behind the 
 <monospace>LANL-DBM</monospace> model (Fig A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007486.s001">S1 Text</xref>). For example, during the scoring period of interest across all regions in the 2017/2018 season, the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> modelâ€™s point estimates for season onset were on average less than half a week after the true value (average bias = 0.38 week) and for 1-week ahead ILI the estimates were underestimated by less than one-quarter of a percentage point (average bias = -0.23 ILI%).
