<p>Forecasting targets for the CDC FluSight challenge are based on the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). ILINet is a syndromic surveillance system that publishes the weekly percentage of outpatient visits due to influenza-like illness, weighted based on state populations (wILI) from a network of more than 2,800 providers. Estimates of wILI are reported weekly by the CDC’s Influenza Division for the United States as a whole as well as for each of the 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions. Reporting of ‘current’ wILI is typically delayed by approximately one to two weeks from the calendar date of a doctor’s office visit as data are collected and processed, and each weekly publication can also include revisions to prior reported values if new data become available. Larger revisions have been shown to be associated with decreased forecast accuracy [
