<p>Following FluSight challenge convention, to focus model evaluation on periods of time that are more relevant for public health decision-making, only certain weeks were included when calculating the average log scores for each target. Forecasts of season onset were included for each region up to six weeks after the observed onset week within that region. Forecasts of peak week and peak intensity were included for all weeks in a region-season until the week in which the wILI measure dropped below the regional baseline level for the final time. Week-ahead forecasts for each region-season were included starting four weeks prior to the onset week through three weeks after the wILI goes below the regional baseline for the final time. All weeks were included for region-seasons that did not have high enough incidence to define a season onset week.</p>
