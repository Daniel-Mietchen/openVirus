<p>Submitted forecasts were evaluated using the modified log score used by the CDC in their forecasting challenge, which provides a simultaneous measure of forecast accuracy and precision. The log score for a probabalistic forecast 
 <italic>m</italic> is defined as log 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>z</italic>*|
 <bold>x</bold>), where 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>z</italic>|
 <bold>x</bold>) is the predicted density function from model 
 <italic>m</italic> for some target 
 <italic>Z</italic>, conditional on some data 
 <bold>x</bold> and 
 <italic>z</italic>* is the observed value of the target 
 <italic>Z</italic>.
