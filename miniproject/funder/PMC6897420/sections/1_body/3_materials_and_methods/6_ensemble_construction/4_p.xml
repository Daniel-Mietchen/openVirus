Weights for components were trained using a leave-one-season-out cross-validation approach on component forecasts from the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 seasons. Given the limited number of seasons available for cross-validation, we used component model forecast scores from all other seasons as training data to estimate weights for a given test season, even if the training season occured chronologically after the test season of interest.
