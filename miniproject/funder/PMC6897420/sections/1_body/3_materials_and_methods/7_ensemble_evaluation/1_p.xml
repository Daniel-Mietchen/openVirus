<p>Based on the results of the cross-validation study, we selected one ensemble model as the official FluSight Network entry to the CDCâ€™s 2017/2018 influenza forecasting challenge. The criteria for this choice were pre-specified in September of 2017, prior to conducting the cross-validation experiments [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007486.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Component weights for the 
 <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model were estimated using all seven seasons of component model forecasts. In real-time over the course of the 2017/2018 influenza season, participating teams submitted weekly forecasts from each component, which were combined using the estimated weights into the FluSight Network model and submitted to the CDC. The component weights for the submitted model remained unchanged throughout the course of the season.
