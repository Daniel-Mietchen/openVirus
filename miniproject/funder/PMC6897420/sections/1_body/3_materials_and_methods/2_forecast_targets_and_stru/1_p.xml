<p>As the goal was to submit our ensemble forecast in real-time to the CDC FluSight forecasting challenge, we adhered to guidelines and formats set forth by the challenge in determining forecast format. A season typically consists of forecast files generated weekly for 33 weeks, starting with epidemic week 43 (EW43) of one calendar year and ending with EW18 of the following year. Every week in a year is classified into an “MMWR week” (ranging from 1 to 52 or 53, depending on the year) using a standard definition established by the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007486.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Forecasts for the CDC FluSight challenge consist of seven targets: three seasonal targets and four short-term or ‘week-ahead’ targets. The seasonal targets consist of season onset (defined as the first MMWR week where wILI is at or above baseline and remains above it for three consecutive weeks), season peak week (defined as the MMWR week of maximum wILI), and season peak percentage (defined as the maximum wILI value for the season). The short-term targets consist of forecasts for wILI values 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks ahead of the most recently published data. With the two-week reporting delay in the publication of ILINet, these short-term forecasts are for the level of wILI occurring 1 week prior to the week the forecast is made, the current week, and the two weeks after the forecast is made. Forecasts are created for all targets for the US as a whole and for each of the 10 HHS Regions (
