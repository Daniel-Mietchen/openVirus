<p>For all targets, forecasts consist of probability distributions over bins of possible values for the target. For season onset and peak week, forecast bins consist of individual weeks within the influenza season, with an additional bin for onset week corresponding to a forecast of no onset. For short-term targets and peak intensity, forecast bins consist of levels of observed wILI rounded to the nearest 0.1% (the level of resolution for ILINet publicly reported by the CDC) up to 13%. Formally, the bins are defined as [0.00, 0.05), [0.05, 0.15), â€¦, [12.85, 12.95), [12.95, 100].</p>
