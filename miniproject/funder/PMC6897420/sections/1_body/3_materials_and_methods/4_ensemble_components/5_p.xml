<p>It is important to distinguish ensemble components from standalone forecasting models. Standalone models are optimized to be as accurate as possible on their own by, among other things, using proper smoothing. Ensemble components might be designed to be accurate on their own, or else they may be included merely to complement weak spots in other components, i.e. to reduce the ensemble’s variance. Because we had sufficient cross-validation data to estimate ensemble weights for several dozen components, some groups contributed non-smoothed “complementing” components for that purpose (Table A in
