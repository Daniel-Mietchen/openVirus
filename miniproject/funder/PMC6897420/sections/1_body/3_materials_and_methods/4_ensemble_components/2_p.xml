<p>For each influenza season, teams submitted weekly forecasts from epidemic week 40 (EW40) of the first year through EW20 of the following year, using standard CDC definitions for epidemic week [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007486.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007486.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. If a season contained EW53, forecasts were submitted for that week as well. In total, teams submitted 233 individual forecast files representing forecasts across the seven influenza seasons. Once submitted, the forecast files were not updated except in four instances where explicit programming bugs had resulted in numerical issues in the forecast. Teams were explicitly discouraged from re-tuning or adjusting their models for different prior seasons to avoid issues with over-fitting.
