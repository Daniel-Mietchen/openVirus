<p>To provide training data for the ensemble, four teams submitted between 1 and 9 components each, for a total of 21 ensemble components. Teams submitted out-of-sample forecasts for the 2010/2011 through 2016/2017 influenza seasons. These models and their performance are evaluated in separate work [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007486.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Teams constructed their forecasts in a prospective fashion, using only data that were available at the time of the forecast. For some data sources (e.g., wILI prior to the 2014/2015 influenza season), data as they were published at the time were not available. In such cases, teams were still allowed to use those data sources while making best efforts to only use data available at the time forecasts would have been made.
