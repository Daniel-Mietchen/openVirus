<p>It should be noted that ensemble weights are not a measure of ensemble components’ standalone accuracy nor do they measure the overall contribution of a particular model to the ensemble accuracy. For example, consider a setting where a component that is identical (or highly similar) to an existing ensemble component with weight 
 <italic>π</italic>* is added to a given ensemble. The accuracy of the original ensemble can be maintained in a number of ways, including (a) assigning each copy a weight of 
 <italic>π</italic>*/2, or (b) assigning the first copy a weight of 
 <italic>π</italic>* and the second copy a weight of 0. In both of these weightings, at least one high accuracy ensemble component would be assigned significantly lower weight due to the presence of another identical or similar component. In fact, we saw this in our results since the 
 <monospace>Delphi-Stat</monospace> model was the top-performing component model but was a linear combination of other Delphi models. It received zero weight in all of our ensemble specifications. Additionally, inclusion of components with small weights can have a large impact on an ensemble’s forecast accuracy.
