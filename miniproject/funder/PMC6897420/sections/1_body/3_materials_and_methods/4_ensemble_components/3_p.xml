<p>Teams utilized a variety of methods and modeling approaches in the construction of their component model submissions (Table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007486.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Seven of the components used a compartmental structure (i.e. Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) to model the disease transmission process, while other components used more statistical approaches to directly model the observed wILI curve. Six of the components explicitly incorporated additional data sources beyond previous wILI data, including weather data and Google search data. Two components were constructed to represent a seasonal baseline based on historical data only.
