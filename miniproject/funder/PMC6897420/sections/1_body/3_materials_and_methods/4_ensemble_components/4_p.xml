<p>Additionally, we obtained the predictive distributions from the CDC-created “unweighted average” model. This ensemble combined all forecast models received by the CDC in real-time in the 2015/2016 (14 models), 2016/2017 (28 models), and 2017/2018 (28 models) seasons [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007486.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. These included models that are not part of the collaborative ensemble effort described in this manuscript, although some variations on the components presented here were also submitted to the CDC. Including this model allowed us to compare our ensemble accuracy to the model used by the CDC in real-time during these three seasons.
