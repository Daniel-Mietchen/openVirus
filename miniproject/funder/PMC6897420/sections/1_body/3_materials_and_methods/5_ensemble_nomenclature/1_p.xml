<p>There are several different ways that the term ensemble has been used in practice. In this paper, we use the phrases ‘multi-model ensemble’ or ‘ensemble model’ interchangably to refer to models that represent mixtures of separate component models. However, a clear taxonomy of ensemble modeling might distinguish three distinct tiers of ensemble models. First, single-model ensemble methodologies can be used to fit models and make predictions. Examples of these approaches include the component models from Columbia University that use, e.g. Ensemble Average Kalman Filtering, to take weighted averages of model realizations to form predictive distributions (Table A in

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Methods</xref>). Among the models described in this work, one component model (
 <monospace>Delphi-Stat</monospace>) is a multi-model ensemble and all of the FluSight Network models are also multi-model ensembles (Table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007486.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Third, the term superensemble has been used for models that combine components that are themselves ensembles (either multi-model or single-model) [
