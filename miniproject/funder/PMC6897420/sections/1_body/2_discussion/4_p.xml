<p>As shown by the FluSight Network Target-Type Weights component weighting structure presented above (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007486.g003">Fig 3</xref>), no one model was ever used by the multi-model ensemble as the best answer and the ensemble instead relied on a combination of components to optimize performance. The ensemble assigned non-negligible weight to 11 of the 21 models available and the updated ensemble weights including the 2017/2018 performance would have added one model to that list. This work highlights the importance of incorporating different models into a single forecast based on past performance. Moving forward, it will be vital to develop and sustain a robust ecosystem of forecasting models for infectious disease that represent many different methods, data sources, and model structures. In particular, we see opportunities in developing incorporating pathogen-specific data into models [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007486.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007486.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The inclusion of mutiple forecasting approaches and use of past performance in determining an ensemble structure reduces the risk of relying on a single probabilistic forecast and therefore strengthens the case for incorporating forecasts into real-time decision-making.
