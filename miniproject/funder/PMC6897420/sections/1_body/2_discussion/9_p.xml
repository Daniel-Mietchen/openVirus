<p>With the promise of new, real-time data sources and continued methodological innovation for both component models and multi-model ensemble approaches, there is good reason to believe that infectious disease forecasting will continue to mature and improve in upcoming years. As modeling efforts become more commonplace in the support of public health decision-making worldwide, it will be critical to develop infrastructure so that multiple models can more easily be compared and combined. This will facilitate reproducibility and archiving of single-model forecasts, the creation of multi-model ensemble forecasts, and the communication of the forecasts and their uncertainty to decision-makers and the general public. Efforts such as this, that emphasize real-time testing and evaluation of forecasting models and facilitate close collaboration between public health officials and modeling researchers, are critical to improving our understanding of how best to use forecasts to improve public health response to seasonal and emerging epidemic threats.</p>
