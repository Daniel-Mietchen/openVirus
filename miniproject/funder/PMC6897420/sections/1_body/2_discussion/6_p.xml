<p>One risk of complex ensemble approaches is that they may be “overfit” to the data, resulting in models that place too much emphasis on one approach in a particular scenario or setting. This is a particular concern in applications such as this one, where the number of observations is fairly limited (hundreds to thousands of observations instead of hundreds of thousands). Against this backdrop, the relative simplicity of the FluSight Network Target-Type weights model is a strength, as there is less danger of these models being overfit to the data. Additionally, approaches that use regularization or penalization to reduce the number of effective parameters estimated by a particular model have been shown to have some practical utility in similar settings and may also have a role to play in future ensembles for infectious disease forecasting [
