<p>Even in a very unusual influenza season, the multi-model ensemble approach presented here outperformed all components overall and did not see a large reduction in overall performance compared to performance during the training seasons. This bodes well for the long-term robustness of models such as this one, compared to single components that show higher variability in performance across specific years, regions, and targets. During the training and test phases, the weighted ensemble approaches outperformed two equal weight ensembles: one constructed based on FluSight Network models presented here (Table A in
