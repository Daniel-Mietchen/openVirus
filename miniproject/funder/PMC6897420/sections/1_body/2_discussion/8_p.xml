<p>Even though we have shown the value in building collaborations between research teams to develop ensemble forecasts, these efforts largely rely on bespoke technological solutions. This challenge is not specific to infectious disease forecasting, but covers many areas of quantitative science. For this project, we built a highly customized solution that relied on GitHub, Travis Continuous Integration server, unix scripts, and model code in R, python, and MatLab. In all, the seven seasons of training data consisted of about 95MB and over 1.5m rows of data per model and about 2GB of forecast data for all models combined. The real-time forecasts for the 2017/2018 season added about 300MB of data. The framework developed by CDC directly facilitated this work by identifying targets, establishing common formats, and establishing a space for this collaboration. To build on this success and move ensemble infectious disease forecasting into a more generalizable, operational phase, technological advancements are necessary to both standardize data sources, model structures, and forecast formats as well as develop modeling tools that can facilitate the development and implementation of component and ensemble models.</p>
