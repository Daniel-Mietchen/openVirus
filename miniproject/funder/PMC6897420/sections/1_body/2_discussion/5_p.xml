<p>While the multi-model ensemble approach described here works well for seasonal pathogens with multiple seasons of retrospective data available, it would be more limited in an emerging pandemic scenario. In these settings, there may not be any historical data on how models have performed nor reliable real-time data to train on. However, adaptive weighting approaches that dynamically update the weights over the course of a season or epidemic could remove the requirement that all models have a substantial track-record of performance. Preliminary work on adaptive weighting has shown some promise, though such approaches still rely on accurately reported real-time data [

Furthermore, a simple average of forecasts remains available in such situations and, as illustrated by the relatively strong performance of the FluSight Network Equal Weights model and the CDCâ€™s unweighted FluSight ensemble, can still offer advantages over individual models.
