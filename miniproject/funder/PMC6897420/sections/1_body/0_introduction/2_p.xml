<p>Multi-model ensembles, i.e. models that combine predictions from multiple different component models, have long been seen as having both theoretical and practical advantages over any single model [

First, it allows for a single forecast to incorporate signals from different data sources and models that may highlight different features of a system. Second, combining signals from models with different biases may allow those biases to offset and result in an ensemble that is more accurate and has lower variance than the individual ensemble components. Weather and climate models have utilized multi-model ensemble systems for these very purposes [
