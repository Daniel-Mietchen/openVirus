<p>In March 2017, influenza forecasters who had worked with CDC in the past were invited to join in establishing the FluSight Network. This research consortium worked collaboratively throughout 2017 and 2018 to build and implement a real-time multi-model ensemble with performance-based model weights. A central goal of the FluSight Network was to demonstrate the benefit of performance-based weights in a real-time, multi-team ensemble setting by outperforming the “simple average” ensemble that CDC uses to inform decision making and situational awareness during the annual influenza season. The CDC used this project to evaluate in real-time the feasibility and accuracy of creating an ensemble forecast based on past performance. Based on the forecast accuracy shown in this experiment, the CDC decided to adopt the approach described here as its main forecasting approach for the 2018/2019 influenza season.</p>
