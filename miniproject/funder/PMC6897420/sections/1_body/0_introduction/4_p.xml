<p>The FluSight challenge has been designed and retooled over the years with an eye towards maximizing the public health utility and integration of forecasts with real-time public health decision making. All forecast targets are derived from the weighted percentage of outpatient visits for influenza-like illness (wILI) collected through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet), weighted by state populations (

Weekly submissions to the FluSight challenge contain probabilistic and point forecasts for seven targets in each of 11 regions in the U.S. (national-level plus the 10 Health and Human Services (HHS) regions,

There are two classes of targets: “week-ahead” and “seasonal”. “Week ahead” targets refer to four short-term weekly targets (ILI percentages 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks in the future) that are different for each week of the season. “Seasonal” targets refer to quantities (outbreak onset week, outbreak peak week, and outbreak peak intensity) that represent a single outcome observed for a region in a season (see
