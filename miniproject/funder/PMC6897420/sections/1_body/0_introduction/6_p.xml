<p>In this paper, we describe the development of this collaborative multi-model ensemble and present forecasting results from seven retrospective seasons and one prospective season. The FluSight Network assembled 21 component forecasting systems to build multi-model ensembles for seasonal influenza outbreaks (Table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007486.s001">S1 Text</xref>). These components encompassed a variety of different modeling philosophies, including Bayesian hierarchical models, mechanistic models of infectious disease transmission, statistical learning methodologies, and classical statistical models for time-series data. We show that using multi-model ensembles informed by past performance consistently improved forecast accuracy over using any single model and over multi-model ensembles that do not take past performance into account. Given the timing of this experiment, during a particularly severe influenza season, this work also provides the first evidence from a real-time forecasting study that performance-based weights can improve ensemble forecast accuracy during a high severity infectious disease outbreak. This research is an important example of collaboration between government and academic public health experts, setting a precedent and prototype for real-time collaboration in future outbreaks, such as a global influenza pandemic.
