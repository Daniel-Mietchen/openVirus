  <title>Forecast score for the 
   <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model in 2017/2018 by week relative to peak.
  </title>
  <p>Scores for the two peak targets in each region were aligned to summarize performance relative to the peak week. On the x-axis, zero indicates the peak week and positive values represent weeks after the peak week. The black line indicates the overall geometric average across all regions. The grey band represents the geometric average across all regions and all seasons prior to 2017/2018.</p>
