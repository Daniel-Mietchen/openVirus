  <title>Average forecast scores and ranks by target and region for 2017/2018.</title>
  <p>Models shown include the 
   <monospace>FSNetwork-TTW</monospace> model, the top performing model from each team during the training phase and the unweighted average of all FluSight models received by CDC. Color indicates model rank in the 2017/2018 season (darker colors indicates higher rank and more accurate forecasts) and the forecast score (rounded to two decimal places) is printed in each cell. Regions are sorted with the most predictable region overall (i.e. highest forecast scores) at the top.
