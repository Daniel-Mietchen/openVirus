<p>I understand that the authors were constrained in the metrics that were reported based on the criteria for the CDCâ€™s contest. However, in some instances, it would be easier to interpret if the results were presented differently. For instance, the authors demonstrate that the TTW model performs better than the equal weight model. But it is difficult to evaluate from the forecast scores whether these improvements are meaningful. Expressing some of the results in terms of the units of measurement might be helpful. For instance, the estimate of peak week was off by an average of X weeks for TTW compared with Y weeks for equal-weighting.</p>
