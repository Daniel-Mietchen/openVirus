<p>Reviewer #1: Reich and colleagues describe the development and validation of a multi-model ensemble approach for flu forecasting. This work has arisen out of a collaborative network of groups participating in the CDCâ€™s flu forecasting challenge. It is hard to find much to fault with this study. The paper is clearly written, and the analysis plan and execution are rigorous and well-thought out. This study provides a gold-standard for how forecasting work should be performed, with clear, pre-specified outcomes, extensive development with cross validation, and an out-of-sample, real-time test of the method. I have only minor comments to help with the interpretation of some of the results.</p>
