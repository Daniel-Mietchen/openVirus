<p>Reviewer #2: In this article, the authors demonstrate that a multi-model ensemble forecast was able to provide accurate forecasts of influenza-like illness activity over the course of the 2017/18 United States influenza season. They describe how a range of multi-model ensembles were created and trained on past years' data, how the best-performing ensemble was identified, and then entered into the CDC FluSight challenge. This ensemble not only out-performed each of the individual models in the ensemble, but also came second overall in the challenge, despite the 2017/18 season being highly unusual. These kinds of collaborative efforts and methodological developments are critical if such forecasts are to become a part of routine public health surveillance.</p>
