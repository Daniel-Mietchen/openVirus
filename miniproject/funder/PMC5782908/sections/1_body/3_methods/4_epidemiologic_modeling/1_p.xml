<p>To infer epidemiologic parameters related to transmission, we constructed an SIR (susceptible-infectious-removed) mathematical model. Following Althaus et al. (

 </xref>), we fit the SIR model to cumulative incidence data and produced maximum-likelihood estimates of epidemiologic parameters (e.g., transmission rate, recovery rate) using the Nelder and Mead optimization algorithm in the optim package in R version 3.3.2 (

Because the epidemic was triphasic, we fit each of the three 2013 respiratory episodes separately. We assumed a well-mixed population of 50 chimpanzees and did not explore heterogeneity of social interactions to minimize model complexity and provide baseline estimates of epidemiologic parameters (
