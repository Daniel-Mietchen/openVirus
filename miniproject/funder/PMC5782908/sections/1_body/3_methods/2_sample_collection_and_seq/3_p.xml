<p>We analyzed sequence data using CLC Genomics Workbench version 8.5 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark). In brief, we trimmed low-quality bases (phred quality score &lt;30), discarded short reads (&lt;75 bp), and subjected the remaining reads to de novo assembly. We then analyzed raw sequence reads and assembled contiguous sequences (contigs), which we examined for similarity to known viruses in GenBank databases.</p>
