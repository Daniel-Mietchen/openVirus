<p>One chimpanzee showing clinical signs (Betty, a 2.2-year-old female) died during the outbreak; her body was recovered immediately after death. An experienced veterinarian (D.H.) performed the postmortem examination and collected samples from her oropharynx, trachea, and lung using swabs (sterile, plastic shaft with Dacron tip) and stored the samples separately in 0.25 mL of RNAlater buffer at −20°C. We homogenized the swab tips, extracted sample RNA, and converted the RNA to double-stranded cDNA in the field. We shipped the cDNA to the United States for unbiased sequencing and pathogen discovery on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using 300-bp paired-end read chemistry as previously described (
