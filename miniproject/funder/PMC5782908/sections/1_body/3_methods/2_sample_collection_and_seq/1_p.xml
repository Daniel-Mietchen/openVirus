<p>Starting approximately in February 2013 and continuing through August of that year, the Kanyawara community of chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, western Uganda, experienced an outbreak of severe respiratory disease. At the onset of the epidemic, the community consisted of 56 chimpanzees &lt;1 week‒56.9 years of age. All Kanyawara chimpanzees are individually identifiable and habituated to human observers, such that trained field assistants collected direct data on behavior and respiratory signs daily. We compiled these data into weekly measures of clinical signs (coughing or sneezing, further classified as mild or severe) and deaths. During June‒August 2013, we collected fecal samples from 41 chimpanzees. Immediately after observing defecation by a chimpanzee, we placed 5 mL of the fecal sample into an equal volume of RNAlater buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), homogenized the mixture, and stored the sample at −20°C for up to 3 months, until export to the United States.</p>
