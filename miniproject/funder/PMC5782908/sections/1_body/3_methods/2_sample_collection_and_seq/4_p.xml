<p>From these analyses, we inferred the presence of a rhinovirus, which we subsequently identified as a member of the rhinovirus C species. We performed pairwise sequence comparisons in MEGA7 (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>16</italic>
 </xref>) to assess the genetic similarity of this virus to its relatives, and we evaluated recombination with other rhinovirus C strains by using RDP4 (
 <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>17</italic>
 </xref>). We performed phylogenetic analyses on this virus and all complete rhinovirus polyprotein genes available in the GenBank database. We first aligned genes by codon using the MAFFT algorithm (
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>18</italic>
 </xref>) implemented in Translator X (
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>19</italic>
 </xref>) and removed poorly aligned regions using the Gblocks algorithm (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>20</italic>
 </xref>). We then used jModelTest (
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>21</italic>
 </xref>) to estimate the model of molecular evolution from the data and PhyML (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>22</italic>
 </xref>) for phylogenetic inference.
