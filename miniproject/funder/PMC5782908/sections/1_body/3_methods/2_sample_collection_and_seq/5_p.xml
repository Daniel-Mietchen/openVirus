<p>We tested chimpanzee fecal samples for a suite of respiratory pathogens by multiplex Luminex assay using the NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA) (

  <italic>23</italic>
 </xref>) and confirmed positive results by singleplex PCR. The NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel includes influenza virus A (multiple subtypes), human respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, coronaviruses (multiple subtypes), human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1–4, bocavirus, and the bacterial pathogens 
 <italic>Chlamydophila pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>. In brief, we added up to 50 µL of fecal suspension to 350 µL of saline; homogenized the mixture; and clarified the mixture by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 3 minutes, after which we added Luminex internal control MS2 before nucleic acid extraction with the NucliSENS EasyMag kit (bioMérieux, Marcy-l’Étoile, France). We then used 10 µL of eluate in the Luminex assay according to the manufacturer’s specifications. We applied this same assay to swab samples and assessed the viral load of rhinovirus C‒positive swab samples using a published real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) (
