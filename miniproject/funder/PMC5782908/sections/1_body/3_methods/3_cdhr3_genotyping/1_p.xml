<p>Given the influence of 
 <italic>CDHR3</italic> allelic variants on rhinovirus C pathogenesis in humans, we genotyped the 
 <italic>CDHR3</italic> allele of 41 chimpanzees from the Kanyawara community using their fecal specimens. In brief, we extracted DNA from fecal samples using the MagMAX Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and we then genotyped the extracted DNA using a qPCR-based allelic discrimination assay (CDHR3 TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay; Thermo Fisher Scientific). We assayed serial 2-fold dilutions of eluted DNA to identify the dilution yielding the strongest fluorescent signal; then, we tested 2 additional replicates of each sample at that optimal dilution. We also examined the 
 <italic>CDHR3</italic> locus of 24 additional chimpanzees from across Africa (including 4 recognized subspecies) using whole genome sequences previously published as part of the Great Ape Genome Project (
