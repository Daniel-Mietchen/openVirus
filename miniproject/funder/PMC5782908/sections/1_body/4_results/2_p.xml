<p>A postmortem analysis was conducted on the infant that died in March (peak of the early phase); other animals that died were not recovered in time for such analyses. The postmortem analysis revealed ecchymotic hemorrhages on the lung surfaces, consolidation of the parenchyma of both lungs (approximately two thirds of both lungs affected), mucoid exudate in the bronchi, hepatomegaly, and hepatic congestion. On the basis of these findings, the cause of death was concluded to be severe acute pneumonia. Deep sequencing of swab samples from this chimpanzee’s oropharynx, trachea, and lung yielded 10,722,035 sequence reads, of which 8,918 had high similarity to rhinovirus C. No other pathogens were detected. Subsequent qPCR confirmed infection with RV-C, with viral loads of 7.41 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/swab in the oropharynx, 1.05 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> copies/swab in the trachea, and 1.74 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/swab in the lung; these values are comparable to the average viral load (7.76 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/mL) found in rhinovirus C‒infected children with acute wheezing illness treated in an emergency department (

Further sequencing yielded a near-complete rhinovirus C genome consisting of a complete polyprotein gene of 6,450 bases, a complete 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of 35 bases excluding the poly(A) tail, and a partial 5′-UTR of 480 bases. The viral polyprotein sequence was 94.59% similar at the nucleic acid level and 99.99% similar at the amino acid level to its closest known relative, a rhinovirus C45 sequence (GenBank accession no. JN837686) from a 2-month-old male patient who had a history of mild nasal congestion and discharge in the United States in 2000. RDP4 analyses showed the chimpanzee-derived sequence to be a rhinovirus C45-C11 recombinant, with a breakpoint in the 5′-UTR (
