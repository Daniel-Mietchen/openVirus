<p>Rhinovirus C is unusual among rhinoviruses because of its clinical severity, unique biochemistry of receptor attachment, and role in modern human evolution (

Although experiments conducted in the 1960s showed rhinoviruses A and B to be capable of infecting chimpanzees in captivity, infections were mild and self-limiting (
