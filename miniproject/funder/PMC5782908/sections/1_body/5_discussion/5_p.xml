<p>Our inference about rhinovirus C as the likely cause of the epidemic is based on clinical samples from a single animal early in the outbreak. We consider it unlikely, however, that rhinovirus C was an incidental finding. The virus was found in this animalâ€™s lung, which was a site of severe pathology, at clinically relevant titers, and paramyxoviruses and other respiratory pathogens were not identified in these samples or in fecal samples from the 41 other animals. All adenoviruses sequenced from fecal samples were similar or identical to adenoviruses that have been documented in apparently healthy wild chimpanzees and other primates (
