<p>Although the mandate that researchers and tourists visiting wild apes wear facemasks is controversial, this practice has successfully reduced the transmission of rhinoviruses and other co-infecting agents that exacerbate rhinovirus clinical severity in hospital settings (

We advocate building upon existing data to engineer novel interventions and prevention strategies for rhinovirus infections in both humans and wild apes.
