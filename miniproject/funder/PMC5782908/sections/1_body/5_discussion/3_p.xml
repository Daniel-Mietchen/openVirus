<p>Epidemics of respiratory disease have been recorded in ape populations across Africa, but the causes have often remained undiagnosed. For example, during 47 years of wild chimpanzee observation in Gombe, Tanzania, respiratory disease accounted for 48% of illness-related deaths and was the predominant cause of lethal illness in this population (
