<p>Long-term records from Kanyawara indicate that respiratory disease outbreaks of varying severity have occurred approximately 2 times per year for at least the past decade, with fatalities occurring every ≈2 years, typically among young animals &lt;5 years of age and adults &gt;35 years of age (R.W. Wrangham, unpub. data). Observations also suggest that respiratory disease outbreaks have occurred in other chimpanzee communities in Kibale at the same times as outbreaks in the Kanyawara community. Kibale contains ≈1,500 chimpanzees in ≈10–20 interconnected communities; that such a population could sustain rhinovirus C or other similar infectious agents in cycles of within-group and between-group transmission is possible, at least for limited time periods (
