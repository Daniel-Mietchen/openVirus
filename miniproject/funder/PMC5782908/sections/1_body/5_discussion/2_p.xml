<p>Variant RV-C45-cpz1-2013 occupies an unremarkable phylogenetic position among rhinovirus C genomic variants from humans around the world (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Although this virus is a recombinant between 2 genotypes, C11 and C45, it is unlikely that this property is related to its origin in a chimpanzee host. Indeed, rhinoviruses often recombine; the parent strains of RV-C45-cpz1-2013 and the genomic location of the recombination event are similar to those described previously (

 </xref>). RV-C45-cpz1-2013 also shares with other rhinovirus C variants the capacity to infect the lower respiratory tract and cause severe disease. Viral load values from this animal’s oropharynx (7.41 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/swab), trachea (1.05 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> copies/swab), and lung (1.74 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/swab) are comparable to the average viral load (7.76 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/mL) found in rhinovirus C‒infected children with acute wheezing illness treated in an emergency department (

Although published estimates of rhinovirus epidemiologic transmission parameters are sparse, the values estimated for the 2013 chimpanzee outbreak (transmission rate 0.68/d; duration of infection 3.2 days) are close to those of common cold viruses in humans (transmission rate 0.74/d; duration of infection 3.0 days) (

 </xref>). Despite this similarity, these values are likely similar for many acute respiratory viruses.
