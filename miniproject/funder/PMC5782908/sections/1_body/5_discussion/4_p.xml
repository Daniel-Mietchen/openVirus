<p>In humans, the

 <sub>529</sub> allele is associated with increased susceptibility to rhinovirus C infection (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>7</italic>
 </xref>). This elevated risk results from increased cell surface expression of CDHR3, enhanced viral binding to the cellular receptor and increased progeny yields (

 <italic>CDHR3</italic>-C
 <sub>529</sub> nonrisk allele occurs (A.C. Palmenberg, unpub. data). In agreement with this finding, all chimpanzees genotyped from the Kanyawara community and across Africa were homozygous for the 
 <italic>CDHR3</italic>-Y
 <sub>529</sub> risk allele. The fact that only modern humans (and not Neanderthals or Denisovans) possess the nonrisk allele implies that resistance to rhinovirus C infection was selected for only in modern humans (

  <italic>9</italic>
 </xref>). These results highlight a species-wide susceptibility to rhinovirus C infection among chimpanzees.
