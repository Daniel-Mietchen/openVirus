<p>Humans and chimpanzees (
 <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic>) are closely related species that share many physiologic similarities, including a general predisposition for pathogen exchange, which, in some cases, might lead to human pandemics (

 </xref>). Anthroponotic (i.e., of human origin) respiratory viruses have caused notable mortality rates in wild chimpanzee populations (

 </xref>–

 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>) as anthroponotic causes (

  <italic>11</italic>
 </xref>–

 </xref>). However, because of the limitations of field-based diagnostics, direct detection of pathogens from lesions of the respiratory tract has proven difficult (

 </xref>). In this study, we were able to identify rhinovirus C, a pathogen not previously known to infect species other than humans, as the causative agent of an epidemic of respiratory disease in chimpanzees by directly sampling the lesions of a dead animal and by subsequent noninvasive sampling (from feces) and epidemiological modeling.
