  <p>Epidemic curve of respiratory illness in the Kanyawara chimpanzee community, Uganda, 2013. Observational data on clinical severity (mild or severe) of respiratory signs (coughing and sneezing) were obtained and compiled into weekly measurements. The proportions of animals showing signs of respiratory illness are displayed by severity. Dashed line indicates 2013 mean rate of respiratory signs, and dotted line indicates 2 SD above that mean. Asterisks above bars indicate the timing of individual animal deaths.</p>
