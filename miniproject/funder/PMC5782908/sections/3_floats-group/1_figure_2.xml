  <p>Recombination between viral genotypes rhinovirus C45 and C11 leading to RV-C45-cpz1-2013, the strain identified in the Kanyawara chimpanzee community, Uganda, 2013. Analyses were performed in RDP4 (
   <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">
    <italic>17</italic>
   </xref>) on aligned rhinovirus C genome sequences of 36 known genotypes. Each alignment entry encoded the full or nearly full polyprotein gene sequence, but some sequences were missing fragments (&lt;400 bp) of their respective 5′-UTRs (Δ seq, yellow box at left). The 3′ poly(A) tail was not included. A recombination event between the 2 viruses shown (GenBank nos. JN837686 and EU840952) is the most likely event among all full alignment comparisons (window size 20 bps) according to 6 of the 9 RDP4 algorithms. The average p values were RDP 2.8 × 10
   <sup>−81</sup>, GENECONV 3.0 × 10
   <sup>−70</sup>, MaxChi 1.4 × 10
   <sup>−18</sup>, Chimaera 2.1 × 10
   <sup>−21</sup>, SiScan 3.6 × 10
   <sup>–34</sup>, and 3Seq 1.5 × 10
   <sup>−27</sup>. BootScan, PhylPro, and LARD made no call for these particular parents. Purple box in the 5′-UTR denotes the 99% breakpoint confidence level (combined). Dashed box indicates the position of the most likely swapped fragment. The (Monte Carlo corrected) probability for this event is 2.8 × 10
   <sup>−81</sup>. The virus map is scaled to the alignment. Conf, confidence level; RV-C, rhinovirus C; Δ seq, missing sequence; UTR, untranslated region.
