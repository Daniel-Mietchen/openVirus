  <p>Phylogenetic tree of rhinovirus C variants. The tree was constructed from a codon-based alignment (6,234 positions) of the new chimpanzee-derived sequence identified in the Kanyawara chimpanzee community, Uganda, 2013 (indicated by the asterisk and chimpanzee silhouette), and all human-derived RV-C complete polyprotein gene sequences available in GenBank as of December 18, 2016, with rhinoviruses A and B from the RefSeq database included as outgroups. We created alignments using the MAFFT algorithm (

   <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">

   <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">
    <italic>20</italic>
