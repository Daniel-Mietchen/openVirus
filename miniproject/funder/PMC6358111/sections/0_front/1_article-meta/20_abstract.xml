 <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging threat to world health. It is transmitted by Aedes species mosquitos, and has caused massive epidemics across the globe. The virus causes fever, rash, arthritis and can sometimes be fatal. The biology of CHIKV is poorly understood, to address this deficiency we aimed to identify functions of one of the viral proteins, nsP3. We focused on the central part of this protein, termed the alphavirus unique domain (AUD) because it is unique to the genus of viruses to which CHIKV belongs–the 
  <italic>Alphaviruses</italic>–and not present in other related viruses. By making changes (mutations) in the amino acid sequence of the AUD and analysing the effects of these changes we show that it is involved in multiple stages of the virus lifecycle. These observations identify nsP3 and the AUD in particular as a potential target for antiviral therapy or rational vaccine design.
