  <title>Sequencing analysis of virus passage P0.</title>
  <p>P0: supernatant virus stock obtained from C2C12 cells at 48 h.p.e. nsP3 coding sequence was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. The region spanning the indicated mutations is shown. Note that for both E225A and R243A/K245A the sequence traces shown are from the negative strand, hence the colour of the trace does not match the colour code of the sequence below. R243A/K245A had already reverted to wildtype, whereas the other mutants had not reverted.</p>
