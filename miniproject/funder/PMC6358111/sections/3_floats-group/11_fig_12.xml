  <title>Fluorescence microscopy analysis of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA distribution during infection of C2C12 cells with P247A/V248A mutant CHIKV.</title>
  <p>C2C12 cells were electroporated with ICRES-nsP3-ZsGreen-CHIKV-P247A/V248A RNA. (A) Cells were fixed at the indicated time points post-infection and stained with antibodies to capsid protein (Cp) (white) and dsRNA (red). Green: nsP3-ZsGreen fusion, blue: nuclear DAPI counterstain. The scale bars are 5 μm and 1 μm, respectively. (B) The percentage of nsP3 that localised on the plasma membrane was determined for 5 cells. (C) The distance of individual nsP3 punctae from the nuclear membrane was determine for 5 cells. Localisations were calculated using Fiji. Significant differences denoted by ** (P&lt;0.01), *** (P&lt;0.001), or **** (P&lt;0.0001), compared to the 4 h.p.e. results.</p>
