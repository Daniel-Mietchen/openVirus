  <title>The P247A/V248A mutation did not revert or result in compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome.</title>
  <p>ICRES-P247A/V248A RNA was electroporated into C2C12 cells and cytoplasmic RNA was TRIzol extracted at 48 h.p.e. cDNA was generated from the extracted cell RNA with random primers before PCR was performed with specific primers (see supplementary 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007239.s006">S1 Table</xref>). A. PCR fragments used for CHIKV whole genome sequencing. B. Sequencing alignment result between wildtype and P247A/V248A mutant using DNA Dynamo software. Red underlined sequences show changes from P247 (CCG) and V248 (GTG) to alanine (GCGGCG)
