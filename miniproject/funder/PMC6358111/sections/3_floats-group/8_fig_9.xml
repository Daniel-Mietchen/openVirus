   <italic>coli</italic> expressed AUD (wildtype (WT) and P247A/V248A) were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant blue staining. (B) Circular Dichroism analysis of purified AUD. (C) Schematic of the CHIKV genome showing the location of the various short RNA fragments used in subsequent filter binding analysis. (D-F) Filter binding analysis of the interaction between AUD and the indicated RNA fragments. Purified AUD at the indicated concentrations was incubated with radiolabelled RNA (1 nM) before application to a slot blot apparatus, filtering through nitrocellulose (protein-RNA complex) and Hybond-N (free RNA) membranes, and visualization by phosphoimaging. The negative control is wildtype AUD with an 80-mer aptamer raised against the foot-and-mouth disease virus 3D RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [
   <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The percentage of RNA bound to the nitrocellulose membrane was quantified and plotted as a function of the AUD concentration. The data was fitted to a hyperbolic equation. Data are displayed as the means Â± S.E. of three experimental replicates. (G) Endpoint (% of total RNA bound) and K
   <sub>d</sub> values derived from the graphs in (D-F).
