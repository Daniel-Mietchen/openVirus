  <title>Phenotype of AUD mutations in the production of infectious virus.</title>
  <p>(A) ICRES-RNAs, wildtype (WT) and indicated mutants, were electroporated into C2C12 cells and supernatants were collected at 48 h.p.e. Virus was titrated by plaque assay in BHK-21 cells. Significant difference denoted by ** (P&lt;0.01), compared to wildtype. (B) Plaques for wildtype and P247A/V248A were visualised illustrating the small plaque phenotype for this mutant. (C-E) C2C12 cells were infected with CHIKV (wildtype and indicated AUD mutants) at an MOI of 0.1. Supernatants were collected at the indicated times for genome RNA quantification (qRT-PCR) (C) and virus titration by plaque assay (D). Data in A, C and D are displayed as the means Â± S.E. of three experimental replicates. (E) The ratios of genome RNA:infectivity were determined from (C) and (D) at 16, 24 and 48 h.p.i. and presented graphically.</p>
