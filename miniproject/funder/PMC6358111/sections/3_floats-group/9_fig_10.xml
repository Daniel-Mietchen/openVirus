  <title>CHIKV genome RNA association with nsP3 during virus replication.</title>
  <p>C2C12 cells were electroporated with ICRES nsP3-TST or untagged ICRES RNAs (wildtype (WT) and P247A/V248A). (A) Supernatants were harvested at 48 h.p.e and titrated by plaque assay on BHK-21 cells. Data are displayed as the means Â± S.E. of three experimental replicates. Cell lysates were collected at 60 h.p.e. and nsP3-TST was precipitated with Streptactin-sepharose beads. Bound proteins and input lysates were subjected to western blotting (B) and both co-precipitated RNAs and lysate samples were extracted by TRIzol and quantified by qRT-PCR (C). The ratio of gRNA to nsP3 is depicted graphically (D).</p>
