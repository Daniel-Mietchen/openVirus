  <title>Phenotype of AUD mutations in virus entry, release and assembly.</title>
  <p>(A) C2C12 cells were infected with CHIKV (wildtype (WT) and indicated AUD mutants) at MOI of 1. At 24 h.p.i, cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml fresh medium. Cell suspensions were freeze/thawed 3 times to release intracellular virus. Genome RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR (blue bars), and virus titrated by plaque assay (red bars). (B) Graphical representation of the ratio of infectivity to genomic RNA. (C) Extracellular (blue bars) and intracellular (red bars) viruses were collected at 36 h.p.e from C2C12 cells electroporated with the indicated ICRES RNAs, and titrated by plaque assay. (D) Graphical representation of the ratio of extracellular to intracellular virus titres. Significant difference denoted by * (P&lt;0.05) compared to wildtype. Data in A and C are displayed as the means Â± S.E. of three experimental replicates.</p>
