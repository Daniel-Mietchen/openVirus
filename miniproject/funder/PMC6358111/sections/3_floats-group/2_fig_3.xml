  <title>CHIKV AUD mutant replication in murine cells.</title>
  <p>C2C12 (A) or BHK-21 cells (B) were transfected with CHIKV-D-luc-SGR wildtype (WT) and mutant RNAs and harvested for both RLuc and FLuc assays at the indicated time points. Luciferase values of wildtype and each mutant were normalized to 4 h values and represent fold-change compared to the 4 h values. (GAA: inactive mutant of nsP4 polymerase in a wildtype nsP3 background). Significant differences denoted by * (P&lt;0.05), and ** (P&lt;0.01), compared to wildtype are only shown for the 12 h timepoint values for clarity. Data are displayed as the means Â± S.E. of three experimental replicates.</p>
