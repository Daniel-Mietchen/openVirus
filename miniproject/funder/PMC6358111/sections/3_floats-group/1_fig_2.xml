  <title>CHIKV AUD mutant replication in human cells.</title>
  <p>Huh7 (A), Huh7.5 (B) or RD cells (C) were transfected with CHIKV-D-luc-SGR wildtype (WT) and mutant RNAs and harvested for both RLuc and FLuc assays at the indicated time points. Luciferase values of wildtype and each mutant were normalized to 4 h values and represent fold-change compared to the 4 h values. (GAA: inactive mutant of nsP4 polymerase in a wildtype nsP3 background). Significant differences denoted by * (P&lt;0.05), and ** (P&lt;0.01), compared to wildtype are only shown for the 12 h timepoint values for clarity. Data are displayed as the means Â± S.E. of three experimental replicates.</p>
