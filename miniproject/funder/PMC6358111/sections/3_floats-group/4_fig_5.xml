  <title>Expression of nsP3 in C2C12 cells.</title>
  <p>Cells were transfected with wildtype and the indicated mutant pcDNA3.1-nsP3 plasmids and cell lysates harvested at 48 h.p.t. into GLB. Lysates were analysed for expression of nsP3 by western blot. Actin was also detected by western blot as a loading control.</p>
