<p>In the second part of this study we focused on P247A/V248A to address the molecular mechanism underpinning the phenotype of this mutant. In the context of the subgenomic replicon P247A/V248A showed a variety of phenotypes from complete lack of replication in Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g002">Fig 2</xref>), to a 10-fold reduction in other mammalian and mosquito cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g003">Fig 3</xref>). It is intriguing that the P247A/V248A mutant exhibited a cell-type and species-specific phenotype as this implies that a cell factor may contribute to the phenotype. For example, a cell factor that is not expressed in Huh7 cells might be involved in the function of nsP3 in transcribing the subgenomic RNA. An alternative explanation is that Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells support lower levels of CHIKV replication than all of the other cell types in this study. The fold increase in FLuc values between 4–12 h.p.e. was 36-fold (Huh7) and 94-fold (Huh7.5) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This compared to 150-fold (RD), 740-fold (C2C12), 250-fold (BHK), 177-fold (U4.4) and 310-fold (C6/36). These overall higher levels of replication may have resulted in the P247A/V248A values rising above the threshold for detection. Virus data in C2C12 cells were consistent with replicon results: following electroporation of viral RNA P247A/V248A showed a modest but significant defect in virus infectivity and exhibited a small plaque phenotype. Further study indicated that P247A/V248A was competent in virus entry and virus release, however, it exhibited a major defect in assembly of infectious virus particles. This defect led to both a delay and a reduction in the release of infectious virus, consistent with the small plaque phenotype. The molecular mechanism underpinning the P247A/V248A defect was shown to be a reduction in subgenomic RNA synthesis, leading to a concomitant reduction in the expression of the structural proteins. It is noteworthy that when analysed in the context of the replicon in C2C12 cells, the P247A/V248A mutant exhibited a 10-fold reduction in FLuc, but RLuc was higher than wildtype. This is also consistent with a defect in transcription of the subgenomic mRNA. The reduced affinity of P247A/V248A AUD for the CHIKV sg-prom(-) RNA as demonstrated by the RNA filter binding assay may help to explain this, but it is possible that other effects of P247A/V248A, such as aberrant host protein recruitment, may also help to explain the defect in subgenomic RNA synthesis. Of note, P247A/V248A AUD also exhibited impaired binding to the 3′UTR(+) and 5′RNA(-)

 <italic>in vivo</italic>, compared to wildtype, consistent with an overall defect in RNA replication. However, it is important to note that whilst there was a difference between wildtype and P247A/V248A in the ratio of genomic RNA to nsP3 in TST precipitates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g010">Fig 10D</xref>), this may have resulted, at least in part, from the reduced abundance of genomic RNA in the P247A/V248A infected cells. Previous studies have also shown that nsP3 is important for initial replication complex formation and negative strand RNA synthesis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Taken together we propose that the AUD plays a critical role in all stages of CHIKV RNA synthesis, but particularly in the transcription of the sgRNA.
