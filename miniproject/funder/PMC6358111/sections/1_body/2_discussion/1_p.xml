<p>Of the four alphavirus non-structural proteins, nsP3 remains the least well understood [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The protein consists of three domains, the N-terminal of which has been identified as a macrodomain that binds to ADP-ribose and possesses ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent studies have proposed a role for this enzymatic activity in virus pathogenesis but as yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The C-terminal hypervariable domain differs dramatically in amino acid sequence between different alphaviruses and is intrinsically disordered. It has been shown to interact with a range of cellular proteins, including components of stress granules [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and is implicated in the assembly of virus genome replication complexes.
