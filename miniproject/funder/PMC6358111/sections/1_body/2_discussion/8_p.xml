<p>In conclusion we propose that the nsP3 AUD is a multi-functional domain. It is not only a critical determinant of both cell and species-specificity, but also plays roles in virus genome replication and assembly. The rational mutagenesis of the CHIKV AUD described here is the first detailed structure-function analysis of this domain and raises many questions. In particular, we need to determine what cellular and viral proteins are interaction partners for the AUD, and investigate how these interactions shed light on the phenotypes of AUD mutants? We expect that our current proteomic analysis, exploiting both a novel SNAP-tagged nsP3 recently developed in our laboratory [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and a twin-strep tag (TST) approach which we recently used to identify interacting partners of the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], will provide some of the answers to these questions. We also hope that these studies will help to identify targets for antiviral intervention and means of rational attenuation for vaccine development.
