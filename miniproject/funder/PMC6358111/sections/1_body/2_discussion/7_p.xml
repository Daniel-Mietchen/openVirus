<p>Analysis of the distribution of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA during CHIKV replication by confocal microscopy revealed further insights into the P247A/V248A phenotype. Wildtype nsP3 exhibited a high level of co-localisation with dsRNA at all time points up to 16 h.p.e. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g011">Fig 11A</xref>), consistent with the role of nsP3 in genome replication. At 12 and 16 h.p.e., both nsP3 and dsRNA also co-localised with capsid and were concentrated at the plasma membrane. In contrast, P247A/V248A nsP3 showed not only a reduction in the co-localisation with dsRNA, but also a loss of the plasma membrane accumulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g012">Fig 12A</xref>). A simple explanation for this observation is that capsid accumulates at the plasma membrane and recruits both nsP3 and dsRNA, and this was perturbed by the low level of capsid expression exhibited by the P247A/V248A mutant. However we cannot rule out the possibility that there is a role for nsP3 (and the AUD in particular) in coordinating the processes of genome replication and virus assembly to facilitate production of infectious virus particles at the plasma membrane. This is in agreement with early evidence for a juxtaposition of sites of genome replication, viral protein translation and nucleocapsid assembly in the case of Sindbis virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition it may be that nsP3 has a role in the trafficking of nucleocapsids from these sites (cytoplasmic vacuoles (CPVs)) to the plasma membrane.
