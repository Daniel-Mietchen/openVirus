<p>In contrast, we know virtually nothing about the function of the central AUD domain. The fact that this domain is highly conserved between different alphaviruses suggests that it plays a fundamental role in the virus lifecycle. Detailed structural information about the AUD is available however, as the partial structure of the SINV nsP2-nsP3 precursor, including the C-terminal protease and methyltransferase-like domains of nsP2 and the macro and AUD domains of nsP3, has been determined [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This analysis revealed that the AUD contained an unique zinc-binding fold with four cysteine residues coordinating a zinc molecule, this formed part of a putative RNA binding surface. Mutagenesis of two of these cysteines revealed an essential role in virus replication. Our data agree with this observation, as the C262A/C264A mutant failed to replicate in any cell type tested.
