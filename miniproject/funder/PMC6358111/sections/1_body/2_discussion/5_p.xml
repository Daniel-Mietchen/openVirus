<p>M219 was also of particular interest as mutation of this residue had no significant effect on genome replication in any cell type apart from U4.4 mosquito cells. M219A replicated well in C6/36 mosquito cells and the key difference between these two cell lines is that C6/36 have a defect in the RNAi response due to a Dcr2 mutation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We propose therefore that M219 may be involved in the interaction of nsP3 with a component of the mosquito RNAi response to inhibit this key mosquito antiviral pathway. We are currently undertaking proteomic and functional analysis to test this hypothesis.
