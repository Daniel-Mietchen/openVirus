<p>In contrast, the other mutants generated during this study exhibited a number of distinct cell-type and species-specific phenotypes (summarised in 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Mutation of two surface exposed basic residues (R243 and K245) abrogated replication in all mammalian cells but showed full replication capability in mosquito cells. However, this apparent discrepancy could be explained by the observation that these two mutations rapidly reverted to wildtype in mosquito cells but failed to do so in C2C12 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These data indicate that R243 and K245 are required for CHIKV genome replication. We do not have an explanation for why R243A/K245A, but not the other lethal mutations, was able to revert in mosquito cells. However it is noteworthy that the reversion to the wildtype sequence took 72 h in C6/36 cells, suggesting that perhaps the lack of cytopathology of CHIKV replication in mosquito cells could facilitate the replication of a minority species. Interestingly, the sequence trace at 24 h in C6/36 shows the presence of such a minority species that would encode a Thr at 243 and 245, suggesting that the two basic residues are not absolutely required.
