<p>A fragment including the AUD coding sequence was excised from the CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR plasmid, and inserted into pcDNA3.1 to generate pcDNA3.1-AUD. This was used as a template for site-directed (Quikchange) mutagenesis using specific primers (primer sequences available upon request) to produce the required AUD mutations. Finally, the AUD mutated fragments were excised and religated into the CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR. AUD fragments were subsequently excised from CHIKV-D-Luc-SGRs and ligated into ICRES-CHIKV-WT. For the twin-strep tag (TST) derivatives of wildtype and P247A/V248A, synthetic oligonucleotides (sequence available upon request) were used to substitute the appropriate coding sequence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] for the RLuc in nsP3. For expression of nsP3 alone in eukaryotic cells the entire nsP3 coding sequences (flanked by an appropriate Kozak consensus/AUG at the 5′ end, and termination codon at the 3′ end) were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. The nsP4 GAA mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis in the CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR, sequenced and recloned back into either ICRES-CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR.
