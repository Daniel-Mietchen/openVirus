<p>To produce radiolabelled RNA transcripts the corresponding DNA sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g009">Fig 9C</xref>) were PCR-amplified and cloned into pcDNA3.1. Plasmids were linearised and used as templates for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, 500 μM each of ATP, CTP and GTP, 12 μM UTP, and 50 μCi [
 <sup>32</sup>P]-UTP for 2 h. After DNase treatment for 30 min., radiolabelled transcripts were purified with an RNA purification kit (Fisher Scientific). Radiolabelled transcripts and AUD proteins were diluted in binding buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM DTT, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml yeast tRNA [Ambion]) and pre-incubated separately for 10 min at 4°C. The binding reaction was initiated by mixing 1 nM radio-labelled RNA and AUD proteins (0 to 1 μM) in a 200 μl final volume at 4°C for 30 min. Membranes were pre-soaked in binding buffer supplemented with 5% (v/v) glycerol and assembled from bottom to top as follows in a slot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad): filter paper, Hybond-N nylon (Amersham Biosciences) to bind free RNA molecules, and nitrocellulose (Schleicher &amp; Schuell) to trap soluble protein-RNA complexes. After assembly, 200 μl of each binding reaction mixture was applied to each slot and filtered through the membranes. Each slot was washed with 0.5 ml of binding buffer and air dried, and quantification of radioactivity was performed using an image plate, BAS 1000 Bioimager (Fuji), and Aida Image Analyser v4.22 software. Fitting was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software. In each case, the data were fitted to the hyperbolic equation R = R
 <sub>max</sub> x R/(K
 <sub>d</sub> + [P]), where R is the percentage of bound RNA, R
 <sub>max</sub> is the maximal percentage of RNA competent for binding, [P] is the concentration of AUD, and K
 <sub>d</sub> is the apparent dissociation constant.
