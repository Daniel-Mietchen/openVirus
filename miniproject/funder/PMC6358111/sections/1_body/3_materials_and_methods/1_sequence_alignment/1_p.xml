<p>AUD amino acid sequences from a number of different alphaviruses (Sindbis, Ockelbo, Oâ€™Nyong-Nyong, Ross River, Semliki Forest, Fort Morgan, Venezuelan, Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis, Highlands-J and CHIKV) were obtained from NCBI and aligned by Clustal Omega. The predicted locations of conserved residues were then identified by Pymol, taking the Sindbis nsP2/3 protein structure (PDB ID code 4GUA) [
