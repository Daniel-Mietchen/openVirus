<p>Infectious CHIKV was harvested from C2C12 cells electroporated with ICRES RNAs at 48 h.p.e. Cell supernatants were titrated by plaque assay in BHK-21 cells and stored at -80°C. For virus growth kinetic analysis (one-step growth curve), C2C12 cells were infected with wildtype or AUD mutant CHIKV at an MOI of 0.1 for 1 h. Infected cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with fresh complete medium at 37°C. For RNA quantification, RNAs were extracted from supernatants with Trizol (ThermoFisher Scientific). qRT-PCR for CHIKV genome RNA was performed with One-step MESA GREEN qRT-PCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR assay (Eurogentec) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers for qRT-PCR were designed to amplify a short sequence of nsP3: (nsP3-F: GCGCGTAAGTCCAAGGGAAT, nsP3-R: AGCATCCAGGTCTGACGGG). Genomic RNA equivalents were determined by reference to a standard curve. Plaque assay was performed as described above.</p>
