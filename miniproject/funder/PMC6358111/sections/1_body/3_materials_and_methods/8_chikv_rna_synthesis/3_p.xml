<p>For gradient analysis, equal volumes of harvested RNAs were loaded on to 14 ml 5–25% (w/v) sucrose gradients in 100 mM sodium acetate and 0.1% SDS followed by centrifugation at 150,000×g for 5 h. at room temperature. Gradients were fractionated into 350 μl fractions, and radioactivity of each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting.</p>
