<p>C2C12 cells were electroporated with ICRES RNAs. At 10 h.p.e. actinomycin D (1 μg/ml) was added and the cells were incubated for a further 2 h. [
 <sup>3</sup>H]-uridine (20 μCi/ml) was then added and the cells were incubated for an additional 3 h., at which time the monolayers were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS, lysed and RNA extracted with TRIzol reagent.
