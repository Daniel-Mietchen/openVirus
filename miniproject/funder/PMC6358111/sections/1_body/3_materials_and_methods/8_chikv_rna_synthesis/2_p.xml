<p>For measurement of viral RNA synthesis, the harvested RNAs were separated on a MOPS-Formaldehyde gel. The gel was fixed (15% methanol, 10% acetic acid and 75% dH
 <sub>2</sub>O) for 30 min followed by fluorography (Fluorographic reagent Amplify, GE Healthcare) for another 30 min. Gels were dried for 2 h. before exposure to autoradiographic film at -80Â°C for 4 days.
