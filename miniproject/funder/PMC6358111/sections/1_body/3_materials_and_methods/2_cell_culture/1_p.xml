<p>Mammalian cells Huh7, Huh7.5, RD, C2C12 and BHK-21 were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 0.5 mM non-essential amino acids and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL). Huh7 cells were obtained from John McLauchlan (Centre for Virus Research, Glasgow), Huh7.5 cells from Charles Rice (Rockefeller University, New York), RD cells from Nicola Stonehouse (University of Leeds), C2C12 cells from Michelle Peckham (University of Leeds) and BHK-21 cells from John Barr (University of Leeds). 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito cell lines (U4.4 and C6/36) were obtained from Susan Jacobs (The Pirbright Institute) and maintained in Leibovitz's L-15 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 10% tryptose phosphate broth and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL). Mosquito cells were incubated at 28°C without CO
