<p>The P247A/V248A mutation was introduced into ICRES-nsP3-ZsGreen-CHIKV where ZsGreen was fused into the hypervariable domain of nsP3. C2C12 cells were electroporated and harvested, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at defined h.p.e., permeabilised by treatment with methanol, blocked with 2% BSA, and incubated with capsid protein antibody (gift from Andres Merits) or dsRNA antibody (J2 antibody, Scicons) at 4Â°C overnight, followed by secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 633 conjugated chicken anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG) for 1h at room temperature. Distribution of nsP3, capsid protein and dsRNA were detected using a Zeiss LSM880 with Airyscan. Post-acquisition analysis was conducted using Zen software (Zen version 2015 black edition 2.3, Zeiss) or Fiji (v1.49) software [
