<p>Capped RNAs were generated from the CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR for transfection using the mMACHINE SP6 transcription kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and purified with PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Life Technologies). Routinely 0.5 μg CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR was transfected into 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. At 4, 12, 24 and 48 h post transfection (h.p.t.), cells were harvested and both Renilla and Firefly luciferase activity measured using the Dual-luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Each sample had three repeats and the data shown in this study represent the mean of three experimental replicates (n = 3).
