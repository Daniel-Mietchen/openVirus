<p>ICRES-CHIKV RNAs were produced and purified as described above. C2C12 cells were electroporated with ICRES-CHIKV RNAs (1 μg RNA was electroporated into 1.2 x10
 <sup>6</sup> cells) and incubated at 37°C. Cell supernatants were collected at 8, 24 and 48 hours post electroporation (h.p.e.), diluted with cell medium and applied to monolayers of BHK-21 cells for 1 h at 37°C. The inoculum was aspirated and plates were overlaid with 0.8% methylcellulose for 48 h at 37°C for plaque formation. For titration of intracellular viruses, cells were freeze/thawed 3 times and supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 12000×g for 10 min., prior to application to BHK-21 cells. All virus work was performed in a Biological Safety Level 3 (BSL3) laboratory. Plaques were visualised by photography with a Canon EOS 80D.
