<p>Far-UV CD spectroscopy was performed on an APP Chirascan CD spectropolarimeter to obtain the secondary structure of AUDs. Spectra (190–260 nm) were recorded using 200 μl protein solution (at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml) in a 1 mm path-length cuvette. Protein CD spectra deconvolution was analysed by DichroWeb.</p>
