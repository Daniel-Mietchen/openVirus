<p>Cytoplasmic RNA from electroporated or infected cells were Trizol extracted, prior to reverse transcription with random primers using SuperScript IV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. cDNAs were then used as a template to amplify fragments of the CHIKV genome with specific primers (primer sequences available upon request). PCR products were subjected to sequencing analysis.</p>
