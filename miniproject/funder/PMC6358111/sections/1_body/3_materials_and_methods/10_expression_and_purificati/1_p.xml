<p>The wildtype and P247A/V248A AUD (nsP3 residues Ile141 to Gly374) were cloned into pET-28a-His-sumo for expression in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and subsequent analysis. His-sumo tagged AUD expression plasmids were transformed into Rosetta 2 and cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 50 μg/μl ampicillin and 1% (w/v) glucose. The cells were grown at 37°C to an optical density at 600 nm (OD
 <sub>600</sub>) of 0.5 to 0.7 and then induced with IPTG (isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside) (0.5 mM) for 5 h at 18°C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000 rpm for 10 min. Wildtype or mutant AUD protein was purified by sequential His-tag affinity purifications. Briefly, cell pellets were suspended in 20 ml AUD lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) supplemented with 2 μg/μl DNase and EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). The cell suspension was lysed by sonication on ice at an amplitude of 10 μm for six pulses of 20 s separated by 20 s and the extract clarified by centrifugation at 16000×g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and applied to a Ni
 <sup>2+</sup> His-tag column for purification. Purified proteins were dialyzed to remove imidazole and sumo-protease was added to cleave the His-sumo tag. After dialysis, the proteins were applied again to the His-tag purification column, and the flow-throughs were collected as purified AUD proteins.
