<p>C2C12 cells were electroporated with ICRES RNAs and incubated for 36 h. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS, lysed by resuspension in Glasgow lysis buffer (GLB) [1% Triton X-100, 120 mM KCl, 30 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 10 mM piperazine-N,N'-bis (2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES)-NaOH, pH 7.2] supplemented with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane and blocked in 50% (v/v) Odyssey blocking buffer (LiCor) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) [50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4]. The membrane was incubated with primary antibody in 25% (v/v) Odyssey blocking buffer overnight at 4Â°C, then incubated with fluorescently labelled anti-rabbit (800 nm) secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature (RT) before imaging on a LiCor Odyssey Sa fluorescence imager.
