<p>Co-precipitation experiments were performed in C2C12 cells electroporated with ICRES One-Strep-tag (OST) RNAs using Streptactin-agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific), following the manufacturers protocol. Precipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblotting and co-precipitated RNAs were extracted by TRIzol and quantified by qRT-PCR.</p>
