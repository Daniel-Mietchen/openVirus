<p>We wished to confirm that none of the phenotypes observed were due to destabilisation of the protein, however the lack of replication of some mutants meant that it was not possible to detect nsP3 by western blotting of replicon transfected cell lysates. To address this we therefore generated a panel of nsP3 mutants in pcDNA3, these plasmids were transfected into C2C12 cells and nsP3 expression detected by western blotting. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g005">Fig 5</xref>, all the mutants were expressed to a similar level as wildtype and did not exhibit any degradation patterns.
