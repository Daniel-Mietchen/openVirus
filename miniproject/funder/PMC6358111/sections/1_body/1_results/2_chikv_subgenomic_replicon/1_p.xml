<p>To analyse the effects of the AUD mutations on CHIKV genome replication, the panel of mutant CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR RNAs were transfected into a range of cell lines. As both liver and muscle are target organs for CHIKV infection we used three human cell lines. The human hepatoma cell line Huh7 is well characterised and we have previously shown that they efficiently support CHIKV replication [

To test any potential role of the AUD in protecting CHIKV from innate immune sensing we also used the Huh7 derivative Huh7.5, which have a defect in innate immunity due in part to a mutation in one allele of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, it was shown that ectopic expression of wildtype RIG-I in Huh7.5 restored the activation of IRF-3 and expression of ISGs in response to Sendai virus [

Additionally, two other mammalian (non-human) cell lines were used: C2C12 (a murine myoblast cell line) and BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney cells) based on their ability to support high levels of CHIKV replication [

 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>) derived cell lines: U4.4 and C6/36. Of note, C6/36 have a defect in RNA interference (RNAi) due to a frameshift mutation in the Dcr2 gene, leading to production of a truncated and inactive Dicer-2 protein [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Again, use of these cells was intended to allow us to assess any role of the AUD in counteracting mosquito innate immunity. To allow direct comparison of replication between different cell lines, all luciferase values are presented as fold increase over the 4 h values, absolute luciferase values are presented in
