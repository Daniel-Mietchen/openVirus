<p>As a mosquito transmitted virus, CHIKV must replicate in both mammalian and mosquito cells. We therefore proceeded to evaluate the replicative capacity of the mutant panel in cells derived from the 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito. Two cell lines were used: U4.4 and C6/36. The major difference between these two cell lines is that C6/36 have a defect in the RNAi response due to a frameshift mutation in the Dcr2 gene [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Consistent with this, although both mosquito cell lines supported robust replication, C6/36 supported higher levels than U4.4 (up to 1000-fold increase at 48 h.p.t.). As described below, we observed remarkable differences in the mutant phenotypes in these cells compared to the mammalian cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The first difference was that M219A failed to replicate in U4.4 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) but exhibited wildtype levels of replication in C6/36 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), suggesting that M219 might be involved in interacting with, and inhibiting, the mosquito cell RNAi pathway. Secondly, R243A/K245A, which was unable to replicate in human cell lines and only showed low replication level in the C2C12 cells, was fully replication competent in both mosquito cell lines. Mutant P247A/V248A was partially replication competent in both cell lines, whereas as seen in mammalian cell lines neither V260A/P261A nor C262A/C264A replicated in mosquito cells.
