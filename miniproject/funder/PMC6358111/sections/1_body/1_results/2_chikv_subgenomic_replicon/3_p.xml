<p>We then evaluated the mutant panel in two other mammalian cell lines: C2C12 murine myoblasts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) and BHK-21 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Wildtype CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR replicated to very high levels in both cell lines, much higher than in the human cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g002">Fig 2</xref>), with FLuc levels increasing ~1000-fold between 4–24 h.p.t. Overall the phenotypes of the panel of mutants were similar to those observed in RD, however two noticeable differences were observed. Firstly, R243A/K245A showed a low replication level in C2C12 cells. Secondly, P247A/V248A was capable of replication in both but at levels that were significantly lower than wildtype (&gt;10-fold). Interestingly, although in C2C12 cells FLuc levels for P247A/V248A were reduced, the concomitant RLuc levels were higher than wildtype, suggesting that there may be a defect in either transcription of the sgRNA or translation of ORF2. These data suggested that P247 and V248 were required for CHIKV genome replication in liver-derived cells, whilst enhancing but not essential for replication in cells derived from muscle or kidney, implying some cell-type specific interactions of nsP3. V260A/P261A (adjacent to the zinc–binding site), and the zinc-coordinating cysteine mutant C262A/C264A were unable to replicate in either cell line, being indistinguishable from the GAA nsP4 control.
