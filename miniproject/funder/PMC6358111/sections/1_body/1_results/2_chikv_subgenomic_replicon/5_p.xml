<p>The striking phenotypic difference between mammalian and mosquito cell lines for R243A/K245A led us to investigate this further. We considered that a simple explanation might be that the mutations had reverted to wildtype in mosquito cell lines. To test this we extracted cytoplasmic RNA from transfected C2C12, U4.4 and C6/36 cells, and subjected them to RT-PCR and sequence analysis. In C2C12 cells at 48 h.p.t. we did not observe any sign of reversion (

However, for both U4.4 at 48 h.p.t., and C6/36 samples the sequence traces revealed the presence of a mixed population of mutant and wildtype. Notably we observed a sequential accumulation of revertants in the C6/36 samples: At 24 h.p.t. a very low proportion of revertants at the first position in the two codons was seen, at 48 h.p.t. the proportion increased and at 72 h.p.t. the sequences were almost entirely wildtype. These data are consistent with a requirement for R243 and K245 for efficient CHIKV genome replication.
