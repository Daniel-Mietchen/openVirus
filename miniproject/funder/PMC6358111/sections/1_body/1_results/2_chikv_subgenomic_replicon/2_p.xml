<p>We first tested replication in the human hepatoma cell line, Huh7 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Wildtype CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR exhibited robust replication in these cells with FLuc levels (a measure of genome replication) increasing approx. 30-fold between 4–12 h post-transfection (h.p.t.). Consistent with this, RLuc levels (reflecting both input translation and subsequent replication) increased between 4–12 h.p.t., but then declined at 24 h.p.t. to input levels, possibly due to preferential transcription of the sub-genomic RNA at later times. Of the mutants M219A exhibited a modest, non-significant, reduction in replication, E225A replicated as wild type, but the other four nsP3 mutants and the nsP4 GAA mutant failed to replicate. The replication defect was indicated by either a reduction or a minimal increase in both RLuc and FLuc values from 4–24 h.p.t. A similar picture emerged when the mutant panel was screened in Huh7.5 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Consistent with the defect in cytosolic RNA sensing, replication of wildtype, M219A and E225A was higher in Huh7.5 cells compared to Huh7, however, this did not allow replication of the inactive mutants. Intriguingly, this enhanced replication in Huh7.5 cells did not manifest in higher levels of RLuc expression at 12 h.p.t. compared to 4 h.p.t. (as compared to Huh7 cells), this may not be due to effects on replication but more likely reflect a preference for translation of the sgRNA. For RD human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, a slightly different picture emerged (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g002">Fig 2C</xref>): firstly both M219A and E225A replicated to a similar level as wildtype. Secondly, the P247A/V248A mutant, which was unable to replicate in Huh7 or Huh7.5 cells, was able to replicate to a low level in RD cells. The other three mutants and nsP4 GAA again failed to replicate.
