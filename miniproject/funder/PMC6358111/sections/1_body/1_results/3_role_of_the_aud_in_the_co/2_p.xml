<p>During the course of these assays we noted that the P247A/V248A mutant uniquely exhibited a much smaller plaque size than the wildtype (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). We reasoned that this might reflect a defect in either virus production or spread that could be masked in the electroporation procedure due to the high level of input RNA. To test this we performed a one-step growth assay by infecting C2C12 cells at an MOI of 0.1 with either wildtype CHIKV or the 3 mutants (M219A, E225A and P247A/V248A). Cell supernatants were harvested at various times post infection (h.p.i.) and analysed for genomic RNA by qRT-PCR (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). In order to exclude the possibility that the P247A/V248A mutant phenotype resulted in a delay to virus replication we extended this analysis to 96 h.p.i. Wildtype, M219A and E225A showed a rapid increase in both genomic RNA and infectivity between 8â€“48 h.p.i., reaching very high titres (for wildtype: 3.4x10
 <sup>10</sup> RNA copies/ml and 4.7x10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu/ml), and declining thereafter (likely due to cell death at later timepoints after infection). In contrast, levels of P247A/V248A accumulated very slowly, reaching a maximum of 4.6 x10
 <sup>6</sup> RNA copies/ml and 2.8x10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu/ml at 48 h.p.i. Levels of both RNA and infectious virus for P247A/V248A also declined after 48 h.p.i. confirming that the phenotype of this mutant was not associated with a delay to virus replication. Interestingly, direct comparison of the genomic RNA quantification with the infectivity over all timepoints revealed that the specific infectivity values for all four viruses were indistinguishable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). We conclude that, although P247A/V248A exhibited a defect in production of virus particles, the virions produced were equally infectious as wildtype.
