<p>We then sought to determine if the AUD played any role in other stages of the virus lifecycle. To test this, a subset of mutations that were able to replicate in all, or some of, the mammalian cells tested (M219A, E225A and P247A/V248A), together with the nsP4 GAA mutant as negative control, were introduced into an infectious CHIKV construct, derived from the same ECSA isolate as the replicons (LR2006 OPY1) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Capped, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed virus RNA was electroporated into C2C12 cells and production of infectious virus was assessed by plaque assay of cell supernatants at 8, 24 and 48 h. post-electroporation (h.p.e.). C2C12 cells were chosen as our previous analysis had revealed that CHIKV grew to very high titres in these cells [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and they are physiologically relevant, being muscle derived. As expected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), wildtype CHIKV produced a high titre of infectious virus following electroporation of C2C12 cells whereas the nsP4 GAA mutant did not produce any infectious virus. M219A and E225A were indistinguishable from wildtype, but P247A/V248A showed a significantly lower titre (approx. 10-fold reduced). We sought to confirm that the P247A/V248A phenotype was not directly attributable to the introduced mutations, and was not influenced by reversion or compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome. To do this we generated RT-PCR amplicons spanning the entire coding sequence of the genome (primer sequences shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007239.s006">S1 Table</xref>), using RNA derived from cells at 48 h.p.e. as template (termed P0). This analysis revealed that not only was the P247A/V248A mutation retained, but there was no evidence for any compensatory mutations (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), we observed that this mutant virus had already fully reverted to the wildtype sequence at 48 h.p.e. in C2C12 cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007239.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), hence we discontinued work with this mutant. For both M219A and E225A no reversion was observed (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007239.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) so we conclude that these two residues are not required for CHIKV replication.
