<p>We then asked whether the reduced virus titre exhibited by P247A/V248A resulted from a defect in virus assembly or release from infected cells. To address this question we first analysed levels of viral genomic RNA (by qRT-PCR) and infectious virus (by plaque assay) present at 24 h.p.i. within cells infected with wildtype or the 3 mutants (at an MOI of 1). This analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) revealed that the levels of intracellular genomic RNA for wildtype, M219A and E225A were comparable whereas P247A/V248A showed a 1000-fold reduction. This was consistent with the replicon dataâ€“for P247A/V248A genomic RNA levels were reduced from a mean of 7.9 x 10
 <sup>9</sup> RNA copies/ml to 7.4x10
 <sup>6</sup>. Levels of infectious virus were similar for wildtype, M219A and E225A, however, P247A/V248A showed a dramatic 10
 <sup>7</sup>-fold reduction in the amount of intracellular infectious virus compared to wildtype: from 2.4 x 10
 <sup>8</sup> pfu/ml to 9.8 x 10
 <sup>1</sup> pfu/ml. This was paralleled by a dramatic change in the ratio of genomic RNA:infectivity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), suggesting that although P247A/V248A exhibited a defect in genome replication there was an additional, more substantial phenotype in the production of infectious virus particles. The difference in magnitude of these two phenotypes suggests that they represented different functions of the AUD. To provide further support for this observation, we performed a similar experiment in which C2C12 cells were electroporated with wildtype or the 3 mutant virus RNAs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). This analysis revealed that the ratio of extra- to intracellular virus titres was significantly higher for P247A/V248A compared to wildtype and the other two mutants. We conclude that, although P247A/V248A produces less infectious virus, this can subsequently be released from the infected cells more efficiently than wildtype and the other two mutants.
