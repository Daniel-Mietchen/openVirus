<p>To explore the RNA binding activity of nsP3 to CHIKV genomic RNA during virus replication, we exploited a previously generated derivative of the ICRES infectious clone in which a twin-strep tag (TST) was introduced in frame near the C-terminus of nsP3, allowing efficient affinity purification of nsP3 by streptactin chromatography. We had previously used this experimental approach to investigate protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions of the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We first confirmed that the presence of the TST did not adversely affect CHIKV virus replication: C2C12 cells were electroporated with either wildtype or P247A/V248A mutant CHIKV RNAs with either untagged or TST-tagged nsP3. Supernatants were harvested at 48 h.p.e and titrated by plaque assay on BHK21 cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g010">Fig 10A</xref>, the presence of the TST tag had no effect on the virus titre, but consistent with 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6</xref> the titre of the P247A/V248A mutant viruses were significantly lower than wildtype. NsP3 proteins were purified from cell lysates on streptactin beads and both lysates and precipitated material analysed by western blot for nsP3 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g010">Fig 10C</xref>), indeed the TST-P247A/V248A values were close to the limit of detection and comparable to mock (uninfected) values. To confirm these data we quantified the amount of nsP3 protein and gRNA from 3 separate experiments and determined the ratio. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g010">Fig 10D</xref>, when the gRNA:nsP3 ratio for wildtype was arbitrarily set to 1:1, the corresponding ratio for P247A/V248A was 0.095+/-0.06:1.
