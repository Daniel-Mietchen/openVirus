<p>Our data thus far are consistent with the hypothesis that the P247A/V248A mutation results in a reduction in the ability of the nsP1-4 complex to recognise and initiate transcription from the subgenomic promoter. As the AUD has been predicted to possess RNA-binding activity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and initiation of gRNA or sgRNA transcription by the nsP1-4 complex will require specific recognition of cognate RNA sequences on the CHIKV negative strand, we further postulated that the phenotype of the P247A/V248A might be explained by a defect in RNA binding activity. To test this we expressed wildtype and P247A/V248A AUD mutants in

 <italic>coli</italic> as His-Sumo fusion proteins. The AUDs were cleaved from the fusion proteins by Sumo-protease and analysed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, the AUDs could be purified to a high degree of homogeneity and exhibited the expected apparent molecular weights (~ 29 kDa). Circular dichroism (CD) analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g009">Fig 9B</xref>) revealed that, as expected, the AUDs comprised predominantly α-helix with no significant differences in the overall structure as a result of the mutations. To test for RNA-binding activity we performed a filter binding assay [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] using purified AUDs and a radiolabelled RNA corresponding to the 3′ end of the CHIKV genome (3′UTR(+)), the 3′ end of the genomic negative strand RNA (5′UTR(-)), or the negative strand subgenomic promoter (sg-prom(-)) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). Both wildtype and P247A/V248A AUD were able to bind the 3′UTR(+) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g009">Fig 9D</xref>) and 5′UTR(-) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g009">Fig 9E</xref>), however P247A/V248A exhibited a significant increase in K
 <sub>d</sub> values and decrease in maximal binding levels (endpoints) compared to wildtype. As 3′UTR(+) and 5′RNA(-) are involved in the initiation of negative and positive strand genome RNA synthesis, respectively; impaired binding of the P247A/V248A mutant AUD may explain the observed defect in CHIKV genome replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g003">Fig 3</xref>). For binding to the sg-prom(-) RNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g009">Fig 9F</xref>), P247A/V248A AUD showed a different phenotype with both a higher endpoint and K
 <sub>d</sub> than wildtype. K
 <sub>d</sub> and endpoint values are listed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g009">Fig 9G</xref>. It is intriguing that at higher concentrations the P247A/V248A AUD bound to the sg-prom(-) RNA more efficiently than wildtype, this might possibly reflect some cooperativity in binding of AUD to this RNA sequence which could be enhanced by the mutation. However this is unlikely to be physiologically relevant as it only occurs at very high AUD concentrations. Taken together, these data suggest that the P247A/V248A defect in sgRNA synthesis may be in part explained by a reduction in the ability to specifically bind the subgenomic promoter.
