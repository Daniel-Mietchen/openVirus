<p>The effect of P247A/V248A on the nsP3:gRNA interaction suggested that this mutation might also disrupt the subcellular localisation of nsP3 in relation to both replication complexes and sites of virion assembly. To test this we exploited another derivative of the ICRES infectious CHIKV clone in which ZsGreen was inserted into nsP3 at the same position as the TST tag [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. C2C12 cells were electroporated with ICRES-nsP3-ZsGreen-CHIKV RNAs (wildtype or P247A/V248A), and cells were analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with Airyscan for the distribution of nsP3, capsid (as a marker for virion assembly sites) and dsRNA (as a marker of genome replication) at different times post-electroporation. For wildtype at 4 h.p.e. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g011">Fig 11A</xref>), small clusters of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA appeared in the cytoplasm but there was little co-localisation. By 8 h.p.e., nsP3, capsid and dsRNA co-localised in larger clusters, these appeared to accumulate at the plasma membrane at 12 and 16 h.p.e., by which time the majority of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA were co-localised on plasma membrane. By 24 h.p.e., it was clear that the infection cycle was complete as there was a reduction in levels of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA. Interestingly, capsid and dsRNA were still co-localised at the plasma membrane while most nsP3 was perinuclear. To confirm these observations we quantified both the amount of nsP3 that was plasma membrane localised (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g011">Fig 11B</xref>), and the distance of nsP3 from the nuclear membrane (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g011">Fig 11C</xref>), in 5 infected cells. Both of these parameters increased steadily until 16 h.p.e., and declined sharply thereafter. In contrast, P247A/V248A exhibited a very different distribution pattern of all three markers throughout the infection cycle (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g012">Fig 12</xref>). Consistent with the western blot data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) levels of capsid were lower than wildtype at all timepoints, but in addition the co-localisation of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA at the plasma membrane was not observed. This was confirmed by quantitative analysis of both plasma membrane localisation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g012">Fig 12B</xref>), and distance from the nucleus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g012">Fig 12C</xref>) of nsP3. We confirmed that this was not due to a delay in virus replication as no plasma membrane localisation was observed even at 72 h.p.e., this is consistent with the time-course of virus production shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>. We conclude that, as well as disrupting sgRNA transcription and production of the structural proteins, the P247A/V248A mutant phenotype also manifests in a perturbation to the sub-cellular localisation of nsP3. The loss of plasma membrane localisation may contribute to the reduced level of infectious virus production.
