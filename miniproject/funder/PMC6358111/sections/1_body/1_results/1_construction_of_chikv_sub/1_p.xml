<p>To identify residues within the AUD that are conserved across the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus we first aligned the AUD amino acid sequences of a range of both Old World and New World alphaviruses (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007239.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). As the AUD sequences between SINV and CHIKV are highly conserved (118 of 243 residues are identical), the nsP2/nsP3 protein structure of SINV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was referenced to identify the putative location of each of the conserved residues. Following from the above analysis, 10 residues were chosen for further study as they were located on the surface of the protein (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007239.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) and were either absolutely conserved throughout the alphaviruses, or in other cases were substituted by residues with similar physical characteristics (specifically the corresponding residue for both Met219 and Val260 in CHIKV is leucine in SINV) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007239.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). We chose to make two single substitutions (nsP3 amino acid numbering: M219A and E225A), and four double substitutions of adjacent or closely located residues (R243A/K245A, P247A/V248A, V260A/P261A and C262A/C264A). The latter two residues were shown to be involved in zinc coordination in the SINV AUD domain [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These mutations were introduced into a CHIKV subgenomic replicon (CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), derived from the ECSA strain LR2006 OPY1 isolate [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This construct contains two luciferase reporter genes, a renilla luciferase (RLuc) is fused in frame within the C-terminal hypervariable domain of nsP3 in ORF1, and a firefly luciferase (FLuc) replaces the structural protein encoding region of ORF2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. RLuc activity is thus a measure of translation from the full-length RNA and at early time points allows assessment of both transfection efficiency and input translation. The subgenomic promoter (sg-prom) drives production of the sgRNA which requires synthesis of negative strand RNA, FLuc expression thus allows assessment of RNA replication. As a negative control we also created a polymerase-inactive mutant (GDD-GAA in the active site of nsP4).
