<p>We considered that the reason for the reduction in virus assembly exhibited by P247A/V248A could be due to a direct role of nsP3 in this process, or alternately could result from a defect in the production of the structural proteins. To test the second of these two possibilities, we analysed electroporated cells by western blot for the presence of both nsP3 and the capsid protein. P247A/V248A exhibited a modest reduction in nsP3 expression but a much greater reduction in the level of capsid expression compared to wildtype or the other two mutants. Indeed the ratio of capsid to nsP3 expression determined from the western blot analysis was approximately 10-fold lower for P247A/V248A (

During alphavirus replication the non-structural proteins (including nsP3) are translated from the full-length genomic RNA (gRNA), whereas the capsid and other structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA). Transcription of both positive sense RNAs is mediated by a complex of the four nsPs using the full-length negative strand as template. This complex either initiates transcription from the 3â€² end of the negative strand or from the subgenomic promoter. We hypothesised that the reduction in capsid expression for P247A/V248A could result from a defect in sgRNA transcription. To test this, C2C12 cells were electroporated and treated with actinomycin D (ActD) to block cellular RNA synthesis, prior to labelling with [
 <sup>3</sup>H]-uridine. Cellular RNA was extracted and analysed by MOPS-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, for wildtype, M219A and E225A, 2 radiolabelled species corresponding to gRNA and sgRNA were detected. However, for P247A/V248A, the sgRNA was present at very low levels, indeed almost undetectable. The corresponding ratio of gRNA:sgRNA for P247A/V248A (25.3:1) was significantly higher than that of wildtype (1.5:1). As controls, mock electroporated cells treated with ActD contained no [
 <sup>3</sup>H]-labelled RNA species, whereas in the absence of ActD the expected smear of [
 <sup>3</sup>H]-labelled RNAs with predominant bands corresponding to 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). To confirm these results, the harvested RNAs were also analysed by sucrose gradient centrifugation. Consistent with the electrophoretic analysis, wildtype, M219A and E225A showed two peaks corresponding to sgRNA and gRNA, whereas P247A/V248A exhibited a dramatically reduced sgRNA peak (
