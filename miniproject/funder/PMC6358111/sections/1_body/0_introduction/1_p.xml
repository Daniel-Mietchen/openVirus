<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV; family 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] is an arbovirus that causes fever, rash and arthralgia with an infrequent fatal outcome [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It was first isolated in Tanzania in 1952â€“1953 [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. During the last 50 years, numerous CHIKV re-emergences have been documented across the world, including Africa, Asia, Europe and America [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. CHIKV is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, mainly 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. The latter can reproduce in more moderate climates meaning that CHIKV has spread from Southern Africa and is now present across the Americas and parts of Southern Europe (including France and Italy). Increasing global temperatures resulting from climate change raise the concern that CHIKV will spread further. In this regard, there are no antiviral therapies or safe, effective vaccines available to treat CHIKV infection.
