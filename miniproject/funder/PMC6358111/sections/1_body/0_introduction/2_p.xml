<p>CHIKV has an 11.5 kilobase positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that is both capped and polyadenylated, and contains two open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF is translated directly from full-length genomic RNA and encodes the non-structural proteins nsP1 to nsP4. These four proteins are required for RNA synthesis–generating both negative and positive full-length genomic RNA and a smaller subgenomic RNA from which the second ORF is translated to yield the structural proteins (capsid, envelope glycoproteins E1-3 and the 6K viroporin). Biochemical functions have been ascribed to 3 of the nsPs: nsP1 exhibits methyl- and guanyl-transferase activities, nsP2 is a helicase/protease, and nsP4 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Although nsP3 plays an essential role in RNA replication, its biochemical functions remain largely undefined [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is proposed to comprise three domains: at the N-terminus is a macro-domain which exhibits both ADP-ribose and RNA binding, and ADP-ribosylhydrolase capabilities [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This is followed by the alphavirus unique domain (AUD), so called as it is only present in the 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus and is absent from the closely related Rubella virus (the sole member of the 
 <italic>Rubivirus</italic> genus within the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>), and a C-terminal hypervariable region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The latter plays an important role in virus-host interactions and may be a significant determinant of pathogenesis through interactions with cell-type specific factors [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The AUD is located in the centre of nsP3, and despite a high level of sequence homology across the alphaviruses, the function of this domain remains elusive. Of note, the structure of the Sindbis virus (SINV) AUD has been determined in the context of a pre-cleavage fragment of the polyprotein spanning the C-terminus of nsP2 (protease and methyl-transferase-like domains), and the N-terminus of nsP3 (macro-domain and AUD) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This revealed that the AUD presents a unique protein fold containing a zinc coordination site. In this study we sought to investigate the function of AUD during the virus lifecycle in cells derived from both the vertebrate host and the mosquito vector, to identify targets for antiviral intervention and means of rational attenuation for vaccine development. By mutagenic analysis we demonstrate that the AUD exhibits both species- and cell-type specific phenotypes, and plays roles in both virus genome replication and structural protein expression.
