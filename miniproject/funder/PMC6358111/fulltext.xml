Antiviral therapies and/or effective vaccines are urgently required. CHIKV biology is poorly understood, in particular the functions of the non-structural protein 3 (nsP3). Here we present the results of a mutagenic analysis of the alphavirus unique domain (AUD) of nsP3. Informed by the structure of the Sindbis virus AUD and an alignment of amino acid sequences of multiple alphaviruses, a series of mutations in the AUD were generated in a CHIKV sub-genomic replicon. This analysis revealed an essential role for the AUD in CHIKV RNA replication, with mutants exhibiting species- and cell-type specific phenotypes. To test if the AUD played a role in other stages of the virus lifecycle, the mutants were analysed in the context of infectious CHIKV. This analysis indicated that the AUD was also required for virus assembly. In particular, one mutant (P247A/V248A) exhibited a dramatic reduction in production of infectious virus. This phenotype was shown to be due to a block in transcription of the subgenomic RNA leading to reduced synthesis of the structural proteins and a concomitant reduction in virus production. This phenotype could be further explained by both a reduction in the binding of the P247A/V248A mutant nsP3 to viral genomic RNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the reduced affinity of the mutant AUD for the subgenomic promoter RNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. We propose that the AUD is a pleiotropic protein domain, with multiple functions during CHIKV RNA synthesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging threat to world health. It is transmitted by Aedes species mosquitos, and has caused massive epidemics across the globe. The virus causes fever, rash, arthritis and can sometimes be fatal. The biology of CHIKV is poorly understood, to address this deficiency we aimed to identify functions of one of the viral proteins, nsP3. We focused on the central part of this protein, termed the alphavirus unique domain (AUD) because it is unique to the genus of viruses to which CHIKV belongs&#x02013;the <italic>Alphaviruses</italic>&#x02013;and not present in other related viruses. By making changes (mutations) in the amino acid sequence of the AUD and analysing the effects of these changes we show that it is involved in multiple stages of the virus lifecycle. These observations identify nsP3 and the AUD in particular as a potential target for antiviral therapy or rational vaccine design.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>096770</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9821-1003</contrib-id><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6837-6253</contrib-id><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Yanni</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Investigator Award to MH (grant number: 096670).

It was first isolated in Tanzania in 1952&#x02013;1953 [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. During the last 50 years, numerous CHIKV re-emergences have been documented across the world, including Africa, Asia, Europe and America [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. CHIKV is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, mainly <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. The latter can reproduce in more moderate climates meaning that CHIKV has spread from Southern Africa and is now present across the Americas and parts of Southern Europe (including France and Italy). Increasing global temperatures resulting from climate change raise the concern that CHIKV will spread further. In this regard, there are no antiviral therapies or safe, effective vaccines available to treat CHIKV infection.</p><p>CHIKV has an 11.5 kilobase positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that is both capped and polyadenylated, and contains two open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF is translated directly from full-length genomic RNA and encodes the non-structural proteins nsP1 to nsP4. These four proteins are required for RNA synthesis&#x02013;generating both negative and positive full-length genomic RNA and a smaller subgenomic RNA from which the second ORF is translated to yield the structural proteins (capsid, envelope glycoproteins E1-3 and the 6K viroporin). Biochemical functions have been ascribed to 3 of the nsPs: nsP1 exhibits methyl- and guanyl-transferase activities, nsP2 is a helicase/protease, and nsP4 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Although nsP3 plays an essential role in RNA replication, its biochemical functions remain largely undefined [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. It is proposed to comprise three domains: at the N-terminus is a macro-domain which exhibits both ADP-ribose and RNA binding, and ADP-ribosylhydrolase capabilities [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This is followed by the alphavirus unique domain (AUD), so called as it is only present in the <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus and is absent from the closely related Rubella virus (the sole member of the <italic>Rubivirus</italic> genus within the <italic>Togaviridae</italic>), and a C-terminal hypervariable region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The latter plays an important role in virus-host interactions and may be a significant determinant of pathogenesis through interactions with cell-type specific factors [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The AUD is located in the centre of nsP3, and despite a high level of sequence homology across the alphaviruses, the function of this domain remains elusive. Of note, the structure of the Sindbis virus (SINV) AUD has been determined in the context of a pre-cleavage fragment of the polyprotein spanning the C-terminus of nsP2 (protease and methyl-transferase-like domains), and the N-terminus of nsP3 (macro-domain and AUD) [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This revealed that the AUD presents a unique protein fold containing a zinc coordination site. In this study we sought to investigate the function of AUD during the virus lifecycle in cells derived from both the vertebrate host and the mosquito vector, to identify targets for antiviral intervention and means of rational attenuation for vaccine development. By mutagenic analysis we demonstrate that the AUD exhibits both species- and cell-type specific phenotypes, and plays roles in both virus genome replication and structural protein expression.</p><fig id="ppat.1007239.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007239.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>(A) Schematic of the domain structure of the alphavirus nsP3 protein.

The two images show opposite faces of the structure, rotated 180<sup>o</sup> along the vertical axis. (C) Structure of CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR. This replicon was derived from the CHIKV ECSA strain LR2006 OPY1 isolate [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and is described in [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Renilla luciferase (RLuc) is expressed as an internal fusion with nsP3 and thus is produced following translation of the input RNA. RLuc activity is therefore an indirect measure of both input translation and subsequent genome replication. Firefly luciferase (FLuc) is expressed from the subgenomic promoter (sg-prom) and thus is only produced after genome replication has occurred (synthesis of negative strand RNA that subsequently templates the production of both full-length genomic and sgRNA).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1007239.g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Construction of CHIKV subgenomic replicons with AUD mutations</title><p>To identify residues within the AUD that are conserved across the <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus we first aligned the AUD amino acid sequences of a range of both Old World and New World alphaviruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007239.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). As the AUD sequences between SINV and CHIKV are highly conserved (118 of 243 residues are identical), the nsP2/nsP3 protein structure of SINV [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was referenced to identify the putative location of each of the conserved residues. Following from the above analysis, 10 residues were chosen for further study as they were located on the surface of the protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007239.s001">S1B Fig</xref>) and were either absolutely conserved throughout the alphaviruses, or in other cases were substituted by residues with similar physical characteristics (specifically the corresponding residue for both Met219 and Val260 in CHIKV is leucine in SINV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007239.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). We chose to make two single substitutions (nsP3 amino acid numbering: M219A and E225A), and four double substitutions of adjacent or closely located residues (R243A/K245A, P247A/V248A, V260A/P261A and C262A/C264A). The latter two residues were shown to be involved in zinc coordination in the SINV AUD domain [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These mutations were introduced into a CHIKV subgenomic replicon (CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), derived from the ECSA strain LR2006 OPY1 isolate [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This construct contains two luciferase reporter genes, a renilla luciferase (RLuc) is fused in frame within the C-terminal hypervariable domain of nsP3 in ORF1, and a firefly luciferase (FLuc) replaces the structural protein encoding region of ORF2 [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. RLuc activity is thus a measure of translation from the full-length RNA and at early time points allows assessment of both transfection efficiency and input translation. The subgenomic promoter (sg-prom) drives production of the sgRNA which requires synthesis of negative strand RNA, FLuc expression thus allows assessment of RNA replication. As a negative control we also created a polymerase-inactive mutant (GDD-GAA in the active site of nsP4).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>CHIKV subgenomic replicons exhibited different phenotypes in human, mammalian and mosquito cells</title><p>To analyse the effects of the AUD mutations on CHIKV genome replication, the panel of mutant CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR RNAs were transfected into a range of cell lines. As both liver and muscle are target organs for CHIKV infection we used three human cell lines. The human hepatoma cell line Huh7 is well characterised and we have previously shown that they efficiently support CHIKV replication [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To test any potential role of the AUD in protecting CHIKV from innate immune sensing we also used the Huh7 derivative Huh7.5, which have a defect in innate immunity due in part to a mutation in one allele of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, it was shown that ectopic expression of wildtype RIG-I in Huh7.5 restored the activation of IRF-3 and expression of ISGs in response to Sendai virus [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. To investigate the role of the AUD during CHIKV genome replication in muscle cells we used a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, RD. Additionally, two other mammalian (non-human) cell lines were used: C2C12 (a murine myoblast cell line) and BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney cells) based on their ability to support high levels of CHIKV replication [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Lastly, we used two mosquito (<italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>) derived cell lines: U4.4 and C6/36. Of note, C6/36 have a defect in RNA interference (RNAi) due to a frameshift mutation in the Dcr2 gene, leading to production of a truncated and inactive Dicer-2 protein [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Again, use of these cells was intended to allow us to assess any role of the AUD in counteracting mosquito innate immunity.

Wildtype CHIKV-D-Luc-SGR exhibited robust replication in these cells with FLuc levels (a measure of genome replication) increasing approx. 30-fold between 4&#x02013;12 h post-transfection (h.p.t.). Consistent with this, RLuc levels (reflecting both input translation and subsequent replication) increased between 4&#x02013;12 h.p.t., but then declined at 24 h.p.t. to input levels, possibly due to preferential transcription of the sub-genomic RNA at later times. Of the mutants M219A exhibited a modest, non-significant, reduction in replication, E225A replicated as wild type, but the other four nsP3 mutants and the nsP4 GAA mutant failed to replicate. The replication defect was indicated by either a reduction or a minimal increase in both RLuc and FLuc values from 4&#x02013;24 h.p.t. A similar picture emerged when the mutant panel was screened in Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Consistent with the defect in cytosolic RNA sensing, replication of wildtype, M219A and E225A was higher in Huh7.5 cells compared to Huh7, however, this did not allow replication of the inactive mutants. Intriguingly, this enhanced replication in Huh7.5 cells did not manifest in higher levels of RLuc expression at 12 h.p.t. compared to 4 h.p.t. (as compared to Huh7 cells), this may not be due to effects on replication but more likely reflect a preference for translation of the sgRNA. For RD human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, a slightly different picture emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g002">Fig 2C</xref>): firstly both M219A and E225A replicated to a similar level as wildtype. Secondly, the P247A/V248A mutant, which was unable to replicate in Huh7 or Huh7.5 cells, was able to replicate to a low level in RD cells.

Interestingly, although in C2C12 cells FLuc levels for P247A/V248A were reduced, the concomitant RLuc levels were higher than wildtype, suggesting that there may be a defect in either transcription of the sgRNA or translation of ORF2. These data suggested that P247 and V248 were required for CHIKV genome replication in liver-derived cells, whilst enhancing but not essential for replication in cells derived from muscle or kidney, implying some cell-type specific interactions of nsP3.

We therefore proceeded to evaluate the replicative capacity of the mutant panel in cells derived from the <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito. Two cell lines were used: U4.4 and C6/36. The major difference between these two cell lines is that C6/36 have a defect in the RNAi response due to a frameshift mutation in the Dcr2 gene [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Consistent with this, although both mosquito cell lines supported robust replication, C6/36 supported higher levels than U4.4 (up to 1000-fold increase at 48 h.p.t.). As described below, we observed remarkable differences in the mutant phenotypes in these cells compared to the mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The first difference was that M219A failed to replicate in U4.4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) but exhibited wildtype levels of replication in C6/36 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), suggesting that M219 might be involved in interacting with, and inhibiting, the mosquito cell RNAi pathway. Secondly, R243A/K245A, which was unable to replicate in human cell lines and only showed low replication level in the C2C12 cells, was fully replication competent in both mosquito cell lines. Mutant P247A/V248A was partially replication competent in both cell lines, whereas as seen in mammalian cell lines neither V260A/P261A nor C262A/C264A replicated in mosquito cells.</p><fig id="ppat.1007239.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007239.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>CHIKV AUD mutant replication in <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquito cells.</title><p>U4.4 (A) or C6/36 cells (B) were transfected with CHIKV-D-luc-SGR wildtype (WT) and mutant RNAs and harvested for both renilla and firefly luciferase assay at the indicated time points.

We considered that a simple explanation might be that the mutations had reverted to wildtype in mosquito cell lines. To test this we extracted cytoplasmic RNA from transfected C2C12, U4.4 and C6/36 cells, and subjected them to RT-PCR and sequence analysis. In C2C12 cells at 48 h.p.t. we did not observe any sign of reversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g004">Fig 4C</xref>)&#x02013;the sequence remained the same as the input RNA. However, for both U4.4 at 48 h.p.t., and C6/36 samples the sequence traces revealed the presence of a mixed population of mutant and wildtype. Notably we observed a sequential accumulation of revertants in the C6/36 samples: At 24 h.p.t. a very low proportion of revertants at the first position in the two codons was seen, at 48 h.p.t. the proportion increased and at 72 h.p.t. the sequences were almost entirely wildtype. These data are consistent with a requirement for R243 and K245 for efficient CHIKV genome replication.</p><p>We wished to confirm that none of the phenotypes observed were due to destabilisation of the protein, however the lack of replication of some mutants meant that it was not possible to detect nsP3 by western blotting of replicon transfected cell lysates.

To test this, a subset of mutations that were able to replicate in all, or some of, the mammalian cells tested (M219A, E225A and P247A/V248A), together with the nsP4 GAA mutant as negative control, were introduced into an infectious CHIKV construct, derived from the same ECSA isolate as the replicons (LR2006 OPY1) [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

C2C12 cells were chosen as our previous analysis had revealed that CHIKV grew to very high titres in these cells [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and they are physiologically relevant, being muscle derived. As expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), wildtype CHIKV produced a high titre of infectious virus following electroporation of C2C12 cells whereas the nsP4 GAA mutant did not produce any infectious virus. M219A and E225A were indistinguishable from wildtype, but P247A/V248A showed a significantly lower titre (approx. 10-fold reduced). We sought to confirm that the P247A/V248A phenotype was not directly attributable to the introduced mutations, and was not influenced by reversion or compensatory mutations elsewhere in the genome. To do this we generated RT-PCR amplicons spanning the entire coding sequence of the genome (primer sequences shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007239.s006">S1 Table</xref>), using RNA derived from cells at 48 h.p.e. as template (termed P0).

We reasoned that this might reflect a defect in either virus production or spread that could be masked in the electroporation procedure due to the high level of input RNA. To test this we performed a one-step growth assay by infecting C2C12 cells at an MOI of 0.1 with either wildtype CHIKV or the 3 mutants (M219A, E225A and P247A/V248A). Cell supernatants were harvested at various times post infection (h.p.i.) and analysed for genomic RNA by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), and infectivity by plaque assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). In order to exclude the possibility that the P247A/V248A mutant phenotype resulted in a delay to virus replication we extended this analysis to 96 h.p.i. Wildtype, M219A and E225A showed a rapid increase in both genomic RNA and infectivity between 8&#x02013;48 h.p.i., reaching very high titres (for wildtype: 3.4x10<sup>10</sup> RNA copies/ml and 4.7x10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml), and declining thereafter (likely due to cell death at later timepoints after infection). In contrast, levels of P247A/V248A accumulated very slowly, reaching a maximum of 4.6 x10<sup>6</sup> RNA copies/ml and 2.8x10<sup>5</sup> pfu/ml at 48 h.p.i. Levels of both RNA and infectious virus for P247A/V248A also declined after 48 h.p.i. confirming that the phenotype of this mutant was not associated with a delay to virus replication. Interestingly, direct comparison of the genomic RNA quantification with the infectivity over all timepoints revealed that the specific infectivity values for all four viruses were indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). We conclude that, although P247A/V248A exhibited a defect in production of virus particles, the virions produced were equally infectious as wildtype.</p><p>We then asked whether the reduced virus titre exhibited by P247A/V248A resulted from a defect in virus assembly or release from infected cells. To address this question we first analysed levels of viral genomic RNA (by qRT-PCR) and infectious virus (by plaque assay) present at 24 h.p.i. within cells infected with wildtype or the 3 mutants (at an MOI of 1). This analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) revealed that the levels of intracellular genomic RNA for wildtype, M219A and E225A were comparable whereas P247A/V248A showed a 1000-fold reduction. This was consistent with the replicon data&#x02013;for P247A/V248A genomic RNA levels were reduced from a mean of 7.9 x 10<sup>9</sup> RNA copies/ml to 7.4x10<sup>6</sup>. Levels of infectious virus were similar for wildtype, M219A and E225A, however, P247A/V248A showed a dramatic 10<sup>7</sup>-fold reduction in the amount of intracellular infectious virus compared to wildtype: from 2.4 x 10<sup>8</sup> pfu/ml to 9.8 x 10<sup>1</sup> pfu/ml. This was paralleled by a dramatic change in the ratio of genomic RNA:infectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g007">Fig 7B</xref>), suggesting that although P247A/V248A exhibited a defect in genome replication there was an additional, more substantial phenotype in the production of infectious virus particles. The difference in magnitude of these two phenotypes suggests that they represented different functions of the AUD. To provide further support for this observation, we performed a similar experiment in which C2C12 cells were electroporated with wildtype or the 3 mutant virus RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). This analysis revealed that the ratio of extra- to intracellular virus titres was significantly higher for P247A/V248A compared to wildtype and the other two mutants.

To test the second of these two possibilities, we analysed electroporated cells by western blot for the presence of both nsP3 and the capsid protein. P247A/V248A exhibited a modest reduction in nsP3 expression but a much greater reduction in the level of capsid expression compared to wildtype or the other two mutants. Indeed the ratio of capsid to nsP3 expression determined from the western blot analysis was approximately 10-fold lower for P247A/V248A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). During alphavirus replication the non-structural proteins (including nsP3) are translated from the full-length genomic RNA (gRNA), whereas the capsid and other structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA). Transcription of both positive sense RNAs is mediated by a complex of the four nsPs using the full-length negative strand as template. This complex either initiates transcription from the 3&#x02032; end of the negative strand or from the subgenomic promoter. We hypothesised that the reduction in capsid expression for P247A/V248A could result from a defect in sgRNA transcription. To test this, C2C12 cells were electroporated and treated with actinomycin D (ActD) to block cellular RNA synthesis, prior to labelling with [<sup>3</sup>H]-uridine. Cellular RNA was extracted and analysed by MOPS-formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g008">Fig 8B</xref>, for wildtype, M219A and E225A, 2 radiolabelled species corresponding to gRNA and sgRNA were detected.

As 3&#x02032;UTR(+) and 5&#x02032;RNA(-) are involved in the initiation of negative and positive strand genome RNA synthesis, respectively; impaired binding of the P247A/V248A mutant AUD may explain the observed defect in CHIKV genome replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g003">Fig 3</xref>). For binding to the sg-prom(-) RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g009">Fig 9F</xref>), P247A/V248A AUD showed a different phenotype with both a higher endpoint and K<sub>d</sub> than wildtype. K<sub>d</sub> and endpoint values are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g009">Fig 9G</xref>. It is intriguing that at higher concentrations the P247A/V248A AUD bound to the sg-prom(-) RNA more efficiently than wildtype, this might possibly reflect some cooperativity in binding of AUD to this RNA sequence which could be enhanced by the mutation. However this is unlikely to be physiologically relevant as it only occurs at very high AUD concentrations. Taken together, these data suggest that the P247A/V248A defect in sgRNA synthesis may be in part explained by a reduction in the ability to specifically bind the subgenomic promoter.</p><fig id="ppat.1007239.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007239.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title><italic>In vitro</italic> AUD RNA-binding activity.</title><p>(A) <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> expressed AUD (wildtype (WT) and P247A/V248A) were analysed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Brilliant blue staining.

We had previously used this experimental approach to investigate protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions of the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We first confirmed that the presence of the TST did not adversely affect CHIKV virus replication: C2C12 cells were electroporated with either wildtype or P247A/V248A mutant CHIKV RNAs with either untagged or TST-tagged nsP3. Supernatants were harvested at 48 h.p.e and titrated by plaque assay on BHK21 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g010">Fig 10A</xref>, the presence of the TST tag had no effect on the virus titre, but consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6</xref> the titre of the P247A/V248A mutant viruses were significantly lower than wildtype. NsP3 proteins were purified from cell lysates on streptactin beads and both lysates and precipitated material analysed by western blot for nsP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g010">Fig 10B</xref>) and qRT-PCR to determine the amount of gRNA associated with nsP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g010">Fig 10C</xref>).

To confirm these data we quantified the amount of nsP3 protein and gRNA from 3 separate experiments and determined the ratio. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g010">Fig 10D</xref>, when the gRNA:nsP3 ratio for wildtype was arbitrarily set to 1:1, the corresponding ratio for P247A/V248A was 0.095+/-0.06:1.</p><fig id="ppat.1007239.g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007239.g010</object-id><label>Fig 10</label><caption><title>CHIKV genome RNA association with nsP3 during virus replication.</title><p>C2C12 cells were electroporated with ICRES nsP3-TST or untagged ICRES RNAs (wildtype (WT) and P247A/V248A).

To test this we exploited another derivative of the ICRES infectious CHIKV clone in which ZsGreen was inserted into nsP3 at the same position as the TST tag [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. C2C12 cells were electroporated with ICRES-nsP3-ZsGreen-CHIKV RNAs (wildtype or P247A/V248A), and cells were analysed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with Airyscan for the distribution of nsP3, capsid (as a marker for virion assembly sites) and dsRNA (as a marker of genome replication) at different times post-electroporation. For wildtype at 4 h.p.e. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g011">Fig 11A</xref>), small clusters of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA appeared in the cytoplasm but there was little co-localisation. By 8 h.p.e., nsP3, capsid and dsRNA co-localised in larger clusters, these appeared to accumulate at the plasma membrane at 12 and 16 h.p.e., by which time the majority of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA were co-localised on plasma membrane. By 24 h.p.e., it was clear that the infection cycle was complete as there was a reduction in levels of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA. Interestingly, capsid and dsRNA were still co-localised at the plasma membrane while most nsP3 was perinuclear. To confirm these observations we quantified both the amount of nsP3 that was plasma membrane localised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g011">Fig 11B</xref>), and the distance of nsP3 from the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g011">Fig 11C</xref>), in 5 infected cells. Both of these parameters increased steadily until 16 h.p.e., and declined sharply thereafter. In contrast, P247A/V248A exhibited a very different distribution pattern of all three markers throughout the infection cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g012">Fig 12</xref>). Consistent with the western blot data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g008">Fig 8A</xref>) levels of capsid were lower than wildtype at all timepoints, but in addition the co-localisation of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA at the plasma membrane was not observed. This was confirmed by quantitative analysis of both plasma membrane localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g012">Fig 12B</xref>), and distance from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g012">Fig 12C</xref>) of nsP3. We confirmed that this was not due to a delay in virus replication as no plasma membrane localisation was observed even at 72 h.p.e., this is consistent with the time-course of virus production shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>. We conclude that, as well as disrupting sgRNA transcription and production of the structural proteins, the P247A/V248A mutant phenotype also manifests in a perturbation to the sub-cellular localisation of nsP3. The loss of plasma membrane localisation may contribute to the reduced level of infectious virus production.</p><fig id="ppat.1007239.g011" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007239.g011</object-id><label>Fig 11</label><caption><title>Fluorescence microscopy analysis of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA distribution during infection of C2C12 cells with wildtype CHIKV.</title><p>C2C12 cells were electroporated with ICRES-nsP3-ZsGreen-CHIKV RNA.

The protein consists of three domains, the N-terminal of which has been identified as a macrodomain that binds to ADP-ribose and possesses ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent studies have proposed a role for this enzymatic activity in virus pathogenesis but as yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The C-terminal hypervariable domain differs dramatically in amino acid sequence between different alphaviruses and is intrinsically disordered. It has been shown to interact with a range of cellular proteins, including components of stress granules [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], and is implicated in the assembly of virus genome replication complexes.</p><p>In contrast, we know virtually nothing about the function of the central AUD domain. The fact that this domain is highly conserved between different alphaviruses suggests that it plays a fundamental role in the virus lifecycle. Detailed structural information about the AUD is available however, as the partial structure of the SINV nsP2-nsP3 precursor, including the C-terminal protease and methyltransferase-like domains of nsP2 and the macro and AUD domains of nsP3, has been determined [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This analysis revealed that the AUD contained an unique zinc-binding fold with four cysteine residues coordinating a zinc molecule, this formed part of a putative RNA binding surface. Mutagenesis of two of these cysteines revealed an essential role in virus replication. Our data agree with this observation, as the C262A/C264A mutant failed to replicate in any cell type tested.</p><p>Mutation of two residues adjacent to the zinc-binding cysteines, V260A/P261A, also completely abrogated CHIKV genome replication. Although adjacent in the primary amino acid sequence, these residues are located on the distal face of the AUD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), suggesting that they are not involved in zinc binding, but may instead interact with key cellular factor(s) or play an alternative structural role.</p><p>In contrast, the other mutants generated during this study exhibited a number of distinct cell-type and species-specific phenotypes (summarised in <xref rid="ppat.1007239.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Mutation of two surface exposed basic residues (R243 and K245) abrogated replication in all mammalian cells but showed full replication capability in mosquito cells. However, this apparent discrepancy could be explained by the observation that these two mutations rapidly reverted to wildtype in mosquito cells but failed to do so in C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These data indicate that R243 and K245 are required for CHIKV genome replication. We do not have an explanation for why R243A/K245A, but not the other lethal mutations, was able to revert in mosquito cells. However it is noteworthy that the reversion to the wildtype sequence took 72 h in C6/36 cells, suggesting that perhaps the lack of cytopathology of CHIKV replication in mosquito cells could facilitate the replication of a minority species. Interestingly, the sequence trace at 24 h in C6/36 shows the presence of such a minority species that would encode a Thr at 243 and 245, suggesting that the two basic residues are not absolutely required.</p><table-wrap id="ppat.1007239.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007239.t001</object-id><label>Table

M219A replicated well in C6/36 mosquito cells and the key difference between these two cell lines is that C6/36 have a defect in the RNAi response due to a Dcr2 mutation [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We propose therefore that M219 may be involved in the interaction of nsP3 with a component of the mosquito RNAi response to inhibit this key mosquito antiviral pathway. We are currently undertaking proteomic and functional analysis to test this hypothesis.</p><p>In the second part of this study we focused on P247A/V248A to address the molecular mechanism underpinning the phenotype of this mutant. In the context of the subgenomic replicon P247A/V248A showed a variety of phenotypes from complete lack of replication in Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g002">Fig 2</xref>), to a 10-fold reduction in other mammalian and mosquito cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g003">Fig 3</xref>). It is intriguing that the P247A/V248A mutant exhibited a cell-type and species-specific phenotype as this implies that a cell factor may contribute to the phenotype. For example, a cell factor that is not expressed in Huh7 cells might be involved in the function of nsP3 in transcribing the subgenomic RNA. An alternative explanation is that Huh7 and Huh7.5 cells support lower levels of CHIKV replication than all of the other cell types in this study. The fold increase in FLuc values between 4&#x02013;12 h.p.e. was 36-fold (Huh7) and 94-fold (Huh7.5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This compared to 150-fold (RD), 740-fold (C2C12), 250-fold (BHK), 177-fold (U4.4) and 310-fold (C6/36). These overall higher levels of replication may have resulted in the P247A/V248A values rising above the threshold for detection. Virus data in C2C12 cells were consistent with replicon results: following electroporation of viral RNA P247A/V248A showed a modest but significant defect in virus infectivity and exhibited a small plaque phenotype. Further study indicated that P247A/V248A was competent in virus entry and virus release, however, it exhibited a major defect in assembly of infectious virus particles. This defect led to both a delay and a reduction in the release of infectious virus, consistent with the small plaque phenotype. The molecular mechanism underpinning the P247A/V248A defect was shown to be a reduction in subgenomic RNA synthesis, leading to a concomitant reduction in the expression of the structural proteins. It is noteworthy that when analysed in the context of the replicon in C2C12 cells, the P247A/V248A mutant exhibited a 10-fold reduction in FLuc, but RLuc was higher than wildtype. This is also consistent with a defect in transcription of the subgenomic mRNA. The reduced affinity of P247A/V248A AUD for the CHIKV sg-prom(-) RNA as demonstrated by the RNA filter binding assay may help to explain this, but it is possible that other effects of P247A/V248A, such as aberrant host protein recruitment, may also help to explain the defect in subgenomic RNA synthesis. Of note, P247A/V248A AUD also exhibited impaired binding to the 3&#x02032;UTR(+) and 5&#x02032;RNA(-) <italic>in vitro</italic>, and also bound less genomic RNA <italic>in vivo</italic>, compared to wildtype, consistent with an overall defect in RNA replication. However, it is important to note that whilst there was a difference between wildtype and P247A/V248A in the ratio of genomic RNA to nsP3 in TST precipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g010">Fig 10D</xref>), this may have resulted, at least in part, from the reduced abundance of genomic RNA in the P247A/V248A infected cells. Previous studies have also shown that nsP3 is important for initial replication complex formation and negative strand RNA synthesis [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Taken together we propose that the AUD plays a critical role in all stages of CHIKV RNA synthesis, but particularly in the transcription of the sgRNA.</p><p>Analysis of the distribution of nsP3, capsid and dsRNA during CHIKV replication by confocal microscopy revealed further insights into the P247A/V248A phenotype. Wildtype nsP3 exhibited a high level of co-localisation with dsRNA at all time points up to 16 h.p.e. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g011">Fig 11A</xref>), consistent with the role of nsP3 in genome replication. At 12 and 16 h.p.e., both nsP3 and dsRNA also co-localised with capsid and were concentrated at the plasma membrane. In contrast, P247A/V248A nsP3 showed not only a reduction in the co-localisation with dsRNA, but also a loss of the plasma membrane accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007239.g012">Fig 12A</xref>). A simple explanation for this observation is that capsid accumulates at the plasma membrane and recruits both nsP3 and dsRNA, and this was perturbed by the low level of capsid expression exhibited by the P247A/V248A mutant. However we cannot rule out the possibility that there is a role for nsP3 (and the AUD in particular) in coordinating the processes of genome replication and virus assembly to facilitate production of infectious virus particles at the plasma membrane. This is in agreement with early evidence for a juxtaposition of sites of genome replication, viral protein translation and nucleocapsid assembly in the case of Sindbis virus [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition it may be that nsP3 has a role in the trafficking of nucleocapsids from these sites (cytoplasmic vacuoles (CPVs)) to the plasma membrane.</p><p>In conclusion we propose that the nsP3 AUD is a multi-functional domain. It is not only a critical determinant of both cell and species-specificity, but also plays roles in virus genome replication and assembly. The rational mutagenesis of the CHIKV AUD described here is the first detailed structure-function analysis of this domain and raises many questions. In particular, we need to determine what cellular and viral proteins are interaction partners for the AUD, and investigate how these interactions shed light on the phenotypes of AUD mutants? We expect that our current proteomic analysis, exploiting both a novel SNAP-tagged nsP3 recently developed in our laboratory [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and a twin-strep tag (TST) approach which we recently used to identify interacting partners of the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein [<xref rid="ppat.1007239.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], will provide some of the answers to these questions. We also hope that these studies will help to identify targets for antiviral intervention and means of rational attenuation for vaccine development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec011"><title>Sequence alignment</title><p>AUD amino acid sequences from a number of different alphaviruses (Sindbis, Ockelbo, O&#x02019;Nyong-Nyong, Ross River, Semliki Forest, Fort Morgan, Venezuelan, Eastern and Western Equine Encephalitis, Highlands-J and CHIKV) were obtained from NCBI and aligned by Clustal Omega.
