<p id="Par9">Attraction towards human odor of each species was estimated as a percentage of trapped females that were caught in the trap with human odor. This index of attraction varies from 0% (full attraction to CO
 <sub>2</sub> without human odor) to 100% (full attraction to CO
 <sub>2</sub> with human odor), with 50% indicating a neutral behavior (no effect of the human odor). To rule out any bias in the intrinsic attractiveness of the traps, we also performed control CO
 <sub>2</sub> only vs. CO
 <sub>2</sub> only experiments for each species. In the control experiments, 51% (95% CI: 36.8–65.2) of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females and 56.2% (95% CI: 28.9–83.6) of 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> females chose one trap over the other. For both species, the percentage of mosquitoes in each trap did not significantly differ from 50%, which confirmed the lack of bias between the traps. As expected, 87.5% (95% CI: 81.9–93.1) of trapped 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> females chose the trap with human odor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>), indicating significant attraction to human odor. In contrast, 33.3% (95% CI: 14.3–52.3) of trapped 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> chose the trap with human odor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>), and this percentage was not statistically different from 50% indicating a lack of response to human odor. Accordingly, relative attraction towards human odor was significantly lower for 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> than for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Overall, these experiments revealed that 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> was not attracted to human odor (i.e., it did not specifically choose the trap containing the human odor), but was activated by human odor (i.e., it initiated flight and host-seeking behavior) as more females responded to the combination of CO
 <sub>2</sub> and human odor than to CO
 <sub>2</sub> alone.
