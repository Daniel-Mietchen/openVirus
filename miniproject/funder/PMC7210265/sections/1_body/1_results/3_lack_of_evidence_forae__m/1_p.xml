<p id="Par8">In addition to vector competence, the ability of 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> to act as an arbovirus bridge vector depends on its human-biting behavior. A typical bridge vector is expected to display an intermediate level of attraction to humans, so that it bites humans and non-human animals in alternation. To assess its probability of human biting, we measured the attraction of 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> to human odor using a dual-port olfactometer. Flight activity in the presence of human scent (i.e., in the CO
 <sub>2</sub> + Human odor vs. CO
 <sub>2</sub> only design) was significantly lower (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) for 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> than for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with 70.7% (111/157) and 86.2% (213/247) of females exiting the release chamber after 20 min, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). However, the flight activity of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was not significantly influenced (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.997) by human odor as 86.9% (146/168) of females exited the release chamber in the CO
 <sub>2</sub> only vs. CO
 <sub>2</sub> only design (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>), whereas the flight activity of 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> was significantly enhanced (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.002) in the presence of human odor with 49.1% (57/116) exiting the release chamber in the CO
 <sub>2</sub> only vs. CO
 <sub>2</sub> only design (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>).
