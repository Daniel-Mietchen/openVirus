<p id="Par2">Many emerging arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) of humans such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever and chikungunya viruses originated in sylvatic transmission cycles where they circulate between vertebrate animals and forest-dwelling mosquitoes

 </sup>. Over the last few centuries, these arboviruses have emerged into sustained transmission cycles among humans, causing substantial mortality and morbidity. Zoonotic arboviruses are typically brought into the human population by mosquitoes referred to as bridge vectors, which make the link between sylvatic and human transmission cycles. Bridge vectors are competent for arbovirus transmission and display host-feeding behavior towards both humans and non-human animals. The emergence or re-emergence of sylvatic arboviruses into the human population is an important public health concern
