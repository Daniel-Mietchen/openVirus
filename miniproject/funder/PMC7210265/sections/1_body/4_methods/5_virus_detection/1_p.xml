<p id="Par22">In DENV-1 experiments, bodies were homogenized individually in 300 µL of PBS. Body homogenates were centrifuged and viral RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA Virus kit (Macherey-Nagel) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Detection of DENV-1 RNA was performed with the EXPRESS one-step Superscript qRT-PCR kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the following program: 30 min at 45 °C, 2 min at 95 °C, 55 cycles of 15 sec at 95 °C and 30 sec at 60 °C with a final step of 2 min at 25 °C. The 25-µL reaction volume contained 1x of reaction mix, 1.4 µM of primers, 5 µM of probe (forward: 5′-AAGGACTAGAGGTTAKAGGAGACCC-3′; reverse: 5′- CGWTCTGTGCCTGGAWTGATG-3′; probe: 5′-TCTGGTCTTTCCCAGCGTCAATATGCTGTT-3′)

 </sup> and 5 µL of RNA extract. In the YFV experiment, viral RNA was extracted by grinding bodies individually in 300 µL of squash buffer (Tris 10 mM, NaCl 50 mM, EDTA 1.27 mM with final pH adjusted to 8.2) supplemented with proteinase K (1 µL for 55.5 µL of squash buffer) and by incubating 100 µL of body homogenates for 5 min at 56 °C followed by 10 min at 98 °C. Detection of YFV RNA was performed using a two-step RT-PCR reaction to generate a 192-bp amplicon located in a conserved region of the

Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA with random hexamers using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific) using the following program: 10 min at 25 °C, 50 min at 37 °C and 15 min at 70 °C. The cDNA was subsequently amplified using DreamTaq DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher Scientific). The 20-µL reaction volume contained 1x of reaction mix and 10 µM of primers (forward: 5′-GCGTAAGGCTGGAAAGAGTG-3′; reverse: 5′-CTTCCTCCCTTCATCCACAA-3′)

 </sup>. The thermocycling program was 2 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of 30 sec at 95 °C, 30 sec at 60 °C, and 30 sec at 72 °C with a final extension step of 7 min at 72 °C. Amplicons were visualized by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. In all experiments, mosquito heads were homogenized in 300 µL of Leibovitz’s L-15 medium supplemented with 2% FBS, centrifuged, and assayed by a qualitative version (without end-point dilution) of the FFA described above.
