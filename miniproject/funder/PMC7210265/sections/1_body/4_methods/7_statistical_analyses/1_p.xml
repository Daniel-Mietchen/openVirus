 </sup>. Vector competence was evaluated using four conventional indices. Infection rate (IR) was estimated as the proportion of blood-fed females that became infected. Dissemination rate (DR) was estimated as the proportion of infected females that developed a systemic infection (i.e., with an infected head). Transmission rate (TR) was estimated as the proportion of females with a disseminated infection that released virus in their saliva. Transmission efficiency (TE) is a summary metric estimated as the overall proportion of blood-fed females with virus-positive saliva. Vector competence indices (IR, DR, TR and TE) were analyzed with a logistic regression model in which each individual mosquito was associated with a binary variable (infected = 1, uninfected = 0), followed by an analysis of deviance with the R package

 </sup>. For DENV experiments, the initial statistical model included the species, the experiment and their interaction as explanatory variables. The experiment effect between the two DENV experiments was statistically non-significant overall and subsequently removed from the model. In the olfactometer bioassays, flight activity and attraction to human odor were analyzed using a logistic regression model where each individual mosquito was associated with a binary variable (flight activity: active = 1, inactive = 0; attraction: trap 1 = 0, trap 2 = 1), followed by an analysis of deviance with the R package
