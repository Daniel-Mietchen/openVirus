 </sup>. Briefly, 8-day-old females starved for 24 hours were offered an artificial infectious blood meal in 3 rounds of 15 minutes using a Hemotek membrane-feeding apparatus with porcine intestine as membrane. Blood meals consisted of a 2:1 mix of washed erythrocytes (rabbit erythrocytes for DENV experiments and human erythrocytes for the YFV experiment) and virus suspension. Human erythrocytes were obtained in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations through a protocol approved by the French Ethical Committee Ile-de-France I, as described above. Adenosine triphosphate (Merck) was added as a phagostimulant

 <sup>7</sup> focus-forming units (FFUs)/mL of DENV-1. In the YFV experiment, they were exposed to 1.84 ×10
 <sup>6</sup> FFUs/mL of YFV. Fully engorged females were sorted on wet ice, transferred into 1-pint cardboard containers and maintained in a climatic chamber (28 °C, 70% relative humidity, 12:12 hour light cycle) with permanent access to 10% sucrose solution. Fourteen days after the blood meal, mosquitoes were cold-anesthetized to remove wings and legs for DENV experiments or paralyzed with triethylamine for the YFV experiment

 </sup>. The proboscis of each female was inserted into a 20-µL pipet tip containing 5 µL of fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 30 minutes of salivation, head and body were separated and stored individually at −80 °C. The saliva-containing FBS was mixed with 45 µL of Leibovitz’s L-15 medium and immediately inoculated onto sub-confluent C6/36 cells for titration by FFA, as described above, without subsequent dilution.
