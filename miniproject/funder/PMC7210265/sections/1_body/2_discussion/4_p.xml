<p id="Par13">A human-baited trap survey demonstrated that this peridomestic 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> in Singapore displayed an anthropophilic behavior
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>
 </sup>, as was also documented for other field populations of 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> in South-East Asia

 </sup>. The discrepancy between the present and the earlier studies could be due to several, non-mutually exclusive explanations. First, there could be biological differences in human-biting behavior between different populations of the same species, as was observed for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>

 </sup>. Second, behavioral assays in the laboratory may lack critical cues underlying host-seeking behavior in the field. Indeed, multiple sensory modalities such as CO
 <sub>2</sub>, heat and visual cues that were not present in our simplified laboratory approach may contribute to attract 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> to feed on humans in a natural situation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, volatiles were collected from the foot only and 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> might not respond to foot odor since metabolites and volatiles largely vary according to the human body part

 </sup>. Additionally, the human-associated microbial flora may have been largely eliminated during −20 °C storage of the stocking used to collect human odor. Although our behavioral bioassay successfully detected a strong attraction of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to human scent, it is possible that for 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> the experimental setup did not faithfully represent a natural situation. Additionally, the fact that more 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> responded to the combination of CO
 <sub>2</sub> and human odor than CO
 <sub>2</sub> only indicated that they were activated by human odor, implying that human odor was enough to initiate flight and stimulate the beginning of a host location response, but perhaps not follow through to closer-range behavior. It would be interesting to increase the complexity of the sensory signals available for the mosquitoes to better mimic the natural conditions, for example using a live host olfactometer assay
