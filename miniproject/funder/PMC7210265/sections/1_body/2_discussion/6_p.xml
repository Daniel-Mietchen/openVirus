<p id="Par15">Dengue is endemic in Laos with the circulation of at least three serotypes (i.e., DENV-1, -2 and -4) all year long and yearly epidemics during the rainy season

 </sup>. Dengue epidemics occur not only in urban areas, but also in more rural settings. For instance, an outbreak of DENV-1 was detected in 2008 in a remote village of northwestern Laos

 </sup>. DENV circulation in rural Laos increases the risk of spillback transmission to NHPs because most of the people living in rural Laos still depend on the forest to sustain themselves. Moreover, one of the goals of WMPA is to develop ecotourism in the NNT NPA. Similar projects exist in the country or are in development. Therefore, infected travelers represent another possible source of DENV introduction or re-introduction into the sylvatic environment. This risk is likely under-estimated as humans can transmit DENV to mosquitoes in the absence of clinical symptoms
