<p id="Par12">The results obtained with this sylvatic population of 
 <italic>Ae. malayensis</italic> in Laos should not be extrapolated to other populations of the species. Indeed, vector competence of a mosquito species for an arbovirus depends on the specific combination of the mosquito and the virus genotypes
