<p>A key feature of the model framework is its description of human movement on a small network [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Nodes (settlements) are considered with their own distinct host/vector populations and disease dynamics, but with the assumption that hosts may travel from their home settlement to another location (perhaps a place of work). Primarily, we will focus on a ‘hub-spoke’ network, where several satellite town settlements have a percentage of their populations migrate into a central city settlement temporarily, before returning to their home settlement.
