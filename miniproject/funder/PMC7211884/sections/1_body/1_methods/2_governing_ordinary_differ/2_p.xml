<p>For the dengue disease management, our optimal control problem has been developed around a mathematical framework presented by Hendron &amp; Bonsall [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The model describes the population dynamics of both vectors and hosts by describing the complex epidemiology associated with dengue infections. These states are summarized in 
 <xref rid="RSOS181843TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>, and schematics of this epidemiology are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181843F1">figure 1</xref>. For the dengue epidemiology, the model framework only considers two potential serotypes (labelled 
 <italic>A</italic> and 
 <italic>B</italic>). As well as simplifying the necessary mathematics, it is unusual for more than two serotypes to be in circulation in a small population at one time [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Dengue infections lead to complex individual host patterns of infection, and two distinct serotypes can create two possible routes of infection (as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181843F1">figure 1</xref>).
