 <italic>b</italic>). Upon hatching, mosquitoes start in a juvenile state (
 <italic>J</italic>), where they cannot yet bite a host. Eventually, they mature into an adult state (
 <italic>M</italic>) susceptible to dengue virus infection. Upon biting an infected host, these mature mosquitoes then enter a state of infection with either serotype 
 <italic>A</italic> or 
 <italic>B</italic> (
 <italic>X</italic> or 
 <italic>Y</italic>, respectively). It has been shown experimentally that 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes will resist infection of a second serotype [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], hence our assumption that mosquitoes may be infected with serotype 
 <italic>A</italic> or 
 <italic>B</italic>, but not both.
