<p>A more in-depth introduction and explanation of optimal control problems is given in the electronic supplementary material, S1 appendix. In short, these are problems whereby a certain objective is desired, and is limited by certain constraints. In our particular case, we wish to minimize the number of infected individuals; however, we are limited in some form by how much we can apply disease-prevention methods, both logistically and economically. An optimal control problem is most commonly formulated around a model of differential equations, explaining the interaction between several variables of interest. These variables are denoted as either 
 <bold>state variables</bold>, variables which cannot be directly impacted, or as 
 <bold>control variables</bold>, variables that can be directly altered. In our case, our control variables are 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="IM21">
   <msubsup>
    <mi>u</mi>
    <mrow>
     <mn>1</mn>
    </mrow>
    <mi>i</mi>
   </msubsup>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>, the proportion of individuals in settlement 
 <italic>i</italic> being vaccinated, and 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="IM22">
   <msubsup>
    <mi>u</mi>
    <mrow>
     <mn>2</mn>
    </mrow>
    <mi>i</mi>
   </msubsup>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> the proportion of the total possible SIT mosquitoes, 
 <italic>Ïˆ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>, being released into settlement 
 <italic>i</italic>. Owing to the ongoing research and development of the Dengvaxia vaccine, we do not attempt to simulate the specific attributes of this particular vaccine. We instead consider application of the vaccine to the naive population, representing an idealized aim of this sort of treatment. All other variables are state variables, as we cannot directly change these variables, and they instead change dynamically as we alter our control variables.
