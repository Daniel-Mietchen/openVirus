<p>The choice of the objective functional is a key assumption in an optimal control problem, as we impose structure upon the system. As such, it is important to mention the impact that different choices of formulation can have on the final results. One simplification we make is to combine both primary and secondary infections under the same cost value, 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>. This is despite secondary infections resulting in a more severe host response as mentioned above. This decision was made owing to, firstly, a lack of information as to the likely increase in hospitalization costs within an already wide spectrum of treatment costs between cases. Secondly, the model dynamics show that secondary infections will always be less populous than primary infections, and the impact of control measures within our case studies reduce secondary infections to a near-negligible level. Thirdly, the underlying dynamics of the objective functional represents a balance between minimizing infected individuals and minimizing the application of control measures, creating a ‘tug-of-war’ effect. As such, and as model simulations showed, the dynamical behaviour of our optimal solution reacted such that increasing 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> would be dynamically equivalent to decreasing 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> or 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>. All of our case studies included feature variations on cost parameters to display this feature.
