<p>One key result (in case 4) is where control schemes in the main city were unaffected by changes to the nature of the surrounding towns (

A programme that effectively aids the city will effectively aid those that migrate in by definition, even when not specifically vaccinating those that live in the outer towns. It confirms that focusing efforts on the largest population centres is by far the best strategy. This is in agreement with the general theoretical findings that, when vaccine supply is limited, they are best distributed among the groups who are most crucial to transmission [

To aid outer towns further, our results suggest a very small-scale vaccination programme and SIT mosquito release within the towns themselves would be appropriate. This would probably just strengthen a herd-immunity effect. By far the biggest impact on minimizing outbreaks in outer towns however is ensuring the central cities are kept under control to minimize the chances of the disease even reaching these towns. We do, however, see that in cases of higher migration (
