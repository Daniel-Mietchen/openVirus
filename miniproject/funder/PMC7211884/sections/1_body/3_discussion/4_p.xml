<p>Our results have also shown that a combination of prevention methods is always preferred, even when there is considerable disparity between their respective costs (

 <xref rid="RSOS181843C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). This disparity in costs is best explained from our analysis of imperfect vaccines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181843F5">figure 5</xref>). The two methods target two different frameworks; hosts and vectors. As these methods affect separate targets, the impact of one on the model cannot be perfectly offset by the other. When an imperfect vaccine was considered, the optimal application of modified mosquito release methods remained the same for all vaccine costs, owing to the vaccine being unable to transfer hosts beyond the risk of secondary infection (hosts were moved to

 <xref rid="RSOS181843C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], using a dynamic Markov approach, showed that vector control remains a cost-effective treatment strategy even in the presence of a medium-efficacy vaccine. Together with our findings, this suggests that vector control schemes should always be employed as a safeguard against imperfect vaccines.
