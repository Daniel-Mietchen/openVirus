<p>A key finding, throughout all the scenarios we investigated, is how minimizing the infected population is always of the greatest economic importance. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181843F3">figure 3</xref>, even when increasing the cost of vector control to a far higher value than is realistic, any control method is always financially advantageous. While calculating specific hospitalization costs is difficult, an in-depth review by Stahl 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] found that countries which invested greatly in vector control methods had lower total costs owing to dengue 
 <italic>per capita</italic>. For some countries, treatment costs are still greater than vector control costs, and this presents a significant financial burden [
