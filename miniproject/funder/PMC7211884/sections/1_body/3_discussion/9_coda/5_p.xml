<p>From a computational perspective, the convergence and efficiency of optimal control methods is very sensitive to certain parameters. Run-time was significantly reduced when generating a new expression for 
 <italic>u</italic> by choosing a weighting of 
 <italic>u</italic> = (0.7 * 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>old</sub> + 0.3 * 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>new</sub>), to save time lost owing to ‘over-shooting’. Because this in an iterative procedure, converging to the optimal 
 <italic>u</italic>, using the more standard update criteria of 
 <italic>u</italic> = (0.5 * 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>old</sub> + 0.5 * 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>new</sub>) was found to repeatedly overcompensate in this instance, by making unnecessarily large adjustments to 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>old</sub>. Developing aspects of Pontryagin’s maximum principle for networks is clearly in its infancy and there is much to be done in developing the mathematics for approaching these challenging real-world problems.
