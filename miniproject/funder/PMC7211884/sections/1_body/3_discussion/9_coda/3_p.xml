<p>As is always the case, our mathematical model is a major simplification of biological reality, and several steps could be taken to improve the model. We note that our cost function could be greatly improved. As well as the ideas posed above, as it stands, the cost of fully vaccinating a small town is the same per day as vaccinating the large city under our model. This is a clearly a convenient fiction and requires further investigation. Likewise, the cost of SIT programmes is complicated by the fact that an initial set-up cost is always required to build the breeding facility. Many of our optimal results eventually push the vector control (
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>) to zero to remove all cost. However, the averaged ‘daily cost’ of having built the facility needs to be considered. The nature of the model also urges an optimal result to maximize flow of hosts into the fully recovered class, 
 <italic>R</italic>, whereas it may be more realistic to consider a delay, where recovered individuals may be temporarily fully immune (
 <italic>R</italic>) before rejoining one of the susceptible pools (
