<p>The limit on migration only occurring into the central city was an important step for formulating a simple network model of dengue disease dynamics. Indeed, our case studies will only represent certain particular cases of dengue epidemics. Many dengue-endemic areas can be characterized by recurring outbreaks, while our current formulation focuses on only one contained outbreak. Considering inter-town dynamics and travel between smaller towns and villages, could give key insight on how to combat the disease across all settlements outside of cities. Several more key scenarios can be considered, for example, larger settlements with a large host population, and high vector populations, would pose a significant challenge.</p>
