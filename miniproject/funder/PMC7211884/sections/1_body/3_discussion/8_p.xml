<p>While the specific values of the control variables may have varied for different case studies, all of these supported a strong initial programme of vaccines (to push as many hosts into the recovered class as quickly as possible) followed by modified mosquito release (which in turn suppress the number of infected mosquitoes through the season). Often modified mosquito releases need to be sustained longer than vaccination programmes to achieve disease control. Although dengue vaccines can reduce susceptible numbers, mosquito control acts to suppress population sizes below the key entomological threshold to prevent further primary and secondary infections emerging. This critical combination of control interventions achieves dengue suppression most effectively in all cases.</p>
