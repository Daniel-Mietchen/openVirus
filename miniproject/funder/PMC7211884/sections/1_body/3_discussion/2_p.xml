<p>Here, we have investigated how vaccination and SIT-focused vector control approaches can be best combined to manage dengue disease dynamics in small networks. Using optimal control approaches, we have shown that a combination of control measures is always an optimal choice, regardless of all the factors explored in the above case studies. This key finding corroborates that presented by Hendron &amp; Bonsall [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], whose work highlighted the synergistic relationship between vaccine coverage and vector control across small networks. Our optimal control approach has further elucidated this relationship and demonstrated how these treatments can be most effectively combined and implemented to achieve cost-effective control. Furthermore, we have revealed how unique factors of an outbreak can alter the optimal course of action.
