<p>While an optimal control was quickly found for the city settlements, an optimal solution within the outer towns was more complicated. When the migration rate

 </sub> was increased, the method took longer to converge and displayed more unpredictable results (

 <italic>c</italic>). This result suggests that the most effective way to control disease outbreaks in the towns was an effective city-based control scheme. The application of vector control interventions in the towns was less efficacious, and therefore no clear ‘optimal solution’ could easily be found. Also, the fact that the optimal controls in the towns were of such small value, their input into the cost function was somewhat negligible. This explains an undocumented phenomena where convergence was more easily acquired for large cost values of 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> and 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>. This warrants further investigation and suggests it could be wise to re-consider the formulation of the cost function, perhaps changing the controls to represent a 
 <italic>volume</italic> of application as opposed to a 
 <italic>proportion</italic> (0 ≤ 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>/
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> ≤ 1).
