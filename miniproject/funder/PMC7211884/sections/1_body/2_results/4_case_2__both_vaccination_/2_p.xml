<p>We now include the potential for fully efficious vaccination (
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>) in the optimal control of dengue infections in a single settlement. Specific values for the daily cost of a vaccination programme are difficult to define precisely, however, Carrasco 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] estimates the annual cost of control methods at $50,000,000 (≈ $136,990 d
 <sup>−1</sup>). We begin with the most idealized version of the vaccine, one which instantly moves susceptible hosts to the fully recovered class 
 <italic>R</italic> (
 <italic>ξ</italic> = 1), and which is fully effective, and able to be administered to the entire population. We fix the other costs, 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = 510 and 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>3</sub> = 400, and present our optimal solutions for varying vaccination costs (
