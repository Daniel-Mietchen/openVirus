<p>Even though the vaccine is imperfect, vaccine delivery remains a feasible way to control dengue infection (

 <italic>b</italic>). Interestingly, there is a single optimal solution to vector control releases for all vaccination costs under imperfect vaccines, this is owing to the new, limited effectiveness of the vaccine. Because all people will be at risk of a secondary infection, vector control methods will always be required in equal measure to tackle this threat, regardless of how many vaccines are administered.
