 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181843F4">Figure 4</xref> shows that the optimum solution for all control costs is to provide the maximum amount of vaccine and SIT-mosquito coverage from as early as possible. These controls are slowly reduced to zero, reflecting how, as the host population moves from the susceptible to the recovered class by vaccine application, it becomes unnecessary to provide further vaccination. As the cost of controls increases, SIT and vaccination can be reduced at earlier points in time. 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> is reduced to zero at earlier points in time as the cost, 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>, increases, however 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> is always applied to some degree in the system until approximately day 22. Unsurprisingly, even when the cost of vaccination programmes (
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>) reaches 10 000 times the magnitude of vector control cost (
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>), the desirable impact of vaccination ensures it is always considered worthwhile. However, as the value of 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> increases, we see the optimal recommended amount of 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> begins to recede, while 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> slowly increases. This result shows how the increasing cost of applying 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> necessitates putting more emphasis on vector-targeted control methods to avoid an increase in the infected population. Of interest is that the optimal solution always involves a combination of both control methods. The rapid decline through time is owing to the vaccine moving susceptible hosts to the recovered class, and hence reducing the potential for further infections, removing the need for further vaccination. To help understand the underlying dynamical impact, the electronic supplementary material, S4 appendix displays the dynamical behaviour of the underlying model state variables under this optimal scheme.
