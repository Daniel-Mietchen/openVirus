 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181843F3">Figure 3</xref> shows that, for all control costs (
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>), it is always optimal to apply the maximum possible SIT-mosquito release at the start of the outbreak. The control is then later reduced, at earlier points in time for larger values of 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>. This reflects how, for higher control costs, it becomes more economically optimal to start gradually reducing control measures. Note that these optimal decreases to the control variable always occur at the end of the disease outbreak, as by this point vector populations will have already been reduced by the earlier control efforts. As such, there is a reduced risk of infection at this later time, meaning there is less demand for disease prevention methods. Evidently, the release of modified mosquitoes is a highly desirable technique, as even when the SIT programme costs (
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>) are roughly 100 times greater than the healthcare costs (
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>), a high release of modified mosquitoes is still of great benefit in managing dengue infections. This will largely be in part to the costs associated with the benefits of mosquito control outweighing the costs associated with the high numbers of infected hosts.
