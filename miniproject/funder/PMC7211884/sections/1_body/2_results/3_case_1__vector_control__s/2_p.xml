<p>We start by considering a case without vaccines within just one settlement (i.e. we define 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> to always be equal to 0 for this case). Carrasco 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] used data from the Singapore Ministry of Health to estimate the hospitalization costs per case per day. This was found to be modelled by a truncated normal distribution with a mean of $431 (US dollars; USD) and standard deviation $597 (USD), bounded below at 0. This large variance in cost is owing to the differences in symptomatic expression among hosts. With this in mind, we choose 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> = $510 (USD), the zero-bounded mean of the above distribution, as an estimate of expected healthcare costs. This distribution was calculated as an average for each hospitalized case, and while not all cases of dengue may result in hospitalization, this captures our inherent desire to minimize human illness, by interpreting each host infection as a potential for hospitalization. For 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>3</sub>, Alphey 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] sets the total costs of setting up and maintaining a 5-year SIT programme as ranging from 0.342 to 1.109 million USD.
