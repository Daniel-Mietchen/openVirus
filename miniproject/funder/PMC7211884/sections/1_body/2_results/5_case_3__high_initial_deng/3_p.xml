<p>In cases of high infected populations, there is clearly a greater need for integrated control efforts. Both vaccination and vector control need to be sustained longer to achieve control. A rapid decline in vaccination is then expected as the population of susceptible hosts, 
 <italic>S</italic>, is moved to a recovered class hence reducing the need for further vaccination (

 <italic>a</italic>). To maintain the disease control, high levels of modified mosquito releases are needed to ensure the control is cost-effective (

 <italic>b</italic>). The constraint(s) of cost-effective disease control within a feasible time frame (e.g. 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0 days â†’
 <italic>t</italic> = 80 days) is commonly seen in our optimal control results, where controls may be sharply curtailed at the end, in an effort to reduce cost before the impact on the number of infected can be realized.
