<p>A final sensitivity analysis was made to observe the effects of varying the rate of migration of susceptible hosts (
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>S</italic>
 </sub>) on control outcomes. All other constants were kept as initially stated for case 4 and we chose 
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 as a fixed number of settlements. These results are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181843F9">figure 9</xref>. Changing the value of 
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>S</italic>
 </sub> had no impact on the control scheme for the city (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181843F9">figure 9</xref>
 <italic>a</italic>,
 <italic>b</italic>), however, movement of susceptible hosts had a dramatic influence on the optimal controls for the towns themselves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181843F9">figure 9</xref>
 <italic>c</italic>,
 <italic>d</italic>). This is to be expected, as these outer towns are initialized with no infected hosts or vectors. As such, the settlement may only become infected owing to the migration effect, with hosts becoming infected in the central node, and then returning to the outer node to infect the vector population. This greater level of migration results in a more erratic optimal 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> for the outer towns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181843F9">figure 9</xref>
 <italic>c</italic>) owing to the rapidly changing influxes of infected individuals owing to a greater migration constant. Note also how recommended increases to 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> and 
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>2</sub> gradually decrease as 
 <italic>m</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>S</italic>
 </sub> increases in value.
