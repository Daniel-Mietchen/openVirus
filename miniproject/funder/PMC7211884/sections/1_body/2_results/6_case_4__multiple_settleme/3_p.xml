 <sub>1</sub>) is optimally administered at the maximum level at the beginning of the disease outbreak, before eventually being reduced to zero by approximately day 22. While this is optimal for both the central hub and the outer towns, coverage is reduced at a slower rate from an earlier point in time than for the central city. In the case of SIT-mosquito releases (
 <italic>u</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>), these modified insects are optimally applied in high amounts within the central cities, but only released at very small levels in the outer towns. Interestingly, within the central city the optimal control strategies are the same regardless of the number of small towns. This is probably owing to the relative size of the towns compared to the city. As only a very small percentage of hosts move from each town this has very little impact on the total epidemiological dynamics. Note that the optimal result displayed is the same for each individual town.
