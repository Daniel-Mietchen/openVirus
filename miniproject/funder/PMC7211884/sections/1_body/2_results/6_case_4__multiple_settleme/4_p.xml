<p>The same optimal control results are recommended for each town, regardless of how many towns there may be in the network. This is linked directly to the relatively small impact the number of towns had on the overall dynamics within the city (as seen in figures

However, the form of control in towns is different to that recommended for the central city. Relatively low levels of coverage and declines in vaccination and vector control (after an initial increase) are the optimal strategy. It seems optimal control methods for the spokes and hub remain somewhat independent.
