<p>In the next section, we introduce the mathematical model and the optimal control formulation. We then investigate how the dynamical impact of these disease prevention methods affects the spread of disease, and how they may be best combined and employed across differing scenarios. In the discussion, we highlight the potential of the work for explaining the interplay between these two imperfect methods of disease prevention.</p>
