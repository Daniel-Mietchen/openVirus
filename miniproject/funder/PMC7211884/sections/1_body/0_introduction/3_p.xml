<p>Dengue has atypical epidemiology. Five serotypes have so far been identified, all of which are capable of inducing the same critical health problems [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] (note that the fifth serotype was only recently discovered, and much of the existing literature still refers to only four serotypes). When a susceptible individual contracts dengue, they enter an infectious state followed by a brief period of cross-immunity to all serotypes once they have recovered. However, this immune period wanes and individuals become highly susceptible to the other dengue serotypes, with an astonishingly high increase of morbidity and mortality. This effect is known as antibody-dependent enhancement [
