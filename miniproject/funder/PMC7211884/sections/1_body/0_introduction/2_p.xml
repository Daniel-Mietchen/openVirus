<p>Approximately 3.9 billion people live at risk of contracting dengue [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], a viral infection transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Vectors become infected upon ingesting blood from an infected host, and then pass on the disease by biting susceptible individuals. Current estimates suggest that 390 million people are infected with dengue each year, of which 96 million display clinical symptoms [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Owing to the method of transmission, the disease is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical climates across the globe, most commonly in urban environments, where dense populations and stagnant water sources create ideal mosquito breeding grounds [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The steady increase in sudden outbreaks and an increase in the epidemic potential highlights dengue as a serious, and growing, concern for public health [
