 <xref rid="RSOS181843C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], currently, the primary method of suppressing dengue is through vector control. By limiting mosquito densities, transmission of the virus is directly reduced as a result of the population sizes of vectors falling below an entomological threshold. While vector control has focussed on insecticides, an increasingly promising approach is the use of genetically modified mosquitoes. Building on approaches developed for agricultural pest management, the sterile insect technique (SIT), whereby modified, infertile male insects are released into the environment to mate with wild-types, has been proven to reduce the number of live young produced, and subsequently suppress total population size. This SIT method has been a tremendous success in some situations [

 <xref rid="RSOS181843C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Genetic-based methods similar to the SIT method have been developed whereby lethal genes switch on at key stages in the insectâ€™s life cycle to induce mortality [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The overall effect is to then reduce the mosquito population size, albeit in a self-limiting way, as once mass releases stop, the control effect diminishes and populations may resurge and disease control may be lost.
