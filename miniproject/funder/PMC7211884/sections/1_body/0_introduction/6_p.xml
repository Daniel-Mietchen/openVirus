<p>In early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, was registered for use in several countries across southeast Asia [

 <xref rid="RSOS181843C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] investigates how combined control interventions for dengue on small networks could be developed, optimal strategies for adequately controlling dengue epidemics remain difficult to determine. Here, we address this by developing on the framework [
 <xref rid="RSOS181843C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] as a basis for investigating the effectiveness of each approach (vaccination, vector control), seeking an optimal strategy to managing dengue outbreaks under varying circumstances.
