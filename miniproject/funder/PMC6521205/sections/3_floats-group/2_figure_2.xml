  <p>Protection from ZIKV-induced cytopathic effect by 2′-
   <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide and sofosbuvir in a ZIKV-sensitive glioblastoma stem cell model. DMSO-treated GSC 387 cells [-ZIKV and +ZIKV, H/PAN multiplicity of infection (MOI) 10], 10 or 30 µM sofosbuvir-treated cells or 10 or 30 µM 2′-
   <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide (2′-CMU ProTide)-treated cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
   <sub>2</sub>, and cell foci were subsequently imaged in bright-field.
