  <p>Reduction in ZIKV titers by 2′-
   <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide and sofosbuvir in neural stem cells as observed by plaque assay. Viral infections were conducted in human fetal neural stem cells (H/PAN ZIKV, MOI 0.1) using vehicle-untreated (ONLY ZIKV), DMSO vehicle-treated, 10 or 30 µM sofosbuvir (SOF)-treated, and 10 or 30 µM 2′-
   <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide (2′CMU)-treated samples. The dotted line represents the limit of detection of the assay. Virus was titered as described in the methods section and plaque forming units (PFU) per ml were calculated for each sample, ± standard error (SE), 
   <italic>n</italic> = 4.
