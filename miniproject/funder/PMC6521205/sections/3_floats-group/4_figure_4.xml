  <p>Kinetic characterization of nucleotide and nucleotide analogue incorporation by ZIKV RdRP. (
   <bold>A</bold>) ZIKV RdRP and primer/template (P/T) substrate (n) was mixed with excess UTP, 2′-F-2′-
   <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine triphosphate (2′-F-2′-C-MeUTP), or 2-
   <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine triphosphate (2′-C-MeUTP), and the reaction was quenched at the indicated timepoints. The substrate and the single nucleotide extension product (n + 1) were separated by using a 20% polyacrylamide denaturing gel, and bands were quantified to determine percent incorporation and plotted against time. (
   <bold>B</bold>) A single exponential fit was used to determine an observed rate of incorporation, 
   <italic>k</italic>
   <sub>obs</sub> (% incorporation min
   <sup>−1</sup>) of 0.151 ± 0.004, 0.0085 ± 0.001, and 0.016 ± 0.001, for UTP (dotted black line), 2′-F-2′-C-MeUTP (dashed red line), and 2′-C-MeUTP (solid blue line), respectively. SE is reported as deviation from the fit, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 2.
