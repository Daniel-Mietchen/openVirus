<p>In this work, we demonstrated that ProTides other than sofosbuvir have promise as potential antiviral drugs to treat ZIKV infections. Interestingly, an apparent bias towards 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-modified uridylate ProTides (with the exception of the ethenyl derivative) was observed, suggesting a possible nucleobase bias to compound activity. Recent biochemical data examining levels of off-target incorporation of nucleoside analogue triphosphates by the human mitochondrial RNA polymerase may help explain the phenotypic relationship we observed; both 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine triphosphate and 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyl-2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-fluorouridine triphosphate (the active metabolite of sofosbuvir) show much lower levels of incorporation by this host enzyme than 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-modified analogues with other nucleobases [
 <xref rid="B51-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. We propose that this may account for the better safety profile observed for sofosbuvir compared to other 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-modified compounds that were tested in clinical trials. This may also suggest that there is greater selectivity for 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-modified uridylate incorporation by flavivirus polymerases over host polymerases, though the exact mechanism by which this occurs should be examined in future studies.
