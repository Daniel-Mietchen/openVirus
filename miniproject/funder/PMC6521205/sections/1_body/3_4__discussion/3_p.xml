<p>We have demonstrated here for the first time that ProTide technology can be broadly applied to anti-ZIKV drug development with nucleobase and ProTide group selectivity observed. These data will guide future work to design highly selective, safe, and bioavailable compounds for the treatment of ZIKV infections.</p>
