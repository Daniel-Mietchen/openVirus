<p>We also observed that changing the ProTide functionality of 2â€²-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine from an aryloxyl phosphoramidate masking group to a 2-(methylthio)ethyl phosphoramidate resulted in a complete loss of activity, suggesting that the local metabolic environment of the host cell is critical for processing of the ProTide functionality. Further studies examining the relationship between different ProTide functionalities and the cell type dependence of their antiviral activity as well as testing the impact of these effects using in vivo animal model testing are planned in our research groups.
