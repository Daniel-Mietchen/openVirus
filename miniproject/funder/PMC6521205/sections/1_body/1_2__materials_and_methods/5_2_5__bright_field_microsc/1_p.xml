<p>GSC 387 cells (5000 cells/well) were seeded into 1536-well black, clear bottom plates with wells containing either 10 or 30 µM sofosbuvir, 10 or 30 µM 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide, or DMSO vehicle controls, and were either mock-infected or infected with ZIKV H/PAN/2016/BEI-259634 at MOI of 10. Cell foci images were acquired 72 h post-infection in bright-field using an ImageXpress Micro automated microscope (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA).
