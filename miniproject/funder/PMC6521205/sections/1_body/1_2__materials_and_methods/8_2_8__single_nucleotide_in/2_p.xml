<p>Single nucleotide incororation assays were modeled from previous work [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, ZIKV RdRP (1 µM) and P/T substrate (200 nM) were pre-incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Reactions were initiated at 37 °C with the addition of 150 µM UTP or analog in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 15% glycerol, 15 mM NaCl, 7.5 mM MnCl
 <sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM dithiothreitol. At specified time points, reaction aliquots were quenched with ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) to a final concentration of 0.3 M.
