<p>To prepare the double-stranded RNA substrate, primer (5′-AGUUGUUGAUC3′) was 
 <sup>32</sup>P-labeled at the 5′ position upon incubation with [γ-
 <sup>32</sup>P] ATP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA) at 37 °C for 30 min. Excess [γ-
 <sup>32</sup>P] ATP was removed with a Bio-Spin 6 column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After heat inactivation, the 5′-
 <sup>32</sup>P labeled primer was combined with an excess template (5′-AUUCACUCAGAUCAACAACU-3′). The primer and the template were annealed via step incubation at 95 °C (5 min), 55 °C (15 min), and 37 °C (10 min) to generate the primer/template substrate (P/T substrate), where the next correct nucleotide to be incorporated was UTP.
