<p>NSCs (5000 cells/well) were seeded into 1536-well black, clear bottom plates containing 20-point, 2-fold serial dilutions of ProTides or DMSO vehicle controls and were either mock-infected, infected with ZIKV H/PAN/2016/BEI-259634 at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10, or infected with ZIKV PRVABC59/Human/2015/Puerto Rico at MOI of 10. Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) 72 h post-infection. An EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer) was used for readouts of luminescence intensity. All data were normalized to DMSO vehicle controls and were expressed as % relative luminescence intensity. Normalized activity and toxicity data were plotted against ProTide concentration and fit to a sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope using Prism 6 (GraphPad Software) to generate EC
 <sub>50</sub> and CC
 <sub>50</sub> curves.
