 <sub>2</sub> (g), we added 5% palladium on barium sulfate (20.8 mg, 10 wt%) followed by quinolone (22 µL) and stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was diluted in ethyl acetate, washed 3 times with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The reaction mixture was purified using flash chromatography (0 to 30% ethyl acetate in hexane gradient) to afford purified product; (162.7 mg, 0.281 mmol, 77.7%) 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl
