<p>To a stirred suspension of 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-ethynyluridine (0.09 mmol, dried under vacuum at 50 °C overnight) in dry THF (1 mL) was added a 2.0 M solution of tert-butyl magnesium chloride in THF (96 μL, 0.19 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 30 min and then allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for an additional 30 min. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 0 °C and 
 <italic>N</italic>-[(
 <italic>S</italic>)-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenoxy)phenoxyphosphinyl]-L-alanine 1-methylethyl ester (46 mg, 0.10 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 18 h as the temperature was allowed to warm to room temperature. The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The reaction mixture was purified first using flash chromatography (a gradient from 0 to 30% methanol in dichloromethane) and then using preparative, normal-phase HPLC (10 to 40% MeOH in dichloromethane gradient) to afford 25.5 mg of the product (54.3%) in ≥ 95% purity.
