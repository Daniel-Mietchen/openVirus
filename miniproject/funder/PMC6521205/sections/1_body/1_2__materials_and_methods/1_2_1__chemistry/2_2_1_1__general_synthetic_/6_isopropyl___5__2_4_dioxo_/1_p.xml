<p>To a stirring solution of 
 <bold>4</bold> (36.4 mg, 0.176 mmol, 1 equivalent) in dry tetrahydrofuran (1 mL) at 0 °C was added tert-butyl magnesium chloride (184.5 µL, 0.369 mmol, 2.1 equivalent). The reaction mixture was raised to room temperature and allowed to react for 30 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C, then

 <italic>S</italic>)-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenoxy)phenoxyphosphinyl]-L-alanine 1-methylethyl ester (95.5 mg, 0.211 mmol, 1.2 equivalent) was added and gradually warmed to room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was purified using flash chromatography (0 to 30% methanol [MeOH] in dichloromethane gradient) to afford the purified product; (42.5 mg, 0.0788 mmol, 44.8%) 1H NMR (400 MHz, CD
