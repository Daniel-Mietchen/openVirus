<p>Compound 
 <bold>3</bold> (90.5 g, 0.155 mmol, 1 equivalent) was dried overnight on high vacuum. Under N
 <sub>2</sub> (g), methanol (1.5 mL) was added, then the reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C followed by the dropwise addition of sodium methoxide (86.5 µL, 1.553 mmol, 10 equivalent). The reaction mixture was raised to room temperature and stirred for 1.5 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to 0 °C followed by the addition of formic acid until pH = 4. The reaction mixture was dried in vacuo then purified using flash chromatography (0 to 40% methanol in dicholoromethane gradient) to afford a purified product; (30.2 mg, 0.146 mmol, 93.8%) 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl
