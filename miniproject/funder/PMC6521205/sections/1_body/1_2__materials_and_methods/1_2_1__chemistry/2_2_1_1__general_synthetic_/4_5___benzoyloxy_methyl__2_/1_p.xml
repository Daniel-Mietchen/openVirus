<p>Uracil (63.0 mg, 0.562 mmol, 2 equivalent) and 
 <bold>2</bold> (162.7 mg, 0.281 mmol, 1 equivalent) were dried under high vacuum in separate round bottom flasks for 2 h. Under N
 <sub>2</sub> (g) and stirring, we added dry acetonitrile (2 mL) to uracil followed by the addition of bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (550.1 µL, 2.250 mmol, 8 equivalent). The reaction mixture was refluxed at 80 °C for 1 h then cooled to 0 °C. Then, compound 2 in dry acetonitrile (2 mL) was added to the reaction mixture followed by tin (IV) chloride (229.9 µL, 1.968 mmol, 7 equivalent) and heated to 60 °C for 3 h. The reaction mixture was poured into a separatory funnel containing ice cold water, extracted 3 times with ethyl acetate, and the combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The reaction mixture was purified using flash chromatography (0 to 100% ethyl acetate in hexane gradient) to afford purified product; (89.4 mg, 0.153 mmol, 54.6%) 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl
