<p>The 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine (45.3 mg, 0.1790 mmol, 1 equivalent) and the triethylammonium 2-(methylthio)ethyl phosphonate (92.1 mg, 0.3579 mmol, 1.5 equivalent) were added to an oven-dried schlenk tube and dried overnight on the high vacuum. To the flask under N
 <sub>2</sub> (g) was added dry pyridine (2 mL) followed by the dropwise addition of trimethylacetyl chloride (60.6 µL, 0.4923 mmol, 2.75 equivalent), and the reaction was stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by saturated sodium bicarbonate and extracted 3 times with dicholormethane. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo at room temperature and dried for 2 h on high vacuum. The dried residue was dissolved in pyridine (2 mL) under N
 <sub>2</sub> (g). To the reaction mixture was simultaneously added trimethylamine (49.9 µL, 0.3579 mmol, 2 equivalent), tryptamine (114.7 mg, 0.7158 mmol, 4 equivalent, dissolved in dry pyridine 2 mL), and carbon tetrachloride (26.0 µL, 0.2685 mmol, 1.5 equivalent) and stirred for 25 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol and purified using flash chromatography (0 to 30% methanol in dichloromethane gradient) to afford a purified product as a mixture of two epimers at phosphorus; (8.0 mg, 0.01443 mmol, 7.3%)
