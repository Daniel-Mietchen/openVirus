<p>All reagents, chemicals, and nucleoside analogues precursors were purchased from Acros Organics, Carbosynth, Chem-Impex International, AK Scientific, and Fisher Chemical at ACS reagent grade or higher purity and used as received. The (3R,4R,5R)-5-(benzoyloxy)methyl)-3-ethynyltetrahydrofuran-2,3,4-triyl tribenzoate 
 <bold>1</bold> was synthesized by following a previously reported procedure [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Synthetic details for aryloxy phosphoramidate ProTides other than for 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-ethynyluridine and 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-ethenyluridine were published previously by our group [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All reactions were carried out in either an oven-dried round bottom flask or a Schlenk tube under a nitrogen atmosphere using commercially available anhydrous solvents and monitored by thin-layer chromatography with detection by UV light. The 
 <sup>1</sup>H NMR and the 
 <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian 400-MHz spectrometer and recorded at 298 K. Chemical shifts were referenced to the residual protio solvent peak and are given in parts per million (ppm). Splitting patterns are denoted as s (singlet), d (doublet), dd (doublet of doublet), dq (doublet of quartet), ddd (doublet of doublet of doublet), ddt (doublet of doublet of triplet), t (triplet), td (triplet of doublet), tdd (triplet of doublet of doublet), q (quartet), and m (multiplet).
