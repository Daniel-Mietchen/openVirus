<p>To further assess the antiviral activity of the 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide against ZIKV, we performed plaque assays at 48 h post-infection to titer ZIKV (H/PAN, MOI of 0.1) levels during treatment with either 10 or 30 µM of 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide or 10 or 30 µM of sofosbuvir in human fetal neural stem cells (

 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide and sofosbuvir were able to repress viral titers to undetectable levels. However, only 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide was able to reduce ZIKV titers to undetectable levels at the 10 µM compound, again highlighting its superior antiviral activity compared to sofosbuvir.
