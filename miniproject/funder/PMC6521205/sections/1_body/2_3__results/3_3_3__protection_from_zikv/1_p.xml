<p>We and others have previously shown that certain lines of brain tumors with stem cell-like genetic programs, such as glioblastomas, are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,

 <xref rid="B49-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These cells display a striking phenotypic change upon infection. To highlight the ability of a representative ProTide hit from our library, 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate, to protect against ZIKV-induced cytopathic effect, we treated the glioblastoma stem cell line GSC 387 with either 10 or 30 µM 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate and compared this to 10 or 30 µM sofosbuvir or the DMSO vehicle control treatment. Samples were prepared in both ZIKV-infected (MOI of 10) and uninfected conditions. After 72 h post-infection, bright-field microscopy images were obtained for each sample and are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00365-f002">Figure 2</xref>. While both compounds were able to protect against the cytopathic effect at 30 µM (intact cell foci were seen), the 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide was better able to protect against ZIKV-induced cytopathic effect at the lower concentration of 10 µM than sofosbuvir, which is in line with our EC
 <sub>50</sub> data in neural stem cells. These data suggest that monosubstituted 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-modified uridylate aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTides may be an attractive chemical series to pursue for more potent and selective ZIKV polymerase inhibitors than sofosbuvir.
