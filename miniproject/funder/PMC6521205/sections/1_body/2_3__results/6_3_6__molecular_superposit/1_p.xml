<p>A previously prepared model (gc-o3 [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]) of ZIKV RdRP in complex with RNA and ATP generated from PDB 5TFR [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and PDB 4WTD [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], an apo structure of ZIKV RdRP (PDB 5WZ3 [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]), and an apo structure of HCV RdRP (PDB 3MWV [
 <xref rid="B39-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) were aligned with a crystal structure of HCV RdRP complexed with RNA and sofosbuvir diphosphate (PDB 4WTG [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]), shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00365-f005">Figure 5</xref>. ZIKV RdRP is shown in magenta (apo form) or in red (in complex with ligands), and HCV RdRP is shown in dark blue (apo form) or in cyan (in complex). The crystal structure of inhibited HCV RdRP (cyan) shows that residue D225 moved upward to accommodate sofosbuvir diphosphate, while in the ZIKV model (red) [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the corresponding residue D1141 in ZIKV RdRP pointed down in the opposite direction to accommodate the nucleotide (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00365-f005">Figure 5</xref>). While the position of the aspartic acid in both the apo forms of the viral RdRPs was similar, it is interesting that the nucleoside ligands were accommodated in different ways, with ZIKV RdRP displaying a larger change in positioning in this residue. While modeling was used to generate the holo-structure of ZIKV RdRP, this suggests some evidence that the ZIKV binding pocket is poised to accommodate a variety of nucleoside analogues.
