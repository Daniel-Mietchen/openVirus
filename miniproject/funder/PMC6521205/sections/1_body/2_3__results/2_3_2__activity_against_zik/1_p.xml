<p>To profile the activity and toxicity profiles of our library of ProTides, we screened compounds in a 20-point, two-fold dose response with a highest concentration of 50 µM against ZIKV PRVABC59/Human/2015/Puerto Rico and ZIKV H/PAN/2016/BEI-259634 in neural stem cells (MOI of 10) using a luminescent cell-viability assay (CellTiter Glo) and determined EC
 <sub>50</sub> (effective concentration 50) and CC
 <sub>50</sub> (cytotoxic concentration 50) values from these data (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00365-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We observed that the compounds with the best selectivity indexes (SIs) were the 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide (EC
 <sub>50</sub>PRVABC59: 1 µM, EC
 <sub>50</sub>H/PAN: 2 µM, CC
 <sub>50</sub>: 47 µM, SIs: &gt;47, &gt;23, respectively) and the 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-ethynyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide (EC
 <sub>50</sub>PRVABC59: 0.3 µM, EC
 <sub>50</sub>H/PAN: 0.8 µM, CC
 <sub>50</sub>: &gt;50 µM, SIs: &gt;166, &gt;62, respectively). These outperformed sofosbuvir in terms of anti-ZIKV activity (EC
 <sub>50</sub>PRVABC59: 35 µM, EC
 <sub>50</sub>H/PAN: 46 µM, CC
 <sub>50</sub>: &gt;50 µM, SIs: &gt;1.4, &gt;1.1, respectively). Activity was observed for the 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyladenosine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide (EC
 <sub>50</sub>PRVABC59: 10 µM, EC
 <sub>50</sub>H/PAN: 18 µM, CC
 <sub>50</sub>: 42 µM, SIs: &gt;4, &gt;2, respectively) and 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methylcytidine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide against PRVABC59 strain (EC
 <sub>50</sub>PRVABC59: 48 µM, CC
 <sub>50</sub>PRVABC59: &gt;50 µM, SI: &gt;1), albeit at lower levels. None of the other ProTides tested displayed activity. Interestingly, the 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-ethenyluridine aryloxyl phosphoramidate ProTide was completely inactive and quite toxic to the host cells, suggesting that this functional group may be more promiscuous in terms of target binding or reactive with cellular components [
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Replacement of the classic McGuigan ProTide masking group with methylthioethyl tryptamine phosphoramidate for the 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine ProTide completely abolished activity. This result was not expected because the classic McGuigan ProTides are unmasked with the involvement of both a carboxyesterase and HINT1, whereas the methylthioethyl tryptamine phosphoramidate requires only HINT1 in addition to spontaneous, chemical steps [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Clearly, cell line specificity for ProTide strategies must be considered in the design of nucleotide analogue inhibitors of ZIKV.
