<p>The selection of nucleoside analogues for testing focused on ribose modifications known to induce chain termination in vitro when used as a nucleoside triphosphate analogue with the viral RdRP. Some of the selected compounds, e.g., the 3′-deoxy and the 3′-
 <italic>O</italic>-methyl, are obligate chain terminators, but phosphorylation of this class of compounds in cells is often inefficient [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Better success in antiviral drug development has been found when using nonobligate terminators, especially 2′ modifications that alter the nucleoside conformation and prevent extension after incorporation during RNA synthesis [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We included sofosbuvir in this set as a point of reference, along with ProTides of the 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyl ribosides, which have known potency against the Flaviviridae family [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Also included were new ProTides of 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-ethynyl- and 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-ethenyluridine. The 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-ethynyl ribosyl triphosphates are known sub-μM inhibitors of flavivirus RdRPs [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and we prepared the new 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-ethenyluridine ProTide to probe the active site of the RdRP and the metabolic consequences of further modification of the 2′-
 <italic>C-</italic>β position. A 5-fluorouridine ProTide was included in our set of analogues to test inhibition by lethal mutagenesis, although toxicity of mutagenic nucleoside analogues is typically prohibitive of clinical applications.
