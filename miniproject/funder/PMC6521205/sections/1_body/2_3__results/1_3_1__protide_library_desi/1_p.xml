<p>To investigate the activity of a set of nucleotide analogue ProTides against ZIKV and obtain basic structure-activity relationships, we selected a set of nucleotides designed to inhibit viral RdRPs by three different mechanisms: obligate chain termination, nonobligate chain termination, and lethal mutagenesis (

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Past work—and the successful results of drug development against HCV—shows that nucleosides alone lack adequate potency owing to slow phosphorylation in the target cells [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. McGuigan’s nucleotide aryloxy phosphoramidates include amino acid esters and are well established; sofosbuvir includes this functional group, and we chose it as our starting point [

 <xref rid="B43-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. One potential drawback of the McGuigan design is that unmasking is initiated by the action of carboxyesterases, which are highly active in the hepatocytes targeted by HCV but less active in the neural cell targets of ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For that reason, we chose to investigate a recently developed methylthioethyl tryptamine ProTide from Wagner, which is unmasked by chemical cleavage of methylthioethanol followed by tryptamine removal by HINT1 [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. HINT1 also catalyzes P
 <monospace>-</monospace>N bond cleavage in the classic McGuigan ProTide. Our hypothesis was that the carboxyesterase-independent unmasking of the methylthioethyl tryptamine ProTide would provide greater potency against ZIKV in human neural stem cells.
