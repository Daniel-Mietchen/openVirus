<p>Single nucleotide incorporation assays were used to compare the relative preference of ZIKV RdRP for UTP versus the UTP analogs 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine triphosphate and 2′-fluoro-2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine triphosphate (the active form of sofosbuvir) (

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Unsurprisingly, UTP was most efficiently incorporated, with 50% incorporation by 5 min and full incorporation by ~30 min, followed by misincorporating extension. The 2′-fluoro-2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine triphosphate had significantly less efficient incorporation by ZIKV RdRP, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Incorporation plateaued at 15%, and half maximal incorporation was only reached after nearly 90 min. In contrast, 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine triphosphate reached half of its eventual maximal incorporation of 35% after ~45 min, showing improved incorporation over the active form of sofosbuvir. These trends are supported by previous work focusing on biochemical characterization of 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine triphosphate and 2′-fluoro-2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine triphosphate incorporation [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Importantly, here we verify the preference of 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine over sofosbuvir in both biochemical and cell-based assays, suggesting a robust inhibitor testing pipeline that supports the hypothesis that cellular efficacy occurs as a result of RdRP inhibition by nucleoside analogs.
