<p>Viral polymerases remain attractive drug targets for the development of selective antiviral therapies [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Generally, clinically-approved inhibitors that target these proteins fall into two broad classes [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The first class consists of nucleoside analogues that mimic the natural substrate of the enzyme. Upon analogue incorporation by the virally-encoded polymerase, DNA or RNA synthesis is abrogated by preventing further nucleotide incorporation (chain termination), thereby arresting viral replication. The second class is known as non-nucleoside inhibitors, which bind allosterically and arrest viral nucleic acid synthesis by distorting the polymerase active site geometry to interfere with nucleotide binding or nucleotide incorporation.
