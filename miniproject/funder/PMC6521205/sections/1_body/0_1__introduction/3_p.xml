<p>A common prodrug strategy used for antiviral ribonucleoside analogues involves the chemical synthesis of nucleoside analogue monophosphates with metabolically-removable masking groups [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-00365" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These masking groups neutralize the negative charge of the phosphate on the nucleoside and allow for better membrane penetrance of these compounds. Chemical addition of the first phosphate group is crucial for improving intracellular levels of the active triphosphate metabolite form of ribonucleoside analogues. Metabolic addition of the first phosphate group is relatively slow for this class of compounds and represents a rate-limiting step for the triphosphorylation of ribonucleoside analogues to active drug molecules.
