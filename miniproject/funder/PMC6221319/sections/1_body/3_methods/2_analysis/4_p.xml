<p>A central premise of our analysis is that our dataset may contain viruses that have an unobserved ability to transmit between humans. These viruses are conservatively designated as “non-transmissible” in our analysis to denote that human-to-human transmission has not been observed, and also to minimize type II error (the error associated with classifying a human transmissible virus as unable to transmit between humans). This designation is analogous to the treatment of presence-absence data in ecology [

 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The statistical literature on this problem shows that while poorly calibrated probability estimates may be a consequence of contaminated controls, the ratio of probabilities for pairs of viruses are not affected [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Thus, AUC scores and the rank ordering of virus species by their predicted response are not affected by the discrepancy either.
