<p>Consolidating records from the primary literature and existing pathogen databases yielded a list of 224 virus species known to infect humans. For each virus, we collected data on taxonomic grouping and 19 biological features (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206926.s004">S1 Table</xref>), 16 of which do not have a counterpart in previous analyses [
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We then assigned each virus a binary score denoting whether or not it was known to be transmissible between humans; non-transmissible viruses received a score of 0, while viruses transmitted directly, via an arthropod vector, or through environmental contamination received a score of 1. Fitting boosted regression trees to this data produced an ensemble of models that identify strong predictors of human transmissibility (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206926.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and accurately discriminate transmissible from non-transmissible viruses: among zoonotic viruses, models distinguished those with observed secondary transmission with ~84% accuracy (median AUC = 0.8430 +/- 0.0778); when applied across all human viruses (zoonotic and non-zoonotic), the model achieved even higher accuracy (median AUC = 0.9196 +/- 0.0353), demonstrating that zoonotic viruses with secondary transmission are easily distinguishable from all other human viruses on the basis of observable viral traits (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206926.g002">Fig 2</xref>). AUC scores, tuning parameters, and the relative influence of covariates are reported in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0206926.s005">S2 Table</xref>. We used partial dependence plots to characterize the relationships between predictor variables and transmissibility in our model (
