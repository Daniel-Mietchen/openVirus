<p>Our model ensemble predicts that zoonoses carried by nonhuman primates are more likely to be transmissible between humans relative to other zoonotic viruses, while viruses found in rodents and birds are less likely to be transmissible. This corroborates current theories on viral emergence, which posit that both phylogenetic and physical proximity between human and animal hosts drives spillover events and the success of subsequent adaptations [

 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In contrast, for viruses that infect phylogenetically distant hosts, beneficial adaptations to one host system can significantly reduce pathogen fitness in the others, impeding the evolution of transmissibility within the new host population due to adaptive trade-offs [

However, close physical proximity can increase contact rates between humans and more distantly related host species, creating additional opportunities for spillover. While genetic dissimilarities may initially inhibit the development of secondary transmissibility in humans, increased contact creates more opportunities for successful viral adaptation [
