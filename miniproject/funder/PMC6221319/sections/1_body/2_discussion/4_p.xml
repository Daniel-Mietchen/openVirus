<p>The negative association between arthropod vector infection and human-to-human transmissibility in our model ensemble suggests that arboviruses, none of which exclusively infect humans, are significantly constrained by the evolutionary trade-offs needed to infect both phylogenetically divergent arthropod vectors and vertebrate host species [

 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Viruses that overcome this barrier most commonly circulate between nonhuman primate hosts and anthropophilic vectors, again illustrating the importance of phylogenetic and physical proximity in successful viral emergence [

 <xref rid="pone.0206926.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In contrast, the vast majority of arboviruses infect genetically dissimilar organisms via zoophilic vectors, typically only infecting humans living in close proximity with reservoir hosts. Humans are predominantly dead-end hosts for such viruses.
