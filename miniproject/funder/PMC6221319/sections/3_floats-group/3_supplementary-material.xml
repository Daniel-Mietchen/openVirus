  <title>Variable partial dependence plots, supplementary models with study effort.</title>
  <p>Partial dependence plots show how the model-predicted probability that a virus is able to spread between humans is affected by individual viral traits when the effects all other predictors are controlled for. These models include the log10-transformed number of PubMed citations for each virus species as a predictor variable. The relationships between predictors and the transmission response are not meaningfully changed from those in our primary model, which does not include a study effort predictor (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0206926.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This suggests that study effort is not a confounder of variable relationships in our models.
