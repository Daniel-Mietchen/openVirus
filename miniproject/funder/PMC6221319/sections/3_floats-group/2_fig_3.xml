  <title>Variable partial dependence plots.</title>
  <p>Partial dependence plots show how the model-predicted probability that a virus is able to spread between humans is affected by individual viral traits when the effects all other predictors are controlled for. Dark lines represent the median predicted transmission probability across the 40 boosted regression tree models of the primary ensemble, while shaded regions represent the corresponding 95% confidence interval. Viral features are ordered by their mean relative influence within the primary boosted regression tree models from left to right, then top to bottom. Predictor variables with a mean relative influence score of 0 are not included in this figure. Trait definitions and exact relative influence scores are given in
