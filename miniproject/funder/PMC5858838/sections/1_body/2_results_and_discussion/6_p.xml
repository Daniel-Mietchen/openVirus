 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006239.s003">S2 Table</xref> details the distribution of seropositives for ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV according to sex and age groups. Differences are minimal between groups (none reaches a significance threshold of 0.05), suggesting that age and sex do not significantly impact exposure to these arboviral diseases in the population investigated. Importantly, there is in the population studied a strong relationship between seropositivity to ZIKV and to DENV (p&lt;10
 <sup>−12</sup>), but also to CHIKV (p&lt;10
 <sup>−15</sup>), obviously pointing to exposure to a common risk factor: the bite of the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> vector of the three diseases.
