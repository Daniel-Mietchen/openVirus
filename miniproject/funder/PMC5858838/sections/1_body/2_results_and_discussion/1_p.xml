<p>Serological results in the different sites for ZIKV are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006239.g001">Fig 1</xref>. ZIKV has been circulating in the two regions with a typical tropical climate (Beni and Santa Cruz de la Sierra), but not in highlands in which the entomological activity is limited. In the tropical regions, the usual period of circulation of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> borne viruses ranges from November to April. The high seroprevalence rate in Beni (39% after VNT, (95% CI [30%â€“48%])) is in agreement with the report of an outbreak of febrile cases with rash locally, with laboratory PCR confirmed cases before our study (performed in December 2016). Since cases were reported in Beni until the end of the rainy season, it is likely that the final seroprevalence rate is even higher nowadays in this region.
