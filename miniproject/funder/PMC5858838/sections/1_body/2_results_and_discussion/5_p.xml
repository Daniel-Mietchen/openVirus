 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006239.t001">Table 1</xref> shows the distribution of seropositives per site with the background of serological results for dengue and chikungunya, which circulation in Bolivia has been widely documented. Immunity to dengue virus is the rule in the tropical regions (&gt;90% of seropositives in Beni and Santa Cruz), but also significant in the region of Tarija (44.1%). It is more limited in Cochabamba and La Paz (
 <italic>ca</italic> ~10%). For chikungunya, approximately half of the population is seropositive in the tropical regions and less than 10% in highlands. The differences observed with dengue most probably reflect the lower number of epidemic waves of chikungunya that hit the country. Dengue was first reported in Bolivia in 1931 and since then has been circulating intensely with major epidemics in the tropical regions[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006239.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and, over time, multiple imported cases and possibly transient local transmission in highlands (in particular the Tarija region). By contrast, autochthonous transmission of CHIKV was first reported in Bolivia as recently as 2015 following the introduction of the virus in the Americas[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006239.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], limiting herd immunity outside the areas of intense epidemic transmission. Altogether, the spreading pattern of ZIKV follows that of other 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>-borne viruses in Bolivia, in particular that of the recently introduced CHIKV.
