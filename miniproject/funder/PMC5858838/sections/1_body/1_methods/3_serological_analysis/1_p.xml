<p>Samples were tested for the presence of IgG to ZIKV as previously described [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006239.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In brief, alike Netto and collaborators[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006239.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] we performed an initial screening with a recombinant NS1-based ELISA test (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006239.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] which is the only test certified for serological diagnostics of ZIKV by the responsible Brazilian authority ANVISA (Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária)[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006239.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and a subsequent Virus Neutralisation Test (VNT) for samples with a positive or equivocal ELISA result (ratio ≥0.8). VNT was performed in a 96-well format based on cytopathic effect (CPE), using ZIKV strain H/PF/2013[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006239.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Vero ATCC cells monolayers and serum dilutions from 1:10 to 1:320. All samples were tested in duplicate with positive and negative serum controls. Sera with titre ≥1:40 were considered positive, according to the recommendations of the French National Reference Centre for Arboviruses. This testing strategy was previously demonstrated to provide specificity and sensitivity values above 98.5% in volunteer blood donors of Martinique Island tested before, during, and after the 2016 ZIKV outbreak[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006239.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and with heavy exposure to dengue[
 <xref rid="pntd.0006239.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
