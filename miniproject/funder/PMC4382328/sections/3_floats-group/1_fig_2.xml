  <p>Viral assembly model of Ebola virus. Viral mRNA transcribed from genomic negative-sense RNA is released into the cytoplasm, where VPs are translated. Nucleoprotein, together with VP35, VP40, VP30, and VP24, forms small inclusions 
   <italic>(A)</italic>, which become larger near the nucleus 
   <italic>(B)</italic>. At the edge of the inclusion bodies, the nucleocapsid 
   <italic>(NC)</italic> is formed. VP40 associates with the NC, contributing to its transport to the plasma membrane 
   <italic>(C1)</italic>. Alternatively, nucleocapside initially associates with a few VP40 molecules and then moves to the plasma membrane, where it is enveloped with membrane-associated VP40 
   <italic>(C2)</italic>. Synthesized glycoprotein 
   <italic>(GP)</italic> is independently transported to the plasma membrane 
   <italic>(D)</italic>. The viral components then assemble, and the progeny virions bud 
   <italic>(E)</italic>.
