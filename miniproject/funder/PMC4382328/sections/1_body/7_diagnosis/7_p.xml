 </xref> and might be more reflective of the available support measures than differences in host susceptibility or acquisition of immunity on a larger scale. Delay in diagnosis, presentation at an already advanced stage of disease, and absence of treatment centers were clearly associated with higher death rates than have been reported lately. However, the more recent reports reflect primarily treatment centerâ€“associated deaths, whereas there are less survival data from more rural areas, which might not yet have received the same level of support. However, judging by previous epidemics and current observations, it is practically certain that differences in host susceptibility and response to infection and therapy exist, which, if better defined through research conducted in the context of the outbreak situation, might help to develop prognostic markers and tailored interventions.
