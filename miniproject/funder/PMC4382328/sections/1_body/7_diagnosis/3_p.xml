<p>Once in the laboratory, each analysis takes between 2 and 6 hours, and the costs of around US$100 per sample are difficult to meet in resource-constrained West African settings, thus severely limiting testing capacity. Lost time means that infected persons might remain in the community, with a severe risk of unknowingly transmitting the virus to others. Moreover, in the absence of rapid laboratory support, persons with other common infectious diseases, such as malaria or dengue, and similar early symptoms might be unjustifiably held in an Ebola “transit” center as a precautionary measure and are thus at risk of contracting Ebola.</p>
