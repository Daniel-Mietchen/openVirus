<p>Patients with severe disease and often fatal outcomes progress to multisystem involvement, including gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea) and pulmonary symptoms, such as breathlessness and cough. AÂ maculopapular rash has been reported around day 5 to 7 of the illness. The most feared symptoms of widespread hemorrhages from various mucous membranes and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy accompany the devastating multiorgan failure at the peak of viremia and ultimately lead to the death of the infected patient from hypovolemic shock unless comprehensive supportive therapy can be offered in time.
