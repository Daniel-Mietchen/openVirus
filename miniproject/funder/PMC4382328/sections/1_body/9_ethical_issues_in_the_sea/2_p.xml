<p>Because no human data exist on Ebola vaccine efficacy, the adaptive, randomized, observer-blind, controlled trial design still remains attractive because it is the most powerful scientific design for detection of vaccine efficacy and begins with truly randomized groups. This adaptive design allows for discontinuation of the control arm (or vaccination) based on predefined event-driven analyses of near-real time data collected during the trial.
