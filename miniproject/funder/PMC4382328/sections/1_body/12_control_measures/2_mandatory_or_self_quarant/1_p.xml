<p>The heroic efforts of international volunteers working in Ebola-hit countries have been widely acknowledged in the containment of the epidemic. Although many of the personnel sacrifice their lives in the process, others who successfully served in the affected areas face discrimination and stigmatization on return to their home countries. This is fueled by the notion that the returning volunteers might be incubating EV and could potentially be a source of infection to the community. Contrary to well-known evidence, a study suggested that asymptomatic subjects could be a significant threat of infection because EV could persist in the blood of asymptomatic infected subjects for 2 weeks after they were first exposed to an infected person.
