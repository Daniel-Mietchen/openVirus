 </xref> Cases were first detected on the border of Guinea Conakry with Sierra Leone and Liberia. Subsequently, transmission became intense in these 3 countries, and by the end of January 2015, it is still ongoing. Small numbers of cases linked to the outbreak have also been identified in neighboring countries, such as Senegal (n = 1), Nigeria (n = 20), and Mali (n = 9). Cases have been exported to other countries outside Africa, and person-to-person transmission occurred in Spain (n = 1) and the United States (n = 2). Simultaneously, a small unrelated EV outbreak took place in the Democratic Republic of Congo between July and October 2014.
