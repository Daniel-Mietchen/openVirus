<p>Several mathematic models have attempted to compare the average number of secondary infections per case (R
 <sub>0</sub>) in the past and recent outbreaks. No significant differences in R
 <sub>0</sub> at the start of epidemics have been observed, ranging between 1.35 and 2.22.

 </xref> Major limitations of these models are that they use different assumptions and rely on available data where accuracy might be poor under epidemic conditions and can vary between outbreaks and countries.
