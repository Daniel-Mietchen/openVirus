<p>The genus 
 <italic>Ebola</italic> are nonsegmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Filoviridae family, which is coined from the Latin word “filum,” meaning thread-like. The viral particles form varying shapes of filaments with the RNA molecule encapsulated in a lipid membrane, allowing formation of new particles on the surfaces of their host cells.
