<p>The genome of EV consists of a single-stranded RNA approximately 19,000 nucleotides long. The Ebola genome has 7 known nucleotide sequences that code for structural and nonstructural proteins also known as viral proteins (VPs). The core of the virus is made up of RNA genomic molecules comprised of nucleoprotein.

 </xref> There are several types of VPs, each with a different function. VP30 plays an important role in RNA transcription activation, which is strongly dependent on the concentration of VP30. VP24, which is the primary matrix protein, is also the most abundant virion component. Its role is unclear. VP35 plays an important role in viral RNA synthesis. It acts as a type of interferon antagonist. There is a very strong possibility that the potency of VP35 could account for the varying degrees of virulence among different strains of EV.

 </xref> VP40 is a matrix protein from the negative strand of RNA. It mainly participates in the assembly of lipid-enveloped viruses by providing a link between the surrounding membrane and the nucleocapsid structure. The protein, also known as single-surface transmembrane glycoprotein, forms spikes on virions and plays an important role in viral entry into cells by mediating receptor binding, fusion, and entry into the target cell.
