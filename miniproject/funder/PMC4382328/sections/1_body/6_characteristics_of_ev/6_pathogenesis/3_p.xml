<p>It is well established that the virus enters through mucous membranes or cuts and abrasions in contact with infected materials, such as blood, sweat, urine, and other secretions. Ingestion of contaminated food with high viral titers might also play a role.

 </xref> The exact mechanisms causing the substantial epithelial damage leading to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and hypotensive shock are incompletely understood. EV replication and ongoingÂ infection lead to extensive necrosis of adrenocortical cells, with a subsequent effect on steroid synthesis, blood pressure regulation, and loss of sodium, resulting in hypovolemic shock.
