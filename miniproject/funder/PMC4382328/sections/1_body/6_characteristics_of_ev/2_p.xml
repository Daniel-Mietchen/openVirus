<p>Five subtypes of EV are known: Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, Tai Forest (formerly known as CÃ´te d'Ivoire), and Reston. Each subtype was named after the site where it was first isolated. Since 1976, when EV was first described, the first 3 subtypes have been responsible for large outbreaks in Africa, with the Zaire strain causing the most fatalities. The Reston subtype is largely localized to the Western Pacific region. Despite being highly pathogenic in nonhuman primates, it has not been reported to cause illness in human subjects.
