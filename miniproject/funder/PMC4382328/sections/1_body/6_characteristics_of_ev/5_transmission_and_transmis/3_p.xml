The likelihood of transmission depends on the type of exposure and the viral load. Therefore transmission is unlikely during the incubation period,

Health care workers caring for patients with EVD are at high risk of infection if they do not use appropriate protective measures. Funerals have also played a significant role in the spread of infection in many EV outbreaks.
