<p>Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a classic zoonosis with persistence of EV in a reservoir species thought to be rodents and bats.

 </xref> Bats are present in large numbers at the sites of several outbreaks and are known to maintain other pathogenic RNA viruses, such as rabies. EV antibodies have been measured in fruit bats.

 </xref> However, the virus has never been isolated from these animals. It is supposed that EV might persist as an asymptomatic or subclinical infection in the reservoir species, with little or no transmission, and is only activated by appropriated stimulus (ie, stress and coinfection).
