<p>Because of the life-threatening situation during EV outbreaks and the absence of known treatments, experimental therapies are being deployed for compassionate use. In line with the principles of reciprocity, health workers infected with EV are currently given higher consideration to access the scarce drugs. Although understandable, this practice can promote distrust in health care systems and potentially undermine the social value of clinical research involving the experimental therapies. Therefore it remains critical that fair selection of beneficiaries of the unprovedÂ interventions should be transparently and consistently practiced.
