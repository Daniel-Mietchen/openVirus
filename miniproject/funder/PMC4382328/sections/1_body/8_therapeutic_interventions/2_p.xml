<p>No results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different interventions and protocols are available at this point in time. It is widely acknowledged that supportive care has differed between sites and patient populations, varying from basic oral rehydration to intravenous fluid resuscitation. Whether the routine use of antibiotics makes a significant contribution to outcome is unclear. The role of oral potassium supplementation in the absence of close electrolyte monitoring and use of antidiarrheal agents also remains to be established.</p>
