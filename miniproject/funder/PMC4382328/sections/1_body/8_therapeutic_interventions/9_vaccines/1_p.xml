<p>At the time of writing, there was no licensed vaccine against EV, although clinical trials have now commenced in the United States, Europe, and West Africa, and preliminary results on safety and immunogenicity are becoming available. Despite existence of promising vaccine candidates, the low incidence and sporadic nature of outbreaks of Ebola, largely limited to a few countries in Central and East Africa, have discouraged pharmaceutical companies from making huge investments into their development and testing.

 </xref> The sheer scale of the global health concerns has finally energized a consortium of pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and funders to prioritize the clinical development of Ebola vaccines. The first goal of this concerted effort is to protect the frontline health workers who are at increased risk of infections and death when providing care for patients.

 </xref> This is ultimately planned to be extended to the affected countries in an exceptionally fast-tracked process in which vaccine development, testing, and licensure take place in parallel. Because speed is the goal for Ebola vaccine development and rollout, a number of challenges need to be pragmatically addressed to achieve this lofty objective.
