<p>The current outbreak has unpredictable economic consequences for the 3 deeply affected countries (Guinea Conakry, Sierra Leone, and Liberia) and the region of West Africa as a whole. Even in neighboring countries within the region, where few or no cases have been reported, tourism (an important source of income) has been heavily hampered while facilities for potential Ebola cases have been prepared.</p>
