It continues to represent an alarming public health threat in the region and beyond and jeopardizes the provision of health care and other services in the affected countries. The scale of the epidemic has accelerated research efforts for diagnostics, treatment, and prevention galvanized through increased availability of funding. Our knowledge relating to the virus, disease pathogenesis, risk factors, dynamics of transmission, and epidemic control is increasing, and sociocultural factors have emerged as critical determinants for the success and failure of control efforts. However, there is a long way to go. In this review we summarize the current knowledge, examine the sociocultural context in West Africa, and outline priority areas for future research.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Ebola virus disease</kwd><kwd>viral hemorrhagic fever</kwd><kwd>containment</kwd><kwd>holistic</kwd><kwd>West Africa</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations used</title><kwd>CFR, Case/fatality ratio</kwd><kwd>CMV, Cytomegalovirus</kwd><kwd>EV, Ebola virus</kwd><kwd>EVD, Ebola virus disease</kwd><kwd>RCT, Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>VP, Viral protein</kwd><kwd>WHO, World Health Organization</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><italic>Discuss this article on the JACI Journal Club blog:</italic>

Subsequently, transmission became intense in these 3 countries, and by the end of January 2015, it is still ongoing. Small numbers of cases linked to the outbreak have also been identified in neighboring countries, such as Senegal (n&#x000a0;= 1), Nigeria (n&#x000a0;= 20), and Mali (n&#x000a0;= 9). Cases have been exported to other countries outside Africa, and person-to-person transmission occurred in Spain (n&#x000a0;= 1) and the United States (n&#x000a0;= 2). Simultaneously, a small unrelated EV outbreak took place in the Democratic Republic of Congo between July and October 2014.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> By the end of January 2015, the outbreak in West Africa had accounted for more than 22,000 cases and 8,800 deaths.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Although transmission seems to have slowed down in Liberia and Guinea Conakry, more than 50 new cases are still reported daily in Sierra Leone.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref></p><p>The current outbreak has unpredictable economic consequences for the 3 deeply affected countries (Guinea Conakry, Sierra Leone, and Liberia) and the region of West Africa as a whole. Even in neighboring countries within the region, where few or no cases have been reported, tourism (an important source of income) has been heavily hampered while facilities for potential Ebola cases have been prepared.</p><p>A serious shortage of timely resources in the region is one of the key factors responsible for the disproportionate scale of the ongoing epidemic in West Africa. Although international response eventually occurred, it only arose when the epidemic was already out of control and had been considered an international public health threat.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> An additional trigger for the international response was the appearance of cases in the United States and Europe. Suddenly, it became obvious that Ebola poses an urgent threat not only to West Africa but also to the international community at large.</p><p>This review aims to summarize the current scientific knowledge relating to host and pathogen, to analyze drivers of the current epidemic, and to discuss potential mitigation strategies within their ethical and societal context.</p><sec id="sec1"><title>Epidemiology of Ebola outbreaks in Africa</title><p>The first human EV outbreak occurred in Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1976<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> and was named after the nearby Ebola River. The same year, a similar outbreak with a different EV species occurred in Sudan.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Since 1976, more than 25 known outbreaks of EV have occurred in Africa, and 5 different EV species have been identified. Currently, EV hemorrhagic fever remains a plague for the population of equatorial Africa, with an increase in the numbers of outbreaks and cases since 2000.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>The current EV outbreak in West Africa is the largest ever recorded given the number of affected persons, countries involved, and longest persistent transmission (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). The previous largest outbreak occurred in Uganda in 2000 and involved 425 persons, less than 2% of the affected subjects in the current outbreak.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> Past outbreaks were confined to relatively&#x000a0;rural and isolated areas in Central Africa without spreading to urban sectors, which facilitated the effective intervention of control measures.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The delay in identifying the outbreak in urban settings in the current outbreak hindered the&#x000a0;timely and effective implementation of control efforts in the region.</p><p>Other clinical and epidemiologic characteristics are similar between past and ongoing EV epidemics. Mortality in patients with EV is very high, with case/fatality ratios (CFRs) that range from 41% to 89% depending on the virus strain.<xref rid="bib8 bib9 bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8&#x02013;11</sup></xref> Although initial numbers seemed to indicate that the CFR in the current epidemic was lower than in previous outbreaks, initial calculations did not account for delays between disease onset and final outcome,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and the sheer number of cases led to underestimates of the overall mortality. Currently, the CFR among all patients from whom a definitive outcome is recorded is 72%, and it is slightly less for hospitalized patients (CFR, 60%).<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The incubation period has also been similar between outbreaks, ranging from 2 to 21 days.<xref rid="bib8 bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,13</sup></xref></p><p>Several mathematic models have attempted to compare the average number of secondary infections per case (R<sub>0</sub>) in the past and recent outbreaks. No significant differences in R<sub>0</sub> at the start of epidemics have been observed, ranging between 1.35 and 2.22.<xref rid="bib8 bib11 bib13 bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8,11,13&#x02013;15</sup></xref> Major limitations of these models are that they use different assumptions and rely on available data where accuracy might be poor under epidemic conditions and can vary between outbreaks and countries.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Characteristics of EV</title><p>The genus <italic>Ebola</italic> are nonsegmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of the Filoviridae family, which is coined from the Latin word &#x0201c;filum,&#x0201d; meaning thread-like. The viral particles form varying shapes of filaments with the RNA molecule encapsulated in a lipid membrane, allowing formation of new particles on the surfaces of their host cells.<xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16,17</sup></xref></p><p>Five subtypes of EV are known: Zaire, Sudan, Bundibugyo, Tai Forest (formerly known as C&#x000f4;te d'Ivoire), and Reston. Each subtype was named after the site where it was first isolated. Since 1976, when EV was first described, the first 3 subtypes have been responsible for large outbreaks in Africa, with the Zaire strain causing the most fatalities. The Reston subtype is largely localized to the Western Pacific region. Despite being highly pathogenic in nonhuman primates, it has not been reported to cause illness in human subjects.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref></p><p>Apart from EV, another member of the Filoviridae family is Marburg virus, which is named after the city in Germany where it was first discovered. EV and Marburg viruses share genome organization and replication mechanisms with rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Molecular structure of EV</title><p>The genome of EV consists of a single-stranded RNA approximately 19,000 nucleotides long. The Ebola genome has 7 known nucleotide sequences that code for structural and nonstructural proteins also known as viral proteins (VPs). The core of the virus is made up of RNA genomic molecules comprised of nucleoprotein.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> There are several types of VPs, each with a different function. VP30 plays an important role in RNA transcription activation, which is strongly dependent on the concentration of VP30. VP24, which is the primary matrix protein, is also the most abundant virion component. Its role is unclear. VP35 plays an important role in viral RNA synthesis. It acts as a type of interferon antagonist. There is a very strong possibility that the potency of VP35 could account for the varying degrees of virulence among different strains of EV.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> VP40 is a matrix protein from the negative strand of&#x000a0;RNA. It mainly participates in the assembly of lipid-enveloped viruses by providing a link between the surrounding membrane and the nucleocapsid structure. The protein, also known as&#x000a0;single-surface transmembrane glycoprotein, forms spikes on virions and plays an important role in viral entry into cells by mediating receptor binding, fusion, and entry into the target cell.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref></p><p>Immunosuppression caused by EV is largely attributed to a&#x000a0;section of the glycoprotein (G1 and G2) that shares a striking homology with another immunosuppressive protein found in oncogenic retroviruses.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> This particular sequence is thought to aid EV in evading the human immune responses in&#x000a0;addition to suppressing MHC. The L protein, an RNA-dependent RNA&#x000a0;polymerase, plays an essential role in catalyzing transcription.<xref rid="bib19 bib21 bib22 bib23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19,21&#x02013;23</sup></xref></p><p>The process of replication and transcription of the viral genome is activated by the VPs that contain the nucleoprotein.<xref rid="bib24 bib25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref> When&#x000a0;compared with Marburg virus, the N-terminal region of nucleoprotein defines the inner diameter of the EV nucleocapside, whereas the RNA genome defines its length.<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> The details of viral assembly are summarized in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Transmission and transmission dynamics</title><p>Ebola hemorrhagic fever is a classic zoonosis with persistence of EV in a reservoir species thought to be rodents and bats.<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> Bats are present in large numbers at the sites of several outbreaks and are known to maintain other pathogenic RNA viruses, such as rabies. EV antibodies have been measured in fruit bats.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> However, the virus has never been isolated from these animals. It is supposed that EV might persist as an asymptomatic or subclinical infection in the reservoir species, with little or no transmission, and is only activated by appropriated stimulus (ie, stress and coinfection).<xref rid="bib29 bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29,30</sup></xref> Apes, humans, and other mammalian species that are susceptible to EV infection are regarded as end hosts.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref></p><p>An outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) typically begins&#x000a0;through human contact with an infected animal.<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> These transmissions might be an infrequent event, probably also underreported, given the restricted contact with the reservoir species.<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Once the first human is infected, the disease spreads&#x000a0;to other human subjects through direct contact with blood&#x000a0;and body fluids of sick patients or persons who have died from EVD.</p><p>The most infectious body fluids are blood, feces, and vomit,<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> although other fluids, such as urine, saliva, breast milk, semen, and, theoretically, sweat, can also contribute to transmission because EV has been isolated from these fluids. The likelihood of transmission depends on the type of exposure and the viral load. Therefore transmission is unlikely during the incubation period,<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> and the risk is highest during contact with very sick patients and dead bodies. Health care workers caring for patients with EVD are at high risk of infection if they do not use appropriate protective measures. Funerals have also played a significant role in the spread of infection in many EV outbreaks.<xref rid="bib32 bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32&#x02013;34</sup></xref></p><p>Other routes of transmission might include contact with contaminated surfaces or objects because the virus can persist for hours or days.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> There is no evidence that EV transmission can spread from human to human through the respiratory route.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref></p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Pathogenesis</title><p>Most insights into the pathogenesis of Ebola stem from animal data because the traditionally remote location of the outbreaks and the varying nature of the associated emergency responses and cautious handling of highly contagious specimens in high-containment laboratories make in-depth immunopathogenesis studies in human subjects very difficult.</p><p>Serosurveys conducted in the region suggest that EV has been endemic in equatorial Africa at least during the last decades<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> and specifically in West Africa for about a decade.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Therefore it is likely that asymptomatic infections can occur in some subjects.<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> However, the factors determining the spectrum and range of clinical symptoms from mild to severe manifestations are not well understood at present. Larger seroprevalence surveys in the affected populations and detailed host studies during the time of an epidemic would be mandatory to understand factors influencing susceptibility and possibly protection.</p><p>It is well established that the virus enters through mucous membranes or cuts and abrasions in contact with infected materials, such as blood, sweat, urine, and other secretions. Ingestion of contaminated food with high viral titers might also play a role.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> EV can infect a wide range of cell types, with a preference for rapid replication in monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells,<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> from which the infection spreads through the lymphatic system and hematogenously. Although not a direct target of infection, large numbers of lymphocytes apoptose and release soluble factors, triggering the inflammatory cascade and causing damage to the endothelial system.<xref rid="bib40 bib41" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40,41</sup></xref> The exact mechanisms causing the substantial epithelial damage leading to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and hypotensive shock are incompletely understood. EV replication and ongoing&#x000a0;infection lead to extensive necrosis of adrenocortical cells, with a subsequent effect on steroid synthesis, blood pressure regulation, and loss of sodium, resulting in hypovolemic shock.<xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref></p><p>Coagulopathy is a key feature of advanced Ebola disease and is induced by the strong proinflammatory response from monocytes and macrophages, as well as possibly deficiencies in production of liver-derived clotting factors because of liver cell necrosis. The&#x000a0;immune mechanisms involved are illustrated in more detail in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>.</p><p>The infection of antigen-presenting cells with EV triggers a strong inflammatory response, and clinical outcome depends on the extent of the host's counterregulatory response. An increase in nitric oxide levels has been associated with poor outcome.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> According to data from Uganda, HLA alleles B*67 and B*15 were associated with fatal outcomes, whereas B*07 and B*14 were associated with nonfatal outcomes, but this has not been confirmed in West Africa at present.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Diagnosis</title><p>After a median incubation period of 2 to 10 days, the abrupt onset of Ebola hemorrhagic fever is characterized by fever, myalgias, chills, and malaise. The initial diagnosis is often made on clinical grounds in the context of a history of exposure. EV infection is then confirmed in national or international reference laboratories by identifying the viral genome in the blood of patients by using RT-PCR techniques or viral detection ELISAs.<xref rid="bib45 bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45,46</sup></xref> The host response can be measured as the IgM and later IgG antibody response by using ELISA techniques.</p><p>In nonfatal cases the increase in antibody titers around day 6 to 11 accompanies the recovery. The development of antigen-specific IgM and then IgG is accompanied by strong inflammatory responses, including TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 production. Whether these are markers of disease activity or have protective potential remains to be established. IgG antibodies are known to persist for many years after infection.<xref rid="bib47 bib48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47,48</sup></xref> Although highly accurate, the currently used diagnostic tests have significant logistic challenges, including the requirements for high-level laboratory biosafety and staff with expertise in using sophisticated machines.</p><p>Once in the laboratory, each analysis takes between 2 and 6 hours, and the costs of around US$100 per sample are difficult to meet in resource-constrained West African settings, thus severely limiting testing capacity. Lost time means that infected persons might remain in the community, with a severe risk of unknowingly transmitting the virus to others. Moreover, in the absence of rapid laboratory support, persons with other common infectious&#x000a0;diseases, such as malaria or dengue, and similar early symptoms might be unjustifiably held in an Ebola &#x0201c;transit&#x0201d; center as a precautionary measure and are thus at risk of contracting Ebola.</p><p>In October 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched an initiative to stimulate diagnostic innovations to bring novel accurate tests to the point-of-care level. Decreasing the turnaround time for diagnosis through such assays would allow triaging and treating appropriate patients as swiftly as possible. The 2 key initiatives aim to rapidly solicit products that meet a prespecified &#x0201c;ideal profile&#x0201d; of the next generation of diagnostic tests and to provide a rapid review process for assessing a diagnostic test's quality, safety, and performance.<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr"><sup>49</sup></xref></p><p>Patients with severe disease and often fatal outcomes progress to multisystem involvement, including gastrointestinal (vomiting, diarrhea) and pulmonary symptoms, such as breathlessness and cough. A&#x000a0;maculopapular rash has been reported around day 5 to 7 of the illness. The most feared symptoms of widespread hemorrhages from various mucous membranes and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy accompany the devastating multiorgan failure at the peak of viremia and ultimately lead to the death of the infected patient from hypovolemic shock unless comprehensive supportive therapy can be offered in time.<xref rid="bib50 bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50,51</sup></xref></p><p>Abnormal laboratory parameters include leukopenia and lymphopenia, increased liver and pancreatic enzyme levels, abnormal clotting results, and renal failure, all of which are indicative of a severe multisystem disorder with a high rate of fatality.<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr"><sup>52</sup></xref></p><p>Death rates have varied between 40% and 80% at various times during the current epidemic<xref rid="bib50 bib51" ref-type="bibr"><sup>50,51</sup></xref> and might be more reflective of the available support measures than differences in host susceptibility or acquisition of immunity on a larger scale. Delay in diagnosis, presentation at an already advanced stage of disease, and absence of treatment centers were clearly associated with higher death rates than have been reported lately. However, the more recent reports reflect primarily treatment center&#x02013;associated deaths, whereas there are less survival data from more rural areas, which might not yet have received the same level of support. However, judging by previous epidemics and current observations, it is practically certain that differences in host susceptibility and response to infection and therapy exist, which, if better defined through research conducted in the context of the outbreak situation, might help to develop prognostic markers and tailored interventions.</p><p>Time of presentation, viral load, general state of the patient by the time of arrival at a treatment center, and possibly age and comorbidities can all influence the ultimate outcome of the disease in a subject.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Therapeutic interventions</title><p>The current recommendations for treatment of Ebola comprise the administration of sufficient fluids (oral or intravenously) to maintain circulatory stability, exclusion or treatment of malaria, and administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat potential&#x000a0;concomitant bacterial infections, antipyretics, and analgesia.<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr"><sup>53</sup></xref></p><p>No results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different interventions and protocols are available at this point in time. It is widely acknowledged that supportive care has differed between sites and patient populations, varying from&#x000a0;basic oral rehydration to intravenous fluid resuscitation. Whether the routine use of antibiotics makes a significant contribution to outcome is unclear. The role of oral potassium supplementation in the absence of close electrolyte monitoring&#x000a0;and use of antidiarrheal agents also remains to be established.</p><p>The pressure on materials, facilities, and skilled personnel in the endemic areas has limited the supportive care that can be provided in this emergency situation when compared with the care delivered to personnel with Ebola infection who were expatriated to resource-rich settings in Europe and North America. Not surprisingly, death rates in the context of modern intensive care have been much lower, as long as the patients arrived at earlier stages of the disease. Beyond these very basic supportive therapies, some experimental treatments have been used on some patients with various success.<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr"><sup>54</sup></xref></p><p>By December 2014, several hundred patients were expected to take part in 3 separate trials in early 2015 conducted at M&#x000e9;decins Sans Fronti&#x000e8;res&#x02013;run Ebola treatment centers in Guinea and Liberia. The different objectives are to test the administration of antibodies from the blood of Ebola survivors to neutralize EV in the patients (passive immunization) or to interfere with transcription and replication of the EV by using antivirals, which have shown promise in other viral diseases.</p><p>The 2 leading antiviral candidates are brincidofovir (Chimerix, Durham, NC) and favipiravir (Fujifilm, Toyama Chemical, Tokyo, Japan).

In line with the principles of reciprocity, health workers infected with EV are currently given higher consideration to access the scarce drugs. Although understandable, this practice can promote distrust in health care systems and potentially undermine the social value of clinical research involving the experimental therapies.

The experts proposed a parallel evaluation of different experimental interventions at different sites while concurrently documenting mortality rates after use of &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; care.<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr"><sup>69</sup></xref> An emerging body of knowledge advocates a prospective cohort, stepped-wedge design. This design is used when ethical, financial, or logistic constraints prevent the use of individual RCTs.<xref rid="bib70 bib71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>70,71</sup></xref> In this design experimental vaccines/interventional treatments would be sequentially rolled out randomly to communities as they become available. Time periods before the community intervention serve as controls, and efficacy is estimated based on having concurrent preintervention and postintervention follow-up time periods.<xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr"><sup>71</sup></xref> This approach requires close interactions with major stakeholders, including regulators, investigators, affected communities, and the WHO. If backed with robust data collection, this design could be acceptable to regulators to support licensure.

In line with this strategy, when an Ebola case is confirmed, the affected patient's family members, friends, neighbors, and community will be vaccinated, thereby forming a ring of resistance around the patient to prevent further spread of the infection. This strategy was successfully used to eradicate smallpox globally.<xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr"><sup>72</sup></xref></p><p>Because no human data exist on Ebola vaccine efficacy, the adaptive, randomized, observer-blind, controlled trial design still remains attractive because it is the most powerful scientific design for detection of vaccine efficacy and begins with truly randomized groups.

Because of apparent food insecurity and poverty, wildlife animals, including bats and nonhuman primates, are frequently hunted for subsistence and trade.<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr"><sup>74</sup></xref> This anthropogenic activity amplifies human exposure to pernicious zoonosis because deadly viruses harbored by these animals can easily be transmitted to human subjects when their carcasses are being processed for human consumption.<xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr"><sup>75</sup></xref> Although the mechanism underlying animal-to-human transmission it is not entirely clear, most Ebola outbreaks to date are traceable to a single index case who (or whose family members) had contact with carcasses of bats or nonhuman primates in impoverished remote African villages with obvious food insecurity.<xref rid="bib18 bib76" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18,76</sup></xref></p><p>Once an outbreak has been initiated, spread is often enhanced by an array of cultural beliefs and practices, including adherence to time-honored paradigms of health and illness. Most of these paradigms ascribe diseases to supernatural or evil forces and have specific treatment approaches, including ritualistic practices to appease gods and ancestors.<xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr"><sup>77</sup></xref></p><p>In the context of Ebola outbreaks, afflicted communities ascribe the disease to evil spirits, witchcraft, or sorcery. These views lead many to seek care from traditional or spiritual healers, who in turn use unsafe practices to treat patients. In many outbreaks traditional treatment homes have served as epicenters for disease propagation.<xref rid="bib78 bib79" ref-type="bibr"><sup>78,79</sup></xref></p><p>Mistrust of governments and foreign workers has helped to fan transmission chains in communities, where containment teams have been blamed for initiating and spreading the disease.<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr"><sup>80</sup></xref> These misconceptions have rendered dozens of affected villages inaccessible and have led to the destruction of treatment units<xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr"><sup>81</sup></xref> and physical attacks on containment teams, including butchering of staff.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Additionally, intense disease transmission in hospitals has further amplified mistrust of authorities when communities view hospitals as institutions that kill more than they cure. Fearful patients subsequently absconded from treatment units, and families resisted taking patients to hospitals, thus enhancing disease propagation in the communities. In West African settings unauthorized collections of money for obtaining death certificates has emerged to enable families to bury their loved ones in local graves.<xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr"><sup>82</sup></xref></p><p>Burial rites and mourning ceremonies appear to be the most significant drivers of the disease. In some settings they account for roughly two thirds of all new cases.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> The risk is high because these ceremonies, which bring hundreds of persons in close contacts with highly infectious corpses, most often&#x000a0;require people to follow long-standing rituals, including keeping corpses for 3 days and communal hand washing in water that was used to bathe corpses.<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr"><sup>79</sup></xref> In an attempt to limit transmissions during funerals, WHO has developed recommendations on safe burial practices. However, uptake of these recommendations are disappointing because many families decline offers for safe burials.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> The low uptake hindered achieving the United Nations target of safely burying 70% of victims by the end of 2014.</p><p>A major obstacle to implementation is the profound view about life after death held in some communities. In many cultures the goal of life is to become an ancestor in the spirit world or to join the creator in heaven. &#x0201c;Proper burials&#x0201d; are mandatory requirements for achieving this goal.<xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr"><sup>83</sup></xref> Therefore the dead must be prepared and buried in a prescribed way, which must be supported by numerous religious rites. According to these beliefs, the person might be subjected to severe torture, rejected by the ancestors, or transformed into wandering ghosts or totems if these rules are not followed. In some cultures improper burials are only reserved for witches and sorcerers, whose bodies are sometime subjected to burning, fed to carnivores, or secretly disposed of in isolated places and away from family graves. In previous outbreaks thoughts of being buried in plastic bags at isolated places by unfamiliar persons and in the absence of relatives and traditional rituals scared patients and families away from seeking health care or even notifying the authorities of Ebola-related deaths in communities.<xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr"><sup>84</sup></xref></p><p>To address these issues, cultural paradigms must be acknowledged, and management must be incorporated into Ebola preparedness plans. As seen in Uganda, some of these paradigms contain elements, such as isolation of cases, restrictions on gatherings, and safe burial practices, which are consistent with modern principles of infectious disease control.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> Aligning such containment strategies to existing helpful paradigms has proved useful in controlling deadly epidemics.<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr"><sup>85</sup></xref> This experience highlights the need for replication of similar studies in other African settings.

The asymmetric distribution of health services has created significant disparities in health equity and access in many rural areas, where most outbreaks occur. Lack of basic health infrastructure, medical supplies, and trained personnel render the quantity and quality of health service delivery in these areas disproportionate to health needs and affect health-seeking behavior.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p><p>Second, most countries lack laboratory capacity, which can provide rapid confirmation of Ebola.<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr"><sup>86</sup></xref> During the early phase of an outbreak, samples are often shipped to distant countries for confirmation of Ebola, resulting in delayed response strategies.</p><p>Third, surveillance systems and quarantine mechanisms are weak,&#x000a0;hindering contact tracing and monitoring efforts. Furthermore, health information systems are failing to deliver timely and reliable information that can guide containment strategies.</p><p>Most of these limitations are a result of limited health care resources. In many Sub-Saharan African nations there are less than 0.4 physicians and 1 bed for every 1000 population, and health expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product hardly exceed 5%.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> This situation is even worse in Ebola-stricken nations because their health systems are plagued by diverse levels of dysfunction, including the inability to maintain adequate infection control.

In the absence of licensed novel treatments and vaccines, control of the epidemic relies on nonpharmaceutical interventions, which include quick identification and isolation of cases, control measures in hospital settings, identification and follow-up of contacts, and, very importantly, safe burials. In the first Ebola epidemic several factors contributed to stopping transmission, including leadership and clear designation of authorities, organization, coordination (assuring international and local support), logistics, and communication.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Several subsequent epidemics used field teams with experience in containing other&#x000a0;outbreaks, such as measles or polio, to trace primary contacts of patients with Ebola because they are trained for rigorous identification and surveillance. Because the virus is not transmitted through air or water, stopping transmission should be feasible when the cases are detected early and managed properly.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> However, burials have effectively served as super-spreader events. Culturally sensitive burials and disposal of cadavers are needed.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Efforts are ongoing to assess previously successful strategies in the current epidemic.

The most effective means to control the current epidemic require a combined strategy of intensifying contract tracing to remove infected persons in the community at an early stage of the development of symptoms, provide both isolation and care,<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> and achieve sanitary burials.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Models predict that the epidemic could be stopped by full alignment of these strategies with an efficacy of 60% for each of them if all were implemented.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> If only individual strategies were applied, these would need to achieve greater than 90% efficacy to control the current outbreak in West Africa.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The experience in developed countries has shown that with appropriate resources, case mortality of EV infection can be decreased.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Because burials are key in the transmission of the virus, the improvement of clinical care that would lead to decreased mortality would favor control of the epidemic.

Although many of the personnel sacrifice their lives in the process, others who successfully served in the affected areas face discrimination and stigmatization on return to their home countries. This is fueled by the notion that the returning volunteers might be incubating EV and could potentially be a source of infection to the community.
