<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to delineate the dynamic epidemic changes and investigated the relationships among HFRS occurrence and climate factors in Changchun. The results of this study confirmed that the incidence of HFRS decreased from 2013 to 2017, which may result from large-scale vaccination campaigns, and the promotion of urbanization, and the decrease of in agricultural and animal husbandry activities.

 </sup> Changchun has a bimodal distribution of large peaks in spring and summer (April to June) and small peaks in autumn and winter (Octoberâ€“December). The seasonal distribution of HFRS is correlated with the dynamics of the main subtypes of HV. HFRS caused by HV occurs all year round but tends to peak in autumn and winter, while HFRS caused by SEOV usually peaks in spring. It is mainly transmitted by strains of
