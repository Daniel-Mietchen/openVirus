<p>Despite the insights gained, the limitations of our study should also be acknowledged. First, this study examined only the effect of climate factors on HFRS epidemics. However, HV transmission results from a combination of rodent-related factors, land use, change in biotope, HV species, and social factors.

 </sup> Unfortunately, data were unavailable on many of these factors. Second, the climate factors used in our models were the average value and the effects of extreme value on the survival and reproduction of rodents and transmission of HFRS require further investigation. These limitations may be overcome in better-designed future studies.
