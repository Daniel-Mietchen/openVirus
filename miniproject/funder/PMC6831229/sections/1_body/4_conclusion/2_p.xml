<p>This study shows the temporal distribution of HFRS in Changchun throughout the years (2013â€“2017), with a distinctly declining trend. The month trends for HFRS were positively correlated with mean wind velocity of the different previous months but negatively correlated with the mean temperature, relative humidity, sunshine duration, and accumulative precipitation. Therefore, climate factors in the next years should be considered as early warning indicators for HFRS breaks in Changchun.</p>
