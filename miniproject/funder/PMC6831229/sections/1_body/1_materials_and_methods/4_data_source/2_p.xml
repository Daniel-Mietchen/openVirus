<p>In 1950, HFRS was included on the list of Class B Notifiable Diseases in China. Clinical diagnostic criteria include: exposure history, that is, exposure to rodents and their excreta, saliva, and urine within 2 months before the onset of illness; acute illness with at least 2 of the following clinical symptoms: that is fever, chill, hemorrhage, headache, back pain, abdominal pain, acute renal dysfunction, and hypotension; experience or partial experience of the 5 phases of disease course, that is, fever, hypopiesis, oliguresis, hyperdiuresis, and recovery; and abnormality of blood and urine routine parameters. In this study, records from 2013 to 2017 on HFRS cases were obtained from the Jilin Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (JNDSS), an administrative database developed by China CDC. All HFRS cases were first diagnosed on the basis of clinical symptoms. Then, the patientsâ€™ blood samples were collected in hospitals and sent to the laboratory of Jilin Provincial CDC for serological confirmation. Finally, the data were collected by case number according to the sampling results. Incidence rates were calculated per 100,000 individuals by using population estimates based on a census of China.</p>
