<p>The annual HFRS incidence from 2013 to 2017 was calculated and plotted to observe annual fluctuations in Changchun. Cumulative HFRS cases for each month from 2013 to 2017 were also calculated to observe seasonal fluctuations. Cross-correlation and autocorrelation analyses were performed to detect the lagged effect of climate factors on HFRS transmission and the autocorrelation of monthly HFRS cases. Cross-correlation could be observed if the absolute value of the cross-correlation coefficient (CCF) was 2 times higher than that of the standard error (SE).

 </sup> Autocorrelation and partial correlation analyses were performed to explore whether the monthly HFRS cases were affected by the cases in the previous months using the Ljung-Box Q test, autocorrelation coefficient (AC) analysis, and partial autocorrelation coefficient (PAC) analysis.

 </sup> If the Ljung-Box Q value is higher than a particular critical value, the autocorrelation of 1 or more delays may be significantly different from zero, indicating that the values are not independent and random during this period. Principal component analysis (PCA) was based on climate data from 2013 to 2017 to extract principal components. The extracted principal components and autocorrelation terms of monthly HFRS cases were added into a multiple regression model called principal components regression (PCR) model to quantify the relationship between climate factors, autocorrelation terms, and transmission of HFRS. All data were analyzed by using R 3.4.3 Software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
