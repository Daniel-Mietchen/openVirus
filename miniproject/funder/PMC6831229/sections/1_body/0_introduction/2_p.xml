<p>Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a rodent-borne endemic disease, is caused by different species of Hantanviruses (HVs).

 </sup> Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Seoul virus (SEOV) are the 2 main virulence factors of HFRS in China related to 
 <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic> and 
 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, respectively. The typical clinical symptoms of HFRS are fever, hemorrhage, headache, back pain, abdominal pain, acute renal dysfunction, and hypotension. Humans are usually get infected with HV by contact or inhalation of aerosols and secretions from infected rodent hosts.

 </sup> The number of human HFRS cases in China accounts for almost 90% of the total cases worldwide.

 </sup> At present, HFRS is endemic in 28 of 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and metropolitan areas of mainland China.

 </sup> The number of cases of infections caused by HV varies both geographically and yearly.

 </sup> In 2004, the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) was established online by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), and HFRS cases in the whole country were reported daily through this system. Although environmental management, host surveillance, and HFRS vaccine implementation have played an important role in controlling HFRS, HFRS is still a serious public health problem in China, with about 20,000 to 50,000 human cases reported annually in mainland China.

 </sup> As a seasonally distributed rodent-borne disease, external environmental factors including climate factors may play a significant role in its transmission. Indeed, studies in different areas of China and other countries have suggested that climate factors, such as temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity, may influence the incidence of HFRS.
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–

 </sup> Rodent population densities, virus prevalence in rodents, diversity of rodents, rodent community composition, and species distributions have important influences on HFRS transmission.

 </sup> Since the first HFRS case in 1955, the Jilin Province, with all its 9 cities/autonomous prefectures, has been susceptible to the disease.
 <sup>[

 </sup> The first HFRS case was reported in 1959 in Changchun of the Jilin Province,
 <sup>[
  <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]
 </sup> where the incidence of HFRS has always been at the forefront in Jilin Province. A key research priority for effective HFRS prevention and control is improving the knowledge of epidemic characteristics and understanding the underlying risk factors for disease transmission. Here, we analyzed the surveillance data of both human cases and climate factors during the period (2013–2017) comprehended to characterize the epidemic trends of HFRS and explore the associations between climate factors and HFRS transmission in Changchun.
