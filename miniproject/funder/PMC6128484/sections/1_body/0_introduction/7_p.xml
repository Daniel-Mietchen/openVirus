<p>The main objective of this review is to update the current literature with more detailed data on the main determinants of direct health-care expenditures for influenza. To this end, the primary aims are to i) collect and analyse detailed data on influenza-driven health-care costs per episode, with a specific focus on inpatient and outpatient costs, emergency department (ED) services, and drugs; ii) analyse the available evidence about drug expenditures, particularly symptomatic treatments and over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, and iii) report on how different cost items vary by population subgroups such as specific age and risk profiles.</p>
