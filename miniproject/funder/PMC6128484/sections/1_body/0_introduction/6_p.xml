<p>Previous reviews have analyzed the economic burden of influenza on both direct healthcare costs and indirect societal costs [

 <xref rid="pone.0202787.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For example Peasah et al. reports nationally-aggregated and per capita costs of hospitalization events, outpatient services and productivity losses [
 <xref rid="pone.0202787.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], whereas Dao et al. collected data on direct medical and non-medical costs as well as indirect costs [
 <xref rid="pone.0202787.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These previous works generally provide aggregate estimates per macro-categories of costs, per capita costs and average cost per item. For example, Peasah et al. report that indirect costs account for more than 50% of total costs in five out of eight studies reviewed, and that total costs per capita range between US$ 1 (Thailand) to US$ 63 (USA). The authors also provide separated cost estimates for hospitalization events, outpatient visits and per-day productivity losses [
 <xref rid="pone.0202787.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, they do not provide any data on the costs per episode, nor they report specific cost items and drug expenditures, or any consideration on inappropriate spending for the management of influenza.
