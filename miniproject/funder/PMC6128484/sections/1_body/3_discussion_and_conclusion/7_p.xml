<p>None of the included studies has considered appropriateness in resource use (e.g. abuse of antibiotics). Despite cost of illness studies have ultimately a descriptive role, evidence on (in)appropriateness may be very useful for policy-makers. Indeed, there is a general belief that antibiotics are overprescribed in primary care. However, judgments on appropriateness of prescription are not easy and depend on clinical characteristics (e.g. presence of likely bacterial pathogens associated with influenza) [

The study reports that 46% of patients were prescribed antibiotics on average, while just 24% were given an antiviral.
