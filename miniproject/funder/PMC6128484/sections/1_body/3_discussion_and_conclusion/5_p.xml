<p>The incidence of outpatient services on the cost per episode was similar to that of inpatient services, and equal to 44.5% on average (range 14â€“72%). Differences in costs of outpatient services reflect the observed variation in the number of outpatient visits per ILI episode. For example, Molinari et al estimated the probability of having an outpatient visit after a flu infection in the US to be in a range between 0.45 and 0.62 for low risk individuals, and 0.62 and 0.91 for high-risk individuals [
