<p>Inpatient admissions absorb a considerable amount of healthcare resources. Therefore, potentially relevant sources of variation may be explained by different hospitalization rates, and the unit cost associated with each hospitalization event. The lowest cost per hospitalisation was reported in Korea (US$473) [

In other countries, variations in hospitalization costs are still wide and range between US$ 1,419 in Hong Kong [

In addition, in studies focusing on the overall ILI population, hospitalization rates varied in a range between near zero and 6%, that again may be attributed to within-study differences in the ILI population and other country-specific features.
