<p>In addition, alternatively to virological confirmation via laboratory tests, many of the included studies identify influenza-like episodes using classification codes from medical claims (e.g. ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM), or a set of predefined symptoms and syndromes. These differences in the identification strategy may be a further source of variation in the estimated total and relative costs of care. For example, retrospective identification of ILI through administrative databases and ICD codes may include different patients populations compared to laboratory confirmed influenza cases (e.g. patients with bacterial pneumonia), that will ultimately affect resource consumption and costs. In addition, these different identification strategies reflect the fact that influenza cases are often not virologically confirmed in clinical practice. This aspect hamper any attempt to formulate considerations about the appropriateness of disease management strategies, especially regarding drug prescription.</p>
