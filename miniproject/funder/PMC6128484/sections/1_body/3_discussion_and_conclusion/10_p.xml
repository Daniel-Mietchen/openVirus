<p>The present study has some limitations. First, we have not performed a quality assessment of the studies. Although envisaged in the PRISMA guidelines, it was considered that these types of costing studies, without a specific intervention, did not require a thorough assessment of the risk of bias. In addition, when not directly reported, data on the cost-per episode was calculated from other reported figures. Lastly the included papers were very different in terms of target population, definition of the disease, methods, data sources and outcomes, hampering the possibility of doing meaningful comparisons among them.</p>
