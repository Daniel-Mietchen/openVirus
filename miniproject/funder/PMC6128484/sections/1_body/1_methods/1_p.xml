 <xref rid="pone.0202787.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The types of studies considered were all types of cost of illness analyses (COI), including both incidence and prevalence-based analyses, using either prospective or retrospective data. Modeling studies that empirically estimated the cost per influenza-related episode and then extrapolated it to a wider population were included as well.
