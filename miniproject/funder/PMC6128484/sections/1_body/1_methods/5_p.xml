<p>The primary outcomes of the present review are seasonal influenza-related direct health care costs. Studies could take either the healthcare sector perspective or a wider societal perspective. However, when a societal perspective was used, data were extracted for direct health-care costs only. When not directly provided, the cost per influenza-related episode was calculated by dividing the overall costs by the number of episodes reported. Conversely, studies were discarded whenever only aggregate estimates were reported, and conversion was not deemed possible.</p>
