<p>Since this review was not aiming to estimate the impact of specific interventions (e.g. the impact of vaccines, or rapid influenza diagnostic tests on costs or cost-effectiveness), all cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses, or other types of comparative studies were not included. Costs may be estimated through either a bottom up or top down approach, with data sources including administrative data, medical records or patient surveys. Other types of studies and data sources, not specifically covered by the defined inclusion criteria, were assessed on a case-by-case basis, and included if deemed informative to the aim of the review.</p>
