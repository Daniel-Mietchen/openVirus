<p>The hospitalization costs over the total number of ILI cases (outpatient and inpatient cases) range between US$9 in Korea [
 <xref rid="pone.0202787.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and US$181 in the US [
 <xref rid="pone.0202787.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], with differences partly explained by differential unit costs per hospitalization events and hospitalization rates. However, figures may also reflect differences in the estimation method (e.g. top down or bottom up approaches), the type of healthcare resources included and the monetary values attached to them.
