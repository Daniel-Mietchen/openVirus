<p>Prescription and OTC drug costs were analysed in 12 and 13 studies respectively. The mean prescription drug cost per episode ranges from US$1 in UK [

 <xref rid="pone.0202787.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The expected OTC expenditure per episode ranges between US$2 in Italy [
 <xref rid="pone.0202787.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and US$13 in Australia and Germany [
 <xref rid="pone.0202787.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0202787.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and their impact varied between 2.8% and 18.6% of total health care costs and between 13.2% and 88.9% of total drug costs. However, differences in OTC consumption is likely to be even more sensitive to estimation methods and data availability. Since OTC drugs are paid out-of-pocket, usage and overall costs have been either estimated through medical charts and patient diaries, or assumed by the authors. Antipyretics and antibiotics are the most-frequently reported drugs, integrated in a few studies by antiviral, analgesics, antitussives and nose spray drugs.
