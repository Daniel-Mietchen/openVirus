 <xref rid="pone.0202787.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> illustrate the main characteristics of the studies included in the analysis. Of the included studies, 44% are based in the US, 22% and 26% in Europe and Australia respectively, and 8% in Asia. Retrospective analyses are predominant (66%) with most studies relying on administrative data. Societal perspective was adopted in 12 studies. The other studies took a health care system perspective (8 studies) or a hospital perspective (7 studies). Identification strategies of patients were mainly based on symptoms assessment, medical charts, confirmatory laboratory tests, or used international classification diseases codes (ICD-9-CM or ICD-10-CM code sets). Cases were mostly defined as influenza cases (59%), followed by ILI (31%), and to a minor extent ARI and RSV cases (7% and 3% respectively). Most of the studies focus on pediatric populations (52%), or the overall adult populations (41%), whereas elderly people were targeted in only 7% of the papers. More than 60% of the studies includes subgroups analyses by age (48%), co-morbidities and complications (22%), risk of complications (18%), and others (e.g. vaccinated
