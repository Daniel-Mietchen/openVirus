<p>It has been hypothesized that HPeV3 could cause more severe disease due to the fact that it lacks the RGD integrin-binding motif and, therefore, perhaps infects a wider range of cells in the host by utilizing a cellular receptor different to other HPeV types [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,

 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, the recombinant HPeV5 detected here possessed the RGD motif and had a high rate of meningitis-/sepsis-like symptoms reported in the infected children, suggesting that the severity of clinical disease is not dependent on the absence of this motif. We previously speculated that changes of a glutamine (Q) to an arginine (R) immediately upstream to the cleavage site of the 2C-3A proteins may be important in determining virulence [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. While, the 2C-3A junction of the sequenced HPeV5’s in this study all possessed a glutamine at this position, this region was again a hotspot of variability with more nucleotide and amino acid changes compared to the other sequenced regions in the four sequenced HPeV5’s. Three of the four amino acid changes from the junction region occurred in 2C. Studies have shown that the 2C co-localizes with viral RNA in HPeV1-infected cells [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It may, therefore, be likely that for a recently formed recombinant HPeV, the 2C must change to better bind to the new viral RNA and capsid structure. It may also be that this variability is the result of the viruses sequenced in this study represent multiple introductions of related viruses into Australia. These may have arisen when the two or more parent viruses were co-circulating in more population-dense regions overseas, resulting in multiple recombination events producing slightly different progeny viruses, which were then brought to Australia by travelers.
