<p>While HPeV5 is not typically associated with the more severe manifestations of parechovirus infections, such as meningitis and sepsis-like symptoms in children, the recombinant HPeV5 described here has had somewhat similar clinical manifestations to the Australian recombinant HPeV3 [

All seven HPeV5 infections in 2019 were detected in young infants less than 3 months old, and the rate of sepsis- and meningitis-like symptoms (57%) in cases was similar to that seen in infections with the Australian recombinant HPeV3 (52%) in the 2017/18 epidemic [

However, the clinicians at University Hospital Geelong have indicated that the two 2019 cases treated there, although severe, were not as severe as cases treated during the Geelong 2015 HPeV3 outbreak. It is possible that the acquisition of a HPeV polymerase very similar (&gt;98% similarity) to the virulent recombinant Australian HPeV3 could result in more efficient virus replication and, therefore, more severe clinical signs in this HPeV5, resulting in the more HPeV3-like clinical manifestation. Similar intertypic recombination, and possible acquisition of HPeV3 genes, has been observed in HPeV4 isolated from infants with sepsis-like illness [
