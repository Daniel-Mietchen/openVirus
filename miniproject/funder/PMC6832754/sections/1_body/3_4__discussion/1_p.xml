<p>A recombinant human parechovirus type 3 has caused three epidemics in Australia approximately every two years between 2013 and 2018 [

While 2019 was predicted to be the year in which the next HPeV3 epidemic in Australia was likely to occur, instead a recombinant HPeV5 has been the predominant parechovirus infection detected in sick infants in 2019. It is unclear at the time of writing, whether these cases represent the early start of a new epidemic of HPeV infections in Australia, or whether the HPeV5 will be replaced by the Australian recombinant HPeV3 as the predominant HPeV type later this year, as the southern hemisphere Springâ€“Summer is when HPeV3 epidemics have been typically observed in Australia [
