<p>Both of the G001-19 and G002-19 cases, described in detail here, were PCR positive for rhinovirus, although the Ion Torrent sequencing was only able to detect a rhinovirus B from patient G001-19. The lack of rhinovirus reads from G002-19 coupled with the high PCR Ct value, suggests that the PCR detection of rhinovirus in this patient may not have been of actively replicating virus, unlike in patient G001-19, but more consistent with the nasal congestion observed one week prior in this infant.</p>
