<p>Co-infection of rhinovirus and parechovirus was not noted in any of the other cases, but rhinovirus and parechovirus testing are usually not part of the same diagnostic screens and, therefore, these coinfections are only likely to be detected in patients screened for both respiratory disease and viral meningitis, or those in which metagenomics are performed. Nevertheless, although speculative at this stage, we cannot exclude that co-infection with parechovirus and rhinovirus may contribute to more severe illness in young infants as both have a propensity to infect basal cells in the human respiratory tract [
