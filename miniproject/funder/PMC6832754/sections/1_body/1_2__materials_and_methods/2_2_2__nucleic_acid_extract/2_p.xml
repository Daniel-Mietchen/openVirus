<p>Samples sent to GCEID for next-generation sequencing, were first processed to enrich virus particles, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Briefly, nasopharyngeal swabs were placed in 1 mL of universal transport media (UTM) (Copan, Italy), briefly homogenized in a TissueLyzer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at 25 Hz for 2 min, and then centrifuged at 17,000×

 <italic>g</italic> for 2 min (Vivaclear mini 0.8 µm PES filters, Sartorius). A quantity of 450 µL of filtrate was then ultracentrifuged at 178,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 130 µL of PBS, and treated with nucleases for 2 h, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-11-00913" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The virus suspension was then treated with 200 µM PMAxx dye (Biotium) for 10 min in the dark, before being exposed to blue light for 30 min. Nucleic acid was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden Germany) spin column, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Nucleic acids were also extracted directly from samples without prior virus enrichment using the same kit for PCR and Sanger sequencing.
