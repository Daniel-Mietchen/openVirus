<p>For case G002-19, a nasal swab was sent to GCEID for sequencing upon detection of an HPeV in the infant’s CSF. A 7136 nt HPeV5 sequence was obtained from the NPA swab of case G002-19. This was made up of 488 nt of the 5’UTR, the full polyprotein and 3’UTR and part of the poly-A tail (GenBank accession: MN451649). The genome was assembled from 4288 reads or 0.08% of the total reads generated from this sample. The HPeV5 from G002-19 was 99.96% (7136 of 7139 nucleotides) similar to the G001-19 virus in the nucleotide sequence. The polyproteins of these viruses were identical in terms of their amino acid sequence.</p>
