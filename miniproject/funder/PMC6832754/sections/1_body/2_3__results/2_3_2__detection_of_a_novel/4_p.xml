<p>NPA swabs from both cases were reported positive for rhinovirus by real-time PCR. The rhinovirus PCR for case G001-19 had a Ct of 27.6; however, case G002-19 was positive at a very high Ct of 37.8 (borderline positive/negative). A full-length rhinovirus B sequence was obtained from G001-19 by sequencing (GenBank accession MN212904.1). This sequence was generated from 156437 reads (1.86% of the total reads). No rhinovirus reads were seen in G002-19, which suggested that the detection by PCR may have been of a very low level of residual virus not actively replicating in this patient at the time of sampling. This would be consistent with this infant having a history of nasal congestion a week prior to presentation.</p>
