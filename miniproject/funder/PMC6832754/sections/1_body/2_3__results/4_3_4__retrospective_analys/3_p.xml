<p>At the nucleotide level, the sequenced VP1 region contained six variable sites out of 566 nucleotides (1.06%), and zero out of 188 variable amino acids sites. The 2C-3A region contained 10 variable nucleotides out of 297 (3.37%), and four variable amino acids out of 98 (4.1%). The 3D contained 10 variable nucleotides out of 608 (1.64%), and one variable out of 202 amino acids (0.5%). The difference in the rate of variability between the VP1 and 3D in both nucleotides and amino acids was not statistically significant (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.14 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.52, Fisher’s Exact Test). However, the rate of variability in the 2C-3A region was significantly different to the 3D and VP1 regions in both nucleotide and amino acids (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.017 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.006, Fisher’s Exact Test), suggesting that this was a hotspot of variability in this HPeV5.
