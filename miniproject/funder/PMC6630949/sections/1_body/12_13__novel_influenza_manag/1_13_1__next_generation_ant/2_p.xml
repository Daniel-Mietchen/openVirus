<p>In 2002, Furuta et al. discovered the anti-influenza virus drug T-705, during screening of anti-influenza compounds by plaque reduction assay. T-705 was shown to have a selective index over 2000 for influenza viruses, with no detectable cytotoxicity in vitro [

Along the same lines, Furuta and colleagues observed some inhibitory action of the drug to some other RNA viruses, but not in DNA viruses. The mechanism of action of the drug has been attributed to the inhibition of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by the active phosphoribosylated T-705, which acts a nucleotide analogue and, hence terminating viral replication [

 <xref rid="B105-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. These have warranted further experiments on many other RNA viruses possessing either negative-strand segmented RNA genomes such as arena-and bunya-viruses or positive-strand RNA such as noro- and flavi-viruses [

 <xref rid="B109-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. In summary, T-705 is effective against influenza viruses in group 1 such as H1N1pdm09, H5N1 and group 2 such as H7N9 and also drug-resistant strains of these viruses and has been exploited for the treatment against other viruses e.g., Ebola virus [
 <xref rid="B110-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>], and to date, no known resistance has been reported, except for a purposeful mutation that conferred resistance to a laboratory H1N1pdm09 virus strain [
 <xref rid="B111-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>] Efficacy of T-705 for treatment of influenza has thus warranted its advancement through phase III and II trials in Japan and US respectively [
