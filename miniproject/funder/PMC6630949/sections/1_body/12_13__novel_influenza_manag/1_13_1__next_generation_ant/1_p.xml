<p>The burden of influenza requires identification of a novel compounds that have the potential to alleviate the symptoms and reduce viral shedding. New research focuses are developing not only virus targeting antivirals but also the ones that target the host organism (
 <xref rid="vaccines-07-00053-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). For instance, DAS-181-F03/F04 is a recombinant host-sialic acid targeting molecule acting as a sialidase at the surface of host’s susceptible cells such as the epithelial cells of the airways [
 <xref rid="B89-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. This inhibits the initial attachment of the influenza virus HA that recognizes Neu5Ac in the α(2, 3)- and α(2, 6)-linked configurations of sialic acids [
 <xref rid="B90-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The universality of DAS-181-F03/F04 is due to its ability to act on both types of sialic acids and, therefore, it can be used in avian―carrying α(2, 3), and mammalian―containing α(2, 6), hosts and was shown to inhibit H1N1pdm09, H3N2, and H5N1 viruses [
 <xref rid="B91-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>,
 <xref rid="B92-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Besides influenza viruses, other sialic acid-dependent viruses such as human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza III virus were also shown to be inhibited by DAS-181-F03/F04 [
 <xref rid="B94-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Another host targeting antiviral is the Nitazoxanide which falls under a category of thiazolides that are known to produce active metabolites following deacetylation. These metabolites have been shown to inhibit the maturation of influenza HA by blocking the trafficking and insertion of HA onto the host cell surface [
 <xref rid="B95-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Nitazoxanide is a licensed anthelminthic drug that has been repurposed to ameliorate influenza due to its broad range of protection efficiency against influenza viruses in a phase II b/III clinical trial [
 <xref rid="B95-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. The antiviral, JNJ-63623872 (Pimodivir) is non-nucleoside influenza virus PB2 inhibitor, which binds a conserved domain on the polymerase subunit, PB2 of influenza A viruses and thereby inhibiting host cap-snatching (a perquisite for the initiation of viral replication). Pimodivir has been shown to be efficacious in nanomolar concentration during both prophylaxis and treatment or in co-administration with the neuraminidase inhibitor (oseltamivir) in mice models [
 <xref rid="B97-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>,
 <xref rid="B98-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Phase II clinical trial has also confirmed the efficacy of Pimodivir when used as a single drug or when co-administered with Oseltamivir. In addition to this, drug effect was not associated with any detectable interference of any cellular processes [
 <xref rid="B99-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>,
 <xref rid="B100-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. There is currently an ongoing recruitment for phase III interventional trial of Pimodivir among adolescents, adults and the aged with non-hospitalized participants with chances of developing complications. Meanwhile, a pre-approval trial (of Pimodivir) for the treatment of patients with influenza virus A (H7N9) infection, has been allowed.
