<p>Most antibodies tend to be elicited against the more antigenically variable head domain of the major surface glycoprotein HA. On the other hand, the less variable stalk domain is characterized as sub-immunodominance and associated with minimal immune response [

 <xref rid="B135-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Experiments by Margine and colleagues employing the variable heads but constant H3 stalk domain as a vaccine in mice, triggered broadly cross-reacting stalk-based antibodies [
