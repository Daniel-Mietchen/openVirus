<p>Passive immunotherapy has demonstrated rapid relief and life-saving capabilities in the treatment of viral infections like measles, rabies, HBV and others [

As established for RSV with the commercial immunotherapy palivizumab, antibody-based therapies with influenza antibodies could aid most susceptible populations including infants, which often suffer from influenza-related complications. Considering this, prophylactic use of antibodies should be considered as a part of an immediate management and care procedures. One of the approaches considered for antibody delivery is via recombinant virus vectors. Balazs et al. developed adenoviral-vectored human broadly neutralizing antibody (F10 or CR6261) which conferred protection in mice (who received the construct intramuscularly) during a pathogenic influenza virus (H1, H2, and H5) challenge [

Their experiments also showed equally protective amounts of the intramuscularly expressed F10 antibodies in the sera of both young and old mice and non-obese diabetic/ severe combined immunodeficiency/interleukin receptor subunit gamma null mice, suggesting how efficacious passive immunotherapy could be for both the aged and immunodeficient [

More so, antibody-based immuno-prophylaxis and -therapeutics have more prospects in effective intermediation of influenza outbreaks and production of specific influenza vaccines, noting that the broadly-reacting antibodies have the capacity to both inhibit virus replication and shedding [

A more consolidating evidence of passive immunotherapeutic management of a case infected with A(H5N1) which was described to have encountered rapid relief in less than two days after convalescent plasma administration, and interestingly, resulted in no detectable viruses by real-time polymerase chain reaction [

Furthermore, it is worth noting the diverse protective mechanisms by which antibodies can exert their functions directly on pathogens or on pathogen-infected cells: virus neutralization, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis (ADCP), and antibody-dependent cell lysis (ADCL) are well-studied in the context of influenza viruses. ADCC, which mainly involves destruction of infected cells chiefly by natural killer (NK) cell activity (via perforin and granzyme B secretion into infected cells leading to cell lysis with destruction of intracellular pathogen), via recognition of antibody Fc that cross-links NK cell Fc receptors (FCRs), has been observed for murine antibodies weakly interacting with cognate influenza M2e [
 <xref rid="B147-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. Similarly, virus replication in mice was shown to be suppressed due to neutrophil-antibody based enhanced phagocytosis (ADCP) in pulmonary infected mice that either received anti-influenza serum before or after influenza infection, when neutrophils were retained and not inhibited by antibodies [
 <xref rid="B148-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. In direct virus neutralization, antibodies that bind the receptor-binding site (or nearby site) of hemagglutinin prevent the viral attachment to the host cell: these antibodies, that are mainly targeted against the globular head of HA, are elicited by either vaccination or natural infection [
 <xref rid="B145-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. ADCL is another mechanism that could augment the killing of influenza viruses as observed by Terajima et al., realizing that mostly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (either recognizing the globular head or stalk of HA) exerted this kind of effect, contrary to previously associated stalk-specific antibodies only [
