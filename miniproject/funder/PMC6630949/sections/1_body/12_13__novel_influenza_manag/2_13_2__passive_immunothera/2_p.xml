<p>Techniques to fully recover human antibodies were further improved by Throsby et al. who used human memory B
 <sup>+</sup> cells and phage panning to recover thirteen mABs one of which CR6261 entered clinical trials [
 <xref rid="B129-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. CR6261 as well as C179 was later found to neutralize only influenza A viruses with group 1 HA. Similarly, another potential mAB MEDI8852 inhibiting cleavage of HA0 was also isolated from human memory B
 <sup>+</sup> cells and has completed phase IIa clinical trials [

 <xref rid="B131-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. This antibody can not only neutralize viruses of different phylogenetic groups but can also overcome amino acid changes due to its binding flexibility as shown by X-ray structures. Following on, the repertoire of broadly neutralizing antibodies was characterized, using plasma cells [

Discovery of mABs that can cross-neutralize multiple viral subtypes could lead to novel passive immunotherapy treatments for human infections and could also have the potential to abrogate spillover infection events from zoonotic species. Several example antibodies with the highest potential for use in management of influenza, are listed in
