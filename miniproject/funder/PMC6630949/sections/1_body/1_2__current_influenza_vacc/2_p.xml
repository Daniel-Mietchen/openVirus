<p>It is worth noting that both the LAIV and IIV are cocktails of circulating seasonal influenza viruses. Mainly three viruses, i.e., A (H1N1) pdm09, A (H3N2), and the pre-determined dominant influenza B lineage (whether Yamagata or Victoria) are the constituents of the seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines (TIV). Subunit vaccines are also formulated as TIV, containing the HA of all representative vaccine strains [

However, it became necessary to feature both lineages of influenza B viruses based on the current global epidemiology of influenza as recommended by Ambrose and Levin in 2012. This resulted in the advancement of quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV) containing the pre-determined representatives of both Yamagata and Victoria influenza B virus lineages, in addition to the two pre-determined circulating seasonal influenza A subtypes [
