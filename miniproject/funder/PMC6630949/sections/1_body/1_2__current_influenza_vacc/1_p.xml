<p>Three types of vaccines against influenza are currently used worldwide including inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV), live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and influenza virus subunit vaccine: each of which has its own advantages and drawbacks. IIV is formulated with replication-incompetent virus, due to whole pathogen inactivation usually achieved by formaldehyde treatment or split virion vaccines generated by disruption of the viral membrane [
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Intramuscular administration of the IIV has been shown to induce both local and systemic immunity [
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, to maintain the antibody titers, booster vaccinations are required. Additional considerations on the vaccine efficacy were raised following metadata analysis suggesting only 40% of children were being protected against influenza, with the percentages going a bit higher up to 65% for the adults [

 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. LAIV comprise of re-assortant viruses generated from cold-adapted donor viruses (that contribute their internal genes) and identified virulent circulating strains of viruses (that contribute their HA and neuraminidase (NA)) as recommended by the WHO. Cold-adapted donor viruses are raised by several passages in embryonated chicken eggs with gradual reduction in temperature during every round of passage. By this process, re-assortant viruses that comprise of the LAIV can grow at 32–33 °C, the temperature range of cells lining the mucosal surfaces of the nasopharynx, when administered intranasally [

For this reason, LAIV has shown some superiority over the IIV in terms of the induction of mucosal immunity via secreted immunoglobulin A [
 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Use of the LAIV has proven to be safe in children (15 to 71 months) and immunocompromised persons (HIV-infected, chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis) [

 <xref rid="B22-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The most spelt-out advantage is the “non-invasive” capacity of the attenuated viruses and this had made it suitable to use for all categories of vaccines, although LAIVs are not recommended for people with underlying chronic medical conditions [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A typical setback to the use of the LAIV is the possibility of the attenuated virus undergoing some genetic modifications and consequently reverting to virulence, a case which has not been reported for the LAIV [
 <xref rid="B7-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, since vaccine viruses are grown in eggs, there have been several concerns about allergic reactions among certain vaccines: whereas the LAIV ovalbumin contents (responsible for the vaccine allergies) are variable, other studies have showed that, the IIV contains a tolerable ovalbumin content of about 0.7 μg/ mL [

 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The development of the subunit influenza vaccines, which often comprise of influenza virus HA that have been purified following protein expression in cells, could be a means to avoid adverse reactions in people with egg allergies [
 <xref rid="B27-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Besides, the subunit vaccine also offers desirable protection against seasonal influenza viruses; but its downside being higher dosage requirement at multiple times for full potentiation of immune protection comparable to that elicited by whole-virus vaccines [
