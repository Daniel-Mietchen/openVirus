<p>Computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen vaccines (COBRA) comprise VLPs that carry a computationally designed HA. Ted Rossâ€™ group first generated consensus amino acid HA sequences of clade 2 highly pathogenic A (H5) involved in human infections and formulated VLPs to express this HA [

 <xref rid="B46-vaccines-07-00053" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Similarly developed H1N1 and H3N2 COBRA vaccines have also been shown to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies in either mice or ferrets, against a broad spectrum of H1N1 and H3N2 viruses, respectively [
