<p>Viral-vectored vaccines platforms are designed to mimic natural infections, in that viral molecules are displayed on either similar or dissimilar virus. This approach has been shown to involve both the humoral and cellular immunity [

Use of the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) as a vector, incorporating influenza NP and M1 proteins, has shown potent induction of both influenza virus-specific humoral and cell-mediated responses leading to the phase II clinical trial [

Recently, Lingel et al. expressed multivalent adenovirus vectored influenza virus vaccine (that comprise the consensus sequences of divergent H1, H2, H3, and H5 HAs) and demonstrated that low dose administration in mice conferred protection of mice in a lethal influenza virus challenge experiment [
