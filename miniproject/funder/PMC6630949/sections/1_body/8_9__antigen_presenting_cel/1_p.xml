<p>Recently, more focus is drawn to increasing the abilities of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to efficiently involve the T-cell arm of immunity to influenza virus clearance. One of the examples is the work of Fonteneau and colleagues who showed that after exposure to influenza virus, dendritic cells (DCs) (both CD11c
 <sup>+</sup> DCs and plasmacytoid DCs) induced an expansion of anti-influenza virus cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and T helper 1 (TH1) CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [

 <sup>+</sup>/Th1 T cell response [
