<p>An analysis of dengue incidence over the entire period (2001â€“2012) showed consistent peaks and troughs consistent with seasonal climate patterns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224353.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Except in July 2004, peak dengue incidences were always lower than the mean for the wet period (10.31) until about mid-2005 when these peaks exceeded the threshold. In the later years, higher peak incidences (&gt;10.31) were observed. Major outbreaks were also observed about every 3 years; these occurred in July 2004, July 2007 and September 2010.
