<p>Relative trends between dengue incidence and environmental variables including LC and altitude are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0224353.g004">Fig 4</xref>. Dengue incidence declined with an increase in altitude, area under savannah grassland and forests. Conversely, dengue incidence was higher in provinces with wetlands compared to those without. It also increased with area under crop farming. Provinces with urban/build-up areas generally had a slightly higher but delayed amplification of the incidence compared to those without.
