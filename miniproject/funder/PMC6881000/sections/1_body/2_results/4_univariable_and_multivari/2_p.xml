<p>Of all the predictor variables used in the multivariable analysis, total monthly rainfall, minimum temperature, and area under urban settlement/build-up areas, altitude, together with the spatial (CAR) and temporal (AR [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]) effects, were significant in the model (
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Minimum temperature and rainfall (lagged by two months) did not meet the linearity assumption; each of these variables were therefore fitted as quadratic functions. The posterior parameter distributions for the main variables generated from the model (
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) suggest that minimum temperature and dengue incidence have an exponential relationship while that for rainfall and dengue incidence is a “concave-down”. This means that at lower levels, there was a positive correlation between rainfall and dengue incidence but at higher rainfall levels of about &gt;500mm, rainfall had a negative correlation with the disease incidence. Areas with urban settlements had a higher risk of dengue (mean relative risk of 2.08) compared to rural/non-urban areas.
