<p>We analyzed dengue fever surveillance records collected between 2001–2012 in Vietnam and developed a statistical model that can be used for forecasting incidence. The disease has become a major threat to human health and wellbeing in the country [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and with climate, the spatial range of dengue fever virus is likely to expand to areas that are currently considered as being relatively safe [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Early warning systems that utilize climate and land cover data, such as that described by Munasinghe et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] are therefore required for risk prediction and to guide the deployment of interventions. The existing global dengue risk maps (e.g. Bhatt et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]) cover multiple countries, including Vietnam, but they don’t delineate high risk areas within countries. Country-specific risk maps and forecasting models on dengue have been developed for many countries including Sri Lanka [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], Brazil [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], Argentina [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], Singapore [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and in hyper-endemic cities of Colombia [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and Venezuela [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Limited mapping of dengue has been done in Vietnam.
