<p>Of all the LC types considered, only the urban/build-up areas was significant in the final model. Compared to urban/build-up areas, croplands and wetlands were not significant yet these LC types could support mosquito breeding, and have been associated with endemicity of other vector-borne diseases including malaria [

 <italic>aegypti</italic>, the main vector of dengue virus, is strongly anthropophilic and thrives well in domestic environments. Urban settlements/build-up areas are more suited for dengue endemicity but these mosquitoes can acclimatize to other external breeding environments [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Moreover, an increase in human population in peri-urban areas leads to expansion of build-up areas, crowding and damping and therefore the creation of more mosquito breeding sites [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This ultimately results in increased vector-host contact, and faster rates of transmission of the virus. The intense vector-host contact is critical for dengue transmission because the infectious period in humans, when uninfected mosquitoes can pick the virus, is only12 days and there are no other reservoir hosts that can sustain the transmission [
