<p>We used a hierarchical spatial Bayesian model with meteorological and geographical (altitude and LC) factors as predictors. These two groups of variables are seldom used together for dengue risk prediction. A systematic review of literature that involved 26 studies, for example, showed that only 7 used meteorological, climatological and/or remote sensing data [

 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). In this study, 13 meteorological variables were available but only a few–i.e., minimum temperature, rainfall, evaporation—were selected as being important predictors through principal component analysis. Findings on the association between dengue incidence and meteorological variables (i.e., temperature and rainfall) are similar to those reported previously in Vietnam [
