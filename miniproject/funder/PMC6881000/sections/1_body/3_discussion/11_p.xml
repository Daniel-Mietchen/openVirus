<p>The predicted risk maps produced results that are similar to the dengue vulnerability maps that have been published by Fullerton et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. It reliably predicted high dengue incidence in most of the high-risk areas in the southern parts of the country and additional areas in the north, such as the Hanoi city, that is known to have high dengue incidence [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). As identified in the dengue vulnerability maps published by Fullerton et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], the model predicted a higher dengue incidence in a few more provinces in the north than observed. One of the possible reasons that can explain the mismatch is that people from affected areas might have sought medical services in Hanoi city. It has also been observed that data from regional surveillance systems may not be recorded and reported uniformly between areas. Cohort studies conducted by Wichman et al. 201 [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] in Thailand and Cambodia, indicated that dengue incidence was under recognized by 8â€“9 times and area-specific multiplication factors were required to amplify the number of cases observed to obtain reliable measures of burden. Regions with discordant predicted and observed incidence trends can be targeted for cohort or capture recapture studies to obtain primary data on incidence to inform the refinement of existing surveillance systems and risk mapping.
