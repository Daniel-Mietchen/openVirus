<p>Latent variables representing space and time are often used to account for spatiotemporal autocorrelations [

Some of the spatial effects could be attributed to differences in ease of travel/movement that might allow importation of cases in some areas, topography of the spatial units which allow various degrees of water drainage, or socio-economic activities that influence exposure to the disease. The model estimated the spatial effect of a province by integrating the effects of all the neighboring provinces using the intrinsic autoregressive model (CAR). This ensured that reliable dengue risk maps could be generated. The AR [
