<p>We found non-linear associations between dengue incidence and both minimum temperature and total monthly rainfall. Controlling for the other variables considered, an increase in the minimum temperature within the limits observed in Vietnam (14 to 28.5°C) led to an exponential increase in dengue incidence. On the contrary, an increase in maximum rainfall per month (within the limits of 0–1,500 mm) was associated with a “concave-down” relationship with the outcome. That means from 0 to about 550 mm, rainfall was associated with an increase in dengue incidence but beyond this level, an increase in rainfall was associated with a decline in dengue incidence. Evidence from studies on malaria vectors show that high rainfall is known to cause flushing of mosquito breeding sites, therefore making them less suitable for breeding [

Better results were obtained when both rainfall and minimum temperature were lagged by two months to account for the period required for the amplification of vector populations once appropriate breeding conditions are provided, as well as the completion of extrinsic incubation period of the virus.
