<p>The model developed could provide a reliable forecast of dengue risk based on favorable Theilâ€™s coefficient of inequality obtained at the validation step of the analysis. Absolute percentage error (MAPE) is another commonly used accuracy measure but this was not used in this study because it is thought to be unreliable especially when the observed data have low values. It produces large percentage errors when the observed data series is low and outliers may distort accuracy assessments [

The model reliably captured seasonal changes in dengue incidence, but it could not accurately match the peaks associated with the major epidemics that occurred in September 2010, which as stated above, was mainly driven by ADE effects. The model was still able to predict a higher incidence compared to that predicted for the rest of the periods indicating that to some degree, climate factors contribute to the amplification of the cyclic multi-annual dengue incidence during such periods in addition to ADE.
