<p>The study identified minimum temperature, rainfall, altitude and urban/build-up areas as being significant predictors of dengue incidence in Vietnam. It also revealed that it was important to account for spatial and temporal dependence to account for extra-Poisson distribution of the outcome. Two key products were generated from the study; dengue incidence risk maps showing the distribution of dengue incidence in the wet and dry seasons. The second product was a dengue forecasting model which can generate predictions for forward planning and deployment of interventions.</p>
