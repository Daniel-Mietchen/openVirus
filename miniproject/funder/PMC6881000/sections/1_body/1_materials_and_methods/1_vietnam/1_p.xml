<p>Vietnam is located on the eastern Indochinese peninsula and has a long, narrow spatial domain with an estimated population of 93 million in 2015 [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has one of the highest population densities in the world with about 263 people/km
 <sup>2</sup>. Highest densities are found in agricultural areas—such as the Red River Delta, the Southeastern and the Mekong River Delta–as well as in the largest cities, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh. Conversely, the northern part of the county is sparsely populated largely because of its high altitude and expansive forests especially in the northwestern region. Climate has a strong latitudinal gradient given the north-south elongation of the country that makes it straddle many climatic zones [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The central and southern regions experience humid conditions throughout the year which favours many infectious agents and vectors such as mosquitoes. Dengue virus has been isolated from various mosquito species in the country including
