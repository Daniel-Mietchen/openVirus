<p>Crude dengue incidence was derived as the proportion of dengue cases reported of the estimated human population per month and multiplied by 100,000 to obtain the number of new cases per 100,000 people. All the crude and adjusted incidence rates reported here represent the number of new dengue cases in 100,000 people. Its distribution by province, month and LC variables was analyzed using line graphs and thematic maps. The first set of analyses generated crude incidence using all the data that were available (2001â€“2012). This estimate was stratified by province and mapped to determine the observed spatial distribution of the disease in the country. Similarly, mean monthly rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature were estimated by month and plotted with the monthly dengue incidence to determine their relative distribution patterns (described further in the next section). The distribution of interannual dengue incidence was also determined and plotted.</p>
