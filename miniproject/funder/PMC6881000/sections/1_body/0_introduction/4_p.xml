<p>Many statistical models have been used to analyse the effects of climate factors on dengue occurrence patterns. In Vietnam, for example, dengue patterns have been analysed using time series seasonal decomposition model (in four provinces with high incidence) [

 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Most of these approaches have, however, used data from few independent geographical locations or cities and focussed more on temporal dynamics. Spatiotemporal interactions have, therefore, not been fully examined yet it is known that dengue cases cluster in space and time [

 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] due to variations in (i) socio-economic development, including urbanization trends, (ii) levels of awareness on the disease, (iii) access to public health services, and (ii) frequency of local movements between contiguous areas.
