<p>Dengue fever (dengue) is a major infectious disease of humans in the tropics and sub-tropics caused by dengue virus (DENV) and transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. The virus has a single positive-stranded RNA genome and is classified into the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. There are 4 antigenetically-related DENV (DENV 1â€“4) each capable of causing the disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. DENV infections cause various symptoms ranging from asymptomatic or uncomplicated fevers to more severe illnesses especially following secondary infections with heterotypic DENV [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A haemorrhagic form of the disease has also been reported. The main vector, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, a predominantly urban mosquito, breeds mainly in water-filled reservoirs, often artificial containers, in human settlements [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Other outdoor mosquitoes in the same sub-genus, including 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic>, are capable of transmitting the virus [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Humans are the primary vertebrate host of DENV but in Africa and Asia, an enzootic transmission cycle exists that involves non-human primates [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. There is uncertainty on the degree of immunity which naturally acquired mosquito-borne infections confer in vertebrate hosts.
