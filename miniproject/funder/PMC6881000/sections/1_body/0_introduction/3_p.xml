<p>Dengue incidence has also increased in endemic countries over time [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A study conducted in the Southeast Asia show that between 1980 and 2010, dengue incidence increased by 6.7% in Thailand, 10.4% in Vietnam, 12.0% in Indonesia, 18.1% in Malaysia and 24.4% in Philippines [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In China, a total of 655,324 cases (6.6 cases in 100,000) and 610 (6.10E– 03) deaths were reported in the mainland, and in 2009–2014, 52,749 cases (0.53 cases in 100,000) and 6 (6.00E—05 in 100,000) deaths were reported in this region between 1978 to 2008 [
 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Risk factors associated with high incidence of the disease in Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines include urban settlements with high population densities, poor drainage systems, inadequate waste disposal and extensive use of water storage containers that can be used by mosquitoes for breeding [

 <xref rid="pone.0224353.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], stronger effects of rainfall and temperature were observed when these variables (rainfall and temperature) were lagged by two months.
