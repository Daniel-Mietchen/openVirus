<p>Background: The study authors outline how the use of financial incentives in the role of HIV re-testing have yet to be studied. While this might be the case, I think the authors could make a stronger case for why the use of financial incentives for retesting would expect to be any different than the use of financial incentives for HIV testing in general? For example, do the authors expect a different outcome than what research has shown with financial incentives for HIV testing? Please clarify.</p>
