<p>Reviewer #1: 1) Interesting study to incentivize retesting of negative individuals vs. incentivizing staying HIV negative. Considering the WHO 2015 Consolidated guidelines on HIV testing services and the upcoming update being released in December 2019 recommends that for most people who test HIV negative additional retesting to rule out being in the window period is not necessary (after 3 months). In addition, the WHO guidelines recommends retesting of individuals with ongoing high risk of HIV infection, not all key populations require retesting every 3 months. It would be helpful for the authors to address the above in the introduction and discussion.</p>
