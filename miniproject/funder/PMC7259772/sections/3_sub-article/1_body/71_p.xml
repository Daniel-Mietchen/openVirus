<p>Methods: “we determined sample size…in feasibility of commitment contracts in approximately 70 adults rather than using power calculations…” Please consider modifying this section to increase clarity. It is not clear how the study authors determined a sample size of 70 to measure feasibility. Further, was the sample size determined to only measure feasibility or also acceptability? At this point, the study authors could state the minimum number of participants needed in each condition to be powered to detect statistical significant differences between conditions. The study authors could also emphasise in the Results section that the study was not powered to detect statistical significance between conditions, and in the Discussion section, mention that this is an area for future research (would be powered in future trial).</p>
