<p>We recruited adults at increased risk of HIV compared to the general population from a community in rural, southwestern Uganda (NCT:02890459). Study staff first met with local health officials and community representatives to identify venues frequented by adults considered at increased risk of HIV, due to attendance at bars associated with transactional sex, participation in sex work, high mobility to and from the community, or trading center work [

The venues identified included bars, motorcycle taxi stages, a hair salons, a restaurant, a primary care clinic waiting room, and a local trading center. Study staff then visited these venues to distribute recruitment cards inviting adults to come to the local government-run clinic for a free health evaluation that included HIV testing. Adults were asked to bring the recruitment cards in order to receive a one-time incentive payment of 15,000 Ugandan Shillings (USh; or ~US$4 in 2017) for the health evaluation and to consider joining a study. Adults who presented to the clinic with recruitment cards underwent rapid HIV antibody testing with the Alere Determine
 <sup>TM</sup> HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo, followed by the Chembio HIV 1/2 STAT-PAK
 <sup>Â®</sup> and SD Bioline HIV-1/2 assays for confirmation of Determine-positive results according to Uganda MoH guidelines [
