<p>Enrollment was offered to eligible adults, 18–59 years of age, who presented with recruitment cards, tested negative for HIV, and had no intention of moving away from the community within three months. Eligible adults who provided informed, written consent underwent a baseline questionnaire: a 62-question survey developed by study investigators and administered by study staff to understand participant demographics, socioeconomic status, HIV risk behaviors, prior HIV testing behavior and testing preferences (see Supporting Information: S3). The questionnaire was followed by randomization (by block randomization, with block size = 10 and allocation sequence computer-generated prior to initiation of trial enrollment by study investigators). Participants chose a sealed envelope from several offered by study staff to unveil study group allocation to one of three groups (1:1:3) to promote HIV retesting within 2–3 months: a) no incentive (control); b) a standard, gain-framed (i.e. presented as a “gain” or bonus) cash incentive (15,000 USh); and c) a commitment contract, in which participants could voluntarily make a deposit that would be returned with added interest (totaling 15,000 USh) upon retesting. The contract group had low- and high-value deposit arms (2,500 USh = US$0.71, or 5,000 USh = US$1.42) in order to assess how the initial deposit amount affected uptake of the commitment contract. Participants in the contract groups were told the deposits were completely voluntary (i.e. there was no requirement to make a deposit) and that the deposits would be lost if they did not return for HIV retesting between 2–3 months following randomization. All groups received counseling encouraging retesting for HIV three months after enrollment, consistent with Uganda MoH guidelines for high-risk populations [

Outcomes included acceptability of trial participation (defined as the number of eligible adults that agreed to continue participating in the pilot trial following randomization) among eligible adults, feasibility of commitment contracts for HIV retesting (defined as the proportion of contract group participants who made a baseline deposit), HIV retesting uptake 2–3 months following enrollment (to determine likely effect sizes), and HIV seroconversion.
