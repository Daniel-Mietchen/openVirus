<p>From August 8–22 2017, study staff distributed 164 recruitment cards at 26 venues frequented by adults considered high-risk for HIV: bars, sites of commercial sex work (i.e. a hair salon and a restaurant), a trading centers with mobile vendors, a primary care clinic waiting room, and transportation hubs (i.e. truck stops and motorcycle taxi stages). Over eight days following recruitment card distribution, 153 (93%) adults presented with recruitment cards and tested for HIV at the local government-run health center. Of those tested, median age was 31 years (IQR: 26–37), 113 (74%) were men, and 23 (15%) tested HIV-positive. HIV positivity varied by recruitment site: e.g. 0% (0/11) at the clinic waiting room, 11% (11/99) at transport hubs, 13% (4/21) at trading centers, 54% (7/13) at bars/sites of commercial sex work, and 11% (1/9) at storefronts associated with informal sex work.</p>
