<p>In a pilot randomized controlled trial of financial incentives to promote retesting for HIV among at-risk adults in rural Uganda, incentive strategies, including commitment contracts with voluntary deposits, were feasible and had high (95%) acceptability. In this first attempt to implement commitment contracts to promote an HIV prevention behavior in sub-Saharan Africa, the large majority of participants (&gt;90%) made a deposit committing to retesting in the future when offered the opportunity. Our findings suggest the use of incentives, including commitment contracts, for HIV retesting is feasible and merits further study in a larger trial.</p>
