<p>Our study has several limitations. First, our pilot trial was designed to test acceptability and feasibility of various incentive approaches, particularly commitment contracts, for HIV retesting and as such, was not powered to detect differences in retesting uptake by study arm or seroconversions. Second, although retesting uptake was high (&gt;70%) in all groups, including the control group (71%), participants in the control group may have anticipated a reward upon retesting due to the receipt of the initial incentive at enrollment, despite our efforts to explain the absence of incentives for retesting. In future studies with more than one retesting opportunity, we suspect HIV retesting might decline over time when incentives are not offered, as has been observed with other repeated health behaviors such as smoking cessation [

Third, our commitment contract group included “interest” on the initial deposit, and as such combined loss aversion with an additional gain. The interest was included to avoid a penalty for making deposits but may also explain the high acceptability of commitment contracts in this pilot. Fourth, no HIV seroconversions were observed in this study, possibly suggesting that we did not reach a high-risk population that needed frequent (i.e. every 3-month vs. annual) HIV retesting. However, participants reported high-risk sexual behavior including sex outside of a primary partnership and paying/receiving money in exchange for sex, in many cases without condom use. These observations, along with the high prevalence of HIV among adults screened (15%, in a setting where the adult HIV prevalence is 6.5% among the general population [
