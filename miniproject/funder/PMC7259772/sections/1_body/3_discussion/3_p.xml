<p>Our findings add to a growing literature on the use of strategies informed by behavioral economics, including financial incentives and opt-out provider-initiated testing and counseling, to promote HIV testing and other HIV-related behaviors and outcomes. The effectiveness of these strategies when studied in randomized trials has varied [

 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], as well as lotteries to promote HIV testing of adolescents in Zimbabwe [
 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], HIV testing among men in Uganda [
 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and negative sexually transmitted infection screening results in Lesotho [
 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, some studies have found financial incentives to be ineffective compared to no incentive control conditions for other HIV-related outcomes, such as achieving or maintaining viral suppression in Uganda [
 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] or decreasing engagement in high-risk sexual activity among men in Malawi [
 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The findings from this pilot trial add to this literature, by demonstrating that deposit contracts can be acceptable and feasible for promoting HIV retesting and might also be feasible for other health behaviors. Future research could address knowledge gaps in effectiveness of commitment contracts or incentives for retesting and explore barriers and facilitators to retesting among high-risk adults after a prior negative HIV test.
