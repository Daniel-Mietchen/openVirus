<p>Commitment contracts are an innovative and potentially low-cost approach to incentivizing behavior change that leverage loss aversion, the tendency of individuals to be more motivated by a loss than a gain of equal value when making decisions, as well as voluntary pre-commitment to overcome present bias [

 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], to our knowledge, they have not been attempted in low-income countries where individuals’ ability to make deposits may be limited by poverty. We sought to overcome these obstacles in a pragmatic manner by offering all participants a standard incentive for their initial HIV test, and then providing contract participants an opportunity to voluntarily deposit part of this initial incentive (or “endowment”) if they wished to commit to HIV retesting in the future. This approach of offering an opportunity to deposit part of this initial incentive also addressed a limitation observed in commitment contract programs in high- and mid-income countries, where a relatively small percentage of those offered such contracts actually make a deposit [

 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The high rates of deposits made by participants in our study are encouraging in this regard and may indicate a clear understanding of the benefits of HIV retesting among high-risk individuals. Indeed, commitment contracts may be ideal for use by people who desire a long-term goal but need an additional “nudge” to achieve the goal. Alternatively, the high deposit rates observed could indicate that the deposit amount was too low–i.e. the loss of the deposit was a risk worth taking even if the desire to retest in the future was not strong. Though this latter explanation is possible, the deposit amounts represented between 25–50% of the average daily wage in the contract groups, suggesting the deposits were not trivial. Future studies of commitment contracts for HIV retesting may need to determine the optimal balance between deposit amounts that are acceptable and of sufficient value to generate loss aversion.
