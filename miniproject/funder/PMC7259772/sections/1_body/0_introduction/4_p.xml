<p>A common approach to implementing economic incentives for healthy behaviors has been to provide monetary or non-monetary rewards conditional on undertaking a desired behavior [

 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, recent studies have indicated that incentives can be made more effective by leveraging loss aversion, the tendency for losses to have a greater psychological impact on individuals than gains of comparable size [

 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, avoiding a monetary loss (such as a small financial penalty for not exercising) tends to be more motivating than a gain (such as a small financial gain for exercising) of equal amount [

One approach to putting loss aversion into practice, and to actively counter-acting present bias, is a “commitment contract” in which individuals interested in achieving a goal (such as smoking cessation, weight loss, or retesting for HIV) commit to the goal in advance by making a financial deposit, and then risk losing the deposit if they do not achieve the goal [

 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Efforts to implement commitment contracts in middle- and high-income countries have generally found that though there may be low uptake of commitment contracts, effectiveness can be high among those who agree to make a deposit [

 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no incentive-based approaches in sub-Saharan Africa have attempted to leverage loss aversion for behavior change through commitment contracts, given legitimate concerns regarding acceptability and feasibility. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of various incentive strategies, including commitment contracts that required a baseline deposit, to promote HIV retesting among at-risk adults in rural Uganda.
