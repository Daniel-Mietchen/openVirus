<p>Economic incentives have been shown to promote a number of behaviors, including one-time HIV testing, in which the costs of a given behavior (e.g. stigmatization, transport costs and lost wages when accessing HIV testing) are immediate but the gains (e.g. the health benefits of antiretroviral therapy if HIV-infected or combination prevention if HIV-uninfected) may not be realized until later [

 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As such, incentives may be effective in promoting retesting for HIV in people who test HIV antibody negative but remain at high-risk. However, in contrast to first-time HIV testing, interventions to promote retesting for HIV among high-risk individuals may face additional challenges, as motivation to retest may be relatively lower following a recent negative HIV test and benefits of accessing testing may be perceived as low, particularly if transportation to clinic and access to testing are costly [
