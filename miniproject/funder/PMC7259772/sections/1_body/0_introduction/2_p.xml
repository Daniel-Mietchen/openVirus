<p>Despite guidelines recommending retesting for HIV among at-risk adults who previously tested HIV negative, published data across multiple settings in sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda [

 <xref rid="pone.0233600.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], suggest that retesting annually (let alone more regular intervals) occurs infrequently, with most adults who access HIV testing reporting that they have not had an HIV test in the prior year [

In a qualitative study examining perceptions of HIV retesting prior to a universal “test and treat” intervention in South Africa, most participants expressed the view that retesting was unnecessary, particularly if a person continued to feel healthy following a prior negative HIV test [

In spite of the importance of retesting high-risk, HIV-negative adults at regular intervals to identify recent seroconversions and to reinforce prevention messaging, there are few evidence-based interventions to promote retesting among high-risk adults [
