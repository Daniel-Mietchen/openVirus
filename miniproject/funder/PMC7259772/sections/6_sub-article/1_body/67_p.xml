<p>It might be clearer if the study authors use ‘Table 1’ to highlight baseline characteristics of study participants (study demographics, sexual activity behaviours, etc.) and ‘Table 2’ to show study outcomes (e.g. ‘HIV retesting 2-3 months following randomisation’ ‘Deposit made to commitment contract’) because the title of Table 1 currently is baseline characteristics, and HIV retesting, for example, is not a baseline characteristic. There are also empty spaces in some parts of Table 1 and then ‘N/A’ in other sections, would be more helpful to be consistent.</p>
