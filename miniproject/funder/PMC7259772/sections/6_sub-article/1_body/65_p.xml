<p>Discussion: “However, participants reported high-risk sexual behaviour…” The sexual behaviours of the participants were presented briefly in Table 1. Are there other components of the questionnaire that can be mentioned in paragraph 1 or 2 of the Results section or placed in Table 1? (but not to be mentioned in both places). The authors used a 62-item questionnaire, so there could be more Results presented from the questionnaire in either Table 1 or written in the Results section. The authors could also provide a copy of the 62-item questionnaire in the Supplementary information section. </p>
