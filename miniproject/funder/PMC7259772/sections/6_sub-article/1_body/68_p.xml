<p>Response: We have opted to present a single table, as the retesting outcomes are brief (3 rows), and the title of Table 1 is “Baseline characteristics and HIV retesting uptake,” indicating that both outcomes are presented in this single table. We have added “N/A” to the empty spaces and thank the Reviewer for this suggestion.</p>
