<p>Response: This phrase is based on our own extensive review of the literature, and does not have a specific reference, as currently there is no systematic review of incentive-based approaches that leverage loss aversion. We have revised this sentence to clarify that, “to our knowledge, no incentive-based approaches in sub-Saharan Africa have attempted to leverage loss aversion for behavior change through commitment contracts.” </p>
