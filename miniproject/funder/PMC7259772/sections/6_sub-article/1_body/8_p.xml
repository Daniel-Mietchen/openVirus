<p>Response: We are pleased that Reviewer 1 finds all of the comments addressed and the manuscript technically sound. The use of incentives are endorsed by the WHO 2019 Consolidated guidelines, and could be used to increase retesting that is targeted to very high-risk people who test negative for HIV, but based on risk behavior, merit retesting 3-6 months in the future â€“ a recommendation in line with WHO guidelines. Furthermore, deposit contracts are potentially cost saving compared to standard incentives, as they leverage voluntary deposits by adults who wish to participate in them. However, our manuscript is not designed to evaluate or test the sustainability of this approach, but rather to understand the feasibility and acceptability of incentive strategies to promote HIV retesting. We agree that further research is needed to address the question of cost-effectiveness and sustainability.</p>
