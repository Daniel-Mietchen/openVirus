<p>Methods: Could the study authors please provide greater details as to the venues in which the participants were recruited from? Is there any indication of how many venues the participants were recruited from? Some detail is mentioned in the Results section but it is not very clear, e.g. a clinic waiting room (primary care clinic waiting room?), bars (what kind of bars? How many?). For example, how many transport hubs? How many trading centers? Additionally, what are the “other sites”?</p>
