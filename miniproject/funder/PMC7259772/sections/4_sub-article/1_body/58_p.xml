<p>Response: We now define acceptability in our methods (see lines 160-162. We pre-specified our definition of acceptability and feasibility in our study protocol (included with our PLoS One submission). Feasibility and how we measured these outcomes are clearly defined in our Methods as well (see lines 162-163). As this was a pilot trial, we did not pre-specify the definition of “high” acceptability, but we now clarify in our Discussion (line 221) that when we indicate “high acceptability”, this refers to the finding that 95% of eligible participants agreed to proceed with enrollment and continued with trial participation after randomization.</p>
