<p>Response: The reviewer correctly notes that various behaviors can be incentivized to prevent HIV, including a variety of prevention behaviors such as voluntary medical male circumcision, condom use, HIV retesting or other behaviors. However, many behaviors (condom use, changes in sexual behavior) cannot ethically or practically be observed or verified for the use of conditional financial incentives or deposit contracts. We therefore focused our efforts on a behavior we could verify (HIV retesting) and that can also act as a platform for ongoing counseling and linkage to other emerging combination prevention services over time.</p>
