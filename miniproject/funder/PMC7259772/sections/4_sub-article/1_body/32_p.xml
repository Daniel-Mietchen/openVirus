<p>Background: This manuscript would benefit from some additional references, particularly in the Background section to provide a stronger case for how the use of financial incentives for HIV retesting would be beneficial for the field. For example, what is the prevalence and/or incidence of HIV infection in Uganda? How often do people get retested in Uganda? If the study authors provided some brief background information about HIV and HIV retesting uptake in Uganda this might also increase clarity for the international reader as to why innovative interventions are needed in this country/region.</p>
