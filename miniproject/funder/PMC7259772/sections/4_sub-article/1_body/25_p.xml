<p>Response: The primary objective of our pilot trial was not to directly compare the effectiveness of incentivizing HIV retesting vs. counseling participants to retest (current practice), and as such we cannot directly address how incentivizing retesting is better than current practice with our study data. However, regarding the need for interventions to promote retesting (the crux of the Reviewer’s insightful comment), peer-reviewed literature on retesting is fairly limited – but the several studies published on this topic have documented low rates of retesting at a frequency of at least annually (if not more frequently, such as every 3-6 months, as recommended for high-risk individuals: see response to first Reviewer #1 comment). For example, in a 2011 study that examined mobile testing outreach in South Africa, although 71% of adults tested reported any prior HIV test, only 37% reported testing within the prior 12 months (reference: Kranzer et al, High Prevalence of Self-Reported Undiagnosed HIV despite High Coverage of HIV Testing: A Cross-Sectional Population Based Sero-Survey in South Africa. PLoS One, 2011). Similarly, in a 2013 study from Tanzania evaluating individuals retesting for HIV over three time periods from 2003-10, only 11% of adults participated in retesting (reference: Cawley, C. et al. Low rates of repeat HIV testing despite increased availability of antiretroviral therapy in rural Tanzania: findings from 2003–2010. PloS ONE 8, e62212, 2013), and in a 2013 study, Regan et al found only 26% of adults reporting retesting in two South African hospitals (reference: Regan et al, Factors Associated with Self-Reported Repeat HIV Testing after a Negative Result in Durban, South Africa, PLoS One, 2013). Based on our prior work in Southwestern Uganda that sought to recruit all adult men across a community for HIV testing, though any prior HIV testing was common (78% of men), less than half reported testing within the past year (Chamie, et al, AIDS, 2018). These published data highlight low rates of HIV retesting, falling well below WHO recommendations of annual retesting for all adults, let alone more frequent testing of high-risk adults. Lastly, in a recent systematic review of interventions to promote retesting, the authors noted that, “evidence-based interventions that promote frequent and repeat testing more than once a year among individuals at high risk for HIV remain sparse,” (reference: Paschen-Wolff, et al, A Systematic Review of Interventions that Promote Frequent HIV Testing, AIDS and Behavior, 2019), emphasizing the need to better study interventions to promote retesting.</p>
