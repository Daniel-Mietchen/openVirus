<p>Response: We did not use power calculations to determine a sample size, and we feel that presenting the sample sizes needed to detect statistical differences between arms (which is a total sample size of 525 participants in our subsequent 3-arm trial to promote retesting) would introduce more confusion than clarity. We now emphasize in our Results section that the study was not powered to detect statistically significant differences in retesting between arms (see lines 214-215) and mention that this is an area for future research in the Discussion section (see lines 224-225).</p>
