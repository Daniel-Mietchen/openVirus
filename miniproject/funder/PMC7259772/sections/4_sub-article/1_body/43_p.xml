<p>Please rephrase this sentence: “the costs of a given behavior are immediate but the gains may not be realized until later…” (could the authors please provide an example?). Also, with this sentence: “insights from behavioural economic theory suggest that individuals display loss aversion…” Perhaps the authors provide an example to increase clarity of “loss aversion”?</p>
