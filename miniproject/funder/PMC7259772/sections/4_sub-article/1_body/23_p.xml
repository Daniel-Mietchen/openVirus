<p>Response: Retesting of high-risk HIV negative individuals is a form of targeted HIV testing services, as reflected in Ugandan Ministry of Health guidelines for every 3-6 month retesting for key populations, such as the adults we recruited into our study. At the time of our pilot, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) was not available in government clinics; however, as PrEP becomes increasingly available, retesting at regular intervals (typically every 3 months in PrEP programs) will have even greater relevance among adults accessing PrEP services.</p>
