<p>Response: We now address, in both the Introduction and Discussion, retesting at 3-month intervals and annually (see Introduction, lines 61-66, and Discussion lines 284-292). We reference the WHO Consolidated HIV Testing Guidelines, and now include reference to the November 2019 update as well, which – though the update recommends annual retesting for all sexually active individuals in high HIV burden settings (such as Southwestern Uganda, where our pilot took place) – also notes that frequent retesting for HIV (i.e. every 3-6 months), “may be warranted based on individual risks and as part of broader HIV prevention interventions.” Uganda Ministry of Health guidelines at the time of this pilot (and currently) recommended retesting for HIV every 3 months in key populations – distinct from WHO guidelines, which we now address in the Introduction (see lines 61-66). In this pilot study, we worked with local health officials and community representatives in a generalized epidemic setting (Southwestern Uganda) to identify specific venues frequented by adults that the health officials/community leaders considered to be high-risk for HIV in their community. The HIV positivity of adults tested during recruitment (15%) is more than double that of the population HIV prevalence in the region (7%), suggesting that the input of local health officials/community leaders was accurately identifying high-risk venues. </p>
