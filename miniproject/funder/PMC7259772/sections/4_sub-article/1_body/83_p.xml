<p>Conclusion: “As reported rates of “ever” having tested…” As the sentence is currently structured, it seems like the study authors are stating that retesting is of “greater priority” than first-time testing. Is this what the study authors meant? Or that “retesting” is also of importance? Please clarify.</p>
