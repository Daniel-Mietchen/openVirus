<p>Discussion: “the optimal balance between deposit amounts that are acceptable versus of sufficient value to generate …” I know what the authors are trying to say, but I think it is the ‘versus’ that makes the statement a bit awkward. Could change to ‘that are acceptable and of sufficient value’.</p>
