<p>Although the methods sections is well detailed, the authors have not explicitly included a statistical analysis section. For example descriptive statistics presented as means(SD), median(IQR) and counts(%ages), also the authors have presented proportions with 95%CI using exact methods to obtain binomial confidence intervals. All this should be stated in the analysis section after methods or within the methods section.</p>
