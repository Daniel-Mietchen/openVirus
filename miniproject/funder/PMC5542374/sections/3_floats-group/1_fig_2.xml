  <title>Using serology and social contacts to explore the evolutionary dynamics of influenza A/H3N2.</title>
  <p>(A, B) Mean log neutralization titer in age &lt;20 and 20+ groups measured in 2009 against 9 strains in different antigenic locations, calculated using an “antibody landscape” smoothing technique [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Data from 151 individuals in Guangdong, China [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
   <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; year labels show antigenic location of the 9 test strains used to estimate the landscape. (C) Log titers can be converted into the proportion of each group susceptible against each strain [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and combining with age-stratified social-contact data [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to calculate the effective reproduction number (defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious host) for each strain location. (D) Effective reproduction number for different strains in antigenic space. Black dots show locations of strains that circulated in the 2 years after serological samples were collected (i.e., 2009–2011) [
   <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The basic reproduction number (i.e., the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious host in a fully susceptible population) is assumed to be 2. Code and data are available at:
