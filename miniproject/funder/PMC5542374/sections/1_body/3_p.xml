<p>Influenza transmission depends both on the extent of cross-protective immunity within a population—which is likely to vary between different age groups—and transmission-relevant contact patterns within and between those groups. For example, younger age groups typically have higher antibody titers against recent influenza strains compared to older individuals [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The overall transmission potential of an infection in a population can be measured using the effective reproduction number, R, defined as the average number of secondary cases generated by a typical infectious individual, which incorporates information about both population immunity and infectious contacts.
