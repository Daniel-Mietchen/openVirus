<p>Such analysis could bring key scientific and public health benefits. First, it could lead to local risk mapping for novel influenza strains. Using serological and social-contact data in conjunction with mechanistic models, it would be possible to map herd immunity and transmission potential in different age groups and identify potential “blind spots” against specific strains [

This could help quantify how the background of population immunity influences the effectiveness of repeated vaccination in the context of existing national immunization campaigns. Second, the analysis could reveal which strains pose the greatest epidemic risk and hence which viruses vaccination may need to target. In future, this could lay the foundations for “personalized immunization” strategies [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which would aim to increase vaccine effectiveness by employing different vaccine compositions depending on age and location. Third, by comparing estimates of historical influenza fitness landscapes to the observed trajectory of influenza antigenic evolution, it would be possible to establish what factors are most important in driving the emergence of new strains. In particular, there is potential to understand whether certain age groups and geographic locations contribute disproportionately to the selection pressure acting on circulating influenza viruses and hence what forms of surveillance would enable influenza evolution to be predicted more accurately in future.
