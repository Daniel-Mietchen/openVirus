<p>Given this growth in data, there is now potential to develop a comprehensive framework to bring disparate data streams together to jointly analyze influenza evolution, immunity, and transmission. For example, how do antigenic drift, herd immunity, and human behavior combine to influence outbreaks? Although patterns of cross-reactive antibody responses against circulating influenza viruses have been well characterized [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], it has been challenging to estimate the population-level transmission potential of a specific virus from available data. Previous infections may generate cross-protective responses against related influenza strains, which will in turn reduce the transmissibility of such strains within a population. However, there is currently a critical link missing between the measurement of individual serological responses and analytic tools to predict transmission dynamics.
