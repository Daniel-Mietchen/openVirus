<p>Understanding the emergence of new influenza strains is crucial for seasonal vaccine strain selection and for assessing pandemic risk [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In particular, recent mismatches between vaccine composition strains and subsequent circulating viruses have led to low vaccine effectiveness and highlighted the need for improved predictions about which antigenic variants will be dominant during future epidemics [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. During the process of selecting vaccine strains from candidate circulating strains, sequence data can provide an indirect measurement of viral transmission fitness by revealing which new genetic variants have successfully become fixed globally [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Current influenza surveillance also includes analysis of epidemiological dynamics, with local outbreaks used as a proxy for transmissibility of viruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the relationship between influenza transmission dynamics, population herd immunity, and viral evolution remains poorly understood. Specifically, there is a need to understand how selection pressure imposed via population-level immunity and transmission combine to shape the observed evolution of influenza viruses (
