<p>The increasing availability of serological and social-contact data presents an opportunity to combine immunological and epidemiological dynamics to estimate the overall transmission potential of different strains. To illustrate how such an analysis could be implemented, we combined publicly available serological and social-contact data from southern China to estimate the R of different strains of influenza A/H3N2 in 2009. R also provides a threshold value that characterizes the ability of a particular infection to spread in a population with preexisting immunity: for R values above 1, strains have epidemic potential. In the China data, the under-20-years-old age group had high titers on average against recent isolates (

The resulting transmission fitness landscape indicated there were 2 regions of antigenic space that contain strains with high fitness, 1 near strains that circulated in the 1970s and 1 near the most recent isolates (
