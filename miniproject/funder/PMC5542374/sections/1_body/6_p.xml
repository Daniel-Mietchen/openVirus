<p>A limitation of the example shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006432.g002">Fig 2</xref> is that the serological data are cross sectional and only capture population immunity when samples were taken in 2009. There is also evidence that specificity of immune responses can vary with age [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006432.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], with certain cohorts having monoclonal antibodies that target different antigenic sites to other groups; this may further shape the emergence and circulation of drifted viruses during an influenza season. The next step would be to link longitudinal serology with mathematical models of infection and antibody responses to explore how the landscape of population immunity accumulates over time. This would also make it possible to “rewind” history by removing recent periods of infection from the modelled immune landscapes and hence generate estimates for the historical fitness of specific influenza strains.
