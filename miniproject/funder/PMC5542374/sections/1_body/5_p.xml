<p>In this example, post-2009 influenza isolates (shown as black dots) were generally located in the higher-fitness region predicted by the model. The correspondence between the fitness landscape and future isolates in this simple illustration indicates that the new emerging strains were correctly characterized as having a higher transmission potential. This approach could also quantify the risk posed by previously circulating strains: the 2009 influenza A/H1N1p virus, which was antigenically similar to pre-1957 strains, could spread because there was not sufficient humoral immunity in younger age groups [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006432.g002">Fig 2</xref> suggest that some pre-1979 A/H3N2 strains could have high transmissibility if reintroduced into a contemporary population. As well as identifying possible reemergence of homosubtypic pandemic viruses, the landscape of transmission fitness for seasonal influenza strains could also provide information about the potential emergence of novel influenza viruses, as there could be cross-protective responses against novel viruses within the same phylogenetic group [
