  <p>Left. Three examples of infected networks. The three networks were randomly chosen from the simulated epidemics. Uninfected nodes were removed and the network is plotted. Based on these, the R0 was calculated based on the edges assuming a directed network, i.e., each edge counted in only one direction. Right. Estimates of the basic reproductive number without any intervention, overall and by age-groups. Simulations of a network of size ten thousand during a period of one year. One thousand simulations were run, each time with a random index case. At the end of each simulation, networks of infected nodes were extracted to compute the average number of secondary infections</p>
