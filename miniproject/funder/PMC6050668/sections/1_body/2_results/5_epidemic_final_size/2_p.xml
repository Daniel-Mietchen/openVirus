<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> also shows that a random vaccination program covering 33% of the population one week before the time zero reduced the final size by more than 100 times compared to a no intervention scenario. However, the low coverage strategy still showed a small probability that the epidemic becomes major, whereas the high coverage strategies did not. Vaccination programs deployed during the epidemics also substantially reduced the epidemic’s size: the vaccination program conducted one month after time zero still reduced the final size by more than ten times. Furthermore, these interventions were not only able to reduce the final size, but they could also increase the epidemics extinction probability (Fig.
