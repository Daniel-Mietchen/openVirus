<p>Throughout this paper, we showed the possibilities to investigate practical and intriguing questions using a within-host viral dynamic model and an age-structured network model. The advantages of using explicitly within-host dynamics are the availability of experimental data, the possibility of conducting experiments to characterize transmission parameters, and the ability to provide high-resolution subject-specific responses to infection. The advantages of using an age-structured network model are its simple implementation, its representativeness for disease transmission, and the availability of the age-structured data. Therefore, immunological studies of infectious agents could be seamlessly integrated into studies of between hosts transmission, promoting evidence-based public health practices.</p>
