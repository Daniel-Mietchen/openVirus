<p>Epidemics of infectious diseases are currently listed among the potential catastrophes that can set the world back in the next decades [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Overwhelming research efforts have been developed to predict the danger of the epidemics but their crisis nature often left scientists no better option than learning from the past [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Confronting outbreaks of emerging infections, however, requires a swift response and thus the ability to evaluate quickly and early possible outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As such, computer simulations of epidemic models undoubtedly hold the potential as the first-aid toolbox for decision making amid the crisis [
