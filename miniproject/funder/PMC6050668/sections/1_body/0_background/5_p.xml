<p>On the other hand, implementations of population level models were either a general representation using probabilistic assumptions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] or a computationally demanding implementation of a particular population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These approaches, while able to recover valuable insights, may not be representative and accessible for another population of interest, because either none or large amount of data were needed. In this case, an implementation of an epidemic model with social mixing attributes, i.e., number of contacts per day and to whom the contact occurs, could be less computationaly intensive [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], consistent across populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and more representative for a realistic disease spreading process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].
