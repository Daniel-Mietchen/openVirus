<p>In reality, the within-host infection process determines key parameters in a disease transmission ([

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is also evident that susceptibility to infection is not the same for all the susceptible but, among others, it is highly correlated with a subject’s age due to age-related changes of the immune system [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These observations together point towards some inherent biological processes where individual dynamics can help to predict population-level epidemics. Differences in the within-host infection profile as well as the susceptibility to infection complicate greatly epidemic models but at the same time underline their influential roles in determining epidemics features and intervention effects [
