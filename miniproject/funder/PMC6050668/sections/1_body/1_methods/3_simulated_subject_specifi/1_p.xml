<p>To simulate subject-specific infection course, the antibody response strength 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>Ab</italic>
 </sub> was varied from a normal level of approximately 10
 <sup>2.5</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] to the highest observed level of 10
 <sup>4.5</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This parameter was assumed to follow a U-shaped function of an individual’s age, where infants and elderly have a higher susceptibility ([
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (the extracted function is presented in “Availability of data and materials” section). As the infective dose can alter the course of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], the initial condition 
 <italic>V</italic>(0) of the model Eq. 
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref> was varied depending on from whom a subject acquired the infection, i.e., the infection dose was assumed as equal to the lethal dose (

  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>=10
 <sup>0.15</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]) times the transmission potential of a subject transmitting the infection. Here we assumed a direct relation between the transmission potential and the viral load at the time of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], i.e., the transmission potential
