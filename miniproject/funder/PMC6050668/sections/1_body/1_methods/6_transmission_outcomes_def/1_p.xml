<p>To obtain EBOV’s epidemic metrics, the within-host infection model was embedded into the network model. Simulations of EBOV epidemic are detailed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. In short, a network of ten thousand nodes was generated. Scenarios in which the population was randomly vaccinated during one-week vaccination program were tested and compared to a control simulation without vaccination. To isolate the effect of vaccination, we assumed that no other interventions were in place, e.g., no treatments were provided and no quarantine or isolation programs occurred. For each scenario, one thousand simulations were performed, each of which started with a single random index case. Each time when a contact occurred, the viral load at that time point was extracted to determine the transmission potential. Next, the susceptibility of the contact persons was computed as a function of their age [

If the transmission succeeded, for the newly infected subject his/her own infection profile was computed. Based on simulation outputs, the epidemic outcomes were determined as in Table
