 </sub> denote the viral replication rate, the carrying capacity of the infected host, and a threshold expressing a lag-phase of viral replication. In particular, a logistic growth was assumed for EBOV, with a short delay when the virus level was low. The parameter 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>Ab</italic>
 </sub> represents the strength of the immune system at which the antibody titre (
 <italic>Ab</italic>) completely inhibits the viral net growth rate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], i.e., it was assumed that the higher antibody level required to inhibit the viral replication the weaker the immune strength. An antibody titre level of 10
 <sup>4</sup> appeared to be protective in NHPs and it required approximately one week after vaccination to reach this threshold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The model parameters were obtained previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] using two experimental datasets on NHPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The antibody dynamic (
 <italic>A</italic>
 <italic>b</italic>) was also fitted in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] to the data of NHPs vaccinated with a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vaccine (rVSV-EBOV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. This vaccine had shown a high efficacy in human [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Details of model fitting, data, and the parameter set can be found in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and “Availability of data and materials” section.
