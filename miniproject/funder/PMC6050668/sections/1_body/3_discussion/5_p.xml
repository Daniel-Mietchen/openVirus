<p>Our network model currently can only simulate epidemics in a population of size 10â€“20 thousand. This is because of the limit in R with the theoretical maximum square matrix size of approximately 45000 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. However, it could be more realistic to have several communities amount to a large population size instead of a large single network. This can be implemented by generating different communities across computers and allow them to communicate, speeding also the computation processes [
