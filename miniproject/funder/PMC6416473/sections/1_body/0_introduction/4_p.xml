<p>Targets designed to improve viral suppression levels and reduce HIV incidence by 2020 have been put forward for the US 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, and by UNAIDS 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. US targets include reducing the total number of new HIV diagnoses in 2020 by at least 25% compared with 2010 (US new diagnoses target), while increasing the percentage of people living with HIV (PLHIV) who know their serostatus to 90%, the percentage of those diagnosed who are in care to 90%, and the percentage of diagnosed persons who are virally suppressed to 80% by 2020 (US continuum targets) 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. The UNAIDS continuum “90‐90‐90” targets aim to increase the percentages of PLHIV who know their HIV status, diagnosed PLHIV receiving ART, and PLHIV receiving ART who are virally suppressed each to 90% by 2020 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. Note that those receiving ART (UNAIDS target 2) are a subset of those in care (US target 2).
