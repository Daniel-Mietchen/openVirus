<p>In this analysis, we developed and used a mathematical model of HIV transmission and treatment for US MSM, parameterized for Baltimore, to project (1) the increase in viral suppression needed to reduce the HIV incidence rate among MSM by 10, 20, 30 or 50% after 2, 5 or 10Â years (representing reduction targets that may be chosen by health departments or clinical trials
