<p>The HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 078 trial, ongoing since March 2016 among MSM in four US cities including Baltimore, aims to increase diagnosis, linkage to care and ART use for HIV‐positive MSM (

The primary trial objectives are to assess the ability of deep‐chain respondent‐driven sampling (using long multi‐wave recruitment chains) to identify non‐virally suppressed HIV‐positive MSM, and to test the efficacy of an enhanced case‐manager intervention package for helping participants to achieve and sustain viral suppression two years after being assigned to the intervention. The trial protocol includes two modelling objectives. The first objective is addressed in this analysis, prior to obtaining trial results, using the best available data. The second objective will be addressed after trial completion, using the same model with trial data to assess the impact of the study intervention on HIV incidence in the wider MSM population in each of the four cities.
