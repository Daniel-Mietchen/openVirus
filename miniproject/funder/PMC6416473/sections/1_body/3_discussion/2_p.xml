<p>Our model results provide important insights for HIV prevention in Baltimore and the US. First, our results suggest HIV incidence is already declining among Baltimore MSM under current rates of HIV testing, linkage and ART initiation. This means the US new diagnoses target (25% relative decline in new HIV diagnoses between 2010 and 2020) could be met with minor continuum improvements, but this is expected to only produce a small (5%) reduction in HIV incidence rate in 2020 compared with base‐case scenarios where current HIV testing, linkage, and ART initiation rates are maintained. Second, large increases in viral suppression – associated with large ART coverage increases – are needed to significantly reduce HIV incidence rates among MSM in Baltimore compared with base‐case scenario projections. To reduce HIV incidence rates by 50% compared to base‐case after five years, viral suppression levels must increase by 27 percentage points above 2015 levels, and 13 percentage points to reduce incidence by 20%. Third, the small HIV incidence reduction projected when meeting the US new diagnoses target contrasts with the 48% reduction in HIV incidence rate expected from meeting US continuum targets, highlighting poor alignment between the new diagnoses and continuum targets. Fourth, local elimination of HIV (incidence below 0.1%/year) among Baltimore MSM is unlikely to occur in the next 20 years, even if US or UNAIDS targets are reached, suggesting additional primary prevention efforts (e.g. pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or a vaccine) are needed to achieve elimination. Fifth, our results emphasize the importance of achieving low rates of ART dropout, and high ART initiation rates and adherence levels to achieve substantial HIV incidence reductions.</p>
