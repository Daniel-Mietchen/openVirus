<p>The model projects that if the HPTN 078 trial achieves its target effect size – an 18 percentage point difference in viral suppression levels between trial arms after two years – this would achieve a 35% reduction in incidence compared with the base‐case scenario. Greater differences – approximately 30 percentage points – are needed to achieve 50% incidence reduction.</p>
