<p>Where possible, we used data from Baltimore. However, some behavioural parameters were sourced from other US locations. Therefore, we may not have fully captured local care continuum progression. Our model did not fully capture the decline in prevalence among older white MSM in the 2014 NHBS. This lower prevalence could partly have resulted from different venues being sampled in the 2014 NHBS than at earlier surveys. Overestimating HIV prevalence among white MSM could mean we underestimated base‐case scenario HIV incidence declines, although since our model captured prevalence trends among black MSM – who account for most HIV‐positive MSM in Baltimore – very well, this is unlikely to greatly impact our results. Due to limited data, we excluded MSM of Hispanic ethnicity, who are a small proportion (&lt;5%) of MSM in Baltimore but have low viral suppression (43% in 2015 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>), due to low levels of engagement in care and suboptimal suppression among those in care. New diagnoses among Hispanic MSM in Maryland have declined in recent years proportionately to overall MSM diagnoses 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, suggesting no significant local incidence differences among Hispanic MSM which might affect our results. NHBS data are collected only from MSM recruited from MSM‐identified venues, and may not reflect the demographic, behavioural and HIV‐related characteristics of the broader Baltimore MSM population (although we showed that our results were not sensitive to NHBS demography and HIV testing data – Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225246-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). In fits to DH continuum data, our model underestimated levels of viral suppression over the period 2014 to 2017; however, as we also fitted the model to ART coverage data, our results cover situations where viral suppression is similar to DH 2014 to 2017 estimates. In intervention scenarios we assumed instantaneous care continuum parameter improvements, therefore our estimates likely overestimate achievable impact, particularly in the short‐term (1 to 2 years). Transmission via injection drug use was not included in our model. In DH surveillance, only 14% of diagnosed PLHIV with MSM exposure also have injecting drug use exposure
