<p>Our analysis has highlighted incompatibilities between different data sources, including current levels of viral suppression among MSM in Baltimore. Estimates of ART coverage obtained from antiretroviral detection in plasma in the Baltimore MSM NHBS sub‐study suggest higher levels of viral suppression (59% for model fits, 2015) than DH estimates of viral suppression among diagnosed MSM (data estimate 46%, 2015). As NHBS participants may not be representative of the wider MSM population the sub‐study could have overestimated true ART coverage. DH statistics may underestimate viral suppression levels, as viral load measurements were only available for 54% of diagnosed Baltimore MSM in 2015. Our results fully account for the resulting uncertainty, with uncertainty ranges including pessimistic and optimistic values, but as this uncertainty influenced our results, these differences warrant further investigation.</p>
