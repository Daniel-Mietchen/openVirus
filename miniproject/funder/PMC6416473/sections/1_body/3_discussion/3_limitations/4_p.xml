<p>Baltimore is currently expanding access to PrEP for HIV at‐risk and uninfected adults, including MSM. PrEP was not included in this analysis as reported use in the 2014 Baltimore MSM NHBS was very low, and more recent city‐level coverage data are not yet available. State‐level estimates of PrEP usage 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> suggest around 2% of uninfected MSM in Maryland are using PrEP. This level of use would minimally affect our results; however, substantial scale‐up of PrEP in the near future would mean that smaller increases in viral suppression would be needed to meet HIV incidence reduction targets. Data from other communities with high MSM HIV burdens suggest that improvements in the care continuum for HIV‐positive MSM and significant levels of PrEP uptake can have synergistic impacts on HIV incidence
