<p>Few studies have assessed the potential impact upon HIV incidence of meeting UNAIDS 90‐90‐90 targets in the US. Risk equation modelling projected that if the US reached the UNAIDS 90‐90‐90 targets by 2020 at the national level, HIV incidence could be reduced by 50% 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>, aligning closely with our 51% incidence reduction projection for meeting UNAIDS targets among Baltimore MSM. Another modelling study projected a slightly smaller 40% reduction in HIV incidence 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>. A recent modelling study suggested that meeting the US target to have 90% of diagnosed PLHIV in care by 2020 would reduce US national HIV incidence (vs. base‐case) by around 56% 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>, higher than our projected 48% reduction – this is likely due to lower baseline levels of PLHIV in care in their study. In agreement with our findings, they found a much smaller impact of reaching the 90% diagnosed target 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>. Another modelling study suggested slightly more modest national impact (46% incidence decline from 2013 to 2020) when US 2020 targets are met
