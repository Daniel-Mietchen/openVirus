<p>Achieving the 90% diagnosis target in 2020 (while improving all care continuum parameters simultaneously) has a limited impact, reducing the HIV incidence rate (compared with base‐case in 2020) by 18% (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225246-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). However, greater reductions in HIV incidence rates (48% to 50%) are achieved in 2020 by either attaining the US continuum indicator targets of 90% diagnosed in care, 80% of diagnosed virally suppressed, or all three continuum targets simultaneously, giving 72% to 75% of MSM virally suppressed in 2020 (Figure
