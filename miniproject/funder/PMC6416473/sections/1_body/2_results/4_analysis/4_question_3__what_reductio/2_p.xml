<p>For 43% of fits, the model projects the US new diagnoses target (25% relative decline in new HIV diagnoses between 2010 and 2020) will be met in the base‐case scenario, without continuum parameter improvements, since HIV incidence – and diagnoses – are already declining in the base‐case, and this target uses a historical comparator. On average, this target could be met if viral suppression in 2020 increased by 6 (UI 1 to 23) percentage points above 2015 levels, only producing a 5% (0% to 32%) relative HIV incidence rate reduction compared with the base‐case scenario in 2020 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225246-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>). This small reduction in incidence occurs because the comparator is the base‐case scenario, in which incidence is also declining, rather than a historical comparator.
