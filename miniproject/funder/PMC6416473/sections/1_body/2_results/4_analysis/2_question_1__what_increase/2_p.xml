<p>The annual HIV incidence rate is projected to be reduced by 20% (compared to the base‐case scenario at the same time point) after 2, 5 and 10 years if viral suppression levels are increased by 13 (UI 11 to 18), 13 (9 to 6) and 12 (8 to 17) percentage points above 2015 levels (increasing from 49% in 2015 to 61%, 60%, and 60%) after 2, 5 and 10 years respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225246-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a; note that the median increase does not always exactly match the difference between the median initial and final levels). Higher suppression levels are needed to achieve a 50% incidence rate reduction (compared to the base‐case scenario) after 2, 5 and 10 years: viral suppression must be increased by 30 (24 to 39), 27 (22 to 35) and 25 (20 to 32) percentage points above 2015 levels respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225246-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a).
