<p>The increase in viral suppression needed to reach a 50% incidence rate reduction target after five years is similar across the different demography and diagnosis fitting assumptions (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225246-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). However, smaller increases in viral suppression are needed under the NHBS ART coverage data fitting assumption than under the DH continuum data assumption. Smaller increases in viral suppression are required to produce the same incidence reduction for higher 2015 viral suppression levels (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225246-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>). Subsequent results are pooled across the eight groups of model fits.
