<p>Due to high 2015 levels of diagnosis and viral suppression amongst those treated, only small improvements in these indicators can be achieved, and so only small increases in these indicators were necessary (along with increases in other indicators) for incidence reduction targets to be met (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225246-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a,d). More substantial increases in care and ART indicators were needed to meet the most ambitious target of 50% incidence reduction – while improving all continuum parameters simultaneously, to meet this target after five years the percentage of diagnosed in care reaches 89%, and diagnosed on ART 86%, from 72% and 66% in 2015 (Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225246-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b,c).
