<p>Following HIV acquisition, modelled individuals move into the high‐infectivity acute stage, and then into one of 16 chronic infection states defined by SPVL and CD4 count 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>. Those not on ART, and those on ART but non‐adherent, move through progressively lower CD4 states 
 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>; those adherent to ART do not. Increases in CD4 count for those adherent to ART are not explicitly modelled, but survival on ART is modelled as a function of initial CD4 count.
