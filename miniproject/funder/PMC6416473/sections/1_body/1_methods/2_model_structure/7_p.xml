<p>Modelled HIV transmission occurs in main, casual and commercial sexual partnerships with men, which differ in number of sex acts and condom use. The age‐ and race‐specific per‐capita infection rate depends upon numbers of new partners/year, sex acts/partnership, transmission probability/sex act, circumcision status, condom use, and HIV prevalence, viral load, infection stage and viral suppression among sexual partners.</p>
