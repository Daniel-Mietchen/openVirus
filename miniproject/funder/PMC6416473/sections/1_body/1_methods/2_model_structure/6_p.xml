<p>In the model, any HIV‐positive MSM can be diagnosed and start ART once symptomatic. A fraction are assumed to never routinely test for HIV. Other HIV‐positive MSM routinely test (at age‐ and race‐specific rates) and leave the undiagnosed state, with a proportion assumed to link directly into care, while the remainder are diagnosed but unlinked, and may subsequently move into care. Those in care may dropout into the diagnosed unlinked state. Those in care may initiate ART, with changes over time in ART eligibility (related to CD4 count) explicitly modelled following past CDC guidelines (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225246-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). A proportion are adherent, achieving full viral suppression following a short period of partial suppression; the non‐adherent remainder do not achieve viral suppression (loss and regain of viral suppression are not explicitly modelled, due to a lack of data). Those on ART can drop out of care, and may subsequently re‐initiate ART following care re‐engagement.
