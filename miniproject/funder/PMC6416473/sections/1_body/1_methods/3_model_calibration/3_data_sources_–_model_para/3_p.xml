 <xref rid="jia225246-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. Briefly, MSM aged over 18 were recruited using venue‐based, time‐space sampling, administered a face‐to‐face behavioural interview and HIV testing. NHBS data collection was approved by the Maryland Department of Health (DH), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Institutional Review Boards, and CDC. All those with a valid HIV test result reporting sex with another man in the last 12 months were included in the current analysis. Individual‐level data were analysed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Clusters (at the recruitment venue level) were taken into account using the SAS surveymeans and surveyfreq procedures.
