<p>We projected the expected levels of different care continuum indicators (diagnosed/in care/on ART/virally suppressed) when meeting incidence reduction targets after 2, 5 and 10Â years, pooling results across the eight groups of model fits. We calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between the increase in each care continuum parameter above 2015 levels and HIV incidence rate reductions after five years across all intervention scenarios.</p>
