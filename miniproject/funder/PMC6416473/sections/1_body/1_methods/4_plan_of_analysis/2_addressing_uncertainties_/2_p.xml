<p>Different data sources provided incompatible estimates – that is if the model was fitted to one data source, it did not fit the other – for three fitting outcomes. To address this uncertainty, we defined six fitting assumptions, using different ranges for relevant input parameters (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225246-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) in order to fit to different data sources (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225246-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). We fitted to two age/race distribution assumptions, from either (1) NHBS or (2) census data. We used two diagnosis assumptions, either (3) using NHBS testing rate parameters or (4) fitting the percentage of diagnosed MSM to Maryland CDC estimates. We defined two care continuum assumptions, fitting to (5) NHBS ART or (6) DH continuum data (further details in 
 <xref rid="jia225246-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supporting Information</xref>). Using all combinations of these fitting assumptions gave eight groups of model fits.
