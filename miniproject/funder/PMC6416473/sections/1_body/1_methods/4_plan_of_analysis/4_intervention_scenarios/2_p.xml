<p>To project (1) required increases in viral suppression to reach incidence reduction targets and (2) HIV incidence reductions if US and UNAIDS targets are met, we explored different improved care continuum parameters, introduced in 2016 (as an instantaneous step change). We used Latin Hypercube sampling to select 1600 combinations of improved continuum parameter values sampled between 2015 levels and most optimistic values (in brackets): percentage HIV tested (98% tested/year), percentage of tested linked (100% link directly into care after diagnosis), rate of linkage into care (4/year/person among those diagnosed but unlinked (i.e. after average three months)), ART initiation rate (6/year/person (after average two months)), percentage ART adherent (100%), ART dropout rate (0%). All parameters were improved simultaneously in 2016 and maintained until 2036. We re‐ran each of the retained fitting parameter sets (from model calibration step 3) with each of these 1600 improved continuum parameter combinations in turn, and identified all combinations where the (1) HIV incidence rate reduction or (2) percentage at different care stages, fell within ±0.5 percentage points of pre‐defined targets (below). We used these to answer five questions.</p>
