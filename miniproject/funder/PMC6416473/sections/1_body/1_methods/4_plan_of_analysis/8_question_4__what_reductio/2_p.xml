<p>The HPTN 078 trial was powered to detect an 18 percentage point difference in levels of viral suppression between men receiving a case‐manager intervention or standard of care, two years after enrolment. We projected the relative reduction in HIV incidence rate compared with the base‐case scenario when the percentage of diagnosed MSM virally suppressed is 18 percentage points higher in the intervention than the base‐case scenario after two years.</p>
