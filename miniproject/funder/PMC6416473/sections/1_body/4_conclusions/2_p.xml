<p>Our model suggests HIV incidence is already declining among MSM in Baltimore, but to achieve more rapid HIV incidence reductions, more intense efforts are needed to strengthen multiple points along the care continuum, particularly improving linkage to care, ART retention and long‐term adherence. This will require substantial investment and attention to the multi‐layered social and structural influences affecting Baltimore MSM, especially black MSM

Meeting US and UNAIDS targets is likely to reduce HIV incidence rates by around 50% in 2020, but will require large increases in ART coverage, and additional primary prevention efforts will be needed to achieve HIV elimination in the near future.
