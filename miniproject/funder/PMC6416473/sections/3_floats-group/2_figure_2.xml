  <title>Required increase in viral suppression above initial 2015 level to meet different incidence reduction targets after different time periods (in comparison with the base‐case scenario at the same time point)</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(a)</bold> 10, 20, 30 or 50% incidence reduction after 2, 5 or 10 years (
   <italic>x</italic>‐axis), pooled across all fits; 
   <bold>(b)</bold> 50% incidence reduction target after five years, across all fits, or stratified by: the two demography fitting assumptions (fitting to either the National HIV Behavioural Surveillance (NHBS) or census age/race distribution), two diagnosis fitting assumptions (using NHBS HIV testing rate parameters or fitting to Centres for Disease Control estimates for Maryland), or the two care continuum fitting assumptions, fitting to NHBS antiretroviral therapy coverage data or Department of Health continuum data (
   <italic>x</italic>‐axis). Note in (b) results for each stratification are pooled across the other stratifications used. Box and whiskers are calculated from mean values across included fits. The thick horizontal line, box and whiskers show the median, 25th to 75th percentiles, and minimum/maximum values.[Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]
