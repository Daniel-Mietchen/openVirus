  <title>Model fits to available data for men who have sex with men (MSM) in Baltimore</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(a, b, c, d)</bold> HIV prevalence among young (18‐ to 24‐year‐old) black/older (&gt;24‐year‐old) black/young white/older white MSM, 
   <bold>(e)</bold> percentage of HIV‐positive MSM virally suppressed. Results are for all 169 fitting parameter combinations across eight groups of model fits (see section 2.3.1 “Addressing uncertainties across data sources” for more details). Results show median (thick lines), 25th to 75th percentile (dark shaded area), and 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles (dotted lines) across model fits. Points and error bars show the mean and 95% CI for HIV prevalence in National HIV Behavioural Surveillance data, measured with HIV testing (a,b,c,d). Data prior to 2014 (black points) were used for model fitting. Data from 2014 (white points) were used to validate model predictions.
