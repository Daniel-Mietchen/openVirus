<p>In conclusion, SNPer is a rapid and efficient tool to detect SNPs to monitor IFV evolution. This efficiency only increases with higher numbers of SNPs. SNPer could be used to analyze quantitative variants of SNPs among not only IFV subpopulations [

SNPer has the potential to improve our ability to understand evolving populations of viruses and other pathogens, particularly for identifying novel universal SNPs associated with specific traits (e.g., drug resistance, virulence, etc.) which can emerge under selective pressure. This tool could allow for more timely response to these newly emerging pathogens.
