<p>Although similar software packages already exist, SNPer has certain advantages compared to currently available package tools. For instance, VCFtools [
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] can compare two subpopulations (two files) whereas SNPer can compare three subpopulations. Although the VCFtools user can merge the SNPs data of two subpopulations to compare with a third subpopulation, it is a cumbersome and time-consuming process, especially when running many subpopulation fragments. A second software package, VariantToolChest [
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], requires reference genomes in fasta format, and is time and memory consuming. In contrast, SNPer does not need any reference genome during comparison and takes less time and memory when compared to VariantToolsChest. Moreover, the VariantToolsChest user needs to create many different sets of commands to compare the fragments from three subpopulations. For example, to compare the SNPs of eight gene fragments from three subpopulations, VariantToolsChest requires 56 different commands, while SNPer requires one command. Therefore, SNPer is more efficient than VariantToolsChest, especially during analysis of multiple genomic fragments. In addition, users validate the outcome from VariantToolsChest and VCFtools whereas sql commands automatically validate outcomes from SNPer. In terms of running time and the resources needed to analyze our test dataset, SNPer requires the least, followed by VCFtools and VariantToolsChest.
