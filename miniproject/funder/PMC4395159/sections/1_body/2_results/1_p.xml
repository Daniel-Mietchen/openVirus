<p>SNPer took three seconds to compare the SNPs of the complete eight IFV genomic fragments against three viral subpopulations as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Each row displays distinct groups of SNPs [unique (only_spX), likely common (only_spX_spY), and universal SNPs (all)]. The HA fragment has the highest number of universal SNPs (all = 12) and unique SNPs (only_X = 6 + 10 + 8 = 24) as visualized in 
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>. The comparison results from SNPer were checked by adding groups of SNPs according to the formula; no errors were found using SNPer. The summation of the SNPs of all groups from SNPer was equal to the summation of the total SNPs numbers in the fragments of the three subpopulations.
