<p>For example, the results from SNPer for the HA fragment of viral subpopulations VIROAF1, VIROAF2, and VIROAF6 were validated with the number of SNPs from 
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The summation of the number of SNPs in the HA fragment of the three subpopulations is 78 (27+22+29). The summation of SNPs from each group for the HA fragment of the three subpopulations is 78 [6+10+8+(0+0+9)*2+(12*3)]. Therefore, SNPer correctly produced the outputs of the HA fragment of the three subpopulations.
