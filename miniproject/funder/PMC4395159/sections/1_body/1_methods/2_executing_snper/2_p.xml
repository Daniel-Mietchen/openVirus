<p>The workflow for SNPs comparison is presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>. The SNPs data in input files is processed by the SNPer library under the R program. SNPer uses RMySQL library and SQL commands to create three tables of the SNPer database including sp1, sp2 and sp3 [
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>]. These tables store SNPs data of each viral subpopulation in the SNPer database. For instance, the sp1 table stores the SNPs data of the HA fragment of the first IFV subpopulation (VIROAF1) contained in “AF1_HA.csv” file, the sp2 table stores the SNPs data of the HA fragment of the second IFV subpopulation (VIROAF2) contained in “AF2_HA.csv” file, and the sp3 table stores the SNPs data of the HA fragment of the third IFV subpopulation (VIROAF6) contained in “AF6_HA.csv” file. SNPer executes data according to the list of subpopulations illustrated in 
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The SNPs data from “AF1_HA.csv”, “AF2_HA.csv” and “AF6_HA.csv” are pulled from the SNPer database for SNPs comparison by SNPer.
