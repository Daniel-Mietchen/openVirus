<p>In addition, the setting of RMySQL table structure for the input data is required as illustrated in 
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> if different datasets are used for SNPs comparison. The input data (as seen in 
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) contains information which is organized into eight fields, separated by columns in the csv file. The assigned primary key, “id” column, must be unique and not null. SNPer queries the SNPs comparison in the tables using RMySQL with SQL commands. Furthermore, SNPer is executed to compare the SNPs of three viral subpopulations ordered by the list of SNPs files as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The SNPs comparison outputs from RMySQL are processed and written in the output files by SNPer.
