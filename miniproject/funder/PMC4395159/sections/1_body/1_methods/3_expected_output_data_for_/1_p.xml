<p>SNPer analyzes the output variants data from NGS done by the MiSeq Illumina platform and groups the SNPs of three different IFV subpopulations into (1) universal SNPs (shared in all viral subpopulations), (2) likely common SNPs (shared in almost all viral subpopulations), and (3) unique SNPs (not shared by other viral subpopulations). 
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> shows an example of SNPs comparison of three different viral subpopulations of influenza A/H3N2: viral subpopulation 1 (sp1), viral subpopulation 2 (sp2) and viral subpopulation 3 (sp3). Universal SNPs are located in area A. Likely common SNPs are presented in area B (in sp1 and sp2 but not in sp3), area C (in sp1 and sp3 but not in sp2) and area D (in sp2 and sp3 but not in sp1). Unique SNPs are indicated in area E (only in sp1), area F (only in sp2) and area G (only in sp3).
