<p>SNPs data of three different influenza A/H3N2 viral subpopulations obtained by NGS and published in Sequence Read Archive (SRA) and GenBank [

 <xref rid="pone.0122812.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were used to create an input data file to measure the performance of SNPer. The IFV genomic information of NGS sequence read data as described in detail in Rutvisuttinunt et al. 2014 [
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] including viral subpopulations from sample #VIROAF1 (GenBank accession number KJ577146-KJ577153), VIROAF2 (KJ577154-KJ577161) and VIROAF6 (KJ577186-KJ577193) were downloaded from the database (

Each subpopulation had eight fragments: PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M and NEP. The SNPs data of the three IFV subpopulations in csv files were created by Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) [
