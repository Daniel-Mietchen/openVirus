 <xref rid="pone.0122812.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> illustrates an example of SNPs data of the HA gene fragment from VIROAF1 contained in “AF1_HA.csv” file. A *.csv file contained SNPs information of the sequence reads of interest after being aligned with the reference genome, and the fields of each line were separated by commas and enclosed within double quotation marks. The specific “AF1_HA.csv” file was created by MiSeq Reporter aligning sequence reads [
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] with the NGS data of influenza A/H3N2 subpopulation 1 against the HA gene of the reference genome influenza A/H3N2 (GenBank CY121792). The Call column presents the alleles of the SNPs. For example, the first SNP at location 51 is A51G (VIROAF1 contains allele G while reference contains allele A at position 51 of HA gene fragment).
