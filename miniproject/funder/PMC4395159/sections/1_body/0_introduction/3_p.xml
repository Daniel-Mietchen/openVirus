<p>NGS [
 <xref rid="pone.0122812.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], also known as high-throughput sequencing, is a powerful sequencing technique often used to obtain large amounts of genomic sequences to investigate specific questions about an organismâ€™s genetic information. Particularly in viruses, this methodology has been adopted for diagnosis and advanced investigations to detect novel mutations and evolving quasispecies [
