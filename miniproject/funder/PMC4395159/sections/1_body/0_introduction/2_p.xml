<p>Close monitoring of current circulating strains is crucial to evaluate IFV evolution as well as the possible detection of novel virulent and drug resistant viral strains. This information is essential for determining seasonal influenza vaccine design and composition. Therefore, a technique to identify the signature sequence or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of viruses from the large amount of sequence information typically generated using next-generation sequencing (NGS) is essential to evaluate the sequence signatures in viral subpopulations associated with virulent or drug resistant phenotypes.</p>
