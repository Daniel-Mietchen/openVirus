<p>Influenza virus (IFV), a rapidly evolving virus in the orthomyxoviridae family, causes frequent epidemics and occasional pandemics. The diversity of the IFV genome generates mixtures of viral subpopulations, which subsequently can lead to the emergence of new virulent strains. Genetic divergence of IFV sequences can be driven by pressure from host immunity and host cell factors [

 <xref rid="pone.0122812.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There are three types of IFVs (influenza A, B and C) with human disease most commonly caused by influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B. A full length RNA genome of influenza A is approximately 13.6 kb; influenza B is about 14.6 kb. The full genomic structure is composed of eight fragments with approximate lengths of 2341 nucleotides (nt) for RNA polymerase PB1 unit; 2300 nt for RNA polymerase PB2; 2233 nt for RNA polymerase PA; 1765 nt for hemagglutinin (HA); 1565 nt for nucleoprotein (NP); 1413 nt for neuraminidase (NA) with additional NB protein in influenza B; 1027 nt for matrix (M); 890 nt for nonstructural protein (NS) including NS1 and NS2 proteins.
