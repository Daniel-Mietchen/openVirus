Abstract</div> <p id="Par1">Influenza viruses evade human adaptive immune responses due to continuing antigenic changes. This makes it necessary to re-formulate and re-administer current seasonal influenza vaccines on an annual basis. Our pan-influenza vaccination approach attempts to redirect antibody responses from the variable, immuno-dominant hemagglutinin head towards the conserved—but immuno-subdominant—hemagglutinin stalk. The strategy utilizes sequential immunization with chimeric hemagglutinin-based vaccines expressing exotic head domains, and a conserved hemagglutinin stalk. We compared a live-attenuated influenza virus prime followed by an inactivated split-virus boost to two doses of split-virus vaccines and assessed the impact of adjuvant on protection against challenge with pandemic H1N1 virus in ferrets. All tested immunization regimens successfully induced broadly cross-reactive antibody responses. The combined live-attenuated/split virus vaccination conferred superior protection against pandemic H1N1 infection compared to two doses of split-virus vaccination. Our data support advancement of this chimeric hemagglutinin-based vaccine approach to clinical trials in humans.</p> </div> <div class="abstract" title="abstract"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Influenza: Defending against a common enemy</div> <p id="Par2">A vaccine against influenza targets non-varying parts of surface proteins to overcome the virus’ attempt at evading detection. Influenza viruses possess rapidly shifting surface proteins, effectively camouflaging themselves. These changes are making it difficult for vaccines to elicit reliable antibody responses against the threat. A team of researchers led by Florian Krammer and Randy A. Albrecht, of the United States’ Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, now describes a vaccine regimen that repeatedly targets a conserved component of the virus’ surface, prompting a broadly protective immune response. The conserved domains of the viral surface proteins are traditionally a more difficult target for vaccines as the immune systems of vaccinees have a preference for the varying domains. The team’s data, generated from ferret experiments, supports an investigation into the efficacy of this approach in humans.</p> </div> <div class="custom-meta-group" title="custom-meta-group"> <meta name="issue-copyright-statement" value="© The Author(s) 2017" /> </div> </div> </div> <div class="body" title="body"> <div class="introduction" title="introduction"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Introduction</div> <p id="Par3">Influenza virus infections cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide every year.<sup><a href="#CR1">1</a></sup> Currently licensed inactivated, recombinant, and live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIVs) are proven to reduce clinical disease following influenza virus infection. However, influenza viruses are an evolving immunological target. The ever-changing nature of their surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), creates a difficult challenge for the production of effective vaccines. Seasonal influenza viruses, which cause annual epidemics, constantly escape from herd immunity by antigenic drift of their HA and NA proteins. Therefore, seasonal vaccine formulations have to be updated, re-formulated and re-administered on an annual basis.<sup><a href="#CR2">2</a></sup> However, accurately predicting and selecting vaccine strains is difficult. Mismatches between vaccine strains and circulating strains cause a substantial decrease in vaccine efficacy.<sup><a href="#CR3">3</a></sup> In addition, the specter of a new influenza pandemic resulting from the unpredictable emergence of a new antigenically shifted virus from an animal reservoir represents an unsurmountable challenge for current influenza vaccines. Production and distribution of matched pandemic vaccines takes approximately 6 months—an interval during which the human population is insufficiently protected from a pandemic influenza virus outbreak.<sup><a href="#CR4">4</a></sup> The development of a pan-influenza vaccine that confers protection against homologous, drifted and shifted influenza virus strains would abolish the need for annual reformulation, and mitigate disease burden following the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus strain.</p> <p id="Par4">The discovery of broadly protective antibodies that bind to the conserved stalk domain of the HA and cross-react between HA subtypes sparked hopes for the development of a universal influenza virus vaccine.<sup><a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR6">6</a></sup> Regular licensed influenza virus vaccines do not induce high antibody levels against the immuno-subdominant HA stalk domain but work through the induction of potent strain-specific antibodies against the immuno-dominant head domain.<sup><a href="#CR7">7</a>–<a href="#CR11">11</a></sup> Sequential immunizations with chimeric HAs (cHAs), which consist of HA stalk domains derived from circulating influenza viruses in combination with ‘exotic’ head domains of influenza viruses that do not circulate in humans, can selectively boost anti-stalk antibodies.<sup><a href="#CR12">12</a>–<a href="#CR16">16</a></sup> When the immune system is presented with a cHA, it responds mainly to the head domain but some priming effect against the stalk domain is achieved as well (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1a</a>). Exposure to another cHA with the same stalk but a different head domain then boosts antibodies against the stalk domain but only induces a primary response against the novel head domain. This procedure can be repeated several times to induce high and protective titers against the conserved stalk domain. Importantly, adult humans are already primed against the stalk domain and it is expected that they mount a solid anti-stalk response after one to two vaccinations with cHAs.<sup><a href="#CR10">10</a>, <a href="#CR17">17</a>, <a href="#CR18">18</a></sup> Another promising vaccination strategy that has recently been described includes heterologous prime boost strategies. In this case, an LAIV or a DNA vaccine is used as a priming immunization followed by a booster immunization with inactivated influenza virus vaccine (IIV) or protein vaccine.<sup><a href="#CR19">19</a>–<a href="#CR23">23</a></sup> Here, using the ferret model, we compare a cHA-based LAIV prime—IIV boost immunization regimen with an IIV–IIV immunization regimen with and without the addition of the adjuvant AS03. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 1</span></a></div>   <p>Vaccination overview and phylogenetic tree. <b>a</b> Chimeric HA vaccination. By exchanging the HA head domains, but retaining the same HA stalk domain, the antibody response can be redirected towards the otherwise immuno-subdominant stalk region. Repeated exposure to cHA constructs can boost HA stalk-specific antibodies to high titers. <b>b</b> Vaccination strategy. Ferrets in the cHA vaccination groups were primed with an influenza B virus expressing the cH9/1 HA, followed by cH8/1 vaccination either as LAIV or IIV (with or without adjuvant) on day 21. All cHA vaccination groups received a second boost on day 42 with cH5/1 IIV vaccine (with or without adjuvant). Ferrets that either received only the cH9/1 HA prime, received a seasonal trivalent influenza virus vaccine (TIV) twice or were naïve were included as control groups. All ferrets were challenged with pH1N1 virus on day 70. <b>c</b> Phylogenetic tree. All vaccines contained the HA stalk domain of H1 (highlighted in blue). ELISA serology was performed against H1 (highlighted in <i>blue</i>) as well as H2, H18 and H3 (highlighted in <i>green</i>). H2 is closely related to H1 HA, while H18 is the most distantly related HA within influenza A group 1. H3 is an influenza A group 2 HA and was included to measure cross-group reactive antibody titers.

Characterization of the cH8/1 LAIV strain</div> <p id="Par5">The objective of this study was the preclinical evaluation of a sequential immunization strategy with cHAs to induce HA stalk-specific immune responses that confer protection against influenza virus infection. The LAIV component, an A/Leningrad/134/17/57 master donor virus expressing the cH8/1 HA (H8 head domain on top of an H1 stalk domain) and the N1 NA from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (cH8/1 LAIV), was rescued by reverse genetics under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Immunization with cHA-based vaccine regimens induces stalk-reactive immunity in ferrets</div> <p id="Par7">Since adult humans have a primed repertoire of B-cells with specificities to the HA stalk domain, <sup><a href="#CR18">18</a>, <a href="#CR26">26</a></sup> we used an experimental design that mimics this pre-existing immunity. Specifically, ferrets were initially primed with a recombinant influenza B virus expressing an influenza A virus cH9/1 HA. Infection with this virus primes the anti-stalk response without conferring any relevant (other than H9) HA head-based or internal protein-based protection from influenza A virus to the ferrets. Following the prime, animals were vaccinated with either the cH8/1 LAIV followed by adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted cH5/1 IIV or with adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted cH8/1 IIV followed by adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted cH5/1 IIV (Fig. <a href="#Fig1">1b</a>). Animals primed with B-cH9/1 and naive animals were used as control groups. Animals that received commercial Trivalent influenza virus vaccine (TIV) were added as ‘standard of care’ control. These animals were vaccinated with two doses of TIV without adjuvant which represents, according to CDC recommendations, the vaccination strategy for naive human subjects/children. Each group contained four ferrets.</p> <p id="Par8">Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were measured pre-challenge (day 70). As expected, ferrets immunized with the influenza B virus expressing cH9/1 HA seroconverted against H9 with HI titers of 320 to 1920 (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3a</a>). Ferrets that received a booster immunization with the cH8/1 LAIV had detectable HI titers against H8 ranging from 20 to 80 (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3b</a>). Of the two groups that received cH8/1 IIV, only two ferrets in the adjuvanted cH8/1 IIV group had detectable HI titers against H8. No ferrets seroconverted against H5 following the second booster immunization with cH5/1 IIV (Fig. <a href="#Fig3">3c</a>).

Animals that received non-adjuvanted LAIV–IIV and IIV–IIV vaccination regimens induced responses slightly higher (1:3200 for LAIV–IIV) or similar to the prime only animals with no apparent boost from the second vaccination (Fig. <a href="#Fig4">4a</a>).

The adjuvanted IIV–IIV regimen also induced a strong antibody response with a titer of 1:7200 after the first vaccination, which was boosted to 1:89600 after the second vaccination. Notably, the anti-stalk responses induced by the B-cH9/1 virus prime varied between the different vaccination groups (day 21).

Discussion</div> <p id="Par18">The aim of this preclinical study was to combine LAIV and IIV vaccination approaches to induce broad immune responses against the influenza virus HA, specifically against the conserved stalk domain. In recent years, heterologous prime-boost regimens (e.g., LAIV followed by IIV or DNA vaccines followed by protein vaccines) have been demonstrated to induce strong and broad antibody responses post-boost despite almost undetectable immune responses post-prime. While the mechanism of this phenomenon is still not well understood, its efficiency has been demonstrated in animal models and humans.<sup><a href="#CR19">19</a>–<a href="#CR23">23</a>, <a href="#CR29">29</a>–<a href="#CR31">31</a></sup> A second technology—based on cHAs that can be used in sequential vaccination regimens to specifically boost antibody responses to the conserved HA stalk domain—has been successfully tested in several animal models as well.<sup><a href="#CR13">13</a>–<a href="#CR16">16</a>, <a href="#CR32">32</a></sup> In this study, we tested if a combination of these two technologies would further enhance and broaden the immune response against the influenza virus surface glycoproteins. Furthermore, we assessed if adding AS03 as adjuvant to the IIV component of the vaccine regimen would be beneficial.</p> <p id="Par19">The heterologous LAIV–IIV vaccination strategy clearly outperformed the homologous IIV–IIV vaccination regimen in terms of protection both in the upper and in the lower respiratory tract. However, it is important to mention that the IIV–IIV regimens tested also afforded significant protection as compared to the current standard of care (2xTIV in naive individuals). Addition of the adjuvant certainly had a substantial effect on antibody titers against both the HA stalk (serum IgG and IgA) and against the NA. The contribution of the adjuvant to protection was less pronounced but a trend could be observed both for the LAIV–IIV and the IIV–IIV regimens in most tissues. One limitation was that animals vaccinated with the LAIV–IIV regimen (adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted) had no detectable virus in lungs, trachea, olfactory bulb and oropharyngeal samples, and it is therefore hard to make a valid comparison. A follow-up experiment with a high dose virus challenge again showed complete protection of the lower respiratory tract, but revealed a similar trend of slightly higher viral titers in the unadjuvanted vaccine group in the upper respiratory tract.</p> <p id="Par20">Another important observation is that there is a disconnect between anti-stalk titers measured in serum and the observed protection. As an example, the non-adjuvanted LAIV–IIV regimen greatly outperformed the adjuvanted IIV–IIV regimen in terms of protection despite a 32-fold lower anti-stalk titer induced by LAIV–IIV (non-adjuvanted) pre-challenge as compared to IIV–IIV (adjuvanted). Several factors could account for this disconnect. Antibodies against the N1 NA were induced by the adjuvanted IIV–IIV but also by the adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted LAIV–IIV regimen. While these titers were low it has been shown that anti-NA antibodies can protect from viral challenge in mouse and ferret models.<sup><a href="#CR33">33</a>–<a href="#CR35">35</a></sup> LAIV is administered mucosally and is therefore thought to induce strong local immune response in tissue-resident immune cells. This could lead to an increased secretion of protective anti-stalk and anti-NA IgA. While we did not find higher mucosal IgA titers in the post-challenge nasal washes of non-adjuvanted LAIV–IIV as compared to the adjuvanted IIV–IIV vaccinated animals, it is unclear if this anamnestic response would correlate with the pre-challenge mucosal concentration of anti-stalk secretory IgA titers. Furthermore, LAIV replicates actively in the upper respiratory tract of vaccinees, leading to intracellular antigen expression, which primes for strong adaptive cellular immune responses. This cell-based immune response could very well account for the observed difference in protection. Finally, replicating LAIV viruses induce unspecific innate immune responses. It has been recently shown that such innate immune responses can actually lead to unspecific protection mediated by Club cells—an effect that can last up to 12 weeks in mice.<sup><a href="#CR36">36</a></sup></p> <p id="Par21">The tested vaccination strategy elicited potent antibody responses against influenza A group 1 HAs, but low antibody responses against H3, a group 2 HA. A complete pan-influenza virus vaccine will need to consist of a trivalent formulation that contains cHAs for group 2<sup><a href="#CR14">14</a></sup> and B influenza viruses. Such a multivalent vaccine could induce stalk-reactive antibody responses against all influenza subtypes.</p> <p id="Par22">All vaccines and adjuvants used in the study are of high translational potential. The LAIV component used in this study grows to high titers in eggs, which allows for large-scale manufacturing. The backbone of the LAIV is based on the Leningrad vaccine strain, which has been licensed and successfully used in humans.<sup><a href="#CR37">37</a></sup> The split virus vaccines were produced in a cell-culture-based approach that has previously been used to manufacture pandemic H5N1 split virus vaccines by GlaxoSmithKline.<sup><a href="#CR38">38</a></sup> Furthermore, the adjuvant AS03 has been licensed for use in humans for pandemic influenza virus vaccines.<sup><a href="#CR39">39</a></sup></p> <p id="Par23">In summary, this study demonstrates that both cHA-based heterologous LAIV–IIV and homologous IIV–IIV vaccination strategies induce broadly reactive anti-stalk antibodies and protect ferrets from challenge with pH1N1 virus with the heterologous vaccination strategy outperforming the homologous vaccination regimen in terms of protection. While we chose to test the vaccines in primed ferrets that better mimic the immune status of adult humans, we hypothesize that the LAIV prime—which also mimics natural infection—might be the better choice for vaccination of children who lack pre-existing anti-stalk immunity. The data resulting from this study warrants testing of this cHA-based heterologous prime boost regimen as a universal influenza candidate in clinical trials.</p> </div> <div class="materials_methods" title="materials|methods"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Stocks were prepared, quantified by plaque assay and sequence verified by Sanger sequencing. The replicative phenotype was assessed in MDCK cells following a well-established TCID<sub>50</sub> protocol.<sup><a href="#CR25">25</a></sup> Briefly, confluent layers of MDCK cells in 96-well plates were infected with serial 1/2-log dilutions of the cH8/1 LAIV and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (as non-<i>ts</i>, non-<i>ca</i> control) in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing TPCK-treated trypsin and Pen-Strep. The plates were incubated at 39 °C, 33 °C and 25 °C and the TCID<sub>50</sub> dose was calculated according to the Spearman &amp;amp; Kaerber algorithm based on cytopathogenic effect.<sup><a href="#CR48">48</a></sup> Per definition of Jin and colleagues<sup><a href="#CR24">24</a></sup> a <i>ts</i> phenotype is defined by a titer at 39 °C that is at least 100-fold lower than at 33 °C and a <i>ca</i> phenotype is defined by a titer at 25 °C being less than 100-fold lower than at 33 °C. Furthermore, the cH8/1 LAIV virus was sent to the USDA where an in vivo intravenous pathotyping experiment in chickens was performed according to the World Organization for Animal Health procedures for testing the pathogenicity of influenza viruses. Finally, we examined the attenuation phenotype of cH8/1 LAIV by intranasal infection of ferrets with an inoculation dose of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> PFU. A group of ferrets inoculated with wild-type A/California/04/09 virus served as a control. For this experiment 4-month-old neutered male Fitch ferrets (<i>n</i> = 3) were confirmed to be seronegative for circulating H1N1, H3N2, and B influenza viruses prior to purchase from Triple F Farms (Sayre, PA).

Ferret immunization and challenge</div> <p id="Par30">Three to 5-month-old spayed female Fitch ferrets were confirmed to be seronegative for circulating H1N1, H3N2, and B influenza viruses prior to purchase from Marshall BioResources (North Rose, NY). All animal experiments were performed according to a protocol approved by the IACUC of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The sample size was chosen according to the standards in the field. The space requirements and cost associated with the ferret model did not allow for a larger sample size. Ferrets randomly assigned to different treatments by assigning a treatment to a group of four animals. Figure <a href="#Fig1">1b</a> summarizes the prime/boost immunizations administered to each immunization group (<i>n</i> = 4) of ferrets. The universal vaccination regimen is based on boosting pre-existing HA-stalk antibodies which are present at low levels in human adults.<sup><a href="#CR18">18</a></sup> To mimic this scenario, naive ferrets in the chimeric vaccination groups were primed by intranasal infection with an inoculation dose of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> PFU (in 1 mL of PBS) of influenza B virus expressing cH9/1 HA.<sup><a href="#CR13">13</a></sup> This priming method prevents the establishment of immunity against influenza A virus internal proteins and does not interfere with a later pH1N1 virus challenge. Importantly, while animals were assigned to groups prior to priming, their immune status post-priming was not assessed until after the challenge, meaning that the animals were de facto randomized after the prime. Three weeks later, two groups of primed ferrets (LAIV–IIV + and LAIV–IIV− groups, + /− indicates the presence of adjuvant in the IIV boost) were intranasally vaccinated with a 0.5 mL dose containing 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> PFU of cH8/1N1 LAIV, followed 3 weeks later by intramuscular vaccination with cH5/1N1 IIV (5ug/HA in 0.25 mL of PBS). The IIV vaccine doses for ferrets in the LAIV–IIV + group were adjuvanted with 0.25 mL of Adjuvant System 03 (AS03), while the vaccine doses for the ferrets in the LAIV–IIV− group were mixed with 0.25 mL of PBS (0.5 mL final injection volume). To compare the LAIV–IIV approach to an exclusive IIV–IIV approach, two groups of ferrets (IIV–IIV + and IIV–IIV−, + /− indicates the presence of adjuvant in prime and boost) received cH8/1N1 IIV followed by cH5/1N1 IIV intramuscularly (5ug/HA in 0.25 mL of PBS per dose) with the same vaccination interval. Ferrets in the IIV–IIV + group received both doses of AS03 adjuvanted vaccine (0.25 mL) and ferrets in the IIV–IIV− group received both doses unadjuvanted vaccine (0.25 mL of PBS). An unvaccinated group served as a negative control to compare the protection conferred by cHA vaccination with naïve animals (naive). To show any effects of the cH9/1 B virus prime on viral loads, a prime only group was included (prime-only). Finally, a "standard of care�? group of ferrets received 2 doses of a human dose TIV containing a pH1N1 component on days 21 and 42 of the experiment (2xTIV; 2015–2016 formulation of the seasonal influenza vaccine, Fluvirin, Seqirus). Four weeks after the last booster immunization, all animals were challenged intranasally with an inoculation dose of 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of A/California/4/09 in 1 mL of PBS. An inoculation dose of 10<sup>6</sup> PFU (high dose challenge) was used in a smaller follow up experiment. Nasal washes and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from anesthetized ferrets on days 1 and 3 after challenge. On day 4 after challenge, the animals were euthanized by intracardiac injection of Sleepaway euthanasia solution (Fort Dodge, IA) and tissues (olfactory bulbs, nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung) were collected from each individual ferret to quantify viral titers by plaque assays. Serum was collected at baseline, day 21, day 42, day 70 and on the last day of the virus challenge experiment.</p> </div> <div class="enzyme-linkedimmunosorbentassay(elisa)" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

After initial blocking, the volume was discarded and 100 µl of blocking solution was added to each well. An additional 90 µl of blocking solution was added to the first well of the dilution series. Ten microliters of serum pre-diluted 1:5 in PBS were then added to the first well of the dilution series (resulting in a 1:100 starting dilution).

After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 3 M hydrochloric acid and plates were read at a wavelength of 490 nm in a plate reader (Biotek Synergy H1). The average plus three standard deviations of blank wells were calculated as a cut-off value. If a sample did not dilute out below the cut-off, it was re-run at a higher starting dilution. The same procedure was used to measure IgA titers in nasal washes and serum. However, a starting dilution of 1:2 was used for the nasal washes (100 µl of nasal wash + 100 µl of blocking solution in the first well).
