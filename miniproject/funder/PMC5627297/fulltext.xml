This makes it necessary to re-formulate and re-administer current seasonal influenza vaccines on an annual basis. Our pan-influenza vaccination approach attempts to redirect antibody responses from the variable, immuno-dominant hemagglutinin head towards the conserved&#x02014;but immuno-subdominant&#x02014;hemagglutinin stalk. The strategy utilizes sequential immunization with chimeric hemagglutinin-based vaccines expressing exotic head domains, and a conserved hemagglutinin stalk. We compared a live-attenuated influenza virus prime followed by an inactivated split-virus boost to two doses of split-virus vaccines and assessed the impact of adjuvant on protection against challenge with pandemic H1N1 virus in ferrets. All tested immunization regimens successfully induced broadly cross-reactive antibody responses. The combined live-attenuated/split virus vaccination conferred superior protection against pandemic H1N1 infection compared to two doses of split-virus vaccination. Our data support advancement of this chimeric hemagglutinin-based vaccine approach to clinical trials in humans.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Influenza: Defending against a common enemy</title><p id="Par2">A vaccine against influenza targets non-varying parts of surface proteins to overcome the virus&#x02019; attempt at evading detection. Influenza viruses possess rapidly shifting surface proteins, effectively camouflaging themselves. These changes are making it difficult for vaccines to elicit reliable antibody responses against the threat. A team of researchers led by Florian Krammer and Randy A. Albrecht, of the United States&#x02019; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, now describes a vaccine regimen that repeatedly targets a conserved component of the virus&#x02019; surface, prompting a broadly protective immune response. The conserved domains of the viral surface proteins are traditionally a more difficult target for vaccines as the immune systems of vaccinees have a preference for the varying domains. The team&#x02019;s data, generated from ferret experiments, supports an investigation into the efficacy of this approach in humans.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Influenza virus infections cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide every year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> Currently licensed inactivated, recombinant, and live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIVs) are proven to reduce clinical disease following influenza virus infection. However, influenza viruses are an evolving immunological target. The ever-changing nature of their surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), creates a difficult challenge for the production of effective vaccines. Seasonal influenza viruses, which cause annual epidemics, constantly escape from herd immunity by antigenic drift of their HA and NA proteins. Therefore, seasonal vaccine formulations have to be updated, re-formulated and re-administered on an annual basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> However, accurately predicting and selecting vaccine strains is difficult. Mismatches between vaccine strains and circulating strains cause a substantial decrease in vaccine efficacy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> In addition, the specter of a new influenza pandemic resulting from the unpredictable emergence of a new antigenically shifted virus from an animal reservoir represents an unsurmountable challenge for current influenza vaccines. Production and distribution of matched pandemic vaccines takes approximately 6 months&#x02014;an interval during which the human population is insufficiently protected from a pandemic influenza virus outbreak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> The development of a pan-influenza vaccine that confers protection against homologous, drifted and shifted influenza virus strains would abolish the need for annual reformulation, and mitigate disease burden following the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus strain.</p><p id="Par4">The discovery of broadly protective antibodies that bind to the conserved stalk domain of the HA and cross-react between HA subtypes sparked hopes for the development of a universal influenza virus vaccine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Regular licensed influenza virus vaccines do not induce high antibody levels against the immuno-subdominant HA stalk domain but work through the induction of potent strain-specific antibodies against the immuno-dominant head domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Sequential immunizations with chimeric HAs (cHAs), which consist of HA stalk domains derived from circulating influenza viruses in combination with &#x02018;exotic&#x02019; head domains of influenza viruses that do not circulate in humans, can selectively boost anti-stalk antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> When the immune system is presented with a cHA, it responds mainly to the head domain but some priming effect against the stalk domain is achieved as well (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Exposure to another cHA with the same stalk but a different head domain then boosts antibodies against the stalk domain but only induces a primary response against the novel head domain. This procedure can be repeated several times to induce high and protective titers against the conserved stalk domain. Importantly, adult humans are already primed against the stalk domain and it is expected that they mount a solid anti-stalk response after one to two vaccinations with cHAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> Another promising vaccination strategy that has recently been described includes heterologous prime boost strategies.

Specifically, ferrets were initially primed with a recombinant influenza B virus expressing an influenza A virus cH9/1 HA. Infection with this virus primes the anti-stalk response without conferring any relevant (other than H9) HA head-based or internal protein-based protection from influenza A virus to the ferrets. Following the prime, animals were vaccinated with either the cH8/1 LAIV followed by adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted cH5/1 IIV or with adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted cH8/1 IIV followed by adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted cH5/1 IIV (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

Animals that received non-adjuvanted LAIV&#x02013;IIV and IIV&#x02013;IIV vaccination regimens induced responses slightly higher (1:3200 for LAIV&#x02013;IIV) or similar to the prime only animals with no apparent boost from the second vaccination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par18">The aim of this preclinical study was to combine LAIV and IIV vaccination approaches to induce broad immune responses against the influenza virus HA, specifically against the conserved stalk domain. In recent years, heterologous prime-boost regimens (e.g., LAIV followed by IIV or DNA vaccines followed by protein vaccines) have been demonstrated to induce strong and broad antibody responses post-boost despite almost undetectable immune responses post-prime. While the mechanism of this phenomenon is still not well understood, its efficiency has been demonstrated in animal models and humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> A second technology&#x02014;based on cHAs that can be used in sequential vaccination regimens to specifically boost antibody responses to the conserved HA stalk domain&#x02014;has been successfully tested in several animal models as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> In this study, we tested if a combination of these two technologies would further enhance and broaden the immune response against the influenza virus surface glycoproteins. Furthermore, we assessed if adding AS03 as adjuvant to the IIV component of the vaccine regimen would be beneficial.</p><p id="Par19">The heterologous LAIV&#x02013;IIV vaccination strategy clearly outperformed the homologous IIV&#x02013;IIV vaccination regimen in terms of protection both in the upper and in the lower respiratory tract. However, it is important to mention that the IIV&#x02013;IIV regimens tested also afforded significant protection as compared to the current standard of care (2xTIV in naive individuals). Addition of the adjuvant certainly had a substantial effect on antibody titers against both the HA stalk (serum IgG and IgA) and against the NA. The contribution of the adjuvant to protection was less pronounced but a trend could be observed both for the LAIV&#x02013;IIV and the IIV&#x02013;IIV regimens in most tissues. One limitation was that animals vaccinated with the LAIV&#x02013;IIV regimen (adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted) had no detectable virus in lungs, trachea, olfactory bulb and oropharyngeal samples, and it is therefore hard to make a valid comparison. A follow-up experiment with a high dose virus challenge again showed complete protection of the lower respiratory tract, but revealed a similar trend of slightly higher viral titers in the unadjuvanted vaccine group in the upper respiratory tract.</p><p id="Par20">Another important observation is that there is a disconnect between anti-stalk titers measured in serum and the observed protection. As an example, the non-adjuvanted LAIV&#x02013;IIV regimen greatly outperformed the adjuvanted IIV&#x02013;IIV regimen in terms of protection despite a 32-fold lower anti-stalk titer induced by LAIV&#x02013;IIV (non-adjuvanted) pre-challenge as compared to IIV&#x02013;IIV (adjuvanted). Several factors could account for this disconnect. Antibodies against the N1 NA were induced by the adjuvanted IIV&#x02013;IIV but also by the adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted LAIV&#x02013;IIV regimen. While these titers were low it has been shown that anti-NA antibodies can protect from viral challenge in mouse and ferret models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> LAIV is administered mucosally and is therefore thought to induce strong local immune response in tissue-resident immune cells. This could lead to an increased secretion of protective anti-stalk and anti-NA IgA. While we did not find higher mucosal IgA titers in the post-challenge nasal washes of non-adjuvanted LAIV&#x02013;IIV as compared to the adjuvanted IIV&#x02013;IIV vaccinated animals, it is unclear if this anamnestic response would correlate with the pre-challenge mucosal concentration of anti-stalk secretory IgA titers. Furthermore, LAIV replicates actively in the upper respiratory tract of vaccinees, leading to intracellular antigen expression, which primes for strong adaptive cellular immune responses. This cell-based immune response could very well account for the observed difference in protection. Finally, replicating LAIV viruses induce unspecific innate immune responses. It has been recently shown that such innate immune responses can actually lead to unspecific protection mediated by Club cells&#x02014;an effect that can last up to 12 weeks in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>

Such a multivalent vaccine could induce stalk-reactive antibody responses against all influenza subtypes.</p><p id="Par22">All vaccines and adjuvants used in the study are of high translational potential.

</p><p id="Par23">In summary, this study demonstrates that both cHA-based heterologous LAIV&#x02013;IIV and homologous IIV&#x02013;IIV vaccination strategies induce broadly reactive anti-stalk antibodies and protect ferrets from challenge with pH1N1 virus with the heterologous vaccination strategy outperforming the homologous vaccination regimen in terms of protection. While we chose to test the vaccines in primed ferrets that better mimic the immune status of adult humans, we hypothesize that the LAIV prime&#x02014;which also mimics natural infection&#x02014;might be the better choice for vaccination of children who lack pre-existing anti-stalk immunity. The data resulting from this study warrants testing of this cHA-based heterologous prime boost regimen as a universal influenza candidate in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Cells, viruses, proteins and vaccines</title><p id="Par24">Madin&#x02013;Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with antibiotics (100&#x02009;U/mL penicillin- 100&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/mL streptomycin [Pen-Strep]; Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone).

Three weeks later, two groups of primed ferrets (LAIV&#x02013;IIV&#x02009;+&#x02009;and LAIV&#x02013;IIV&#x02212; groups,&#x02009;+&#x02009;/&#x02212; indicates the presence of adjuvant in the IIV boost) were intranasally vaccinated with a 0.5&#x02009;mL dose containing 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>7</sup> PFU of cH8/1N1 LAIV, followed 3 weeks later by intramuscular vaccination with cH5/1N1 IIV (5ug/HA in 0.25&#x02009;mL of PBS).

Ferrets in the IIV&#x02013;IIV&#x02009;+&#x02009;group received both doses of AS03 adjuvanted vaccine (0.25&#x02009;mL) and ferrets in the IIV&#x02013;IIV&#x02212; group received both doses unadjuvanted vaccine (0.25&#x02009;mL of PBS). An unvaccinated group served as a negative control to compare the protection conferred by cHA vaccination with na&#x000ef;ve animals (naive).
