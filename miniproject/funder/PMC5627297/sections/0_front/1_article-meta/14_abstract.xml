 <title>Influenza: Defending against a common enemy</title>
 <p id="Par2">A vaccine against influenza targets non-varying parts of surface proteins to overcome the virus’ attempt at evading detection. Influenza viruses possess rapidly shifting surface proteins, effectively camouflaging themselves. These changes are making it difficult for vaccines to elicit reliable antibody responses against the threat. A team of researchers led by Florian Krammer and Randy A. Albrecht, of the United States’ Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, now describes a vaccine regimen that repeatedly targets a conserved component of the virus’ surface, prompting a broadly protective immune response. The conserved domains of the viral surface proteins are traditionally a more difficult target for vaccines as the immune systems of vaccinees have a preference for the varying domains. The team’s data, generated from ferret experiments, supports an investigation into the efficacy of this approach in humans.</p>
