  <p>H1 and N1 specific antibody titers measured by ELISA. ELISA endpoint titers against cH6/1 protein are plotted on the 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis. 
   <bold>a</bold> H1 stalk serum IgG titers. The IgG antibody responses were measured on days 0, 21, 42, 70 and 74 (
   <italic>x</italic>-axis). Each point shows the mean titer and standard error of the mean for each group (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4/group). 
   <bold>b</bold> H1 stalk serum IgA titers. The IgA antibody responses were measured on days 0, 21, 42, 70 and 74 (
   <italic>x</italic>-axis). Each point shows the mean titer and standard error of the mean for each group (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4/group). 
   <bold>c</bold> H1 stalk nasal wash IgA titers. ELISA IgA titers were measured in nasal washes on day 3 post infection. Each point shows the titer for one animal (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4/group). White bars indicate the GMTs of each group. The 
   <italic>gray dashed line</italic> indicates the limit of detection. 
   <bold>d</bold> N1 serum IgG titers. The IgG antibody responses were measured on days 0, 21, 42, 70 and 74 (
   <italic>x</italic>-axis). Each point shows the mean titer and standard error of the mean for each group (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4/group). Vaccinated group means in 
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold> and 
   <bold>d</bold> were compared to naïve animals with a two-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (multiple time points) and a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used in 
   <bold>c</bold> (single time point). The 
   <italic>asterisks</italic> refer to the level of significance (zeros after the decimal point of the 
   <italic>p</italic>-value): *
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05; **
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01; ***
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001; ****
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001
