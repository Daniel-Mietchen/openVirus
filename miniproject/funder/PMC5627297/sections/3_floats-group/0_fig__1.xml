  <p>Vaccination overview and phylogenetic tree. 
   <bold>a</bold> Chimeric HA vaccination. By exchanging the HA head domains, but retaining the same HA stalk domain, the antibody response can be redirected towards the otherwise immuno-subdominant stalk region. Repeated exposure to cHA constructs can boost HA stalk-specific antibodies to high titers. 
   <bold>b</bold> Vaccination strategy. Ferrets in the cHA vaccination groups were primed with an influenza B virus expressing the cH9/1 HA, followed by cH8/1 vaccination either as LAIV or IIV (with or without adjuvant) on day 21. All cHA vaccination groups received a second boost on day 42 with cH5/1 IIV vaccine (with or without adjuvant). Ferrets that either received only the cH9/1 HA prime, received a seasonal trivalent influenza virus vaccine (TIV) twice or were na√Øve were included as control groups. All ferrets were challenged with pH1N1 virus on day 70. 
   <bold>c</bold> Phylogenetic tree. All vaccines contained the HA stalk domain of H1 (highlighted in blue). ELISA serology was performed against H1 (highlighted in 
   <italic>blue</italic>) as well as H2, H18 and H3 (highlighted in 
   <italic>green</italic>). H2 is closely related to H1 HA, while H18 is the most distantly related HA within influenza A group 1. H3 is an influenza A group 2 HA and was included to measure cross-group reactive antibody titers. The scale bar (0.06) indicates the percent difference based on amino acid sequences
