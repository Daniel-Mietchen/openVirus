  <p>Virus titers post pH1N1 (10
   <sup>4</sup> PFU) challenge. Viral titers were measured by plaque assay. LAIV followed by IIV-vaccinated animals are shown as 
   <italic>blue circles</italic> (
   <italic>empty circles</italic>, without adjuvant; 
   <italic>full circles</italic>, with adjuvant). IIV followed by IIV-vaccinated animals are shown as 
   <italic>red triangles</italic> (
   <italic>empty triangles</italic>, without adjuvant; 
   <italic>full triangles</italic>, with adjuvant). Animals that received only the cH9/1 HA prime are shown as white diamonds. TIV-vaccinated animals are shown as 
   <italic>green squares</italic> and naïve animals are shown as 
   <italic>white squares</italic>. 
   <italic>White bars</italic> indicate the GMTs of each group. Each point shows the titer for one animal (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4/group). The 
   <italic>gray dashed line</italic> indicates the limit of detection. 
   <bold>a</bold> Nasal wash viral titers. Viral titers in nasal washes were measured on day 1 and day 3 post infection. 
   <bold>b</bold> Oropharyngeal swab viral titers. Viral titers in oropharyngeal swabs were measured on day 1 and day 3 post infection. 
   <bold>c</bold> Nasal turbinate viral titers. Viral titers in nasal turbinates were measured on day 4 post challenge. 
   <bold>d</bold> Olfactory bulb viral titers. Viral titers in olfactory bulbs were measured on day 4 post challenge. 
   <bold>e</bold> Trachea viral titers. Viral titers in the trachea were measured on day 4 post challenge. 
   <bold>f</bold> Lung viral titers. Viral titers in the left medial bronchus of the upper lobe of the lung were measured on day 4 post challenge. Groups in 
   <bold>a</bold> and 
   <bold>b</bold> were compared to naïve animals with a two-way ANOVA (multiple time points), followed by a Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Groups in 
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>d</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold> and 
   <bold>f</bold> (single time point) were compared to naive animals with a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. The asterisks refer to the level of significance (zeros after the decimal point of the 
   <italic>p</italic>-value): *
   <italic>P</italic>  ≤ 0.05; **
   <italic>P </italic> ≤ 0.01; ***
   <italic>P</italic>  ≤ 0.001; ****
   <italic>P </italic> ≤ 0.0001
