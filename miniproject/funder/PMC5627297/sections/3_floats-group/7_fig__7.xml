  <p>Virus titers post high dose pH1N1 (10
   <sup>6</sup> PFU) challenge. Viral titers were measured by plaque assay. Naïve animals are shown as 
   <italic>white squares</italic>, LAIV/IIV-vaccinated animals with adjuvant are shown 
   <italic>full blue circles</italic> and LAIV/IIV-vaccinated animals are shown 
   <italic>empty blue circles</italic> of the 
   <italic>x</italic>-axis. 
   <italic>White bars</italic> indicate the GMTs of each group. The 
   <italic>gray line</italic> indicates the limit of detection. 
   <bold>a</bold> Nasal wash viral titers. Viral titers in nasal washes were measured on day 1 and day 3 post infection. 
   <bold>b</bold> Nasal turbinate viral titers. Viral titers in nasal turbinates were measured on day 4 post challenge. 
   <bold>c</bold> Trachea viral titers. Viral titers in the trachea were measured on day 4 post challenge. 
   <bold>d</bold> Lung viral titers. Viral titers in the left medial bronchus of the upper lobe of the lung were measured on day 4 post challenge. Groups in a were compared to naïve animals with a two-way ANOVA (multiple time points), followed by a Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Groups in 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold> and 
   <bold>d</bold> (single time point) were compared to naive animals with a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. The asterisks refer to the level of significance (zeros after the decimal point of the 
   <italic>p</italic>-value): *
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05; **
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01; ***
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001; ****
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001
