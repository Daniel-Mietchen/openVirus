  <p>Antibody breadth measured by ELISA and neutralization. Titers are plotted on the 
   <italic>y</italic>-axis. LAIV followed by IIV-vaccinated animals are shown as 
   <italic>blue circles</italic> (
   <italic>empty circles</italic>, without adjuvant; 
   <italic>full circles</italic>, with adjuvant). IIV followed by IIV-vaccinated animals are shown as 
   <italic>red triangles</italic> (
   <italic>empty triangles</italic>, without adjuvant; 
   <italic>full triangles</italic>, with adjuvant). Animals that received only the cH9/1 HA prime are shown as 
   <italic>white diamonds</italic>. TIV-vaccinated animals are shown as 
   <italic>green squares</italic> and naïve animals are shown as 
   <italic>white squares</italic>. 
   <italic>White bars</italic> indicate the GMTs of each group. Each point shows the titer for one animal (
   <italic>n</italic> = 4/group). The 
   <italic>gray dashed line</italic> indicates the limit of detection. Titers were measured in pre-challenge sera (day 70). 
   <bold>a</bold> H1 ELISA IgG titer. 
   <bold>b</bold> H2 ELISA IgG titer. 
   <bold>c</bold> H18 ELISA IgG titer. d H3 ELISA IgG titer. 
   <bold>e</bold> pH1N1 neutralization titer. Groups were compared to naive animals with a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. The asterisks refer to the level of significance (zeros after the decimal point of the 
   <italic>p</italic>-value): *
   <italic>P</italic>  ≤ 0.05; **
   <italic>P</italic>  ≤ 0.01; ***
   <italic>P </italic> ≤ 0.001; ****
   <italic>P</italic>  ≤ 0.0001
