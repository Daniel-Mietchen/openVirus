  <p>Replication of cH8/1N1 LAIV is attenuated in ferrets. Viral titers were measured by plaque assay. Animals infected with wild type pH1N1 (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) are shown as 
   <italic>blue circles</italic> and animals infected with cH8/1N1 LAIV (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) are shown as 
   <italic>blue squares</italic>. 
   <italic>White bars</italic> indicate the GMTs of each group. The gray dashed line indicates the limit of detection. 
   <bold>a</bold> Nasal wash viral titers. Viral titers in nasal washes were measured on day 1 and day 3 post infection. 
   <bold>b</bold> Nasal turbinate viral titers. Viral titers in nasal turbinates were measured on day 4 post infection. 
   <bold>c</bold> Oropharyngeal swab viral titers. Viral titers in oropharyngeal swabs were measured on day 1 and day 3 post infection. 
   <bold>d</bold> Bronchus viral titers. Viral titers in the left medial bronchus of the upper lobe of the lung were measured on day 4 post infection. Groups in 
   <bold>a</bold> and 
   <bold>c</bold> were compared with a two-way ANOVA, followed by a Sidak’s multiple comparison test. The 
   <italic>asterisks</italic> refer to the level of significance (zeros after the decimal point of the 
   <italic>p</italic>-value): *
   <italic>P</italic>  ≤ 0.05; **
   <italic>P</italic>  ≤ 0.01; ***
   <italic>P</italic>  ≤ 0.001; ****
   <italic>P</italic>  ≤ 0.0001
