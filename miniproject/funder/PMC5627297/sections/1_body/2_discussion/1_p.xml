<p id="Par18">The aim of this preclinical study was to combine LAIV and IIV vaccination approaches to induce broad immune responses against the influenza virus HA, specifically against the conserved stalk domain. In recent years, heterologous prime-boost regimens (e.g., LAIV followed by IIV or DNA vaccines followed by protein vaccines) have been demonstrated to induce strong and broad antibody responses post-boost despite almost undetectable immune responses post-prime. While the mechanism of this phenomenon is still not well understood, its efficiency has been demonstrated in animal models and humans.

 </sup> A second technology—based on cHAs that can be used in sequential vaccination regimens to specifically boost antibody responses to the conserved HA stalk domain—has been successfully tested in several animal models as well.

 </sup> In this study, we tested if a combination of these two technologies would further enhance and broaden the immune response against the influenza virus surface glycoproteins. Furthermore, we assessed if adding AS03 as adjuvant to the IIV component of the vaccine regimen would be beneficial.
