<p id="Par20">Another important observation is that there is a disconnect between anti-stalk titers measured in serum and the observed protection. As an example, the non-adjuvanted LAIV–IIV regimen greatly outperformed the adjuvanted IIV–IIV regimen in terms of protection despite a 32-fold lower anti-stalk titer induced by LAIV–IIV (non-adjuvanted) pre-challenge as compared to IIV–IIV (adjuvanted). Several factors could account for this disconnect. Antibodies against the N1 NA were induced by the adjuvanted IIV–IIV but also by the adjuvanted and nonadjuvanted LAIV–IIV regimen. While these titers were low it has been shown that anti-NA antibodies can protect from viral challenge in mouse and ferret models.

 </sup> LAIV is administered mucosally and is therefore thought to induce strong local immune response in tissue-resident immune cells. This could lead to an increased secretion of protective anti-stalk and anti-NA IgA. While we did not find higher mucosal IgA titers in the post-challenge nasal washes of non-adjuvanted LAIV–IIV as compared to the adjuvanted IIV–IIV vaccinated animals, it is unclear if this anamnestic response would correlate with the pre-challenge mucosal concentration of anti-stalk secretory IgA titers. Furthermore, LAIV replicates actively in the upper respiratory tract of vaccinees, leading to intracellular antigen expression, which primes for strong adaptive cellular immune responses. This cell-based immune response could very well account for the observed difference in protection. Finally, replicating LAIV viruses induce unspecific innate immune responses. It has been recently shown that such innate immune responses can actually lead to unspecific protection mediated by Club cells—an effect that can last up to 12 weeks in mice.
