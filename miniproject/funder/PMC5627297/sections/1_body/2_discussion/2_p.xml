<p id="Par19">The heterologous LAIV–IIV vaccination strategy clearly outperformed the homologous IIV–IIV vaccination regimen in terms of protection both in the upper and in the lower respiratory tract. However, it is important to mention that the IIV–IIV regimens tested also afforded significant protection as compared to the current standard of care (2xTIV in naive individuals). Addition of the adjuvant certainly had a substantial effect on antibody titers against both the HA stalk (serum IgG and IgA) and against the NA. The contribution of the adjuvant to protection was less pronounced but a trend could be observed both for the LAIV–IIV and the IIV–IIV regimens in most tissues. One limitation was that animals vaccinated with the LAIV–IIV regimen (adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted) had no detectable virus in lungs, trachea, olfactory bulb and oropharyngeal samples, and it is therefore hard to make a valid comparison. A follow-up experiment with a high dose virus challenge again showed complete protection of the lower respiratory tract, but revealed a similar trend of slightly higher viral titers in the unadjuvanted vaccine group in the upper respiratory tract.</p>
