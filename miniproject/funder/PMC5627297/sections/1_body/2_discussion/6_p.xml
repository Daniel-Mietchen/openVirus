<p id="Par23">In summary, this study demonstrates that both cHA-based heterologous LAIV–IIV and homologous IIV–IIV vaccination strategies induce broadly reactive anti-stalk antibodies and protect ferrets from challenge with pH1N1 virus with the heterologous vaccination strategy outperforming the homologous vaccination regimen in terms of protection. While we chose to test the vaccines in primed ferrets that better mimic the immune status of adult humans, we hypothesize that the LAIV prime—which also mimics natural infection—might be the better choice for vaccination of children who lack pre-existing anti-stalk immunity. The data resulting from this study warrants testing of this cHA-based heterologous prime boost regimen as a universal influenza candidate in clinical trials.</p>
