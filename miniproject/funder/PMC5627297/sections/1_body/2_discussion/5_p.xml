<p id="Par22">All vaccines and adjuvants used in the study are of high translational potential. The LAIV component used in this study grows to high titers in eggs, which allows for large-scale manufacturing. The backbone of the LAIV is based on the Leningrad vaccine strain, which has been licensed and successfully used in humans.
