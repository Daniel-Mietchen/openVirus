<p id="Par34">Two-fold dilutions (50 µL) of the RDE-treated sera in sterile Opti-MEM (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were mixed with 200 PFU of influenza virus (5 µL). The serum virus samples were then incubated at room temperature for 60 min to allow any HA-specific antibodies present in the serum to neutralize the influenza virus. The serum-virus samples (55 µL) were then transferred to MDCK cells cultured in 96-well flat bottom plates. Following virus adsorption for 60 min, the serum-virus inocula were removed, and the MDCK cells were cultured for 4 days in Opti-MEM supplemented with 1 µg/mL of TPCK-trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich). Virus production was determined by HA assay. The neutralization titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that neutralizes 200 PFU of influenza virus. Samples were tested in technical duplicates and the mean titers were reported.</p>
