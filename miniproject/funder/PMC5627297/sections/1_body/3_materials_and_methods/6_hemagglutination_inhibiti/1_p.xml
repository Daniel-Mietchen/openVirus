 </sup> Working stocks for each influenza virus strain were prepared by diluting the virus stock to a final HA titer of 8 HA units/50 µL. Two-fold dilutions (25 µL) of the RDE-treated sera in PBS prepared in 96 V-well microtiter plates were then mixed with 25 µL of the working stock of each influenza virus strain (each well contains a final volume of 50 µL). The serum virus samples were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow any HA-specific antibodies present in the serum to neutralize the influenza virus. To each well, 50 µL of a 0.5% suspension of chicken red blood cells was then added, and the assays were then incubated at 4 °C until the red blood cells in the PBS control sample formed a button. Samples were tested in technical duplicates. The HI titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that inhibited red blood cell hemagglutination by influenza virus and the mean titers of duplicates were reported.
