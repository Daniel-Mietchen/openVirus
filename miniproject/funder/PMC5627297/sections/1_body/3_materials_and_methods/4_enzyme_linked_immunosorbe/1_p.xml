<p id="Par31">ELISAs were performed with recombinantly produced proteins to measure HA-specific antibodies in serum and nasal washes. Furthermore, antibodies against N1 were measured in serum by ELISA. To measure serum IgG, 96-well plates were coated with 50 µl of 2 µg/mL of antigen in sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.4) per well and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and blocked with 220 µl of blocking solution (PBS-T containing 3% goat serum (Gibco) and 0.5% milk powder) for 1 h at room temperature. After initial blocking, the volume was discarded and 100 µl of blocking solution was added to each well. An additional 90 µl of blocking solution was added to the first well of the dilution series. Ten microliters of serum pre-diluted 1:5 in PBS were then added to the first well of the dilution series (resulting in a 1:100 starting dilution). Samples were 2-fold serially diluted by transferring 100 µl to the next well. Two columns were left blank on each plate. Plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS-T and 50 µl of horse radish peroxidase-labeled anti-ferret IgG (Alpha Diagnostic International, #70530) at a concentration of 1:5000 was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed four times with PBS-T and developed by adding 100 µl of SigmaFast OPD per well. After 10 min, the reaction was stopped by addition of 3 M hydrochloric acid and plates were read at a wavelength of 490 nm in a plate reader (Biotek Synergy H1). The average plus three standard deviations of blank wells were calculated as a cut-off value. If a sample did not dilute out below the cut-off, it was re-run at a higher starting dilution. The same procedure was used to measure IgA titers in nasal washes and serum. However, a starting dilution of 1:2 was used for the nasal washes (100 µl of nasal wash + 100 µl of blocking solution in the first well). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti ferret IgA antibody (Novus Biologicals, NBP1-73728) was used at a 1:3000 concentration as secondary antibody.</p>
