<p id="Par24">Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were maintained in complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin- 100 μg/mL streptomycin [Pen-Strep]; Gibco) and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Virus stocks were grown in 8–10 day old specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories) for 2 days at 37 °C or for 3 days at 33 °C. Eggs were then chilled to 4 °C overnight, allantoic fluid was harvested, cleared using low speed centrifugation, aliquoted and quantified by plaque assay on monolayers of MDCK cells in the presence of tosyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. Plaques were visualized by immunostaining or crystal violet staining.</p>
