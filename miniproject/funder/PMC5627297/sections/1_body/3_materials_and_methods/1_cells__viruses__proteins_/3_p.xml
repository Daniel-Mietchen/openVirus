 </sup> The cH5/1
 <sub>Cal09</sub>N1
 <sub>Cal09</sub>virus expresses an HA head domain of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1), an H1 stalk domain and N1 NA from A/California/04/09 virus while the internal genes were derived from A/Puerto Rico/8/34 virus.

 </sup> The cH8/1
 <sub>Cal09</sub>N1
 <sub>Cal09</sub> expresses an HA head domain from A/mallard/Sweden/24/02 (H8N4) while the remaining genes as well as the stalk domain are the same as for the cH5/1
