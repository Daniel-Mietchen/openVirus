 </sup> pDZ plasmids for the virus rescue were cloned at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. GLP-grade PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS segments of A/Leningrad/134/17/57 virus were synthesized (DNA2.0, Newark, CA) from sequences deposited in the Global Initiative for Sharing Influenza Data (GISAID) online database (EPI555079 to EPI555086).
