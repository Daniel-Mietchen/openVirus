<p id="Par29">Upon rescue, the cH8/1 LAIV was expanded in specific pathogen-free embryonated eggs (Charles River Laboratories) at the permissive temperature of 33 °C for 72 h. Stocks were prepared, quantified by plaque assay and sequence verified by Sanger sequencing. The replicative phenotype was assessed in MDCK cells following a well-established TCID
 <sub>50</sub> protocol.

 </sup> Briefly, confluent layers of MDCK cells in 96-well plates were infected with serial 1/2-log dilutions of the cH8/1 LAIV and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 (as non-
 <italic>ts</italic>, non-
 <italic>ca</italic> control) in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing TPCK-treated trypsin and Pen-Strep. The plates were incubated at 39 °C, 33 °C and 25 °C and the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> dose was calculated according to the Spearman &amp; Kaerber algorithm based on cytopathogenic effect.

 </sup> a 
 <italic>ts</italic> phenotype is defined by a titer at 39 °C that is at least 100-fold lower than at 33 °C and a 
 <italic>ca</italic> phenotype is defined by a titer at 25 °C being less than 100-fold lower than at 33 °C. Furthermore, the cH8/1 LAIV virus was sent to the USDA where an in vivo intravenous pathotyping experiment in chickens was performed according to the World Organization for Animal Health procedures for testing the pathogenicity of influenza viruses. Finally, we examined the attenuation phenotype of cH8/1 LAIV by intranasal infection of ferrets with an inoculation dose of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU. A group of ferrets inoculated with wild-type A/California/04/09 virus served as a control. For this experiment 4-month-old neutered male Fitch ferrets (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) were confirmed to be seronegative for circulating H1N1, H3N2, and B influenza viruses prior to purchase from Triple F Farms (Sayre, PA). All animal procedures performed in this study were performed in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines and Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the IACUC of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.
