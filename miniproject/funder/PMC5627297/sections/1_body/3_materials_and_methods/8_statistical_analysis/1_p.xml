<p id="Par35">For comparisons of two groups with a single time point an unpaired t-test followed with a Welch’s correction for unequal standard deviations was used. For comparisons of two groups with multiple time points a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by a Sidak’s post-test to adjust for multiple comparisons was performed. For comparisons of more than two groups with a single time point, column means were compared to naive animals with a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s post-test to adjust for multiple comparisons. For comparisons of more than two groups with multiple time points, column means were compared to naive animals with a two-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett’s post-test to adjust for multiple comparisons. All statistical analyzes were performed in Graphpad Prism 7. The asterisks shown in the figures refer to the level of significance (zeros after the decimal point of the
