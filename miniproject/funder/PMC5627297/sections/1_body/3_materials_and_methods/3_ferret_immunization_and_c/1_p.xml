<p id="Par30">Three to 5-month-old spayed female Fitch ferrets were confirmed to be seronegative for circulating H1N1, H3N2, and B influenza viruses prior to purchase from Marshall BioResources (North Rose, NY). All animal experiments were performed according to a protocol approved by the IACUC of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The sample size was chosen according to the standards in the field. The space requirements and cost associated with the ferret model did not allow for a larger sample size. Ferrets randomly assigned to different treatments by assigning a treatment to a group of four animals. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> summarizes the prime/boost immunizations administered to each immunization group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) of ferrets. The universal vaccination regimen is based on boosting pre-existing HA-stalk antibodies which are present at low levels in human adults.

 </sup> To mimic this scenario, naive ferrets in the chimeric vaccination groups were primed by intranasal infection with an inoculation dose of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU (in 1 mL of PBS) of influenza B virus expressing cH9/1 HA.

 </sup> This priming method prevents the establishment of immunity against influenza A virus internal proteins and does not interfere with a later pH1N1 virus challenge. Importantly, while animals were assigned to groups prior to priming, their immune status post-priming was not assessed until after the challenge, meaning that the animals were de facto randomized after the prime. Three weeks later, two groups of primed ferrets (LAIV–IIV + and LAIV–IIV− groups, + /− indicates the presence of adjuvant in the IIV boost) were intranasally vaccinated with a 0.5 mL dose containing 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU of cH8/1N1 LAIV, followed 3 weeks later by intramuscular vaccination with cH5/1N1 IIV (5ug/HA in 0.25 mL of PBS). The IIV vaccine doses for ferrets in the LAIV–IIV + group were adjuvanted with 0.25 mL of Adjuvant System 03 (AS03), while the vaccine doses for the ferrets in the LAIV–IIV− group were mixed with 0.25 mL of PBS (0.5 mL final injection volume). To compare the LAIV–IIV approach to an exclusive IIV–IIV approach, two groups of ferrets (IIV–IIV + and IIV–IIV−, + /− indicates the presence of adjuvant in prime and boost) received cH8/1N1 IIV followed by cH5/1N1 IIV intramuscularly (5ug/HA in 0.25 mL of PBS per dose) with the same vaccination interval. Ferrets in the IIV–IIV + group received both doses of AS03 adjuvanted vaccine (0.25 mL) and ferrets in the IIV–IIV− group received both doses unadjuvanted vaccine (0.25 mL of PBS). An unvaccinated group served as a negative control to compare the protection conferred by cHA vaccination with naïve animals (naive). To show any effects of the cH9/1 B virus prime on viral loads, a prime only group was included (prime-only). Finally, a “standard of care” group of ferrets received 2 doses of a human dose TIV containing a pH1N1 component on days 21 and 42 of the experiment (2xTIV; 2015–2016 formulation of the seasonal influenza vaccine, Fluvirin, Seqirus). Four weeks after the last booster immunization, all animals were challenged intranasally with an inoculation dose of 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of A/California/4/09 in 1 mL of PBS. An inoculation dose of 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU (high dose challenge) was used in a smaller follow up experiment. Nasal washes and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from anesthetized ferrets on days 1 and 3 after challenge. On day 4 after challenge, the animals were euthanized by intracardiac injection of Sleepaway euthanasia solution (Fort Dodge, IA) and tissues (olfactory bulbs, nasal turbinates, trachea, and lung) were collected from each individual ferret to quantify viral titers by plaque assays. Serum was collected at baseline, day 21, day 42, day 70 and on the last day of the virus challenge experiment.
