<p id="Par6">The safety profile and replication phenotype was then assessed in 4-month-old neutered male ferrets. Following intranasal infection with an inoculation dose of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU of cH8/1 LAIV, nasal wash and oropharyngeal swab samples were collected at days 1 and 3 post-immunization to quantify virus titers by plaque assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). For comparison, ferrets were infected with a wild-type pandemic H1N1 virus isolate (pH1N1). Consistent with the anticipated attenuated phenotype, cH8/1 LAIV could not be detected by plaque assay in nasal wash and oropharyngeal swab samples, whereas the pH1N1 virus was present at high titers in recovered samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, c</xref>). Analysis of nasal turbinate samples collected at day 4 post immunization revealed that cH8/1 LAIV was present at a geometric mean titer (GMT) of 303.3 PFU/g tissue whereas the pH1N1 virus was present at a GMT of 1.1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> PFU/g tissue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Infectious cH8/1 LAIV could not be recovered from lung tissue; however, the control pH1N1 was detected at a GMT of 1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/g tissue (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Collectively, the in vitro and in vivo data confirmed the expected attenuated phenotype of the cH8/1 LAIV strain.
