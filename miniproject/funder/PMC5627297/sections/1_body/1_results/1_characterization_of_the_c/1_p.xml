<p id="Par5">The objective of this study was the preclinical evaluation of a sequential immunization strategy with cHAs to induce HA stalk-specific immune responses that confer protection against influenza virus infection. The LAIV component, an A/Leningrad/134/17/57 master donor virus expressing the cH8/1 HA (H8 head domain on top of an H1 stalk domain) and the N1 NA from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus (cH8/1 LAIV), was rescued by reverse genetics under Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Virus growth in eggs at permissive temperature led to titers above 10
 <sup>8</sup> 50% egg infectious dose per ml. The temperature sensitive (

 <italic>ca</italic>) phenotype of the cH8/1 LAIV was assessed in cell culture. The cH8/1 LAIV met the

 <italic>ca</italic> (reduction of less than 2 logs at 25 °C as compared to 33 °C) criteria according to the criteria established by Jin and colleagues (Table

 </sup> Furthermore, the cH8/1 LAIV strain proved to be non-pathogenic in an intravenous pathogenicity test in chickens performed at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) according to the World Organization for Animal Health procedures for testing pathogenicity of influenza viruses.
