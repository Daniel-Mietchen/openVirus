<p id="Par17">Finally, to test if the use of adjuvant is necessary in this influenza vaccination model the LAIV/IIV vaccination strategies with and without AS03 adjuvanted boost were repeated followed by a higher pH1N1 challenge dose (10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU) with the goal to detect differences in protection, specifically in the lower respiratory tract. The nasal wash and nasal turbinate virus titers were low in both groups, which indicated good protection even at a higher challenge dose (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a, b</xref>). No significant differences could be detected between the groups, but more ferrets in the unadjuvanted group had detectable virus titers. Both groups were again completely protected from viral replication in the lower respiratory tract (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c, d</xref>). While the benefit of adding adjuvant to the LAIVâ€“IIV vaccination regimen is clear when antibody titers are assessed, we were unfortunately not able to draw conclusions based on protection from infection, even with the higher 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU challenge dose.
