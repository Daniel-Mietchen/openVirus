<p id="Par14">On day 70 post prime, all ferrets were challenged intranasally with 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of a pH1N1 isolate. The challenge dose of 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU is the standard challenge dose established in the laboratory and was chosen here to make comparisons to earlier studies possible.

 </sup> Nasal washes and oropharyngeal swab samples were obtained on day 1 and day 3 post challenge, and animals were euthanized on day 4 and the nasal turbinates, olfactory bulb, trachea, and lungs were harvested. This set-up is the standard challenge set-up and, as mentioned above, makes the data comparable to earlier studies. Naive animals showed geometric mean nasal wash titers in the 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU/mL range on day 1 and day 3, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Titers in the 2xTIV and prime-only groups were slightly lower than in the naive group. Animals vaccinated with the cHA-based IIV–IIV strategy showed a greater reduction of nasal wash titers, specifically on day 1 post challenge with a trend to lower titers in the adjuvanted versus the non-adjuvanted group. The lowest nasal wash titers on both day 1 and day 3 post-infection were found in the LAIV–IIV vaccinated groups with virus titer reductions of up to 3 logs as compared to naive animals. Again, the regimen with the adjuvanted IIV boost showed a trend towards lower titers than the group that received the non-adjuvanted boost. Oropharyngeal samples for all groups were negative on day 1 post infection and followed a similar trend as the nasal wash titers on day 3 post infection with undetectable titers in both LAIV–IIV groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>).
