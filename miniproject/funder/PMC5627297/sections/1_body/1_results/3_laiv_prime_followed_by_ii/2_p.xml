 <sup>7</sup> PFU/gram tissue in the naive and TIV groups and slightly reduced in the B-cH9/1 group (10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU/gram tissue range) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>). Animals that received the non-adjuvanted IIV–IIV and the adjuvanted IIV–IIV regimen had nasal turbinate titers in the range of 10
 <sup>6</sup> and 10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU/gram tissue respectively. Nasal turbinate titers in both LAIV–IIV groups were close to the limit of detection and one animal from the adjuvanted LAIV–IIV group had viral titers below the limit of detection. Virus replication in the olfactory bulb, which is an organ that is typically infected by pH1N1 isolates,

 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref>).
