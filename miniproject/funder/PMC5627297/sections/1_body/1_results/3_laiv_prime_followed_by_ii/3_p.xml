<p id="Par16">We also assessed protection from virus replication in the lower respiratory tract. Interestingly, both LAIV–IIV vaccination regimens induced sterilizing immunity in the trachea with no detectable virus observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). The IIV–IIV vaccination and TIV vaccination groups showed tracheal titers that were very similar to the titers in naive ferrets. LAIV–IIV vaccination also completely blocked virus replication in the lung (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). Non-adjuvanted IIV–IIV vaccination caused a 2.5 log reduction of virus replication in the lungs compared to naive animals and adjuvanted IIV–IIV caused a reduction of approximately 3 logs. Again, no reduction was observed in the B-cH9/1 prime group or the TIV group.
