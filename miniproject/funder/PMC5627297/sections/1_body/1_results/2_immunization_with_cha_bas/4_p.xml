<p id="Par10">In addition to the IgG anti-stalk response, we also monitored the serum IgA anti-stalk response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The serum IgA response followed a similar trend as the serum IgG response albeit at a lower magnitude. We also measured the anamnestic mucosal IgA anti-stalk response in day 3 post challenge nasal washes and found a similar pattern compared to serum IgA titers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).
