 </sup> we used an experimental design that mimics this pre-existing immunity. Specifically, ferrets were initially primed with a recombinant influenza B virus expressing an influenza A virus cH9/1 HA. Infection with this virus primes the anti-stalk response without conferring any relevant (other than H9) HA head-based or internal protein-based protection from influenza A virus to the ferrets. Following the prime, animals were vaccinated with either the cH8/1 LAIV followed by adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted cH5/1 IIV or with adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted cH8/1 IIV followed by adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted cH5/1 IIV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Animals primed with B-cH9/1 and naive animals were used as control groups. Animals that received commercial Trivalent influenza virus vaccine (TIV) were added as ‘standard of care’ control. These animals were vaccinated with two doses of TIV without adjuvant which represents, according to CDC recommendations, the vaccination strategy for naive human subjects/children. Each group contained four ferrets.
