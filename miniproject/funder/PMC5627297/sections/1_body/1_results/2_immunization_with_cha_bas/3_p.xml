<p id="Par9">B-cH9/1-primed animals induced an anti-stalk response that reached a plateau at a low titer (1:1800) at day 42 post prime as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Animals that received non-adjuvanted LAIV窶的IV and IIV窶的IV vaccination regimens induced responses slightly higher (1:3200 for LAIV窶的IV) or similar to the prime only animals with no apparent boost from the second vaccination (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). LAIV followed by adjuvanted IIV induced a strong anti-stalk response that was boosted by the second vaccination and peaked at a titer of 1:20800 on experimental day 70. The adjuvanted IIV窶的IV regimen also induced a strong antibody response with a titer of 1:7200 after the first vaccination, which was boosted to 1:89600 after the second vaccination. Notably, the anti-stalk responses induced by the B-cH9/1 virus prime varied between the different vaccination groups (day 21). Naive animals and TIV (2xTIV) vaccinated animals did not induce a substantial IgG antibody response against the stalk domain during the study period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). To corroborate titers measured with the cH6/1 HA substrate we also performed ELISA assays with H1-based headless HA consisting of only the stalk domain.

 </sup> Titers against headless HA were very similar to titers measured with cH6/1 HA, showing an overall good correlation (Supplementary Fig.
