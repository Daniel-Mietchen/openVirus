<p id="Par11">In addition, the serological IgG response to the N1 NA was tested (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). Only three groups induced notable N1 antibody levels. Vaccination with the non-adjuvanted LAIV–IIV strategy induced low anti-NA titers (1:600) that increased in an anamnestic response post challenge. A stronger response was induced when the adjuvanted LAIV–IIV regimen was used (1:2300 on day 70), which was similar to the observed response induced by the adjuvanted IIV–IIV regimen with a pre-challenge (day 70) peak titer of 1:2400.
