<p id="Par13">Finally, we measured the neutralization titer against the pH1N1 challenge virus in a microneutralization assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). The titers were generally low with one animal in the non-adjuvanted LAIV–IIV group and two animals in the adjuvanted IIV group reaching a 1:40 titer. In the adjuvanted LAIV–IIV group two animals reached 1:40 and one animal reached 1:80. Titers in all other groups including the 2xTIV group had titers below 1:40. These results are consistent with earlier results with stalk-based vaccines in animal models in which low neutralization titers were measured.
