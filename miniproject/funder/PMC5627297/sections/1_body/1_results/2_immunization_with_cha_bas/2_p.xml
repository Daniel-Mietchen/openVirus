<p id="Par8">Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers were measured pre-challenge (day 70). As expected, ferrets immunized with the influenza B virus expressing cH9/1 HA seroconverted against H9 with HI titers of 320 to 1920 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Ferrets that received a booster immunization with the cH8/1 LAIV had detectable HI titers against H8 ranging from 20 to 80 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Of the two groups that received cH8/1 IIV, only two ferrets in the adjuvanted cH8/1 IIV group had detectable HI titers against H8. No ferrets seroconverted against H5 following the second booster immunization with cH5/1 IIV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Importantly, during the course of the immunization schedule, the ferrets remained HI na√Øve for pH1N1 (Fig.
