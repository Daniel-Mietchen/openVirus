<p id="Par12">Furthermore, we analyzed the breadth of the antibody response induced by the cHA-based vaccination pre-challenge (day 70). Antibody titers in all groups were assessed against group 1 HAs H1, H2 and H18 as well as H3, a group 2 HA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Antibody responses to H1 and H2 were high in both the adjuvanted LAIV–IIV and IIV–IIV groups with the IIV–IIV groups reaching GMTs of 1:204800 and 1:121775, respectively and the LAIV–IIV group reaching GMTs of 1:72408 and 1:36204, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). Animals in the non-adjuvanted LAIV–IIV and IIV–IIV groups had lower titers than the adjuvanted groups but higher titers than the prime-only, 2xTIV and naive groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). Similar trends were observed for H18, a more distantly related group 1 HA (as compared to H1), but titers were lower in all vaccination groups. Antibody titers against H3—a group 2 HA—were very low but detectable, which could indicate low titers of cross-group reactive antibodies (Fig.
