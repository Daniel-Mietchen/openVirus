 </sup> Currently licensed inactivated, recombinant, and live attenuated influenza virus vaccines (LAIVs) are proven to reduce clinical disease following influenza virus infection. However, influenza viruses are an evolving immunological target. The ever-changing nature of their surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), creates a difficult challenge for the production of effective vaccines. Seasonal influenza viruses, which cause annual epidemics, constantly escape from herd immunity by antigenic drift of their HA and NA proteins. Therefore, seasonal vaccine formulations have to be updated, re-formulated and re-administered on an annual basis.

 </sup> However, accurately predicting and selecting vaccine strains is difficult. Mismatches between vaccine strains and circulating strains cause a substantial decrease in vaccine efficacy.

 </sup> In addition, the specter of a new influenza pandemic resulting from the unpredictable emergence of a new antigenically shifted virus from an animal reservoir represents an unsurmountable challenge for current influenza vaccines. Production and distribution of matched pandemic vaccines takes approximately 6 monthsâ€”an interval during which the human population is insufficiently protected from a pandemic influenza virus outbreak.

 </sup> The development of a pan-influenza vaccine that confers protection against homologous, drifted and shifted influenza virus strains would abolish the need for annual reformulation, and mitigate disease burden following the emergence of a pandemic influenza virus strain.
