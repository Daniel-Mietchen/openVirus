  <title>Phylogenetic analysis of CVA16 strains detected in this study and reference strains based on partial VP1 sequences.</title>
  <p>The reference strains were selected based on geographical and chronological distributions. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. Bootstrap values (&gt;70%) are shown as percentage derived from 1,000 sampling at the nodes of the tree. Scale bar denotes number of nucleotide substitutions per site along the branches. Red, green, blue, purple and turquoise dots indicate the viruses detected in this study in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively.</p>
