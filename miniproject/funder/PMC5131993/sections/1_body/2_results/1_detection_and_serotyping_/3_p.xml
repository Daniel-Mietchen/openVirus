<p>Among the six cases who were only detected using the VI-IFA, four provided paired sera and three of them were also confirmed with the serum neutralization test (
 <xref rid="pone.0167532.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Among the 48 cases who were only detected using the VP1-CODEHOP, 35 provided paired sera and all of them were also confirmed by the serum neutralization test (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0167532.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Among the 202 cases tested positive by both tests, 192 and 10 have consistent and inconsistent serotypes defined by the two tests, respectively. Eight of the 10 cases with inconsistent serotypes provided paired sera for verification. Based on the serum neutralization test for the eight cases, two and five cases showed consistent serotypes with the VI-IFA and VP1-CODEHOP tests, respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0167532.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Overall, among the 47 cases who had inconsistent results between the VI-IFA and VP1-CODEHOP tests and provided paired sera for verification, correct diagnosis for the VI-IFA and VP1-CODEHOP tests were 5 (11%, 95% confidence interval 1–19%) and 40 (85%, 95% confidence interval 75–95%) cases, respectively. Therefore, the VP1-CODEHOP is more reliable for detection of human enteroviruses than the VI-IFA.
