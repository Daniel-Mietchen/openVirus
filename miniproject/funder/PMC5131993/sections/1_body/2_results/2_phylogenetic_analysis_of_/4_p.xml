<p>There were 31 CVA10 cases detected by the VP1-CODEHOP test, including 2 in 2008, 6 in 2009, 21 in 2011, and 2 in 2012. Most of the CVA10 strains detected in 2011 could be grouped together and are phylogenetically related to CVA10 strains circulated in China in 2009. The other sporadic CVA10 strains detected in 2008, 2009 and 2012 did not have a clear phylogenetic pattern (
