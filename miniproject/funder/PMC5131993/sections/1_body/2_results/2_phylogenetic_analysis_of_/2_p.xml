<p>There were 20 CVA4 cases available for phylogenetic analysis (one was excluded for analysis due to short sequences), including 4 in 2009, 10 in 2010, and 6 in 2011. Interestingly, two genetic clusters and one outlier were identified based on phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167532.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The first cluster including 13 strains detected in 2009 and 2010 is phylogenetically related to CVA4 strains circulating in China in 2008–2009. The second cluster including 6 strains detected in 2011 is phylogenetically related to CVA4 strains circulating in Greece in 2010 and India in 2007–2009. All CVA4 cases detected in our study were mild infections without neurological complications.
