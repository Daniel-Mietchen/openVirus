<p>There were 40 EV71 cases detected by the VP1-CODEHOP test, including 7 in 2008, 2 in 2009, 4 in 2010, and 27 in 2012. None of the 40 EV71 cases developed neurological complications. Interestingly, two major genogroups (B and C) were identified based on phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167532.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Twenty eight strains were identified as genogroup B5, including 5 in 2008 and 23 in 2012. Most of the genotype B5 viruses detected in 2012 could be further classified as subgenotype B5c and they are phylogenetically different from the genogroup B5 viruses detected in 2008. Surprisingly, 6 sporadic strains detected in 2008, 2009, and 2012 were identified as genotype C2 which caused large-scale epidemics in Taiwan in 1998 but had disappeared in Taiwan from 1999 to 2007 [
