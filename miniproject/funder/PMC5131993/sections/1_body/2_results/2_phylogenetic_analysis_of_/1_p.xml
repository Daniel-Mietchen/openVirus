<p>We further used CODEHOP-amplified partial VP1 nucleotide sequences of the six prevalent serotypes to conduct phylogenetic analyses for each prevalent serotype. There were 21 CVA2 cases detected by the VP1-CODEHOP test, including 9 in 2008, 1 in 2011, and 11 in 2012. Interestingly, three genetic clusters were identified based on phylogenetic analysis. The first cluster including 9 strains detected in 2008 is phylogenetically related to CVA2 strains circulating in Japan in 2003. The second cluster including 7 strains detected in 2012 may be phylogenetically related to CVA2 strains circulating in Russia in 2005. The third cluster including 5 strains detected in 2011â€“2012 is phylogenetically related to the CVA2 strains causing severe neurological complications in Hong Kong in 2012 (
