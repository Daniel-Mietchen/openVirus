<p>There were 47 CVA6 cases detected by the VP1-CODEHOP test, including 10 in 2009, 34 in 2010, and 3 in 2011. Interestingly, two genetic clusters were identified based on phylogenetic analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0167532.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The first cluster including 10 strains detected in 2009 is phylogenetically related to multiple CVA6 strains circulating in different countries before 2009. The second cluster including 37 strains detected in 2010–2011 is phylogenetically related to CVA6 strains circulating in Japan in 2009. All CVA6 cases detected in our study were mild infections without neurological complications but some studies have described onychomadesis desquamation and widespread blistering mucocutaneous reactions following CVA6 infection after 2009 [
