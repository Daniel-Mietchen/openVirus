<p>Overall, the VP1-CODEHOP test has multiple advantages over the VI-IFA test but it requires well-trained personnel. Moreover, the virus isolation could not be completely replaced because virus isolates are still required for conducting virological studies and sequencing full VP1 genes and virus genomes. Therefore, it would be desirable to use the VP1-CODEHOP test as the primary test for enterovirus surveillance. Then, clinical specimens from some CODEHOP-positive cases infected with representative or unique serotypes could be further selected for virus isolations. Recently, WHO has officially recommended the VP1-CODEHOP test for enterovirus surveillance [
