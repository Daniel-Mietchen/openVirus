<p>Due to cyclic occurrence of EV71 epidemics, enterovirus surveillance in Taiwan and other Asian countries focus on clinical symptoms related to herpangina or neurological complications, which could not detect enteroviruses without causing these two symptoms and may not reflect comprehensive enterovirus circulation. In Taiwan, EV71 is currently the most devastating enterovirus. Due to being lack of EV71 vaccines and drugs, reducing contacts between patients and healthy children become the most important intervention to prevent EV71 infections and neurological complications. At the moment, class suspension for 5–7 days in kindergartens and primary schools based on clinical diagnosis is the current strategy to prevent enterovirus-related severe infections in Taiwan. During 2010–2013, about 4000–6000 classes in Taiwan were temporarily suspended every year in order to preventing enteroviruses epidemics (
