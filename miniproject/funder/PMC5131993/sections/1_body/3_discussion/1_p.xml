<p>Human enteroviruses have more than 100 serotypes which make laboratory diagnosis very challenging. The traditional methods based on VI-IFA are time-consuming and labor-intensive and could not detect novel serotypes before antisera are available. Alternatively, the VP1-CODEHOP test could be more sensitive and time-saving than the VI-IFA for detection and serotyping of human enteroviruses in clinical specimens. In this study, we compared these two diagnostic methods to conduct a 5-year enterovirus surveillance in 431 pediatric outpatients. As expected, detection rate of the VI-IFA was lower than that of the VP1-CODEHOP test (48% vs. 58%). After verification with the serotype-specific serum neutralization tests, we further confirmed high accuracy of the VP1-CODEHOP test, which is consistent with a previous study with a small sample size [

The previous study is a pilot study and included 110 cases for comparing two molecular methods (5'-UTR and VP1-CODEHOP) and the traditional method (virus isolation). The pilot study found that the VP1-CODEHOP is more suitable for detection and serotyping of enterovirus surveillance than the 5'-UTR. Therefore, the current study selected the VP1-CODEHOP for 5-year enterovirus surveillance (431 cases) and further conducted phylogenetic analysis of 6 prevalent enteroviruses to understand enterovirus evolution in Taiwan. Overall, the current study provides significant advances over the previous study.
