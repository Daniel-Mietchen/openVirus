<p>Surprisingly, only sporadic enterovirus-related severe cases were detected in 2010 and 2013 but over 5000 classes were suspended in these two individual years. Class suspension for 5â€“7 days could cause a lot of disturbances to a family as well as indirect burdens to a society. As shown in this study, the VP1-CODEHOP test could be employed to judge the necessity and duration of class suspensions. Currently, the VP1-CODEHOP test could be completed using the regular molecular equipment and its material costs are less than $20 USD per test. Comparing with the direct and indirect expenses due to unnecessary class suspensions every year, it could be cost-effective to establish the VP1-CODEHOP platform for decision-making of class suspensions in Taiwan [
