<p>Human enteroviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses in the Picornaviridae family and have been classified into four species including over 100 serotypes. With the exceptions of polioviruses, enterovirus 71 (EV71) and some Coxsackievirus group B, neurological complications due to other enteroviruses are relatively infrequent [

Since then, three national enterovirus surveillance platforms have been gradually established by Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC), including (1) a sentinel physician network to collect weekly number of HFMD and herpangina, which was recently replaced by the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance through the National Health Insurance Database [
