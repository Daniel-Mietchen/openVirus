<p>The traditional methods for detection and serotyping of enterovirus infections are virus isolation and immunofluorescence assay (VI-IFA), which are labor-intensive and time-consuming but are widely used in enterovirus surveillance system in Taiwan and other countries. In addition, the VI-IFA test requires 7–14 days to complete detection and serotyping and cannot provide rapid laboratory diagnosis to support decision-making for controlling EV71-related outbreaks. Therefore, many local governments in Taiwan have set up enterovirus-related class-suspension policies based on clinical diagnosis to control enterovirus epidemics in day care centers, kindergartens, and elementary schools since 2005. For example, Taipei City government has established the following three scenarios for class suspension: 1) More than one student are clinically diagnosed with HFMD or herpangina by physicians within one week, the corresponding class will be suspended immediately; 2) After the first EV71-related severe case is detected in Taipei City, classes with one EV71 confirmed case will be suspended immediately; and 3) when an enterovirus-related cluster occurs in a school, classes with any HFMD and herpangina case in the same school will be suspended. The class-suspension policy relying on clinical diagnosis but not laboratory diagnosis could lead to unnecessary class suspension and cause indirect social burden. Therefore, it is desirable to develop rapid laboratory diagnosis for class suspension and case management in the enterovirus surveillance system. Previous studies have documented that molecular diagnosis based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is more time-saving and sensitive than the VI-IFA for detection of EV71 infections in inpatients [

Besides, a novel molecular method using the consensus degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primer (CODEHOP) has been developed to detect and identify distant-related pathogens with limited primers instead of a large number of primers. Moreover, CODEHOP can amplify genes with high variations instead of conserved regions to provide a better ability for identifying serotypes than traditional degenerate primers [

Therefore, the enterovirus VP1 gene has been targeted to develop a CODEHOP-based reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR (VP1-CODEHOP) for serotyping of enterovirus clinical isolates. Recently, accuracy of the VP1-CODEHOP test was further confirmed to be higher than that of the 5'-UTR RT-PCR and VI-IFA for detection and serotyping of enterovirus infections using throat swabs collected from pediatric outpatients [
