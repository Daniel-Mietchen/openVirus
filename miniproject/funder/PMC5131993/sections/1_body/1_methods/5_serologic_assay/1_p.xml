<p>Serum neutralizing antibody test has been widely used for diagnosis of enterovirus serotypes but it is not suitable for early diagnosis of enterovirus infections due to requirement of collecting paired sera and complexity of preparing virus stocks. Therefore, we only used serum neutralizing antibody test to verify serotypes of enterovirus infections when the VI-IFA and VP1-CODEHOP tests had discordant results. Enteroviruses used for serum neutralization tests include EV71, Coxsackievirus A2, A4, A5, A6, A9, A10, and A16. Laboratory methods for measuring serum neutralizing antibody titers followed standard protocols as described in detail previously [
