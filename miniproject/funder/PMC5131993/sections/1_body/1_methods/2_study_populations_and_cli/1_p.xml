 <xref rid="pone.0167532.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the cohort study, throat swabs were obtained from these participating children for virus isolation if the participating children developed suspected enterovirus-like illnesses (HFMD and herpangina). Occasionally, pediatricians also collected throat swabs from the participating children who developed non-specific febrile illness for virus isolation during enterovirus seasons. Sera were obtained from participating children of the study cohort in the following schedule: neonates at birth (cord blood), and children at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months of age. From 2008 to 2012, 431 cases provided throat swabs and 346 of them also provided paired sera samples collected before and after disease onset.
