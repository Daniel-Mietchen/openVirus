<p>Viral RNA was extracted from the clinical specimens using a QIAamp Mini Viral RNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany). EV VP1 gene (350â€“400 bp) was amplified as described in detail previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0167532.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0167532.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The amplified DNA was sequenced using the ABI 3730 XL DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystem Inc., Foster City, CA). Nucleotide sequences of the partial VP1 gene were analyzed using the BLAST search in the GenBank database to find the enterovirus serotype with the highest identity. Alignment of the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic analysis were conducted as described in detail previously [

 <xref rid="pone.0167532.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nucleotide sequences analyzed in this study have been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers KM816412-KM816579).
