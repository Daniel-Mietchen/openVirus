<p>Clinical specimens were inoculated onto four commercial cell lines (Hep2, MK2, MRC-5, and RD) obtained from ATCC (Manassas, Virginia, USA. Inoculated cells with cytopathic effects were harvested for IFA using a panel of antibodies which can detect multiple human viruses (respiratory syncytia virus, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, cytomegalovirus, and enterovirus).

The type-specific monoclonal antibodies covered 23 serotypes as described in detail previously [
