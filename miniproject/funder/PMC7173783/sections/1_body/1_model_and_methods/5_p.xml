<p>We define a set of agents (or individuals), each of whom can be in one of four states that correspond to the epidemiological SEIR model: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R). Since it is known from data for the pathogenesis of the influenza virus that there is an incubation period corresponding to the non-contagious, exposed state [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we use the SEIR model. The system evolves in time according to probabilistic rules with agents making transitions between states with rate parameters chosen to reflect the known features of influenza A dynamics. The primary quantity of interest is the number of infected agents as a function of time, both in individual samples, as well as the trends in the mean calculated over an ensemble of simulations. These depend on the epidemiological parameters enumerated above, as well as the population structure of the model. Individual sample dynamics correspond to data over a season in a region and display fluctuations with potentially important public health consequences.
