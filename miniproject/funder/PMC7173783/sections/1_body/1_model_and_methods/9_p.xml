<p>This style of hierarchical population structure has previously been observed across different regions and has been utilized in several modeling studies; observations of networks with densely connected cohorts and weak inter-cohort connections arose in STD studies in which individual agents either travel between cities or are separated socially from each other [

 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Combining modeling and real survey data for the study of influenza, Longini et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] utilized a hierarchical population to model influenza spread through close groups (families, schools, workplaces) and casual groups (markets and shops). The strength of connection between these groups was reduced as a function of geographical distance according to a study conducted in the region modeled. While a model in which the agents may move between cohorts, Watts et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also define a many tiered population structure in which recurrent influenza infections are shown to occur. The closely connected contexts in their model are roughly the same size as clusters within our cohorts. This style of structure was also used to model SARS spread in Hong Kong by Riley et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. There, the hierarchical structure once again arose from modeling spatial distance between weakly interacting groups. While different forms of the contact matrix have been used, the values of the elements are not known. The structure of
