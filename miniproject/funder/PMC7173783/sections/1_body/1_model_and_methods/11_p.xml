<p>These distributions depend on fine-grained details of immunology and virology that are currently unknown; the study of immunogenicity of vaccines is rudimentary [

One can justify this formally as follows: if one adopts the principle of maximum entropy, in the absence of information (other than the interval of variation), the distribution with the largest entropy should be chosen as the least-informative default. The uniform distribution is the maximum entropy distribution among all continuous distributions defined on a finite line.
