<p>The terms in the second equation describe, for example, the susceptible fraction in cohort 2 decreasing at a rate 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>21</sub> because susceptible agents become exposed due to contact with the infectious fraction 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> in cohort 1, and also decreasing due to transmission within cohort 2 at a rate 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>22</sub>. There is a corresponding increase in the exposed fraction in cohort 2. The exposed fraction in a cohort turns over to the infectious fraction at a rate 
 <italic>σ</italic>; the infectious fraction recovers at a rate 
 <italic>ν</italic> and has no further effect on the dynamics.
