<p>The code to simulate the model was written in C++, with data analysis performed in C++, 
 <italic>Mathematica 11.3</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and R, and visualization using gnuplot and R. During the analysis, it was necessary to find peaks in individual time series data. For this, a duplicate time series was created and smoothed using Wiener filtering [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. This smoothing was necessary due to the natural stochasticity of individual runs of the model. This smoothed time series was then analyzed using FindPeaks in 
 <italic>Mathematica 11.3</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The peaks were then mapped back to the original time series and checked for accuracy.
