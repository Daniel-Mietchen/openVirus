<p>Each infectious agent 
 <italic>j</italic> is characterized by a parameter, 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sub>, which represents the infectivity of the individual 
 <italic>j</italic> in the infectious state. It is clearly insufficient to characterize infectivity by a a single parameter since it encompasses the relative rate of viral shedding, personal hygiene, and many other parameters that vary from individual to individual and can be expected to be multi-dimensional. Each agentsâ€™ infectivity is drawn from a uniform distribution in the interests of parsimony and the lack of data characterizing variation in individual infectivities. Further, the distributions for 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>j</italic>
 </sub> realistically vary with time, a complication that is ignored in our model. Information on the variation of the infectivity in time and the differences between individuals is not available. We can interpret the constant value assumed in the model as the time-averaged value and the individual variations as being encapsulated in the uniform distribution. This is consistent with our overall goal of parsing the effect of the variations of a few parameters on the behavior of a relatively simple model. Isolating the effects of specific dynamical behaviors will be computationally prohibitive if the number of parameters is increased.
