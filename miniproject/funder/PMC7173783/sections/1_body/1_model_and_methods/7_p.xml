<p>Simulations are initialized with 
 <italic>N</italic> agents, placed into 
 <italic>M</italic> cohorts. Connections between agents are organized into a matrix, 
 <italic>C</italic>, termed the contact matrix, whose elements 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>ij</italic>
 </sub> describe the strength of the infectious contact between agent 
 <italic>i</italic> and agent 
 <italic>j</italic> when one of them is infectious and the other susceptible. First, connections within cohorts are specified. Each agent in a cohort is connected to 
 <italic>k</italic> other random agents within their cohort. In graph-theoretic terminology, each agent is a vertex with degree 
 <italic>k</italic> in the connection graph.
