<p>Guo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] combine a heterogeneous graph modeling approach to build a social network for a specific region (Forsythe County, North Carolina) with an Agent-Based Model and found good agreement with clinical data. Fox et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] use a stochastic model to argue that seasonal flu leaves a short refractory period of heterosubtypic immunity which impedes the emergence of novel flu viruses and used it explain the seasonality of the emergence of pandemic viruses. Computationally efficient implementations of household models have been described by Ross et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], while Roche et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] develop and validate an Individual-Based Model (IBM) and address the ecology, epidemiology, and evolution of influenza A viruses. Longini et al. studied a stochastic influenza simulation model for rural Southeast Asia and determined the effectiveness of targeted antiviral strategies for containing an emerging influenza strain at the source as a function of the input reproduction ratio [
