<p>Infectious diseases have been and continue to be a major public-health problem [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] affecting the quality of life and reducing life expectancy of human populations with attendant negative, socio-economic effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The emergence of new diseases and the re-emergence of mutant strains have added to their enormous negative impact. The control of influenza A virus, a major international health concern [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] poses a scientific challenge at many levels. According to the CDC, on average, about 8% of the U.S. population falls ill from flu each season, with a range of between 3% and 11%, depending on the season [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The problem of influenza spread and proliferation spans length scales from the sub-cellular to the national and time scales from seconds to decades. There are many virus strains that display different pathogenic behaviors and elicit different immune responses at the sub-cellular and cellular scales [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]: the outcome of the infection is determined by the spatio-temporal dynamics of the competition between the propensity of the virus to spread, the host response to eliminate the pathogen, and their mutual antagonism.
