<p>There is a long history of mathematical modeling of infectious diseases starting from the work of Daniel Bernoulli in the eighteenth century studying the efficacy of small pox vaccination of healthy people. Many pioneering deterministic studies were carried out in the early years of the twentieth century, for example, by Ross and co-coworkers, and Lotka, especially on malaria. A significant milestone was the work of Kermack and McKendrick [

Our paper reports results of numerical simulations of a stochastic agent-based model of the spread of influenza A over the course of a season and an analysis of the behavior of the model as population size, interconnectivity and immune strength are varied.
