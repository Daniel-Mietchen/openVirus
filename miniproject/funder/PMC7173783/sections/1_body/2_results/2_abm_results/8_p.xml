<p>We present results for this set of parameters for which features such as peaks are better delineated so that their characteristics can be studied. When the parameters are varied over larger ranges, features such as the location of the peaks, their width and amplitude will be smeared out even in the case of weak immune strength. In the supplementary information, individual runs are given for several different sets of parameter variations which show how qualitative features of the peaks in the infected number time series change according to various ABM parameter choices.</p>
