<p>For the weak immune case (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g003">Fig 3</xref>), while the peaks are well-defined recurrences, their numbers and their positions appear random as can be seen even in the few runs. The statistics of the distribution of these peaks is presented later. In contrast, for the case in which the population possesses a strong immune profile, the secondary peaks are not well-defined. In fact, the time course of individual runs are characterized by strong short-time fluctuations that wash out the peaks. The short-time fluctuations are, however, much larger in the strong immune case compared to the weak immune case (compare individual runs in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g004">4</xref>). This can be ascribed to the intra-cohort dynamics being dominated by rare events as we explain now.
