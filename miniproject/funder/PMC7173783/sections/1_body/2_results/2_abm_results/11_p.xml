<p>The distribution of first peak times in the weak immune case is narrowly peaked around 12 days, consistent with the few sample runs shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g003">Fig 3</xref>. On the other hand, it is much broader in the strong immune case. The introduction of a stronger immune response forces the infection to spread through relatively rare events as discussed earlier. We have monitored the probability for susceptible agents to be infected and become exposed, 
 <italic>P</italic>(
 <italic>S</italic> → 
 <italic>E</italic>); for the strong immune case, the values center around 
 <italic>P</italic> ∼ 10
 <sup>−3</sup>. This means that infection spread is unlikely, even on the scale of the entire cohort. This manifests itself in the width of the distribution of first peak times, since each run will be driven mostly by statistically uncommon infections.
