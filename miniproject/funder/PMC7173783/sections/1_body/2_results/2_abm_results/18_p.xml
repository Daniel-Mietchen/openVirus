<p>We discuss the behavior of the reproductive number as a function of time in the ABM and compare it with the result for the ODE model. We define the (instantaneous) reproductive number as the number of susceptible agents that an infectious individual infects during the time before recovery averaged over the sample. We have evaluated the reproductive number as a function of time in the ABM as follows: we count the change in the number of infectious people from one day to the next. We divide this number by the original number of infectious people from the previous day. This is an attempt to imitate the reproduction number one would calculate from field data, in which only the people who are visibly symptomatic are likely to report to a hospital. We relate our calculated quantity to the reproduction number simply as
