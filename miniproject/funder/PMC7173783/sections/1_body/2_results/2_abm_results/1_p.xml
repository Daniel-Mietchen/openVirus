<p>We discuss the results of numerical simulations of the agent-based model described in the Model section. Despite the many drastic simplifications made in representing the details of the complex processes that occur on many different length and time scales, simulations of the model lead to insights into the dynamics of the spread of infection. The primary quantity of interest is the time evolution of the number of infected agents (the sum of the number of exposed and infectious agents at a given time) given a small number of initially exposed individuals (0.5%) in the first cohort. The ODE model results presented above demonstrates that in a deterministic system, we can find recurrent behavior; here, we study the stochastic behavior in the discrete ABM with a finite number of agents, a limited number of contacts, and probabilistic time evolution.</p>
