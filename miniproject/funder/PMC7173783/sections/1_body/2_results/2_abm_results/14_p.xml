<p>By increasing the number of inter-cohort connections, (from 2% of the cohort to 10%), in the right side of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g006">Fig 6</xref>, we see that the distribution of second cohort infection times both shifts earlier in time, as well as narrows substantially. This is consistent with the left panel of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g005">Fig 5</xref>, as the mean timing of the second cohortâ€™s first infection is coincident with the timing of the mean first peak occurrence. The rapid infection spread statistically reaches both more agents which have connections to the second cohort, as well as reaches them sooner after initial infection. This underlines the importance of the separated nature of the contact structure for discernable peaks in the infected number; one important driver of well-separated peaks is the stochasticity inherent in spread between weakly connected subpopulations.
