<p>We display the time course of the number of infected agents–on the average in the inset and for a few randomly chosen runs in the main body– for the weak and strong cases in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g004">4</xref>, respectively. The average value shows only a single peak in the case of strong immunity, and an additional shoulder in the weak immune strength case, which is very similar to the behavior displayed by the ODE model (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the individual sample runs can show well-defined peaks in the weak immune strength case as is evident from the figure. The value of the infection number at the peaks are much higher, as would be expected, in the weak immune (low or no vaccination) case.
