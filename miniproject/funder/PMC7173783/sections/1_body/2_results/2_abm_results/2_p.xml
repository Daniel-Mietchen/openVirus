<p>We investigate the model with 
 <italic>N</italic> = 6000 agents divided into 
 <italic>M</italic> = 4 cohorts. While we present selected results for other values of 
 <italic>N</italic>, the number of agents was chosen so that an exploration of different parameters can be done expeditiously. Each agent has an intra-cohort, out-degree of 16, i.e., is connected to 16 randomly chosen agents inside the cohort. This out-degree value is consistent with various other population models [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] which find the degree of connection tends to vary between 6 and 20, depending on the method of data analysis. Inter-cohort connections are chosen as follows: 25 agents in a cohort (2% of the cohort size) are randomly chosen to have one connection to an agent in the next cohort. The number of inter-cohort connections is varied in the simulations to examine the dependence of the behavior of the model on this number, and the results are displayed later in the section.
