<p>When only the first cohort is exposed initially, we find two peaks in the total infected fraction as a function of time as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g002">Fig 2</xref>. We have normalized the fractions so that the total in each cohort is unity. In contrast, in the usual single cohort SEIR model with a small initial infection, there is only one peak in the infected number as a function of time.
