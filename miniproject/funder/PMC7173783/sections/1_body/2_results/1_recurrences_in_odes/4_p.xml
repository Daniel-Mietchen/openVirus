<p>As the separation of the infection time scales is reduced by increasing

 <sub>12</sub>, the time difference between the two peak positions decreases and eventually, the peaks merge into just one peak. We note that introducing a time delay in the SIR model so that while the susceptible population fraction decreased instantaneously upon infection at time 
 <italic>t</italic>, the infected numbers increase only after a delay 
 <italic>τ</italic>, corresponding to the time when they are in the exposed state, leads to two peaks. See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. This is consistent with the fact that sufficient time delays can induce oscillatory behavior in ordinary differential equations [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We note that the agent-based models incorporate such time delays in their definition, for example, corresponding to the time during which an individual is exposed but not infected.
