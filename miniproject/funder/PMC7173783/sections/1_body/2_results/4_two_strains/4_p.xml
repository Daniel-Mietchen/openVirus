<p>We investigated two cases: one with 80% inoculation rate and the other with 50% rate. We used a model with four cohorts, and a total population of 
 <italic>N</italic> = 6000. The key results for the mean number of infections of the two strains as a function of time in are presented in the two panels in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g012">Fig 12</xref>. The average was taken over 10,000 runs. Individual runs for these two are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s009">S9 Fig</xref>. In both cases, there is a first peak that corresponds to the initial infection due to the pandemic strain. The vaccine effectiveness over the years has ranged between 20% to 60%. We assumed that 80% or 50% of agents were inoculated, but were still susceptible to the pandemic virus, leading to the first peak. 50% inoculation is roughly equivalent to the true immunization rate in the United States as reported by the CDC [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We note that even though fewer agents are infected with the pandemic strain with higher inoculation, rare events can cause small recurrences at late times due to the larger pool of susceptibles.
