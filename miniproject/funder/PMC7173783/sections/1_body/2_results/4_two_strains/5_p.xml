<p>The second strain was introduced after 30 days, roughly corresponding to the data from Columbus, Ohio from the 2018-2019 flu season [
 <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We find a result that might be surprising at first sight: the number of infected cases of the seasonal strain is higher when the inoculation rate is higher for the pandemic virus. If one considers the protection afforded by being infected by the pandemic virus and the model population structure (specifically, the contact matrix that allows only few, weaker links between the cohorts) the result can be understood. If the small number of agents that provide connectivity between cohorts are infected by the first virus (more likely with the lower inoculation rate), then they cannot be infected by the seasonal virus. This reduces the probability of transmission to the succeeding cohorts and thus limits the number of seasonal infections. Once again, we chose parameters to make peaks clearly visible in order to study these effects. We note also the increase in stochasticity of the occurrence of the seasonal infection seen in the curves in the lower right panel of 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s009">S9 Fig</xref>; this is a result of the rare events that control the inter-cohort spread due to the weak connections between cohorts. We emphasize, however, that we have pointed out a possible mechanism that can yield an increase the infection number for the second strain when vaccination rate for the first strain is increased.
