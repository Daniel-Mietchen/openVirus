<p>These investigations enable us to identify quantitatively the parameter variations that affect the recurrences that are seen in the base model for which the results are displayed in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g003">3</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g007">7</xref>. In the limit that the inter-cohort and intra-cohort transmission rates become comparable, we obtain a single large infection peak as in the one cohort SEIR model. As the population is fragmented into well-separated segments, we obtain well-defined recurrence peaks corresponding to infection spreading into the successive cohorts.
