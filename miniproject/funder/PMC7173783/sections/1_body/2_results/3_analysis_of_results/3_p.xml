<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g009">Fig 9</xref>, we show the mean number of infected (the sum of exposed and infectious) agents as a function of time, averaged over 10,000 samples, for 
 <italic>N</italic> varying from 1000 to 8000 for the model with a weak immune profile. An important feature of the plots is the stochastic instability at smaller values of 
 <italic>N</italic>. Sample runs which contributed to these means are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s007">S7 Fig</xref>. We see the peak caused by the initial infection, and a shoulder that becomes progressively better defined as we increase 
 <italic>N</italic>, becoming a discernible second peak at 
 <italic>N</italic> = 8000. For lower values of 
 <italic>N</italic>, the number of infectious people can easily fluctuate down to 0, prematurely ending the simulation on that sample. This can be seen in the Supplementary Figure. With the introduction of larger numbers of agents, a stochastic fluctuation is less likely to collapse the run, leading to more opportunities for spread, and thus a recurrence of infection.
