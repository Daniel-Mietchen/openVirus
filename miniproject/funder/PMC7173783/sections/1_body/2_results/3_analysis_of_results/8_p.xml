<p>Nevertheless, since the inter-cohort transmission rate is less than the intra-cohort transmission rate, though not substantially so in these simulations, we see remnants of the recurrences within the one well-defined peak. While increasing the inter-cohort connectivity (out-degree), were we to re-scale (decrease) the connection strength correspondingly, we recover well-defined recurrences as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s005">S5 Fig</xref>. The rescaling of the contact matrix element keeps the average strength of the connection between cohorts the same and similar behavior ensues.
