  <title>Mean number of infected (the sum of exposed and infectious) people as a function of time as the degree of inter-cohort connections is increased.</title>
  <p>The connection degree determines how many agents are connected to one of 25 randomly chosen agents in the preceding cohort. The black dots represent the ensemble mean, taken over 10,000 runs, while the blue lines represent the standard deviations. Individual runs which contributed to these averages are shown in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s008">S8 Fig</xref>. For a connection degree of 1, it is clear that a recurrence is present on average, as there are two peaks in the mean number which are clearly separated. As the number of connections drawn from an agent in the first cohort to the second are increased, we are increasing the strength of the coupling between the cohorts, as well as decreasing the average node-to-node distance between agents in different cohorts. Thus, as the connection degree is increased, we recover the single-cohort SIR-like infection curve in which there is one large period of infection.
