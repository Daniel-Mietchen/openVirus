  <p>Individual sample runs are shown along with the mean infected number, averaged over 10,000 runs, in the inset. This level of immunity leads to time scales for the rate of infection transmission between individuals comparable to or faster to the time duration before which an infectious individual recovers. However, the inter-cohort spread, through the weak, intermediate connections, is slow and the position of the peaks in the succeeding cohorts successively connected varies from run to run. The statistics of where the first peak occurs and the time interval between the first and second peaks are shown in Figs
