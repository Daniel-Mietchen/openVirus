  <p>We see that as 
   <italic>N</italic> increases, the mean length of the run increases. At 
   <italic>N</italic> = 1000, samples undergo stochastic extinction. At 
   <italic>N</italic> = 2000, the extinction occurs after a long tail with some runs exhibiting a small recurrence. At 
   <italic>N</italic> = 4000 and above, the recurrences are stable.
