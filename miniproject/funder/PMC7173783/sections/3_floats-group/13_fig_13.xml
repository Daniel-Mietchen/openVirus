  <title>Histograms of the maximum number (defined as the highest number at a given time over the entire season) of infected people with either the seasonal or pandemic strain of influenza in a season.</title>
  <p>In the left figure, half of the population has been inoculated against the pandemic strain, whereas in the right figure, 80% of the population has been inoculated. We see a natural reduction in the number of pandemic cases, but also a rightward shift in the number of seasonal cases, indicating that a higher level of immunization to the pandemic strain increases the susceptibility of the population at large to the seasonal strain.</p>
