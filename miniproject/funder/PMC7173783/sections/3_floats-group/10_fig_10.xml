  <title>Infectious number as a function of time in several sample runs for varying degrees of inner-cohort connectivity.</title>
  <p>Different colors indicate individual samples trajectories in time which are started with the same initial condition of 30 infected individuals in the first cohort of 4 in a total population of 6000. The significant change is in the time interval between recurrence peaks as explained in the text.</p>
