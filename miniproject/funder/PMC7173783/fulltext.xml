Building on an early work of Bartlett, we define a model with a limited number of parameters and rates that have clear epidemiological interpretation and can be constrained by data. We demonstrate the occurrence of recurrent behavior in the infected number [more than one peak in a season], which is observed in data, in our simulations for populations consisting of cohorts with strong intra- and weak inter-cohort transmissibility. We examine the dependence of the results on epidemiological and population characteristics by investigating their dependence on a range of parameter values. Finally, we study infection with two strains of influenza, inspired by observations, and show a counter-intuitive result for the effect of inoculation against the strain that leads to the first wave of infection.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 AI117873</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>J.W. and C.J. were supported by PRIME (Program for Research on Immune Modeling and 532 Experimentation), an NIAID-funded Modeling Immunity for Biodefense Center (Grant 533 U19 AI117873).

The emergence of new diseases and the re-emergence of mutant strains have added to their enormous negative impact. The control of influenza A virus, a major international health concern [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] poses a scientific challenge at many levels. According to the CDC, on average, about 8% of the U.S. population falls ill from flu each season, with a range of between 3% and 11%, depending on the season [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The problem of influenza spread and proliferation spans length scales from the sub-cellular to the national and time scales from seconds to decades. There are many virus strains that display different pathogenic behaviors and elicit different immune responses at the sub-cellular and cellular scales [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]: the outcome of the infection is determined by the spatio-temporal dynamics of the competition between the propensity of the virus to spread, the host response to eliminate the pathogen, and their mutual antagonism.</p><p>There is a long history of mathematical modeling of infectious diseases starting from the work of Daniel Bernoulli in the eighteenth century studying the efficacy of small pox vaccination of healthy people. Many pioneering deterministic studies were carried out in the early years of the twentieth century, for example, by Ross and co-coworkers, and Lotka, especially on malaria. A significant milestone was the work of Kermack and McKendrick [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] who made a comprehensive study showing the existence of a threshold population size below which an outbreak does not occur. Several books and reviews provide a comprehensive introduction to recent work [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Our paper reports results of numerical simulations of a stochastic agent-based model of the spread of influenza A over the course of a season and an analysis of the behavior of the model as population size, interconnectivity and immune strength are varied.</p><p>Numerous works have appeared on how agent-based models and stochastic models have been applied to infectious diseases and their implications for health [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A simple version of the original mathematical model developed by Kermack and McKendrick known as the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model has been used extensively and forms the basis of many investigations, including ours. Stochastic modeling was subsequently initiated by the pioneering work of Bartlett [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Bailey [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and others. Rvachev conducted one of the earliest studies of spatial-temporal model of influenza and applied it to spread in the Soviet Union [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There are many models that have used stochastic simulation methods applied to metapopulation models and agent-based models to investigate the epidemiology of influenza and other infectious diseases. Watts et al. [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] introduce and study a class of meta-population models with a hierarchy of successively larger domains with mixing, finding behavior with qualitative agreement with features extracted from data. Epidemic processes have been studied in a metapopulation approach with different flows based on coarse-grained empirical data in the air transportation network [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For example, the impact of different strategies of intervention, random vs. targeted, on the spread of epidemics in a population, separated into subgroups in spatially discrete patches connected by migration pathways have been studied [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Guo et al. [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] combine a heterogeneous graph modeling approach to build a social network for a specific region (Forsythe County, North Carolina) with an Agent-Based Model and found good agreement with clinical data. Fox et al. [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] use a stochastic model to argue that seasonal flu leaves a short refractory period of heterosubtypic immunity which impedes the emergence of novel flu viruses and used it explain the seasonality of the emergence of pandemic viruses. Computationally efficient implementations of household models have been described by Ross et al. [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], while Roche et al. [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] develop and validate an Individual-Based Model (IBM) and address the ecology, epidemiology, and evolution of influenza A viruses. Longini et al. studied a stochastic influenza simulation model for rural Southeast Asia and determined the effectiveness of targeted antiviral strategies for containing an emerging influenza strain at the source as a function of the input reproduction ratio [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It is known from these and other studies that the network structure of contacts determines the spreading of infection.</p><p>The data reported by the CDC show that the number of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) measured by hospitalizations or outpatient visits can show more than one peak within a season in some years at the national [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], regional [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and city [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] levels. There can be multiple reasons for such recurrences in the data. In this paper, we define and study a simple agent-based epidemiological model, with probabilistic dynamical rules, with the goal of describing a mechanism that can lead to recurrences within a flu season; we investigate how varying the topology of the network structure of contacts known to determine the spread of infection (see above) affects the occurrence of recurrences. We analyze, inter alia, the sample-to-sample variability due to stochastic fluctuations and their statistical properties. The antecedents of our model lie in the early work of Bartlett who used ordinary differential equations and numerical simulations to show that recurrences can occur in measles epidemics on the scale of years when immigration is included in the model. Emphasis is on the behavior of the spread of influenza infection during the course of one flu season, and we show that recurrences that are seen in the data can occur in the simulations for certain network structures of contacts and values of rate constants.</p><p>We study the model in cases where the randomly occurring recurrences are well-defined to investigate their statistical properties. We use these results to study distributions of times at which the first peak occurs and the time intervals between the first and second peaks that underlines the highly stochastic behavior of the model. As reported by the CDC, as well as the city of Columbus, Ohio [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the 2018&#x02013;19 influenza season had two waves of influenza A activity of similar magnitude: A(H1N1), a pandemic strain first, followed by a seasonal virus A(H3N2). Motivated by this observation, we have used our model to study two strains of infection, seasonal and pandemic, with a vaccine effective only for the pandemic, and show that the intensity of the second wave of seasonal infection can be lower with lower inoculation rate for the pandemic virus.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the Model and Methods section, we describe our model based on the SEIR paradigm with a number of agents that are divided into cohorts with strong transmissibility within, and weak connections between successive cohorts. The assumptions made that render the model parsimonious and tractable, yet describe behavior of interest, are specified. In the Results section, we first report the results of an ODE model of two groups or cohorts for weak coupling between the groups that provides a point of comparison for the ABM simulations. We present simulation results for the spread of infection: the dynamics of the infected number, reproduction number, and features of probability distributions that characterize the stochastic behavior and how these vary with the number of inter-cohort connections and strengths. Results obtained from our model for the case of a two-strain infection are then discussed. Our results and conclusions are summarized briefly in the Conclusions. Supplementary material provides more detailed support for various statements in the main text.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Model and methods</title><p>In early, seminal work in the context of measles epidemics, Bartlett showed the existence of a critical population size below which the infection dies off and the occurrence of recurrent behavior if there is immigration providing a supply of susceptible individuals [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. He argues this by examining the Hamer-Soper model [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a model with <italic>s</italic> susceptible agents and <italic>i</italic> infectious agents, which evolves stochastically in time. Three possible &#x0201c;transitions&#x0201d; can occur per unit time with specified rates: infection, defined by <italic>s</italic> &#x02192; <italic>s</italic> &#x02212; 1 and <italic>i</italic> &#x02192; <italic>i</italic> + 1 at a rate &#x003bb; <italic>is</italic>, recovery, defined by infectious agents recovering <italic>i</italic> &#x02192; <italic>i</italic> &#x02212; 1 and becoming permanently immune at a rate <italic>&#x003bc;i</italic>, and immigration, in which the susceptible agents <italic>s</italic> &#x02192; <italic>s</italic> + 1 at a rate <italic>&#x003f5;</italic>. The first two correspond to the transitions in the SIR model and as we discuss below, the population structure of our model mimics an immigration-like term.</p><p>Bartlett [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] studied the stochastic differential equations that describe these transitions and derived the deterministic approximation that gives rise to the standard equations.

We seek to explain recurrences (peaks in the reported infection numbers) on a very different time scale, within one flu season (30 weeks compared to the interval of 70 weeks or more for measles [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]) and study the agent-based model described in detail below. The population structure of the model consists of two or more cohorts that are strongly connected within, but with weak transmission (slower time scales) between cohorts. If only the first cohort is infected initially, the slow spread of infection to the second cohort effectively introduces additional susceptible individuals. This basic feature underlies our agent-based model that displays recurrent behavior of infected number with substantial stochasticity.</p><p>We present the details of our stochastic agent-based (individual-based) model that allows us to investigate the behavior of the dynamics of infection in a population as a function of the virulence of the infection, level of inoculation, details of the contact between individuals, and number of virus strains.</p><p>We define a set of agents (or individuals), each of whom can be in one of four states that correspond to the epidemiological SEIR model: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R). Since it is known from data for the pathogenesis of the influenza virus that there is an incubation period corresponding to the non-contagious, exposed state [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we use the SEIR model. The system evolves in time according to probabilistic rules with agents making transitions between states with rate parameters chosen to reflect the known features of influenza A dynamics. The primary quantity of interest is the number of infected agents as a function of time, both in individual samples, as well as the trends in the mean calculated over an ensemble of simulations. These depend on the epidemiological parameters enumerated above, as well as the population structure of the model. Individual sample dynamics correspond to data over a season in a region and display fluctuations with potentially important public health consequences.</p><p>The time evolution is assumed to occur in discrete time, with a time step of 1 day, which is appropriate for describing influenza infection in a group of individuals in a single season. We simulate for a time of one season: influenza strains mutate on the time scale of a year [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], particular influenza strains tend to dominate in each season, and which strain is a threat varies from year to year. Due to the difficulty in modeling the antigenic drifts on longer time scales, as well as the coarse-grained description of the infection in our model, we limit our simulations to a single season. In addition, it is common for municipalities to collect data on influenza infections for this time period, as is the case for our location. We choose the time step to be one day because available immunological data which details the course of influenza infection for individuals is on the scale of days to weeks [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. One day is also roughly the time scale on which a person would be able to characterize their personal immunological state, and is thus a reasonable time unit.</p><p>Simulations are initialized with <italic>N</italic> agents, placed into <italic>M</italic> cohorts. Connections between agents are organized into a matrix, <italic>C</italic>, termed the contact matrix, whose elements <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> describe the strength of the infectious contact between agent <italic>i</italic> and agent <italic>j</italic> when one of them is infectious and the other susceptible. First, connections within cohorts are specified. Each agent in a cohort is connected to <italic>k</italic> other random agents within their cohort. In graph-theoretic terminology, each agent is a vertex with degree <italic>k</italic> in the connection graph.</p><p>Next, connections between successive cohorts (cohort <italic>J</italic> to <italic>J</italic> + 1 for <italic>J</italic> = 1, &#x02026;.<italic>M</italic> &#x02212; 1) are defined as follows. <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>bet</italic></sub> agents are chosen randomly from cohort <italic>J</italic> and each is connected <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>inter</italic></sub> agents in cohort <italic>J</italic> + 1. We used <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>bet</italic></sub> = 25 and <italic>k</italic><sub><italic>intra</italic></sub> = 1. The intra-cohort connections are always given the same value <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub> (for explicit values, see <xref rid="pone.0231521.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The inter-cohort connections are chosen to be weak in comparison, and fewer in number. The inter-cohort connection strength is taken to be <italic>C</italic><sub>0</sub>/10. This structure defines a hierarchical model in which infections generally spread within cohorts, with infections between cohorts happening rarely. This separation leads to model behavior with peaks in the infected number and which is stochastic with respect to individual simulations.

Combining modeling and real survey data for the study of influenza, Longini et al. [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] utilized a hierarchical population to model influenza spread through close groups (families, schools, workplaces) and casual groups (markets and shops). The strength of connection between these groups was reduced as a function of geographical distance according to a study conducted in the region modeled. While a model in which the agents may move between cohorts, Watts et al. [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] also define a many tiered population structure in which recurrent influenza infections are shown to occur. The closely connected contexts in their model are roughly the same size as clusters within our cohorts. This style of structure was also used to model SARS spread in Hong Kong by Riley et al. [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. There, the hierarchical structure once again arose from modeling spatial distance between weakly interacting groups. While different forms of the contact matrix have been used, the values of the elements are not known. The structure of <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> in this work is similar to that in previous models while the details differ. We have examined the dependence of our results on features of the topology, such as the inter-cohort connectivity.</p><p>Now, we describe the rules that govern the transitions of the agents between the states at each time step. At the beginning of the season, every agent is in either of two states. Most are in the susceptible state, and a small fraction are in the exposed state; the latter can be viewed as the initial infection fraction.

We therefore choose a uniform distribution (given evidence for large variations among individuals in the references cited) for both <inline-formula id="pone.0231521.e015"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0231521.e015.jpg" id="pone.0231521.e015g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M15"><mml:mi mathvariant="script">R</mml:mi></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula id="pone.0231521.e016"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0231521.e016.jpg" id="pone.0231521.e016g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M16"><mml:mi mathvariant="script">I</mml:mi></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>. One can justify this formally as follows: if one adopts the principle of maximum entropy, in the absence of information (other than the interval of variation), the distribution with the largest entropy should be chosen as the least-informative default. The uniform distribution is the maximum entropy distribution among all continuous distributions defined on a finite line.</p><p>It is possible to generalize this model substantially by allowing these distributions to vary as a function of time, infectivity, contact with other individuals, and many other possible effects. Our goal is to study how the behavior changes when rates are varied according to biological and epidemiological considerations, and it would be well-nigh impossible computationally to include such effects. Quantitative characterization of the parameters from real data is difficult because of the multiplicity of causes for observed effects.</p><p>Each susceptible agent is characterized by an immune strength that is determined by their immunological profile, whether they are vaccinated or not, and how effective the vaccine is [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We denote this by <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for the <italic>i</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup> agent and the probability per day that a susceptible agent becomes exposed upon contact with an infectious agent decreases with increasing <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>. This provides a simple way of including the effect of immunization in the model; the immune strength of an agent, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>, increases in value, resulting in an increase in the mean time to become exposed by an infectious agent. A fully effective vaccine would extend this mean time well beyond the duration of time that an agent remains infectious, thus insulating the susceptible agent from infection. Different values of the immune strength <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> can be interpreted as being partly due to vaccine efficacy. While it is clearly a drastic simplification to represent the immunological profile by a single number, as more data become available, more detailed characterizations can be used. The value for each agent is chosen from a uniform distribution due to lack of data on individual variation in immunological profile.</p><p>Each infectious agent <italic>j</italic> is characterized by a parameter, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub>, which represents the infectivity of the individual <italic>j</italic> in the infectious state. It is clearly insufficient to characterize infectivity by a a single parameter since it encompasses the relative rate of viral shedding, personal hygiene, and many other parameters that vary from individual to individual and can be expected to be multi-dimensional. Each agents&#x02019; infectivity is drawn from a uniform distribution in the interests of parsimony and the lack of data characterizing variation in individual infectivities. Further, the distributions for <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>j</italic></sub> realistically vary with time, a complication that is ignored in our model. Information on the variation of the infectivity in time and the differences between individuals is not available. We can interpret the constant value assumed in the model as the time-averaged value and the individual variations as being encapsulated in the uniform distribution. This is consistent with our overall goal of parsing the effect of the variations of a few parameters on the behavior of a relatively simple model. Isolating the effects of specific dynamical behaviors will be computationally prohibitive if the number of parameters is increased.</p><p>An exposed agent <italic>i</italic> is simply characterized by the state (E) until they turn infectious at the end of the period <inline-formula id="pone.0231521.e017"><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="pone.0231521.e017.jpg" id="pone.0231521.e017g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/><mml:math id="M17"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="script">I</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, chosen for that individual at the time of exposure from the distribution specified above.

Despite the many drastic simplifications made in representing the details of the complex processes that occur on many different length and time scales, simulations of the model lead to insights into the dynamics of the spread of infection. The primary quantity of interest is the time evolution of the number of infected agents (the sum of the number of exposed and infectious agents at a given time) given a small number of initially exposed individuals (0.5%) in the first cohort. The ODE model results presented above demonstrates that in a deterministic system, we can find recurrent behavior; here, we study the stochastic behavior in the discrete ABM with a finite number of agents, a limited number of contacts, and probabilistic time evolution.</p><p>We investigate the model with <italic>N</italic> = 6000 agents divided into <italic>M</italic> = 4 cohorts. While we present selected results for other values of <italic>N</italic>, the number of agents was chosen so that an exploration of different parameters can be done expeditiously. Each agent has an intra-cohort, out-degree of 16, i.e., is connected to 16 randomly chosen agents inside the cohort. This out-degree value is consistent with various other population models [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0231521.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] which find the degree of connection tends to vary between 6 and 20, depending on the method of data analysis. Inter-cohort connections are chosen as follows: 25 agents in a cohort (2% of the cohort size) are randomly chosen to have one connection to an agent in the next cohort. The number of inter-cohort connections is varied in the simulations to examine the dependence of the behavior of the model on this number, and the results are displayed later in the section.</p><p>As explained in the previous section, a single parameter <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> characterizes an individual&#x02019;s immune profile, consisting of various features: the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the immune system which is enhanced by vaccination. We investigate two cases; one corresponds to a population with a &#x0201c;strong&#x0201d; immune profile that can be viewed as arising from immunization in which <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> is drawn from a uniform distribution of range 2&#x02013;6. The second case is a population with &#x0201c;weak&#x0201d; immune profiles corresponding to no immunization or ineffective vaccines. In this case, the values of <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> range from 0 to 4.

Nevertheless, the individual sample runs can show well-defined peaks in the weak immune strength case as is evident from the figure. The value of the infection number at the peaks are much higher, as would be expected, in the weak immune (low or no vaccination) case.</p><fig id="pone.0231521.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0231521.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>ABM results for the infected (the sum of exposed and infectious) agent number time series, with <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &#x02208; [0, 4], for a population with weak immune strength corresponding to no immunization prior to the onset of the infection.</title><p>Individual sample runs are shown along with the mean infected number, averaged over 10,000 runs, in the inset.

In fact, the time course of individual runs are characterized by strong short-time fluctuations that wash out the peaks. The short-time fluctuations are, however, much larger in the strong immune case compared to the weak immune case (compare individual runs in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g004">4</xref>). This can be ascribed to the intra-cohort dynamics being dominated by rare events as we explain now.</p><p>The immune strength <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of the agents is uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 4] in the weak immune case and [2, 6] in the strong immune case. One consequence of the uniform increase of the immune strength by 2 units in the strong immune profile case is the reduced pool of susceptible agents that can be exposed in the course of the simulation that lasts a season of 200 days. In fact, <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &#x0003c; 0.01 for <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &#x0003e; 4. The stronger immune strength implies a decrease in the probability of a susceptible agent becoming exposed by a factor of roughly 7 (&#x02248;<italic>e</italic><sup>2</sup>). The combination of fewer susceptible agents and lower probability for transitions means that new infections are relatively rare events. Since only a small number of new infectious occurs across the cohort in a short time interval, the fluctuations are large and this makes the peaks poorly defined in individual runs and smooths out the peaks on the average.</p><p>We present results for this set of parameters for which features such as peaks are better delineated so that their characteristics can be studied. When the parameters are varied over larger ranges, features such as the location of the peaks, their width and amplitude will be smeared out even in the case of weak immune strength. In the supplementary information, individual runs are given for several different sets of parameter variations which show how qualitative features of the peaks in the infected number time series change according to various ABM parameter choices.</p><p>We characterize the stochastic behavior of the model by computing probability distributions for different features of the time series for the infected numbers in the weak and strong cases: the distributions of the time at which the first peak occurs, the distribution of time intervals between the first and second peaks that is well-defined for the weak immune case, and the time at which the first susceptible agent in the second cohort becomes exposed.</p><p>We show the distribution of the times at which the first peak occurs for weak and strong immune cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g005">Fig 5a and 5b</xref>. by averaging over 10,000 samples.</p><fig id="pone.0231521.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0231521.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>Distributions of the occurrence time of the first peak in the infected number.</title><p>The results for a weak population immune strength corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g003">Fig 3</xref> on the left, and for a strong population immune strength corresponding to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g004">Fig 4</xref> on the right. For a population with weak immune strength, infection spreads rapidly throughout the initial cohort, leading to a narrow distribution of times for the peak. Rapid spread reduces variance in the timing of the peak due to the finite size of the cohort. Increasing the collective immune strength, as shown on the right, broadens the distribution reflecting the increased time to spread as well as the availability of fewer susceptible agents, leading to many pauses in infection spread throughout the cohort.

On the other hand, it is much broader in the strong immune case. The introduction of a stronger immune response forces the infection to spread through relatively rare events as discussed earlier. We have monitored the probability for susceptible agents to be infected and become exposed, <italic>P</italic>(<italic>S</italic> &#x02192; <italic>E</italic>); for the strong immune case, the values center around <italic>P</italic> &#x0223c; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>. This means that infection spread is unlikely, even on the scale of the entire cohort. This manifests itself in the width of the distribution of first peak times, since each run will be driven mostly by statistically uncommon infections.</p><p>We explore another effect of events with low probability: we focus on the spread of the infection across cohorts; in particular, the time at which the first agent in the second cohort becomes exposed. This is a low-probability event because the number of agents in the second cohort who are connected to agents in the first cohort is small. We calculate the statistics for a situation in which we increase the number of inter-cohort connections for the weak immune case, and examine the first incidence of infection in the second cohort.</p><p>The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g006">Fig 6(a) and 6(b)</xref>.

We see that the distribution of times of first successful infection in the second cohort is very broad, despite the rapid spread through the first cohort. This is due to the relatively small number of weak inter-cohort connections. This bottleneck makes the dynamical behavior stochastic. Spread to the second cohort hinges on the small number of agents in the first cohort with connections to the second becoming infected. Typically, the small number of intra-cohort connections necessitates infection of a large fraction of the cohort before those few agents connected to the next cohort are infected. Since the probability of infection rarely rises above 0.1 for the parameters we have used, the spread is highly stochastic.</p><fig id="pone.0231521.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0231521.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Distributions displaying the occurrence time of the first infection in the second cohort for weak immune strength.</title><p>The figure on the left is for cohorts in which 2% of the agents are connected to the second cohort on the left, and on the right is for cohorts in which 10% of the agents are connected to the second cohort.

The sparsely connected structure displays a very wide distribution of first infection times, despite rapid intra-cohort spread as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g005">Fig 5</xref>. We show that with more inter-cohort connections, the distribution is both shifted earlier in time, as well as substantially narrowed.

This is consistent with the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g005">Fig 5</xref>, as the mean timing of the second cohort&#x02019;s first infection is coincident with the timing of the mean first peak occurrence. The rapid infection spread statistically reaches both more agents which have connections to the second cohort, as well as reaches them sooner after initial infection. This underlines the importance of the separated nature of the contact structure for discernable peaks in the infected number; one important driver of well-separated peaks is the stochasticity inherent in spread between weakly connected subpopulations.</p><p>The distribution of first infection times in the second cohort in the strong immune case with few inter-cohort connections appears as broad as in the weak immune case. While this is surprising, it must be noted that a large fraction of the samples shows no infection in the second cohort within one season due to the low probability of the spread. Were the simulation time to be extended unnaturally, the distribution would be broader than in the weak immune case. Given that the distribution is constrained by the simulation time, we display it in the Supplementary section for completeness. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s006">S6 Fig</xref>.</p><p>Another feature which characterizes the stochastic infection spread is the timing of the second peak of infection.

As stated in the Methods section, peaks were found using FindPeak in <italic>Mathematica 11.3</italic>, after applying a Wiener filter for basic smoothing of the time series.</p><p>Despite limiting the variability of various parameters in cohorts and confining our attention to the stationary distributions for immune strengths and infectivities, there is considerable variation in the time interval between the first and second wave of infection in this model in the weak immune case. The histogram for the time differences is shown for weak immune system cases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g007">Fig 7</xref>, and is broad even though the first peak occurs over a narrow range of times as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g003">Fig 3</xref>.

We divide this number by the original number of infectious people from the previous day.

This is an important consideration both for application to real data, as well as computational considerations. For our analysis, an agent number higher than 8,000 considerably slowed computational speed.

It is computationally prohibitive to perform a large number of samples.</p><p>The number and timing of the recurrence peaks remain random since we have kept the number of inter-cohort connections weak and few in number. This leads naturally to the question of the dependence of the behavior of the model on the inter-cohort and intra-cohort transmission probabilities that we examine next.</p><p>We have discussed the behavior of the model when the out-degree inside the cohort is taken to be 16. When the number of intra-cohort connections is decreased substantially, the spread is slow and stochastic with the possibility of extinction. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g010">Fig 10</xref>, we display sample runs as the number of intra-cohort connections are increased keeping the contact matrix element and other parameters unchanged. We see that at lower values of the connectivity, the peaks are separated on longer time scales and as the connectivity (the out-degree of agents within cohorts) is increased, the peaks occur closer together. The separation of the recurrences in time depends on the rate at which inter-cohort transmission occurs. This depends both on the strength of the inter-cohort connections that we have not changed, but also the speed with which the few (25) agents in one cohort who are directly connected to the next cohort become infectious. This rate depends on the speed with which the infection spreads within an individual cohort, and this time decreases as we increase the intra- (or inner) cohort connectivity.

When each of 25 agents in the first cohort are connected to a single agent in the second (and similarly for the succeeding pairs of cohorts), it is easy to see that there is a bottleneck for the infection to spread between cohorts. However, increasing the number of agents in the succeeding cohort to whom a fraction of the agents in the preceding are connected decreases the period of time for the infection to spread between cohorts. This washes out the well-separated recurrences that correspond to spread into succeeding cohorts and one just sees the first peak.

We note that in a recent experiment [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], ex-vivo NHBE (normal human bronchial epithelial) cells were infected first with H1N1 virus, and then the H3N2 virus 509 A/Wyoming/03/2003. It was found that in bystander cells (cells that were not infected by H1N1), paracrine loops induced a strong anti-viral response (as measured by interferon-stimulated genes). Indeed, the replication of the H3N2 was decreased in comparison with single infection by H3N2. Thus, there is microscopic evidence for the influence of the immune response to the first strain on the infection by the second strain: it provides protection against it. While it is difficult to directly incorporate the results of such a microscopic model into the parameters of the macroscopic model, we assume that infection with the first virus (pandemic) provides increased immunity to the second virus (seasonal) in susceptible individuals, none of whom had received vaccinations against the seasonal flu.</p><p>This model was simulated with the following parameters. The virulence of the two strains in the model, i.e. the distributions of <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> of infectious individuals was kept the same in the absence of clear data to the contrary. Immunization against the pandemic strain was taken to mean that the immune strength of an inoculated individual <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> was uniformed randomly distributed between values 2 and 8 in contrast to [0, 6] for Individuals that are not inoculated. This implies an enhancement of the fundamental timescale of infection of inoculated individuals by at least a factor of 8.</p><p>We investigated two cases: one with 80% inoculation rate and the other with 50% rate. We used a model with four cohorts, and a total population of <italic>N</italic> = 6000. The key results for the mean number of infections of the two strains as a function of time in are presented in the two panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g012">Fig 12</xref>. The average was taken over 10,000 runs. Individual runs for these two are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s009">S9 Fig</xref>. In both cases, there is a first peak that corresponds to the initial infection due to the pandemic strain. The vaccine effectiveness over the years has ranged between 20% to 60%. We assumed that 80% or 50% of agents were inoculated, but were still susceptible to the pandemic virus, leading to the first peak. 50% inoculation is roughly equivalent to the true immunization rate in the United States as reported by the CDC [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We note that even though fewer agents are infected with the pandemic strain with higher inoculation, rare events can cause small recurrences at late times due to the larger pool of susceptibles.</p><fig id="pone.0231521.g012" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0231521.g012</object-id><label>Fig 12</label><caption><title>Mean infected (sum of exposed and infectious) agent number as a function of time.</title><p>The black dots represent ensemble averages over 10,000 runs, and the colored bars represent the standard deviation. Individual runs which contributed to these averages are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s009">S9 Fig</xref>. The left column (blue) shows the number of seasonal cases, while the right column (red) shows the number of pandemic cases. For the top row, 50% of the population was inoculated against the pandemic strain as detailed in the text, whereas in the bottom row, 80% of the population was inoculated. We see that the higher level of inoculation effectively prevents even the first peak of infection. However, this prevention is compensated by a large wave of infection in the seasonal strain; the number of peak cases is twice that of the lower inoculation rate. This feature is examined in the main text.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0231521.g012"/></fig><p>The second strain was introduced after 30 days, roughly corresponding to the data from Columbus, Ohio from the 2018-2019 flu season [<xref rid="pone.0231521.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We find a result that might be surprising at first sight: the number of infected cases of the seasonal strain is higher when the inoculation rate is higher for the pandemic virus. If one considers the protection afforded by being infected by the pandemic virus and the model population structure (specifically, the contact matrix that allows only few, weaker links between the cohorts) the result can be understood. If the small number of agents that provide connectivity between cohorts are infected by the first virus (more likely with the lower inoculation rate), then they cannot be infected by the seasonal virus. This reduces the probability of transmission to the succeeding cohorts and thus limits the number of seasonal infections. Once again, we chose parameters to make peaks clearly visible in order to study these effects. We note also the increase in stochasticity of the occurrence of the seasonal infection seen in the curves in the lower right panel of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0231521.s009">S9 Fig</xref>; this is a result of the rare events that control the inter-cohort spread due to the weak connections between cohorts. We emphasize, however, that we have pointed out a possible mechanism that can yield an increase the infection number for the second strain when vaccination rate for the first strain is increased.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231521.g013">Fig 13</xref>, we display histograms of the maximum number of people infected with each of the strains in each sample. The left panel shows the probability of a given maximum infection level for the case with no immunization against the seasonal strain and 50% coverage against the pandemic. The figure in the right panel is for the case of 80% coverage of immunization against the pandemic that occurs earlier. The peak numbers of those infected with the pandemic strain (the blue histogram) declines with increase in the immunization level. While larger number of agents become infected with the seasonal strain compared to the pandemic strain infections in both cases, the contrast is clear. The maximum number of people infected by the seasonal strain (orange-red histogram) has significantly larger weight at larger numbers. Since a larger fraction of the population is protected from pandemic infection for higher immunization, they are more susceptible to the seasonal strain, leading to larger epidemic spreads.</p><fig id="pone.0231521.g013" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0231521.g013</object-id><label>Fig 13</label><caption><title>Histograms of the maximum number (defined as the highest number at a given time over the entire season) of infected people with either the seasonal or pandemic strain of influenza in a season.</title><p>In the left figure, half of the population has been inoculated against the pandemic strain, whereas in the right figure, 80% of the population has been inoculated.

We have investigated the effect of the topology of connections between members of a population and the strength of the immune profile of individuals due to immunization. We identified quantitatively the parameter variations that affect the recurrences and showed that as the population is fragmented into cohorts which are more and more weakly connected, we obtain increasingly better-defined recurrence peaks corresponding to infection spreading into the successive cohorts.</p><p>We examined the stochastic nature of recurrence peaks in detail: rare events, arising from weak transmissibilty between cohorts of populations, leading to opportunistic spread of infection from one cohort to another give rise to recurrences that can occur randomly. Within a cohort whose members are well-immunized, although the infectious number is limited, the times at which the peak occurs can be broadly distributed. The study of a two-strain model revealed that immunity induced by inoculation against one strain of infection can lead to increased occurrence of a second later infection. The simplicity of the model allowed us to conduct a detailed study of its behavior, leaving open for future work the consequences of including specific effects such as time-varying environmental influences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec010"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0231521.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title><italic>I</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>I</italic><sub>2</sub> in the ODE SIR model with time delay.</title><p>There is a delay inserted between the time of infection and the transition of the susceptible number to infected.
