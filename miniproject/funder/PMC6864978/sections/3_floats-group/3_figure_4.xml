  <p>Overall and clade-specific vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H3N2), explored by age modelled by single year, Canadian Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network, 2018/19 (n = 1,735)</p>
 </caption>
 <p content-type="fig-fn">CI: confidence interval; HA: haemagglutinin; VE: vaccine effectiveness.</p>
 <p content-type="fig-fn">Adjusted VE estimates with 95% CI are displayed for A(H3N2) viruses overall (panel A) and for 3C.2a1b (panel B) and 3C.3a (panel C) viruses. Amino acids at HA positions 159 and 193 of 3C.2a1b and 3C.3a viruses are specified in panel labels, including whether position 159 was shielded or exposed (reflecting presence or absence of adjacent glycosylation); for comparison, note that the 2018/19 3C.2a1 vaccine is Y159-exposed, F193. VE estimates by single year of age are presented among participants aged 1–64 years with age smoothed as a natural cubic spline function assessed with knots at equal percentiles of age, demarcated by red triangles. Adjusted VE estimates by age subset are also overlaid. Methods are detailed in

For panel C related to 3C.3a, variation in amino acids at HA positions 159/193 of historic A(H3N2) viruses is overlaid with colour shading, corresponding to potential childhood priming epochs associated with those amino acid positions for participants of the specified age in 2018/19.
