<p>Here, we report virological and VE findings for the 2018/19 influenza A(H3N2) epidemic in Canada. To explain a paradoxical signal of increased (rather than reduced) risk of clade 3C.3a illness among vaccinated compared with unvaccinated adults, we hypothesise an underlying cohort effect following the 1968 influenza A(H3N2) pandemic. The first influenza-priming infection in childhood is known to imprint the immune system, leading to long-lived memory responses that are focused towards pivotal epitopes of the imprinting virus [
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We hypothesise that distant childhood priming provided long-lasting protection against contemporary influenza A(H3N2) viruses sharing imprinted epitopes, whereas vaccine mismatch may have negatively interacted with imprinted immunity. To explore the hypothesis of imprint-regulated effect of vaccine (I-REV), we compare VE variation by age in 2018/19 to amino acid variation in the HA glycoprotein by year since 1968.
