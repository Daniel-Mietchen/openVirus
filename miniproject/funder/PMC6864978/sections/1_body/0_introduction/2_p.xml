Clade 3C.3a viruses, which first arose in 2013/14, bear two substitutions within the immuno-dominant antigenic site B of the haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. Both substitutions affect major antigenic cluster transition positions: one is clade-defining, namely a phenylalanine (F) to serine (S) substitution at HA position 159 (F159S), and another more recently acquired in 2016/17 is considered an accessory substitution, namely F193S [
