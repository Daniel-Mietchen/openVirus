<p>The northern hemisphere influenza vaccine included a clade 3C.3a-representative virus in 2015/16, but clade 3C.3a viruses have since diversified [

 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In 2016/17, the influenza A(H3N2) vaccine component was updated to a clade 3C.2a strain, retained for 2017/18 but further updated in 2018/19 to clade 3C.2a1 [
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. With adaptation for egg-based manufacturing, clade 3C.2a vaccine candidates (including clade 3C.2a1) acquire several antigenically relevant mutations including a threonine (T) to lysine (K) substitution at HA position 160 of site B that constitutes an important loss of glycosylation (T160K (B) (âˆ’CHO)), exposing adjacent residues [

 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Overall, however, egg-adapted 3C.2a and 3C.2a1 vaccine strains are considered antigenically related to each other but antigenically distinct from circulating 3C.2a1b and 3C.3a viruses, with greater antigenic distances generally recorded for 3C.3a [
