<p>Specimens were tested for influenza by real-time RT-PCR. The genetic clade was determined by Sanger sequencing of the HA gene and phylogenetic analysis, with reference sequences obtained from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) [
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Amino acid substitutions at pivotal HA positions (H3 numbering with the signal peptide removed) are reported with antigenic sites indicated in parentheses (A–E), the receptor-binding site as ‘RBS’ and changes associated with potential gain or loss of N-linked glycosylation as ‘+/−CHO’. HA amino acid positions associated with major antigenic cluster transitions are specified [
