<p>Annual SPSN study activities are integrated within an outpatient sentinel surveillance platform for influenza-like illness (ILI) in the four most populous provinces of Canada. The ILI case definition is standardised for clinical severity, requiring both fever and cough plus additional systemic or respiratory symptoms [
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The VE against medically attended, laboratory-confirmed ILI was estimated by test-negative design whereby the odds of vaccination in influenza test-positive cases were compared with influenza test-negative controls via the odds ratio (OR) [

 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The VE to the level of the influenza A(H3N2) genetic clade was derived as (1 − adjusted OR) × 100%, adjusted for potential confounders of age, province, specimen collection interval and calendar time. Comorbidity, sex and epidemic period were further explored in sensitivity analyses and Firth’s method of penalised logistic regression (PLR) addressed sparse data issues as specified [
