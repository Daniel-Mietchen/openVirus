<p>All available HA sequences from influenza A(H3N2) viruses with collection dates from 1 January 1968 to 31 July 2019 were downloaded from GISAID [
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and aligned using MAFFT v7.245 [
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We gratefully acknowledge the hundreds of authors, originating and submitting laboratories that contributed sequences to GISAID since 1968, enabling the phylogenetic and priming epoch analyses we report here.
