<p>Individuals 55 years and older in 2018/19 would probably have been primed to A(H2N2) (emergent in 1957) or A(H1N1) (emergent in 1918) viruses and children aged 10–19 years may have been primed to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. These subtypes belong to group 1 HA, whereas A(H3N2) viruses belong to group 2 HA [
