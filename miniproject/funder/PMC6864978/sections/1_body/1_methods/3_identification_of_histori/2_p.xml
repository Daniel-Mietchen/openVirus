<p>Amino acids at select antigenic site positions were extracted using python scripts and their distribution compared by 1-year and 5-year groupings across historic and contemporary influenza A(H3N2) viruses, including the 2018/19 egg-adapted 3C.2a1 vaccine and wild-type 3C.2a1b and 3C.3a consensus sequences. Corresponding birth years were derived as 2018 minus age. Selected antigenic site positions were associated with clade-defining or other antigenic cluster transition or accessory substitutions or with potential gain or loss of glycosylation.</p>
