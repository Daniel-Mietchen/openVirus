<p>National coverage surveys for 2018/19 indicate that among Canadians 18–64-years-old, 31% without comorbidity and 43% with comorbidity received influenza vaccine, as did 70% of elderly adults overall [

Similarly, among our test-negative controls, 27% (231/853) of those aged 18–64 years without comorbidity and 43% (98/226) with comorbidity self-reported any influenza vaccination (without reference to timing in relation to ILI onset), as did 30% (107/363) and 46% (44/95), respectively, of 35–54-year-olds and 72% (173/240) of elderly adults overall. In our VE analyses, the greater proportion of vaccinated 3C.3a cases was not explained by an excess with known (i.e. excluding unknown) comorbidities overall (15/99; 15%) or among adults 35–54 years (3/15; 20%) relative to controls overall (363/1,571; 23%) or among adults 35-54 years (88/443; 20%) or compared with other surveillance data indicating &gt; 20% of Canadians live with a major chronic disease [
