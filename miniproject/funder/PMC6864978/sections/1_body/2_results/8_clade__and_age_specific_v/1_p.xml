<p>To further explore potential cohort (imprinting) effects, we assessed VE by single year of age. Splines are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> with VE estimates by age subset overlaid; colour shading in the 3C.3a panel reflects potential priming epochs associated with HA positions 159 and 193.
