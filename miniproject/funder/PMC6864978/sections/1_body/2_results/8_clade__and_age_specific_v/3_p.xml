<p>In younger adults, however, age-related patterns differed by genetic clade. For 3C.2a1b viruses that were Y159/F193 matched to the vaccine but with position 159 shielded from antibody access, VE hovered around the null throughout adulthood with point estimates varying at most 20% above or below. Conversely, for 3C.3a viruses that were S159/S193 vaccine-mismatched and with position 159 unshielded, a pronounced drop in VE below the null was evident between ca 35 and 54 years of age. Negative VE for adults 35–54-years-old (−346%; 95% CI: −58 to −1,321, Firth's PLR) corresponds with a 4.46-fold increased risk (95% CI: 1.58 to 13.21) among vaccinated individuals (p &lt; 0.005) (

A lesser dip below the null was also observed among participants ca 13–28 years-old (VE of −57%; 95% CI: −349 to 48, Firth’s PLR), corresponding to birth cohorts likely to have been primed to influenza A(H3N2) viruses that were Y159-matched but S193-mismatched to the 2018/19 (Y159/F193) vaccine.
