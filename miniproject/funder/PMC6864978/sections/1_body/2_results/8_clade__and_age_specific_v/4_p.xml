For the 2017/18 influenza A(H3N2) epidemic that was due mostly (&gt; 85%) to 3C.2a2 (Y159/F193 vaccine-matched) viruses, significant positive VE (40%; 95% CI: 7 to 61) was instead observed for adults 35–54-years-old, whereas for all other ages, VE hovered around the null. This mirror-image pattern compared with 2018/19 may be a clue to possible underlying mechanisms.
