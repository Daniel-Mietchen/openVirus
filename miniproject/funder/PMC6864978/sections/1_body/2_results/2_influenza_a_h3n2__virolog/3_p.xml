<p>We attempted HI characterisation on one-third (109/332) of A(H3N2) viruses, successful for 11 of 54 clade 3C.2a1b and 49 of 50 clade 3C.3a viruses. Of the viruses successfully HI-characterised, four of the 11 3C.2a1b (3/4 with T135K and 1/7 with T131K) and 38 of the 49 3C.3a viruses were antigenically distinct from the vaccine strain.</p>
