<p>Conversely, contemporary 3C.2a and descendant viruses, including 3C.2a1 vaccine and 3C.2a1b circulating viruses, possess Y159 and F193 (

Of related importance, no A(H3N2) viruses since 1968 possessed the N158/T160 glycosylation motif that was newly acquired by 3C.2a viruses from 2013/14. With addition of that sugar moiety, position 159 in 3C.2a and descendant viruses (including 3C.2a1b) is shielded from antibody and other immune system access. During the egg adaptation process, however, 3C.2a and 3C.2a1 vaccine strains lose that glycosylation site and associated shielding of position 159.
