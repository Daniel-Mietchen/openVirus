<p>To explain a paucity of unvaccinated 3C.3a cases older than 30 years, we sought priming epitopes to which adults may have been uniquely exposed in childhood and which were shared with contemporary 3C.3a viruses but not with 3C.2a1 vaccine and circulating 3C.2a1b viruses. We assessed amino-acid variation at 32 HA antigenic site positions across 83,026 historic influenza A(H3) sequences since 1968, aligned with 5-year age intervals in 2018/19 and corresponding birth years (

We propose that HA position 159 played a central role with potential accessory contribution by position 193.
