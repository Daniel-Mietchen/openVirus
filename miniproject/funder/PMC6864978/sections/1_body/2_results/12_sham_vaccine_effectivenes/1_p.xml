<p>In the absence of selection bias, the OR for vaccine effect against non-influenza respiratory viruses should approximate 1.0 [
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. During the 2018/19 season, two provinces conducted routine testing for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Applying the same covariates, the OR for vaccine effect against RSV (131 cases and 955 controls) was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.66 to 1.62) and with additional adjustment for comorbidity and sex was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.63 to 1.58). With restriction to adults 35–54 years (30 cases, 277 controls) the OR for RSV was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.56 to 2.80). The latter does not approach the substantial OR for 3C.3a viruses in 35–54-year-olds in these RSV-testing provinces (3.75; 95% CI: 1.06 to 16.28, Firth’s PLR) (12 cases, 308 controls). Note that in an analysis by test-negative design, a negative VE for RSV would mean that including RSV cases as controls in the evaluation of influenza VE would tend to under-estimate a true negative vaccine effect for influenza.
