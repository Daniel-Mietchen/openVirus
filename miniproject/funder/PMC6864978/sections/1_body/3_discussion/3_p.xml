<p>We sought a unifying hypothesis to simultaneously explain signals of pre-existing clade 3C.3a protection in unvaccinated adults older than 30 years and increased risk among their vaccinated counterparts. Taking into account a potential delay of several years from birth to first influenza-priming exposure [
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we postulate that individuals 35–54-years-old in 2018/19, corresponding to birth years 1964 to 1983, acquired protection through imprinting to historic influenza A(H3N2) viruses that bore S159 in common with contemporary clade 3C.3a viruses. Position 159 of the HA head is a focal point for immune response [
