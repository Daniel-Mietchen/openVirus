<p>Negative VE for clade 3C.3a viruses was driven by the majority (&gt; 80%) of vaccinees in our dataset who were repeat recipients of Y159-bearing 3C.2a vaccines in 2017/18 and 2018/19, mismatched to contemporary S159-bearing clade 3C.3a as well as distant imprinting viruses. In that context, the antigenic-distance hypothesis (ADH) previously elaborated by Smith et al. predicts negative interference from the prior season’s vaccine, potentially reducing VE [
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; however, the ADH did not incorporate more distant immunological interactions nor did it allow for negative VE (vaccine-associated increased risk). In order for our I-REV hypothesis to explain not only reduced or null, but also negative VE, we suggest that mismatched epitope responses must have somehow interfered with imprinted immunity. In a recent ferret study involving influenza A(H1N1) viruses, the cross-reactivity of imprinted A/USSR/90/1977 antibody against antigenically distinct A/Taiwan/1/1986 was diminished with each additional dose of antigenically distinct A/California/07/2009 vaccine received [

Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral replication may also explain vaccine-associated increased risk. ADE of influenza infection has long been postulated [

 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], but is not generally accepted. For other diseases, ADE is described during particular periods (windows of opportunity) when weakly cross-reactive antibodies are present at precise low levels [
 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], such as might variably be the conditions during late-season epidemics caused by antigenically distinct or drifted virus. The Canadian SPSN previously raised this possibility in relation to heterologous seasonal vaccination and increased risk of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 illness during the spring wave of the 2009 pandemic [
 <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], recapitulated in ferrets [
 <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and hypothesised by others to be mediated by immune-complex formation [
 <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The immunological mechanisms underlying I-REV require specific investigation in ferret or other experimental models.
