<p>Ultimately, our findings constitute a strong surveillance signal with consistency across VE networks and a concordant hypothesis, but are based on observational design and sparse data. Given the multivalent vaccine, policy implications must take into account not only negative clade- and age-specific VE against influenza A(H3N2) illness but also the protective effects of other vaccine components (e.g. against H1N1pdm09 illness) for the same age group and season. It is important to underscore that as a weighted average of any influenza type/subtype contribution, vaccine was protective during the 2018/19 season in Canada with a VE of 56% (95% CI: 47 to 64) overall and 49% (95% CI: 28 to 64) for adults 35â€“54-years-old. Nevertheless, better understanding of variation in influenza VE is needed, incorporating distant imprinting as well as proximate influences and interactions, with a view to improving influenza vaccine design and performance over the long term. We offer the I-REV hypothesis (
