<p>During the 2018/19 late-season influenza A(H3N2) epidemic, the Canadian SPSN observed low VE against outpatient influenza A(H3N2) illness, including significant negative VE for clade 3C.3a viruses among adults 20–64-years-old (−96%), pronounced among adults 35–54-years-old (−346%). A similar signal of negative VE for clade 3C.3a illness was identified in 2018/19 by the European I-MOVE primary care network among adults 15–64 years (−74%; 95% CI: −259 to 6) [

In the US where clade 3C.3a viruses predominated, the Hospitalized Adult Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (HAIVEN) reported negative VE against influenza A(H3N2) overall (−43%; 95% CI: −102 to −2), a finding also driven by non-elderly adults that remains under investigation [

These separate international networks differ somewhat in the methods, vaccines (e.g. egg- vs cell-based) and laboratory-confirmed clinical outcomes (e.g. outpatient vs inpatient; acute respiratory illness vs ILI) that were used. Although findings become less robust with stratification and reduced sample size, consistency in the direction of the negative vaccine effect against clade 3C.3a viruses among non-elderly adults across these networks requires explanation beyond chance variation.
