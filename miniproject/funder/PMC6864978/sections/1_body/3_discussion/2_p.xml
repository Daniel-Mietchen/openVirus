<p>In the absence of an obvious indication of bias, we have considered a biological phenomenon. Clade- and age-specific observations suggest an underlying cohort effect which we postulate may be linked to the distant but durable immunological imprint made by the first influenza virus exposure of childhood. This concept of imprinting was initially described by Davenport in 1957 with negative branding as
