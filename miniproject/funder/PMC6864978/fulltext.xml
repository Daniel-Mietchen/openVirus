The SPSN also reported a prominent shift in the age distribution of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases to include more children&#x02009;younger than&#x02009;10 years. It was postulated that this reflected an immunological cohort effect following the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Thereafter, Canada experienced a secondary influenza A wave due to H3N2 subtype viruses that peaked unusually late, in March 2019 [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Several influenza A(H3N2) genetic clades contributed, the majority (&#x0003e;&#x02009;60%) overall belonging to clade 3C.2a1b in Canada, Europe and Asia, with a minority (one-third or less) belonging to clade 3C.3a (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.46.1900585#supplementary_data">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>) [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Conversely, clade 3C.3a viruses comprised the majority (&#x0003e;&#x02009;70%) of influenza A(H3N2) detections in the United States (US) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2019.24.46.1900585#supplementary_data">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>) [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Clade 3C.3a viruses, which first arose in 2013/14, bear two substitutions within the immuno-dominant antigenic site B of the haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein. Both substitutions affect major antigenic cluster transition positions: one is clade-defining, namely a phenylalanine (F) to serine (S) substitution at HA position 159 (F159S), and another more recently acquired in 2016/17 is considered an accessory substitution, namely F193S [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>-<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The northern hemisphere influenza vaccine included a clade 3C.3a-representative virus in 2015/16, but clade 3C.3a viruses have since diversified [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In 2016/17, the influenza A(H3N2) vaccine component was updated to a clade 3C.2a strain, retained for 2017/18 but further updated in 2018/19 to clade 3C.2a1 [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. With adaptation for egg-based manufacturing, clade 3C.2a vaccine candidates (including clade 3C.2a1) acquire several antigenically relevant mutations including a threonine (T) to lysine (K) substitution at HA position 160 of site B that constitutes an important loss of glycosylation (T160K (B) (&#x02212;CHO)), exposing adjacent residues [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Antigenic characterisation by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is problematic for all clade 3C.2a (and descendant viruses) [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Overall, however, egg-adapted 3C.2a and 3C.2a1 vaccine strains are considered antigenically related to each other but antigenically distinct from circulating 3C.2a1b and 3C.3a viruses, with greater antigenic distances generally recorded for 3C.3a [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Here, we report virological and VE findings for the 2018/19 influenza A(H3N2) epidemic in Canada. To explain a paradoxical signal of increased (rather than reduced) risk of clade 3C.3a illness among vaccinated compared with unvaccinated adults, we hypothesise an underlying cohort effect following the 1968 influenza A(H3N2) pandemic. The first influenza-priming infection in childhood is known to imprint the immune system, leading to long-lived memory responses that are focused towards pivotal epitopes of the imprinting virus [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We hypothesise that distant childhood priming provided long-lasting protection against contemporary influenza A(H3N2) viruses sharing imprinted epitopes, whereas vaccine mismatch may have negatively interacted with imprinted immunity. To explore the hypothesis of imprint-regulated effect of vaccine (I-REV), we compare VE variation by age in 2018/19 to amino acid variation in the HA glycoprotein by year since 1968.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Vaccine effectiveness estimation</title><p>Annual SPSN study activities are integrated within an outpatient sentinel surveillance platform for influenza-like illness (ILI) in the four most populous provinces of Canada.

Position 159 of the HA head is a focal point for immune response [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and S159 was an accessible trigger for immunological imprinting and memory back-boosting throughout that 20-year period.</p><p>Negative VE for clade 3C.3a viruses was driven by the majority (&#x0003e;&#x02009;80%) of vaccinees in our dataset who were repeat recipients of Y159-bearing 3C.2a vaccines in 2017/18 and 2018/19, mismatched to contemporary S159-bearing clade 3C.3a as well as distant imprinting viruses. In that context, the antigenic-distance hypothesis (ADH) previously elaborated by Smith et al. predicts negative interference from the prior season&#x02019;s vaccine, potentially reducing VE [<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; however, the ADH did not incorporate more distant immunological interactions nor did it allow for negative VE (vaccine-associated increased risk). In order for our I-REV hypothesis to explain not only reduced or null, but also negative VE, we suggest that mismatched epitope responses must have somehow interfered with imprinted immunity. In a recent ferret study involving influenza A(H1N1) viruses, the cross-reactivity of imprinted A/USSR/90/1977 antibody against antigenically distinct A/Taiwan/1/1986 was diminished with each additional dose of antigenically distinct A/California/07/2009 vaccine received [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Similar epitope narrowing of imprinted cross-protection with repeat vaccination may have contributed to our findings. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral replication may also explain vaccine-associated increased risk. ADE of influenza infection has long been postulated [<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], including for heterologous vaccination in swine [<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], but is not generally accepted. For other diseases, ADE is described during particular periods (windows of opportunity) when weakly cross-reactive antibodies are present at precise low levels [<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], such as might variably be the conditions during late-season epidemics caused by antigenically distinct or drifted virus. The Canadian SPSN previously raised this possibility in relation to heterologous seasonal vaccination and increased risk of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 illness during the spring wave of the 2009 pandemic [<xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], recapitulated in ferrets [<xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] and hypothesised by others to be mediated by immune-complex formation [<xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The immunological mechanisms underlying I-REV require specific investigation in ferret or other experimental models.</p><p>Ultimately, our findings constitute a strong surveillance signal with consistency across VE networks and a concordant hypothesis, but are based on observational design and sparse data. Given the multivalent vaccine, policy implications must take into account not only negative clade- and age-specific VE against influenza A(H3N2) illness but also the protective effects of other vaccine components (e.g. against H1N1pdm09 illness) for the same age group and season. It is important to underscore that as a weighted average of any influenza type/subtype contribution, vaccine was protective during the 2018/19 season in Canada with a VE of 56% (95% CI: 47 to 64) overall and 49% (95% CI: 28 to 64) for adults 35&#x02013;54-years-old. Nevertheless, better understanding of variation in influenza VE is needed, incorporating distant imprinting as well as proximate influences and interactions, with a view to improving influenza vaccine design and performance over the long term. We offer the I-REV hypothesis (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="b1">Box</xref>) as springboard for discussion by the broader scientific community, recognising that other viral components (e.g. HA stalk, neuraminidase) and mechanisms may play a role and that under some conditions, childhood immunological imprinting has beneficial effects.</p><boxed-text id="b1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Box</label><caption><title>Imprint-regulated effect of vaccine (I-REV)</title></caption><p>
