<p>Awareness of symptoms of disease has been associated with voluntary uptake of counselling and testing [

Clients who accessed a stand-alone service for an HIV test may have identified signs or symptoms of disease and actively sought an HIV test. Those who tested at the mobile may have taken the immediate opportunity to test that a mobile service offers [
 <xref rid="pone.0195208.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and may not have been aware of any signs or symptoms of disease. The presumption that clients diagnosed at mobile were not driven to test due to their own awareness of symptoms may have delayed them linking to care. Studies have shown that individuals who are feeling “well” i.e. have higher CD4 counts [
 <xref rid="pone.0195208.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], are asymptomatic [
 <xref rid="pone.0195208.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], have no TB symptoms [
 <xref rid="pone.0195208.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] are less likely to link to HIV care. Future research is required to investigate factors associated with linkage to care from community-based services to provide an empirical basis for designing interventions aimed at improving linkage to care, in particular from mobile HTS.
