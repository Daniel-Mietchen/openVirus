<p>ART is currently available for all people living with HIV in South Africa, irrespective of CD4 count (universal test and treat (UTT)) [

 <xref rid="pone.0195208.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We speculate that linkage to HIV care will not necessarily improve as UTT is rolled out. We hypothesise that initial awareness of signs or symptoms of disease may play a larger role in linkage to care and treatment than demographic (e.g. sex and age), clinical (e.g. diagnosed disease or co-infection) or health service factors (referral letter). Future studies should determine the impact of UTT on linkage to care from community-based HTS.
