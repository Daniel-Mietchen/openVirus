<p>Linkage to care is sub-optimal. Linkage to HIV care is estimated at 55% from facility-based provider-initiated testing [

 <xref rid="pone.0195208.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 53% from community-based mobile services [
 <xref rid="pone.0195208.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. No known published linkage to care data exists at stand-alone services. While community-based services can diagnose HIV and TB among individuals who typically do not access public health facilities [
 <xref rid="pone.0195208.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], there exists limited data around linkage to HIV care and TB treatment from integrated community-based HTS.
