<p>Among males, 121/165 (73.3%) initiated TB treatment. Clients who initiated TB treatment were younger (median age 29 years, IQR: 25–41) compared to those who did not initiate TB treatment (median age 36 years, 95% CI: 27–45) (p≤0.007). Among clients co-infected with HIV, linkage to TB treatment was higher as compared to linkage among those without co-infection (84.9% vs 72.5%, p = 0.025). See
