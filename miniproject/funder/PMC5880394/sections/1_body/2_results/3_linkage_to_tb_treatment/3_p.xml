 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195208.t002">Table 2</xref> shows that linkage to TB treatment was associated with age. Clients in the age groups 25–34 (p = 0.046), 35–44 (p = 0.007) and ≥45 years (p = 0.019) were less likely to link to TB treatment compared to clients in the age group 12–24 years. Linkage to TB treatment was not associated with sex, HIV testing service or HIV co-infection. At the stand-alone, linkage to TB treatment was not associated with sex, age or HIV co-infection. At mobile, clients in the age groups 25–34, 35–44 and ≥45 years were less likely to commence TB treatment compared to clients in the age group 12–24 years (all, p-value&lt;0.02). See
