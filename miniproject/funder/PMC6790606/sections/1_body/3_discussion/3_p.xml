<p>Attaining the viral hepatitis elimination targets set by the global community in 2016 is achievable but also highly ambitious and comes with considerable challenges (see Appendix 
 <xref rid="liv14222-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). These should not be ignored, but instead considered and addressed both at a global level and within the local context to invigorate and maintain national elimination efforts. Gathering sufficient funds to finance viral hepatitis programmes continues to be difficult among competing health priorities and budget constraints. Not all countries currently benefit from generic competition, with heavily burdened middle‐income countries (eg China, Malaysia, Thailand) struggling to afford higher drug prices. A further obstacle is the increasing cost of diagnostics; for example, in Egypt expenditure on diagnostics now exceeds that on hepatitis C treatment.
 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">68</xref> There are few WHO prequalified point‐of‐care viral hepatitis tests and little production of low‐cost high‐quality generic tests. In many low‐income countries, strengthening primary health care systems for maternal and child health, developing laboratory capacity, and improving weak registration and procurement systems for essential medicines is an ongoing challenge. For hepatitis B, cold chain barriers to vaccination including birth dose delivery exist, and while the controlled temperature chain presents a cost‐effective alternative that could vastly improve coverage
