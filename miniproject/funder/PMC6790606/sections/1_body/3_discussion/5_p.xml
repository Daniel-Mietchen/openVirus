<p>The country case studies presented here demonstrate that major gains are possible in spite of these challenges – across various epidemic profiles, within a diverse range of resource constraints and within relatively short‐time frames. The case studies illustrate that political will and commitment, civil society advocacy, donor support and community acceptance are crucial and can make a difference. From concerted screening efforts in Egypt and using innovative approaches to increase hepatitis C testing in Scotland, to building local investment cases in South Africa, to integrating viral hepatitis services into existing health infrastructure in Brazil and Rwanda, these pioneers provide important models for other countries to follow. In all countries multi‐stakeholder engagement of national and international experts, civil society organisations and affected communities form critical components across the three pillars of evidence‐gathering and planning, implementation and integration.</p>
