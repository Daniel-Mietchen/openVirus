<p>The programme has now expanded its scope to treat every person chronically infected with hepatitis C, as outlined in the “Strategic plan for the Elimination of Hepatitis C Virus in Georgia, 2016‐2020”. Hepatitis C treatment services are provided at treatment centres located throughout the country and treatment decentralisation in harm reduction centres and primary care is ongoing. Patient out‐of‐pocket fees for diagnostics and clinical monitoring are based on ability to pay. Georgia is working to integrate its hepatitis C elimination programme into the overall health system, because this will benefit the management of other health problems such as HIV and tuberculosis.
