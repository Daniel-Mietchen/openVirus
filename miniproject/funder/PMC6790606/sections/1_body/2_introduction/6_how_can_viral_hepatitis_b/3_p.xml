<p>The necessary tools for viral hepatitis elimination are already available, but worldwide implementation of a concerted viral hepatitis response is slow and faces many challenges. These include low levels of investments in health overall; inadequate data and weak surveillance systems; poor infrastructure; low awareness among policymakers, at‐risk populations and primary care practitioners; high prices of some diagnostics and treatments; and a lack of prioritisation of viral hepatitis.

Moreover, only 12 countries are currently on track to achieve the hepatitis C elimination goal that all WHO member states adopted in 2016.
