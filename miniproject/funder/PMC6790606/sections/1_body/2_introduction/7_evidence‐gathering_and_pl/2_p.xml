<p>Low‐quality surveillance systems and a lack of reliable cause‐specific mortality data limit countries' capacity to guide, implement and monitor effective viral hepatitis responses.

 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> To advocate for an adequate allocation of domestic resources and to mobilise external funding support, countries should develop a national plan that sets ambitious but achievable targets, informed by a robust local investment case for viral hepatitis. Gathering accurate data to inform a targeted approach can improve the cost‐effectiveness of specific interventions.

 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0037" ref-type="ref">37</xref> Many countries have begun collecting epidemiological data through national seroprevalence surveys or by adding key hepatitis indicators into existing surveillance systems. Below, we give examples of countries that have gathered evidence and are developing a national plan (Georgia), produced an investment case for elimination (South Africa) and obtained accurate data to inform the response (Scotland).
