<p>Driven by strong political commitment and with support from the Global Alliance on Vaccine and Immunization, including an investment of ~ USD76 million to subsidise the hepatitis B catch‐up vaccination programme for 15 million children through public‐private partnerships such as with Rotary and the ZeShan Foundation,
