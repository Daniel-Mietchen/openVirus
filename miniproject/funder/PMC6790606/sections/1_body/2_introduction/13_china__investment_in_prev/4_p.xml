<p>Although China has made considerable progress with hepatitis B, systemic obstacles to the elimination of MTCT remain. The physician‚Äêcentred approach of the medical service infrastructure discourages affected pregnant women from seeking timely treatment, because physicians trained to provide treatment (ie obstetricians, gynaecologists, gastroenterologists and infectious disease specialists working in central hospitals) are often reluctant to do so. Moreover, China is yet to implement a comprehensive national strategy addressing its hepatitis C epidemic. Few DAAs have been approved and their high cost restricts inclusion in basic health insurance programmes; consequently, DAA treatment is not universally available. Policy changes and education campaigns are needed to overcome stigma and discrimination and improve diagnosis rates, and linkage to care needs improvement.</p>
