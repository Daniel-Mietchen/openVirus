<p>By negotiating a volume‐based, risk‐sharing agreement with originator pharmaceutical companies and committing over AUD1 billion to the purchase of DAAs between March 2016 and February 2021, Australia obtained major discounts on drug list prices and as a consequence limited its expenditure. With no cap on treatment numbers,

This provides an enabling environment to prioritise high‐prevalence groups with ongoing risks for treatment, such as PWID and prisoners, necessary to achieve hepatitis C elimination. In addition, all registered medical practitioners are able to prescribe DAA therapy, enabling more convenient, patient‐centred care. In Australia, close collaboration between people living with hepatitis C, community organisations, clinicians and policymakers facilitated improved access to diagnosis and treatment scale‐up (Figure
