<p>Integrating the viral response into the health system by utilising existing structures and trained workforces can save costs and generate efficiencies, as well as maximising access to services for key risk populations.
 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">83</xref> For example conducting viral hepatitis testing at HIV services is likely to yield high diagnosis rates because people living with HIV have a higher risk of hepatitis B or hepatitis C co‐infection, and may improve their engagement in care.
 <xref rid="liv14222-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">84</xref> However, it is important to look beyond integrating the response into HIV programmes, because further opportunities exist to broaden the viral hepatitis response by integrating it within tuberculosis, maternal and child health, and diabetes programmes. Also such an approach may not be useful in countries with generalised epidemics (such as China and Egypt) that require population‐based approaches to testing and treatment.
