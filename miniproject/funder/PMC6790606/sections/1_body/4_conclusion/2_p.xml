<p>At the 2016 World Health Assembly, the global community uniformly endorsed the unique opportunity to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat. Although an ambitious goal, technological advancements have made it scientifically feasible and increasing recognition of the public health threat posed by viral hepatitis provides the grounds for substantial political and societal support. The broader benefits of investing in the elimination of viral hepatitis – including progress on the Agenda for Sustainable Development – are now well recognised. Sustaining political momentum will be critical if elimination efforts are to be successful and more countries will need to take action if global elimination of viral hepatitis is to be achieved. Looking to existing approaches that address viral hepatitis can facilitate political support, because they demonstrate that investing in viral hepatitis is cost‐effective and can be made affordable, provide multiple economic benefits, and above all alleviate the human burden of the epidemic. The case studies presented in this paper provide clear and feasible examples of successful approaches taken by low‐, middle‐ and high‐income countries with diverse epidemics of hepatitis B and C to achieve the WHO 2030 viral hepatitis elimination targets.</p>
