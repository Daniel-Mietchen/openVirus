 <p>(a) Identified collinearities among key sexual network statistics across 500 sexual network simulations. Predictors of higher HIV (b) or HSV-2 (c) prevalence and their effect sizes as identified across 500 epidemic and sexual network simulations. In b and c, network statistics are ordered according to descending strength of effect size. Size of arrow denotes strength of effect size: large arrow for strong effect size (≥0.6), medium arrow for intermediate-strength effect size (0.2≤ effect size &lt;0.6), and small arrow for weak effect size (&lt;0.2). HSV-2, herpes simplex virus type 2.</p>
