 <p>Association between HIV prevalence and HSV-2 prevalence across 500 epidemic and sexual network simulations at variable levels of population mean and variance of number of sexual partners over the last year for both unmarried and married individuals, degree correlation for nonmarital and all partnerships, clustering coefficient for nonmarital and all partnerships, and concurrency prevalence for nonmarital and all partnerships. The shading scale in each panel describes the range of simulated values for the sexual network statistic of that specific panel. Each of the panels describes the association between HIV prevalence and HSV-2 prevalence in the context of the variation in a specific sexual network statistic. HSV-2, herpes simplex virus type 2.</p>
