<p>With these challenges to empirical data, we used in-silico simulations of HIV and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) transmission in a population to explore ‘microscopically’ the link between sexual networks and HIV/HSV-2 patterns. We explored infection transmission in diverse network structures informed by observed behavior patterns and tuned by ranges of different network statistics. This approach enabled us to explore associations and risks of exposure beyond what can be implemented in an actual observational study.</p>
