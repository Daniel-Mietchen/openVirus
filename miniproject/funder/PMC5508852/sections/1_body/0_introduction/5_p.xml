<p>We aimed specifically to determine the mean effects of key network statistics on infection transmission, and to what extent they are independent of each other. We further aimed to assess whether HSV-2 prevalence, despite differences in natural history and infectiousness profile, is associated with HIV prevalence and can (as a proxy) forecast HIV epidemic potential in a population yet to experience a full-blown epidemic. An overarching goal of our study is to inform the investigation of the network factors that have led to such large HIV epidemics in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), but nowhere else.</p>
