<p>Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> shows the results of HIV models where HSV-2 prevalence was included as an independent variable. HSV-2 prevalence was a strong predictor of HIV prevalence whether alone, or with the addition of degree correlation and clustering coefficient. However, with the addition of concurrency prevalence, HSV-2 prevalence was a weak predictor as concurrency prevalence alone explained most of HIV prevalence variation. With inclusion of concurrency prevalence, clustering coefficient, and degree correlation in the model, HSV-2 prevalence was not predictive of HIV prevalence and had a vanishing effect size – inclusion of network statistics explicitly as independent variables in the model prevented HSV-2 prevalence from ‘acting’ as a collective measure of sexual risk behavior.
