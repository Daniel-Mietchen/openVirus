<p>In examining the univariable (unadjusted) associations between each network statistic and HIV/HSV-2 prevalences, it was evident that network statistics sometimes affected HIV/HSV-2 prevalences differentially. Higher concurrency, for example, drove higher prevalence for both infections (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>c and f). In contrast, degree correlation among nonmarital partnerships affected each prevalence differently (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a).
