<p>Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> also shows the best-fit models in the Number of Partners Class. For each infection, the final model included unmarried/married mean/variance of number of partners, and degree correlation and clustering coefficient, both for nonmarital partnerships. The HIV model explained 90% of the variation. In this model, unmarried mean number of partners was a strong predictor of HIV prevalence, with intermediate-strength effect for unmarried variance of number of partners and weak effects for the other variables. The HSV-2 model explained 88% of the variation. In this model, unmarried/married mean/variance of number of partners and clustering coefficient had intermediate-strength effects (that was negative for clustering coefficient), and degree correlation had a weak effect. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>b and c summarize these effects and their scales.
