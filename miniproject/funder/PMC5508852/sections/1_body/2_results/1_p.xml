<p>Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a–f shows the association between HIV/HSV-2 prevalences across the 500 simulations at different scales of network statistics. HSV-2 prevalence was consistently higher than HIV prevalence, and apart from settings with HSV-2 prevalence greater than 60%, HIV prevalence was one-third or less of HSV-2 prevalence. HIV/HSV-2 prevalences were associated with an SRCC of 0.64 (95% confidence interval: 0.58–0.69).
