<p>Several collinearities were detected in the regression analyses (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>a). These included: concurrency prevalence among nonmarital/all partnerships versus unmarried/married mean/variance of number of partners, concurrency prevalence among nonmarital versus all partnerships, degree correlation among nonmarital versus all partnerships, and clustering coefficient among nonmarital versus all partnerships. We used, therefore, two classes (i.e., two types) of models in the final regression analyses to control for collinearities: Concurrency Class, which included one of the two concurrency measures, but no measure of number of partners; and Number of Partners Class including unmarried/married mean/variance of number of partners, but no concurrency measure.
