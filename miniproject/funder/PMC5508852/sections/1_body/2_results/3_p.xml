<p>Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> shows the associations between network statistics and HIV prevalence as measured by SRCC. HIV prevalence was strongly and positively correlated with unmarried mean/variance of number of partners and concurrency prevalence among nonmarital/all partnerships. Meanwhile, it had intermediate-strength positive associations with married mean/variance of number of partners and clustering coefficient among all partnerships, but intermediate-strength negative association with degree correlation among all partnerships. Lastly, HIV prevalence had weak associations with degree correlation and clustering coefficient, both among nonmarital partnerships.
