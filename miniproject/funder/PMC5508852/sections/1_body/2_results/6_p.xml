<p>Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> shows the best-fit models in the Concurrency Class. For each infection, the final model included degree correlation and clustering coefficient, both for nonmarital partnerships, and concurrency prevalence for all partnerships. The HIV model explained 88% of the variation. In this model, concurrency prevalence was a strong predictor of HIV prevalence, with weak effects for degree correlation and clustering coefficient. The HSV-2 model explained 79% of the variation. In this model, concurrency prevalence was also a strong predictor of HSV-2 prevalence, with intermediate strength but negative effect for clustering coefficient, and weak effect for degree correlation.
