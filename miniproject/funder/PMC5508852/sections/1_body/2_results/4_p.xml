<p>Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> also shows the associations between network statistics and HSV-2 prevalence as measured by SRCC. HSV-2 prevalence was strongly and positively correlated with unmarried mean number of partners and concurrency prevalence of nonmarital/all partnerships. Meanwhile, it had intermediate-strength positive associations with unmarried variance of number of partners, married mean/variance of number of partners, and degree correlation among nonmarital partnerships, but intermediate-strength negative associations with degree correlation among all partnerships and clustering coefficient among nonmarital/all partnerships. HSV-2 prevalence was not weakly associated with any of the network statistics.
