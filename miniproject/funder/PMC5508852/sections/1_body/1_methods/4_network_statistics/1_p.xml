<p>Based on relevance to STI epidemiology, we investigated five types of network statistics: population mean and variance of the number of partners over the last year for married/unmarried individuals, degree correlation for nonmarital/all partnerships, clustering coefficient for nonmarital/all partnerships, and concurrency prevalence for nonmarital/all partnerships. The 1-year timeframe for the number of partners was chosen based on DHS data availability [
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Degree correlation measures the correlation between the number of partners of each partner in a partnership (Text S1) [
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Clustering coefficient measures the degree to which individuals in the network tend to cluster together (Text S1) [
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Concurrency prevalence measures the proportion of individuals who have at least two partners at a specific time point (Text S1) [
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].
