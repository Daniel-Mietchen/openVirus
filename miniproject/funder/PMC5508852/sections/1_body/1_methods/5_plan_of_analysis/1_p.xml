The choice of 500 is a balance between computing time versus the need to have diverse networks and to estimate measures with sufficiently narrow confidence intervals to make valid inferences. Parameters were sampled from plausible ranges. For each dynamical network, HIV/HSV-2 transmission was also simulated. Each simulation was seeded with 10 infected individuals for each of HIV/HSV-2, and was run with a ‘burn-in’ time of 200 years to reach equilibrium. Accordingly, we generated 500 HIV/HSV-2 epidemics in 500 different networks.
