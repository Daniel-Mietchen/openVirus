<p>The regression statistical model was selected using the variance inflation factor (VIF) [
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and Akaike's information criterion [
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] as criteria. To account for the collinearities while building the models, the VIF was calculated and model selection was based on VIF less than 10. Among models satisfying the VIF criterion, the final model was selected by minimizing Akaike's information criterion. The final model was then used to calculate associations and estimate effect sizes, that is, the standardized partial regression coefficients (estimated parameters of the independent variables in the regression equation) [
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Effect sizes were considered strong if effect size was at least 0.6, of intermediate strength if effect size was between 0.2 and 0.6 and weak if effect size was less than 0.2. A strong effect size would imply that the independent variable (a network statistic) has a strong influence on the dependent variable (infection prevalence). Statistical analyses were implemented in R version 3.2.3. (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).
