<p>Network statistics and HIV/HSV-2 prevalences were calculated in each simulation. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) was calculated to estimate the associations between HIV/HSV-2 prevalences and each of the network statistics. Associations were considered strong if SRCC was at least 0.6, of intermediate strength if SRCC was between 0.2 and 0.6, and weak if SRCC was less than 0.2. Subsequently, to examine potential collinearities between network statistics and to control for confounding, multiple linear regression analyses were conducted and adjusted associations assessed. These analyses were conducted on the population-based summary measures of the simulated networks/epidemics. The dependent variable was HIV (or HSV-2) prevalence, as a continuous variable, and the independent variables were the network statistics.</p>
