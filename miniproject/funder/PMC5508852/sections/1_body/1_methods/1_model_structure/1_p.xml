<p>We constructed an individual-based Monte Carlo simulation model describing sex partnering, birth and death, and HIV/HSV-2 transmission in a given population. Each individual is born, dies, forms/dissolves marital/nonmarital partnerships, or acquires HIV/HSV-2 at event-specific probabilities at each time step in each simulation run. Transmission was assumed to occur only through sex. An initial population of 2000 individuals was assumed (for computational reasons), but this population can vary with time by random birth/death events. The model was structured as a one-sex model to avoid complexities in the definitions and analytics of network statistics. As our present interest is on the natural dynamics as the HIV epidemics emerged in SSA, we did not incorporate more recent intervention scale-up such as HIV antiretroviral therapy. Final analyses were conducted at endemic equilibrium for both infections.</p>
