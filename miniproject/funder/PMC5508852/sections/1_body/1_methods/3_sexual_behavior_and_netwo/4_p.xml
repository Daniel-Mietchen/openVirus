<p>We aimed to investigate STI dynamics in diverse networks where degree correlation and clustering coefficient can vary independently. To control these factors while maintaining the degree distribution, ‘rewiring’ of newly formed partnerships is required [
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. We used a rewiring prescription introduced by Yuasa and Shirayama [
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] utilizing a tuning factor with two parameters,

 </disp-formula>, the network is a random weighted network, otherwise, degree correlation and clustering coefficient can be varied.
