<p>HSV-2 natural history was described by the stages of primary infection, latent infection, and reactivation [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Viral shedding was assumed to occur only during primary infection and reactivations at a frequency of 14% of the time [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. HSV-2 transmission probability per coital act during shedding was determined through several analyses [
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Based on evidence of the pattern, sites, and frequency of subclinical reactivations [
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], all seropositive persons were assumed equally infectious regardless of clinical symptoms.
