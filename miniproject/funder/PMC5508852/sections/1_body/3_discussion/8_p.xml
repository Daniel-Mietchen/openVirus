<p>Our study has limitations. We focused on specific network statistics based on presumptive relevance to HIV/HSV-2. Other network measures or behavioral attributes may shed further light on STI dynamics. For example, we did not explicitly explore role of commercial sex, but this may have a sizable independent effect. Our analyses were conducted on population-based summary data, and technically could be subject to ecological fallacy. For analytical tractability, we used a one-sex model, but this limitation is not perceived to be critical as the core transmission dynamics is already captured allowing the model to effectively simulate same sex or heterosexual transmission in a population. We assumed no HIV/HSV-2 biological interaction, despite earlier observational evidence [
