<p>We explored the sexual network determinants of HIV/HSV-2 prevalences and the epidemiological overlap between these two infections. Not surprisingly, we found that each infection prevalence is predicted by key network summary statistics. However, the network effects on each infection showed similarity and variation in nature and scale. Unmarried mean/variance of number of partners and concurrency prevalence were overall strong predictors for both infections. The other network statistics had smaller effects that varied by infection. The network statistics considered here explained most of the variation in HIV/HSV-2 prevalences across these simulations.</p>
