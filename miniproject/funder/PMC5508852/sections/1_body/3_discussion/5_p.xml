<p>Though HIV and HSV-2 propagate in the same network, there are distinctions in how network statistics affect each infection transmission. Clustering had an opposite effect on each infection, driving higher HIV transmission but lower HSV-2 transmission. HIV is possibly more difficult to propagate in networks, with its lower infectiousness and shorter infection duration, and much of its transmission could be occurring in clusters, reminiscent of core group STI dynamics [

Meanwhile, HSV-2 spreads more easily in networks, with its higher infectiousness and longer infection duration, and therefore, can reach a larger population segment. High clustering in a network may limit HSV-2's ability to reach remote areas of the network, just as observed in an analysis of generic epidemic transmission [
