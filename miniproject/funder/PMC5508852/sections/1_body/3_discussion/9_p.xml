<p>We included broad ranges for the network statistics in context of absence of empirical measures for some network statistics, such as degree correlation and clustering. We focused on studying the ‘mean’ overall association between each network statistic and HIV/HSV-2 prevalences over broad ranges for these variables. Each of these associations, nevertheless, is nonlinear and complex, and may change in strength or nature at different scales of network statistics or prevalence levels. Moreover, different interventions, whether they affect both infections directly (such as condom use), or whether they affect one of them differentially (such as antiretroviral therapy) can further influence these nonlinear associations and their interactions. These intricacies warrant detailed examination in further work.</p>
