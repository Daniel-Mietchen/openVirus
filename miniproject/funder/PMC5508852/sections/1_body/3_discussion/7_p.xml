<p>Our findings indicate hidden complexity, if not danger, in concluding that specific network aspects are core drivers of STI epidemics without cautious analysis that control for other network factors and their interdependency. Our results, for example, showed that concurrency was strongly predictive of HIV prevalence, apparently supporting the literature implicating concurrency as the key factor to explain SSA fulminant HIV transmission [
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, such a conclusion seems unwarranted as our results indicate that concurrency's effect is not independent of the number of partners effect. Concurrency appeared largely as a proxy for the high mean/variance of number of partners â€“ not a surprising outcome considering the analytical association between concurrency and mean/variance of number of partners [
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. HIV prevalence in our analysis reflected primarily mean/variance of number of partners, with smaller effects for clustering and degree correlation. These factors alone explained 90% of HIV prevalence variation (Table
