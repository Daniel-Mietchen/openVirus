<p>In conclusion, HIV transmission and HSV-2 transmission in sexual networks share similarities that allow us to use HSV-2 prevalence as a proxy of HIV epidemic potential, and accordingly inform HIV prevention interventions. There are also distinctions in the network factors that drive each infection transmission. HIV prevalence reflected primarily mean/variance of number of partners (or alternatively concurrency), whereas HSV-2 prevalence was affected by a range of network statistics. Key infection effects of network statistics were found not to be independent â€“ concurrency captured similar effects as those of mean/variance of number of partners. This genre of epidemic analyses, particularly when extended to more infections, can elucidate the behavioral factors that drive STI transmission, how STIs can inform us about the structure of sexual networks, and how to best design interventions to control transmission.</p>
