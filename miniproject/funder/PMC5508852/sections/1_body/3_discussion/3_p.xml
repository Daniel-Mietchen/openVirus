<p>HIV prevalence was also found to be one-third or less of HSV-2 prevalence. If HSV-2 prevalence was less than 20% in a given population, such as among many female sex worker populations in the Middle East and North Africa [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], our results indicate that HIV is unlikely to reach a concentrated epidemic level among these sex workers (&gt;5% prevalence). Meanwhile, if HSV-2 prevalence was at 50%, there is sufficient sexual risk behavior in the network to sustain a large HIV epidemic, as found in the general population HIV epidemics in SSA [
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It would be of interest to assess whether these modeling predictions are consistent with the HIV/HSV-2 association in empirical data. The latter could be assessed through a global systematic review and meta-analyses of existing studies with primary data for both infections.
