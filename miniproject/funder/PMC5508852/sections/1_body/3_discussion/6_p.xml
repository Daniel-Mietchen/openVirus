<p>Higher degree correlation among nonmarital partnerships was associated with higher HSV-2, but lower HIV transmission. Degree correlation may facilitate the formation of larger connected sections within a network (larger components), thereby probably allowing HSV-2 to reach a larger population segment and remote areas of the network. Meanwhile, higher degree correlation among all partnerships, that is, with inclusion of marital partnerships, was negatively associated with HIV/HSV-2 transmission, as it indicated tendency for monogamy.</p>
