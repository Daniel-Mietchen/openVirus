<p>Importantly, we found that network statistics effects on prevalence were not independent of each other. Concurrency prevalence captured the same effect as that of mean/variance of number of partners. Our results demonstrated also that HSV-2 prevalence is a proxy of HIV prevalence, and therefore, of HIV epidemic potential among populations where HIV has not yet been introduced, or has not yet reached its endemic equilibrium (stable endemic level). With both infections being transmitted sexually and propagating in the same sexual network, HSV-2 prevalence acts as a ‘summary collective measure’ of the network statistics that drive HIV transmission.</p>
