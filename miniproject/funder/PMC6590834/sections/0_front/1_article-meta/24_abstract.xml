 <p>Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is the virus responsible for most of the severe forms of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) associated with neurological involvement and mortality in young children under the age of 5. Seasonal outbreaks of HFMD -with a 2â€“3 years epidemic cycle- are recurring around the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. To date, no antiviral agent has been approved for the treatment of EV-A71 infections. Here, we report on a recently uncovered class of tryptophan dendrimers with an extraordinary antiviral activity 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> against circulating EV-A71 clinical isolates. Mode of action studies revealed that this class of compounds targets the 5-fold vertex of EV-A71, in turn blocking receptor binding. Our finding may open an entirely novel line of research and largely aid in anti-enterovirus drug development.
