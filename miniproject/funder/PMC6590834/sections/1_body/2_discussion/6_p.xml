<p>Medicinal chemistry efforts are currently ongoing to simplify and reduce the backbone of MADAL385 without affecting the antiviral activity. Half-sized compounds (~1500 Da versus 3575.84 Da) have now been identified that are equipotent to MADAL385 against EV-A71 and that have little or no adverse effect on the host cells (at concentrations up to 100 Î¼M). 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies to assess tolerability and antiviral efficacy will be complementary to medicinal chemistry efforts to pursue the development of this class of compounds as novel EV-A71 antiviral agents.
