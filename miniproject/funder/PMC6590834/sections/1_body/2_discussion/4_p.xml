<p>Suramin and its derivative NF449 are known to specifically interact with residues VP1_145Q and VP1_98E_244K at the 5-fold vertex, respectively [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Of interest, we show that the susceptibility to suramin is not affected in the presence of both S184T and P246S amino acid substitutions. In addition, we observed a prominent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral synergistic effect between MADAL385 and suramin. These results indicate that, despite the common binding site for these two classes of drugs, the subtleties of their binding modes are different, which is not entirely surprising given their very distinct chemical structure. However, based on molecular modelling considerations, the simultaneous binding of MADAL385 and suramin on the same 5-fold vertex seems most unlikely due to the large size and negatively charged character of both entities.
