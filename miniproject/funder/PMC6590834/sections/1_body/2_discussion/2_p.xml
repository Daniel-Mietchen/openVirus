<p>Recent SAR studies performed with MADAL derivatives [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] point to the crucial role of the carboxylic acid groups for the antiviral efficacy. The importance of these carboxylates is corroborated by the lack of activity observed with the corresponding tryptamine (a “decarboxylated” analogue of Trp) and methyl ester derivatives (COOCH
 <sub>3</sub> instead of COOH) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The nature of the amino acid side chains is also very important for activity since the indole ring of Trp is preferred, most likely due to its relative polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential, particularly towards the hydroxyl of Thr141 (according to our MD simulations). These observations suggest that the carboxylic acid (-COOH) or carboxylate (-COO
 <sup>-</sup>) groups of MADAL385 can mimic the sulfate groups (-SO
 <sub>3</sub>H or -SO
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>-</sup>) of human PSGL1 or HS. By competing with the sulfate groups, MADAL385 may prevent virus attachment to these host receptor(s) and thereby the entry into and infection of host cell.
