<p>In agreement with the cryo-EM results showing that MADAL385 is lodged in the external pore region, the MD simulations revealed the preference of the drug for binding inside the cavity lined by the adjoined 
 <sup>141</sup>TPTGQVVP
 <sup>148</sup> and 
 <sup>242</sup>QSKYP
 <sup>246</sup> loops of the five VP1 subunits. Three of the MADAL385 ‘legs’ projected into the inter-subunit crevices and the remaining one occupied the outer part of the pore. It seems, therefore, that a certain conformation of these two exposed VP1 loops is necessary for MADAL385 binding, most likely for providing relative accessibility of VP1_244K to interact with the negative charges of MADAL385. We propose that the location of the MADAL385-sensitive variants VP1_148P and VP1_245Y is critical for stacking and establishing van der Waals interactions with the indole moieties of MADAL385. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that the MADAL385-resistant variants may only reduce viral sensitivity to MADAL385 in the context of the BrCr strain VP1. Indeed, the clinical isolate EV-A71_11316 carries the VP1_184S residue, a resistant variant for the BrCr strain.
