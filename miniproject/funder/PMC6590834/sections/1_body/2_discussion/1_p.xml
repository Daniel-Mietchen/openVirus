<p>We report here on the mechanism of action of MADAL385, the lead compound of a novel class of tryptophan dendrimers with exquisitely potent 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity against EV-A71. Cryo-EM studies revealed that the highly conserved lysine residue at position 244 of VP1 (VP1_244K), near the icosahedral 5-fold vertex, is closely connected to the density of MADAL385. This residue also plays a key role in the interaction of EV-A71 with PSGL1 and HS. Both receptors are sulfated molecules (

 <italic>e</italic>. endowed with a negative charge at physiological pH) whose interaction with the positively charged VP1_244K capsid residue is thought to involve a strong electrostatic interaction. As a result of this high-affinity interaction, we showed that MADAL385 inhibits EV-A71 binding with PSGL1 and HS. Together with biochemical evidence, we also demonstrate that MADAL385 inhibits the binding of EV-A71 to human SCARB2- or PSGL1-expressing L929 cells. We observed that the activity of MADAL385 in L929-SCARB2 cells was exclusively dependent on the inhibition of HS binding since the activity of MADAL385 was lost in cells treated with sodium chlorate (NaClO
 <sub>3</sub>), a molecule that prevents cell-surface sulfation. In addition, this experiment also demonstrates the importance of HS binding for efficient entry and replication of EV-A71 in both L929-SCARB2 and L929-PSGL1 overexpressing cells.
