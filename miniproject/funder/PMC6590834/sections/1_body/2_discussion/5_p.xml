<p>Cyclophilin A is a newly reported uncoating regulator for EV-A71 entry, and its binding site is very close to that of PSGL1 and HS on EV-A71 virion [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The MADAL class of tryptophan dendrimers may thus have the potential to block Cyclophilin A binding. However, the Cyclophilin A inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) did not affect binding of EV-A71 BrCr to RD cells (

 <sub>50</sub>&gt;30μM and Debio-025 EC
 <sub>50</sub>&gt;21μM), suggesting that this host factor does not play a prominent role in the entry of the strains that we used in our study.
