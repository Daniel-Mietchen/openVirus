<p>CPE reduction assays were performed as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Briefly, RD cells in 96-well cell culture plates were seeded, after which serials of diluted compounds and EV-A71 inoculum were added. CPE was quantified by MTS assay at 3 days post infection and expressed as percentage of untreated controls. The 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by logarithmic interpolation and is defined as the concentration at which the virus-induced CPE is reduced by 50%.
