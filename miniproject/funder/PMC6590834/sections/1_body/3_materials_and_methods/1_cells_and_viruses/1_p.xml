<p>RD cells (Human rhabdomyosarcoma cells) and Hela cells, obtained from ATCC, were cultured in DMEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heated-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS); Enterovirus A71 BrCr strain (EV-A71 BrCr), a kind gift from Prof. F. van Kuppeveld (University of Utrecht), was propagated on RD cells with 2% FBS-DMEM. L929-human SCARB2 cells and L929-human PSGL1 cells were kindly provided by Prof. Satoshi Koike (Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Japan) and were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% sodium bicarbonate, 1% L-glutamine and 10Î¼g/ml puromycin. To reduce sulfate from the cell surface, 50mM of sodium chlorate (NaClO
 <sub>3</sub>) was added to the culture medium one week before the experiment. EV-A71 clinical isolates were obtained from Dr. Shih-Cheng Chang (Chang Guang University) or purchased from The National Collection of Pathogenic Viruses (NCPV).
