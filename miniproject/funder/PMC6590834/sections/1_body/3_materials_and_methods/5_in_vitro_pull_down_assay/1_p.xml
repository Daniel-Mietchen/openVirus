<p>Recombinant plasmid pPSGL-1-Fc was transfected in HEK-293T cells. After 36-48h, cells were harvested and lysed (1% Triton X-100 in NTE buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail) for 30 min in ice. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation 15,000 × g for 15 minutes. To confirm pPSGL-1 expression, the supernatant was subjected to Western-blot with goat anti-Human IgG Fc antibody. After confirmation, the soluble recombinant PSGL1-Fc was incubated with protein G Dynal beads (Sigma) overnight at 4° C on a rotary mixer. Unbound PSGL1-Fc was removed after 3 washes with cold TBS. The EV-A71 viruses were mixed with indicated concentrations of compounds at 37° C for 1 hour. Next, the beads loaded with PSGL1 were incubated with viruses in presence/absence of compounds at 4° C for 2 hours. After 3 washing with TBS to remove the unbound virus, beads were treated with 2x laemmli buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) and subject to 10% SDS-PAGE and further Western-blot with EV-A71_VP1 MaxPab rabbit polyclonal antibody and goat anti-Human IgG Fc antibody. For heparin-Sepharose coated beads, after 3 washing with TBS to remove the unbound virus, lysis buffer was added and viral RNA was extracted and quantified by real time qRT-PCR.</p>
