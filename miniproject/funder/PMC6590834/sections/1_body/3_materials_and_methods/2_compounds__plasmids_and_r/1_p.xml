<p>The Trp-containing dendrimer MADAL385 was synthesized as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Vapendavir and pirodavir were kindly provided by Aviafen Therapeutics and A. Muigg, respectively. Suramin sodium salt and heparin sodium were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All compounds were dissolved in DMSO and stored at 4Â°C. The plasmid pEV-A71 (Nagoya-VP231) was generously provided by Dr. Arita (National Institute of Infectious Disease, Japan) and was modified to carry the viral genome of EV-A71 BrCr (pEV-A71-BrCr) by classic cloning. For the construction of EV-A71BrCr-mCherry, the genome of EV-A71 BrCr was inserted to a pShuttle-BAC vector. In the spacer region between the 5'UTR and VP4, mCherry gene was inserted and flanked by 2A
 <sup>pro</sup> cutting sites. The plasmids pLX304-PSGL-1 was purchased from DNASU, and vector pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc1 was from InvivoGen. PSGL-1 extracellular region was cloned into the expression vector pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc1 to create recombinant protein with human IgG Fc-tag at the C-terminal domain (pPSGL1-hFc). The EV-A71 VP1 purified MaxPab rabbit polyclonal antibody was obtained from Abnova. Goat anti-Human IgG Fc cross-absorbed secondary antibody, HRP was purchased from Thermo Scientific. Heparin Sepharose CL-6B and Dynabeads Protein G were supplied by Pharmacia and Thermo Scientific, respectively.
