<p>EV-A71_11316 was purified as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Briefly, EV-A71_11316 was propagated in HeLa cells for 24 h. The media and cells were collected and processed by freezing and thawing three times. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation and the supernatant was precipitated with sodium chloride and polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000. After ultracentrifugation through a 30% sucrose buffer cushion, the pellets were resuspended and applied to a 10 to 35% K-tartrate step gradient. The virus was collected and dialyzed against 10 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, pH 7.5.
