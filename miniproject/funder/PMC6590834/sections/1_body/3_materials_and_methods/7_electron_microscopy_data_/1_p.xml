<p>EM samples were prepared and data sets were recorded at the Pennsylvania State University—Huck Institutes of the Life Sciences in the following way: prior to incubation and vitrification of the sample, the virus buffer was exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). MADAL385 was incubated at 2.8 μM with about 58 nM of the virus at 37°C for 1 hour, which equates to four copies of molecule per each of vertex on the virus capsid. Three microliters of each sample was pipetted onto a Quantifoil R2/1 grid (Quantifoil Micro Tools GmbH, Jena, Germany), blotted to remove excess, and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot (Thermo Fisher, USA). Grids were imaged in a Titan Krios G3 under automated control of the FEI EPU software. An atlas image was assembled from micrographs taken at 165x magnification on a FEI BM-Ceta camera, and suitable areas were selected for imaging on the FEI Falcon 3EC direct electron detector. The microscope was operated at 300 kV with a 70 μm condenser aperture and a 100 μm objective aperture. Magnification was set at 59,000x yielding a calibrated pixel size of 1.1 Å. Images were recorded in movie mode saving 44 fraction images, each fraction including 56 frames. The total accumulated exposure was 46 e
