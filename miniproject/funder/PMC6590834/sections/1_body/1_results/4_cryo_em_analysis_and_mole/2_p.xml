<p>To complement the cryo-EM analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit water were performed on both the free MADAL385 (for conformational sampling) and its complex with the VP1 pentamer (for assessing pose stability and characterization of intermolecular interactions). In the case of the Cα-restrained complex, the pentaerythritol core of the tetrapodal MADAL385 was initially lodged in the external pore region corresponding to the highest electron density while three of its ‘legs’ projected into the inter-subunit crevices and the remaining one occupied the outer part of the pore (

 </bold>). In this location at the 5-fold axis, the Trp carboxylates and indole rings of MADAL385 establish interactions with the positively charged residues and the hydrophobic cavities. This binding mode is reminiscent of the binding to sulfated Tyr residues
