<p>The location of the two MADAL385-resistance mutations and the eight sensitivity mutations were mapped on the atomic model of EV-A71 (

 </bold>). Among those, the sensitivity variant VP1_148P, is located on the surface of the channel at the 5-fold axis (

 </bold>) and is found within the electron density envelope connected to MADAL385 density. The presence of a positively charged arginine residue in the BrCr strain (instead of a proline) may provide an explanation for the reduced drug sensitivity of this lab strain. Two other residues, VP1_244K and 245Y, with their corresponding side-chains extended towards MADAL385, are also found within the density envelope at the interface between capsid and drug (

 </bold>). The two resistance mutations, VP1_184T and 246S, are located closely to the drug density but are not found within the density envelope

 </bold>, therefore interactions between MADAL385 and those residues cannot be verified or excluded based on the cryo-EM result. The rest of the other sensitivity mutations are distal from the cryo-EM densities corresponding to MADAL385, suggesting origins for the susceptible phenotypes (such as adaptive mutations) other than the physical binding of the drug. Further interpretation was limited because of the icosahedral symmetry averaging applied during the cryo-EM reconstruction on the asymmetrically bound drug molecules.
