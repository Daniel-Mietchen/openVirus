<p>HS and PSGL1 have been proposed to play critical roles in the early steps of EV-A71 infection by interacting with the positive charges at the 5-fold vertex of the EV-A71 capsid. In addition, our structural analysis suggests that the binding site of MADAL385 overlaps with the binding sites of both receptors. We hence hypothesized that MADAL385 exerts its antiviral activity by blocking virus attachment to PSGL1 and/or HS. The experimental setup is depicted in

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g004">Fig 4A</xref>
 </bold>. Binding-inhibition assays were performed with heparin or PSGL1-coupled beads in either the presence of MADAL385 or reference compounds and the extent of inhibition was quantified by RT-qPCR or Western-blot. First, the ability to bind soluble heparin was assessed by neutralization assay for the BrCr, MADAL385-resistant and sensitive EV-A71 strains. Similar sensitivity is noted across the different viruses (

 </bold>). Next, HS-binding inhibition assay revealed that binding affinity between heparin and EV-A71 BrCr is gradually lost with increasing concentration of MADAL385 (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g004">Fig 4C</xref>
 </bold>). In contrast, MADAL385 does not inhibit heparin binding of the resistant strain (EV-A71 VP1_S184T_P245S), even at the highest concentration tested (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g004">Fig 4D</xref>
 </bold>). Interestingly, and in line with the high susceptibility to the antiviral action of MADAL385, binding of the recombinant EV-A71 BrCr_VP1(11316) strain to heparin is inhibited by MADAL385 more efficiently as compared to the BrCr strain, with more than 50% binding affinity lost at low micromolar concentrations (

 </bold>). As expected, the pocket binder pirodavir does not significantly affect binding of EV-A71 to heparin, whereas suramin completely blocks heparin binding of all viruses (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g004">Fig 4C–4E</xref>
 </bold>). Next, the effect of MADAL385 on the interaction of PSGL1 with EV-A71 was studied. For this purpose, PSGL1-Fc was over-expressed in HEK293T cells (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007760.s007">S7 Fig</xref>
 </bold>) and concentrated on protein G beads. MADAL385, akin to suramin, blocks binding of the EVA71-PB strain to PSGL1 in a concentration-dependent manner. The capsid binder pirodavir has, as expected, no effect on this binding event (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g004">Fig 4F</xref>
 </bold>). To determine whether MADAL385 affects attachment to PSGL1 and HS during infection, we employed human SCARB2- or PSGL1-overexpressing L929 cells. EV-A71_812 strain, a PSGL1 binding strain sensitive to MADAL385 (EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 1.78 ± 0.81nM) was used to study binding to the cell receptors in presence of MADAL385 (0.1 μM). To account for (and exclude) the contribution of HS, L929-SCARB2 and PSGL1 cells were treated in parallel with sodium chlorate (NaClO
 <sub>3</sub>, 50mM), an inhibitor of cell-surface sulfation. MADAL385 greatly reduced the binding of EV-A71 to both L929-SCARB2 and PSGL1 cells; however, in NaClO
 <sub>3</sub>-treated cells, MADAL385 effectively reduced binding of EV-A71 to L929- PSGL1 but not to L929-SCARB2 cells (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g005">Fig 5A</xref>
 </bold>). Quantification of the infectious content of EV-A71_812 in L929-SCARB2 and PSGL1 cells treated with MADAL385 in presence of NaClO
 <sub>3</sub> recapitulate the data of the binding assay; i.e. MADAL385 is only effective against EV-A71 in L929- PSGL1 cells (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g005">Fig 5B</xref>
 </bold>). These data support the hypothesis that MADAL385 blocks EV-A71 infection by preventing viral attachment to either HS, PSGL1 or both.
