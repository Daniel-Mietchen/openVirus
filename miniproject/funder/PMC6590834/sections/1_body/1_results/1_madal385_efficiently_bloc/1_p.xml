<p>From the series of Trp dendrimers endowed with high

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g001">Fig 1A</xref>
 </bold>) was selected for further mechanistic studies (EC
 <sub>50</sub> against the lab-adapted BrCr strain: 0.29 ± 0.07 μM, CC
 <sub>50</sub>: 30.0 ± 2.5 μM) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In a cytopathic effect (CPE)-based reduction assay, MADAL385 is ~1,800 to ~20,000-fold more effective against a representative EV-A71 clinical isolate (EV-A71_11316, geno-group B2) than two earlier reported EV-A71 inhibitors, namely pirodavir [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and suramin [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] (

 </bold>). MADAL385 inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, (i) the formation of infectious EV-A71 BrCr particles (

 </bold>) and (ii) the replication of a mCherry-reporter EV-A71 BrCr (

 </bold>). MADAL385 inhibits the early stages of EV-A71 replication [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and to precisely determine which step of viral entry is targeted, binding and internalization assays were performed with pirodavir and suramin as reference. MADAL385 (10 μM) markedly reduces -akin to suramin- the binding of EV-A71 to the host cells and prevents as well the internalization of the virus (

 </bold>). In contrast, pirodavir does not show any inhibitory activity in either the binding or the internalization assays, which is in line with the reported mechanism of action (i.e. inhibition of viral uncoating). By tightly binding in the hydrophobic pocket, “classical’ capsid binders such as pirodavir and pleconaril increase the rigidity of the viral particle and, as a consequence, its resistance to heat inactivation. MADAL385, in marked contrast to the capsid-binder pirodavir protects the virus only slightly against heat inactivation (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g001">Fig 1E</xref>
 </bold>). Taken together, these results suggest that MADAL385 blocks viral attachment by binding to the virus particle in a region outside the hydrophobic pocket.
