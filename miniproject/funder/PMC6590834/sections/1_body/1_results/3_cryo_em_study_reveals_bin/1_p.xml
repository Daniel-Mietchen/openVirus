<p>To define the binding area of MADAL385 and to understand the possible mechanism underlying resistance and susceptibility to the compound, cryo-EM single particle analysis of MADAL385 bound to the EV-A71_11316 strain was performed. Purified EV-A71_11316 particles were vitrified before and after incubation with MADAL385 (cryo-EM 2D class average images

 </bold>). The corresponding three-dimensional (3D) maps were reconstructed at 3.3 and 3.6 Å resolutions, respectively, by applying icosahedral-symmetry averaging and using the images from a Falcon-3 direct electron detector

 </bold>, indicating that the incubation with MADAL did not cause any significant conformational change on the viral capsid proteins. In the two atomic models, the pocket factor lipid (sphingosine) has slightly different conformations, but the corresponding cryo-EM densities have similar intensities (

 </bold>), suggesting that the drug binding likely induces subtle conformational changes around the pocket region but does not initiate pocket factor release. When the two 3D reconstructions were compared, strong extra densities were identified on the 5-fold vertices of the EV-A71_11316-MADAL385 complex (

 </bold>), indicating that MADAL385 binds on the 5-fold vertex. The drug density fills the pore on the 5-fold symmetry axis and is connected to the capsid density. Also, the density intensity is comparable to that of the capsid shell (

 </bold>). Thus, MADAL385 binds on the 5-fold vertex and full saturation of the binding sites is achieved by the incubation. In particular, the intensity of MADAL385 density was highest at the symmetry axis, suggesting that the bound drug molecule occupies the very centric area of the 5-fold vertex. Due to steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion, these observations suggest that only one molecule of MADAL385 binds on each vertex (
