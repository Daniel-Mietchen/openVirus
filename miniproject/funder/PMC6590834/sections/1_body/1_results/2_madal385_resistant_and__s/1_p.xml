<p>To gain first insights into the putative binding site of MADAL385, two independent, MADAL385-resistant strains were generated via a stepwise clonal resistance selection procedure (

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g002">Fig 2A</xref>
 </bold>). Full genome sequence analysis revealed two amino acid replacements in the capsid protein VP1 of the BrCr strain: S184T and P246S (

  <xref rid="ppat.1007760.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
 </bold>). To confirm that S184T and P246S are responsible for resistance to MADAL385, the single or double mutant(s) were engineered by site-directed mutagenesis in the EV-A71 BrCr strain infectious clone. All mutant variants show replication kinetics comparable to that of the wild-type virus (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007760.s002">S2A Fig</xref>
 </bold>). The susceptibility of the single S184T and P246S mutants to MADAL385 is decreased by 7- and 17-fold, respectively; the double mutant (S184T_P246S) confers the highest (32-fold) resistance to the compound (

  <xref rid="ppat.1007760.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>)
 </bold>. Next, to address the role of viral VP1 in antiviral susceptibility, we engineered a recombinant virus by swapping the VP1 of the BrCr strain with that of the EV-A71 11316 clinical isolate, against which MADAL385 is ≥1000-fold more potent (BrCr strain EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0.28 ± 0.01μM versus 11316 strain EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0.21 ± 0.03nM) (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g002">Fig 2B</xref>
 </bold>). The susceptibility of the recombinant EV-A71 BrCr_VP1 (11316) strain to MADAL385 increases dramatically to the level observed with the clinical isolate (EC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0.12 ± 0.02nM) (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g002">Fig 2C</xref>
 </bold>). A comparison of sequences of BrCr and selected circulating EV-A71 clinical isolates (including EV-A71_11316) revealed 8 amino acid differences in the viral VP1 (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007760.s002">S2B Fig</xref>
 </bold>). These residues were individually engineered into the BrCr infectious clone. Only R148P and L241S mutants show an increased sensitivity to the drug, without however fully restoring the susceptibility of the EV-A71_11316 strain (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g002">Fig 2D</xref>
 </bold>). Altogether, these data further point towards the VP1 as the molecular target of MADAL385. Notably, most of the sensitivity and resistance residues are located in the proximity of the 5-fold vertex of the EV-A71 capsid, in a region known to be involved in HS and PSGL1 receptor binding [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] (
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007760.g002">Fig 2E</xref>
 </bold>). As expected, both the MADAL385-resistant strain and the more susceptible recombinant strain EV-A71 BrCr_VP1(11316) were shown to retain wild-type sensitivity to the capsid binders pirodavir and vapendavir. However, to our surprise, no cross-resistance with suramin was observed, despite the fact that this molecule was earlier reported to interact with the positively charged region surrounding the 5-fold axis of the capsid [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition, when combined, MADAL385 and suramin result in a strong synergistic

 <sup>2</sup>% (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007760.s002">S2C Fig</xref>
 </bold>). According to MacSynergy method [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], values over 100 μM
 <sup>2</sup>% indicate strong and biologically relevant synergy. The lack of cross-resistance and the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> synergistic effect thus suggest a different mode of antiviral action of MADAL385 and suramin.
