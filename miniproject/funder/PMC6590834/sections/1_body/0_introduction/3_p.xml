<p>A well-known class of inhibitors of entero- and rhinovirus entry (such as pirodavir, pleconaril and vapendavir) bind into a hydrophobic pocket under the floor of the viral “canyon” formed by VP1. Drug binding prevents receptor interaction and/or increases particle stability, which in turn blocks the conformational changes required for viral uncoating [
