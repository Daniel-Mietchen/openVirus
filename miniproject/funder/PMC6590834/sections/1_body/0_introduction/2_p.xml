<p>EV-A71 has been reported to bind to several cell surface receptors, including scavenger receptor B2 (SCARB2) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL1) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Other host factors such as cyclophilin A, annexin II, sialylated glycans, vimentin, nucleolin, fibronectin and prohibitin have also been reported to promote infection, although their importance in viral entry is still less noted [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It has been shown that EV-A71 interaction with PSGL1 on leukocytes requires the presence of sulfated tyrosine (Tyr) residues at the N-terminal region of PSGL1 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and depends on two highly conserved lysine residues, VP1_244K and VP1_242K, near the 5-fold vertex of the viral capsid [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A spatially close residue, VP1_145, is another determinant for PSGL1 binding [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly to PSGL1, HS has also been proposed to interact near the 5-fold vertex of the viral capsid [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
