<p>In the present work, we elaborate on the precise molecular mechanism of action of the lead compound MADAL385 by means of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> biological assays, cryo-EM analysis and molecular modeling. Our data support a model of activity by which a single MADAL385 molecule binds on each of the 5-fold vertices of the EV-A71 capsid, thereby blocking the engagement of the virus with host receptors PSGL1 and/or HS.
