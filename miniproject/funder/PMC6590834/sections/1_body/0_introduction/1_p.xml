<p>Since the first large outbreak in 1997, enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) (genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>) has been reported to cause 2–3 year cyclic epidemics in the Asia-Pacific region [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In the last two decades, the increasing number of EV-A71 cases and the spread of the virus across Asia have raised major concerns about its pandemic potential. The virus is primarily transmitted by the oral-fecal route [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Most EV-A71 infections are characterized by mild symptoms, with the typical signs of the hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD): slight fever, red rashes on the palms of hand and soles of feet, and ulcers in the mouth. However, EV-A71 infections are also associated to severe neurological complications (such as encephalitis, aseptic meningitis and poliomyelitis-like syndrome) and acute pulmonary edema, which may be highly limiting and fatal particularly in children under the age of 5 years [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 2010, a large outbreak of HFMD in China resulted in an estimated 1.7 million cases and 905 deaths [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A sub-genogroup C4 EV-A71-inactivated vaccine has recently been approved in China, but worldwide coverage and long-term protection still need to be addressed [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There are no antiviral agents approved against EV-A71 nor against any other enteroviruses.
