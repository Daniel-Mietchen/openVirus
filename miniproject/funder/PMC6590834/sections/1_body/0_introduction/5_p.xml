<p>Recently, we discovered a class of inhibitors with dual activity against HIV and EV-A71 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The lead compound of this family, MADAL385, is a tetrapodal derivative with a pentaerythritol core, 4 trivalent spacer arms and 12 tryptophan (Trp) residues on the periphery [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Because the tryptophan dendrimers are linked to the central scaffold through their amino groups, their carboxylates are free and exposed to the solvent. Our earlier biological studies demonstrated that MADAL derivatives inhibit HIV entry into its target cell by interaction with glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 of the viral surface [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For EV-A71, we demonstrated that MADAL derivatives exhibit low micromolar activity against the lab-adapted strain BrCr and low-nanomolar/high-picomolar activity against a large panel of EV-A71 clinical isolates from different genogroups and various geographic origins [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007760.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on the periphery and central scaffold of MADAL highlighted the importance of free carboxylic groups for optimal antiviral activity, those carried by Trp or Tyr residues.
