   <bold>(A)</bold> Superposition of 10 cooled and energy-minimized structures from the MD simulation, each separated by 5 ns and covering a total simulation time of 50 ns. Each VP1 subunit is displayed in a different color and MADAL385 is shown as sticks, with C-atoms colored in grey. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Simplified cartoon representation of VP1 in complex with MADAL385 (sticks). The view is rotated 90 degrees about the X-axis with respect to that shown in (A). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Detail from one of the complexes shown in (B) in which each VP1 subunit displays as sticks the side chains of MADAL385-interacting residues K244, T245, and P246.
