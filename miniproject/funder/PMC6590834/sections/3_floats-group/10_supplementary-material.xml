  <title>Comparison of the pocket factor before and after drug incubation.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> A superimposition of the atomic models without drug incubated (green) and with drug incubated (magenta) showing the pocket factor and neighboring residues. 
   <bold>(B and C)</bold> Cryo-EM densities for the pocket factor and pocket area. Slab densities from the EV-A17_11316 map (B) and virus-MADAL385 complex map (C) were shown in grey mesh in addition to the corresponding atomic models. Densities connecting the pocket factor with VP1 residues that are weaker in the complex map were marked by asterisks in (C). The blue star marks the site of VP3 Ile-23. Although this site has a connecting density without drug (B), there is no pocket factor-connecting density when the drug is present.
