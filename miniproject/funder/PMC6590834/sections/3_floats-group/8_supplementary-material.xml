   <bold>(A)</bold> Replication kinetics of EV-A71 BrCr, VP1_S184T, VP1_P246S and VP1_S184T_P246S. EV-A71 Infections were determined by end-point titration at indicated time-points post infection. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Sequence alignment of the VP1 of EV-A71 clinical isolates and the lab-adapted strain BrCr. The amino acid (AA) positions in BrCr which are different from clinical isolates are highlighted in red, and clinical isolates are highlighted in blue. The compound resistant AA substitutions are highlighted in grey. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Combination study of MADAL385 and suramin with Mac synergy method. Mean volumes of synergy are presented based on 99.9% confidence values using the MacSynergy II template (Prichard and Shipman). Values above, under and in the zero plane indicate synergistic, antagonistic and additive activity, respectively. Error bars represent the mean Â± SD of at least 2 independent experiments with three replicates.
