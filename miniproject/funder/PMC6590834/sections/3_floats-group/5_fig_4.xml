  <title>MADAL385 blocks the engagement of EV-A71 to its receptors.</title>
  <p>(A) Scheme of the receptor binding inhibition assay setup. (B) Relative neutralization of EV-A71 BrCr, VP1_S184T_P246S and VP1(11316) to heparin. Data are expressed in percentage compared to EV-A71 BrCr (WT). Heparin-coated beads were incubated with (C) EV-A71 BrCr, (D) EV-A71 VP1_S184T_P246S and (E) EV-A71 BrCr_VP1(11316) in presence of indicated concentration of MADAL385 and other reference compounds, binding was measured by RT-qPCR. The graph represents the RNA binding levels relative to the untreated group (DMSO). Error bars represent the mean ± SD of at least 2 independent experiments with at least 2 replicates. Statistical analysis was performed using the one-way ANOVA test; **p&lt;0.01, ****p&lt;0.0001. (F) Lysate of HEK293 cells overexpressing PSGL1-Fc was incubated with protein G beads in TBS buffer overnight at 4°C. EV-A71 BrCr (non-PB) and EV-A71_11316 (PB) were added in the presence of selected compounds. Attachment was determined by Western-blot with EV-A71 VP1-specific antibody or anti-human IgG Fc antibody.</p>
