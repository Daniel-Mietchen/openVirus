  <title>The atomic resolution structures were solved for EV-A71_11316 strain and MADAL385 to interpret the interaction of virus and compound.</title>
  <p>(A) The ribbon diagram (VP1-4 as blue, green, red, and yellow, respectively) of the atomic model of the EV-A71_11316 clinical isolate capsid built into the cryo-EM 3D reconstruction map. Asymmetric unit and symmetry axes are indicated. (B) The four capsid proteins, VP-1 to VP-4 (from left to right), from the EV-A71_11316 strain and the EV-A71-MADAL385 complex were super-imposed yielding an average RMSD 0.292 Å. The central sections of the cryo-EM densities (C) and the surface rendered maps (D) for EV-A71 alone (left) and EV-A71-MADAL385 complex (right) show that the complex includes strong extra densities on the capsid surface at the 5-fold icosahedral symmetry axis (yellow arrow) (symmetry axes indicated). The surface rendered maps displayed in orientation indicated in (A) clearly distinguishes the extra densities at the 5-fold symmetry axes (yellow). (E and F) The residues identified from the resistant (red spheres) and susceptible (blue spheres) mutants were mapped on the VP-1 pentamer (E) and monomer (F). The monomer in (F) represents the monomer colored in gold in (E). The segmented drug density was shown in a transparent tan surface rendering. (G) Residues of one VP1 molecule comprising the 5-fold illustrates P148 (blue), K244 and Y245 (green) which were identified in the continuous density envelope connected to the MADAL385 densities at a contour level of σ = 1. The location of Q145 (orange) is also shown.</p>
