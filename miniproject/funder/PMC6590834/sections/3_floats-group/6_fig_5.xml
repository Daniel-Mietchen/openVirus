  <title>Anti-EV-A71 effect of MADAL385 on L929-SCARB2 and PSGL1 cells.</title>
  <p>(A) Binding assay of EV-A71_812 to L929-SCARB2 and PSGL1 overexpressing cells in either the presence or absence of MADAL385. A condition with cells pre-treated with sodium chlorate (NaClO3, 50mM) which prevents cell-surface sulfation was also included. The graph represents the RNA levels of bound virus relative to the L929-SCARB2 infected and L929-SCARB2 infected pre-treated with NaClO3 condition, respectively. (B) MADAL385 inhibits EV-A71 infection of L929-SCARB2 and PSGL1 cells. L929-SCARB2 and PSGL1 cells were infected with EV-A71_812 in presence or absence of MADAL385 and in presence or absence of NaClO3 (50mM). Twenty-four hours (24h) after infection, viral progeny was quantified by end-point titration. Error bars represent the mean Â± SD of at least 2 independent experiments with 3 replicates each. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student t- test; ns, not significant; *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001; ****p&lt;0.0001.</p>
