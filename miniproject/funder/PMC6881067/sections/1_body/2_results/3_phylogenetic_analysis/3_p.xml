<p>The DENV-3 (n = 13) sequences obtained in this study were analysed with 22 reference sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007889.g003">Fig 3</xref>) from genotypes I to V. Based on this analysis, all the sample sequences clustered with strains from genotype V, including with the first DENV-3 genotype V strain isolated in the Philippines in 1956 (M93130) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] as well as with isolates that were detected in India in 2009 (KC787098) and in Brazil in 2002 (EF629371). Genotype V is represented by early Asian strains and were recently detected among patients during outbreaks in Brazil and Colombia [
