 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquito collected in Selangor in 2017. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this strain belonged to genotype I, one of the most prevalent genotypes in Southeast Asia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The strain clustered closely with two other isolates, namely one from Hawaii in 1944 (EU848545) and another more recent isolate from China in 2015 (KU094071). Many DENV-1 strains isolated between the 1940s and 2010s from Southeast Asia also belong to this genotype, including Malaysian isolates from Johor Bahru (KX452068) and the Klang Valley (JN697058).
