<p>The DENV-4 (n = 18) sequences obtained in this study were analysed with 16 reference sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007889.g004">Fig 4</xref>) from genotypes I to III as well as three sylvatic strains (genotype IV). Genotype III is specifically found in neighbouring Thailand, with genotypes I and II represented by strains from Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka, the Caribbean and the Americas [
