<p>From May 2016 to April 2017, 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larvae and adult mosquitoes were collected from two urban areas (Selangor and Kuala Lumpur) in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. Localities within Selangor and Kuala Lumpur were selected along a transect line extending from East to West. In total, nine sites were selected for sampling in each area (labelled A to I) for a total of 18 sampling sites. The sampling regimen used included one central site per locality (SJ-E and BJ-E) set approximately 12 km apart. Each area was segmented into three parallel lines 1 km apart from North to South. A series of three sampling sites, each at least 200 m apart, were identified at each segmented line (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the coordinates of each site and their associated land cover. Prior permission was obtained from owners and residents for the study, which was conducted on private land and residences. Samples were collected at monthly intervals using ovitraps for larvae and light traps for adult mosquitoes. Every month, 30 ovitraps were set in shaded locations indoors and outdoors and collected after five days. One light trap was set at each site and collected after 24 hours. In total, 9 light traps and 270 ovitraps were collected from each area every month and transported back to the laboratory for processing. A trap was recorded as positive when it contained 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes of any species. Each sample was identified by species using keys by Rueda [
