<p>cDNA synthesis was performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For detection of DENV, nested PCR was carried out as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In brief, a total of 1,441 field-caught 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larvae and adult mosquitoes were individually harvested for RNA and subjected to nested PCR. The first and second round of PCR amplification was carried out using the DENV consensus primers Dcon [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], D1 and D2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. To determine the DENV serotype present, the amplified DNA sequence was subjected to multiplex PCR using the same forward D1 primer and four reverse primers TS1, TS2, TS3 and TS4 for each serotype DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4, respectively [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The primers used for PCR amplification are detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007889.s001">S1 Table</xref>. Positive controls for each DENV serotype (DENV-1-DENV-4) as detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007889.s002">S2 Table</xref> and a negative control (nuclease-free water) were included separately. All PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by sequencing the positive PCR products. The expected sizes of the amplified products were 429nt for DENV-1, 70nt for DENV-2, 240nt for DENV-3 and 351nt for DENV-4.
