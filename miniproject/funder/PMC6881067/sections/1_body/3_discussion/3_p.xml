<p>DENV-4 has not been associated with major DENV epidemics in Malaysia since the 1960s [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and appears to be circulating at a lower prevalence compared to the other three. In this study, sylvatic DENV-4 strains were detected in both 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> larvae collected from Selangor and Kuala Lumpur in Peninsular Malaysia. The large numbers of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> collected in urban areas in the study is concerning, as this vector has high potential to act as a ‘bridging vector’ and, in the absence of the primary vector 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, contribute to dengue epidemics amongst susceptible human populations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, the DENV-4 isolates in this study were determined by phylogenetic analysis to be a sylvatic strain that is very closely related to sylvatic DENV-4 sequences isolated from 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>niveus</italic> (EF457906) and sentinel monkeys (JF262779 and JF262780) by Rudnick in Malaysia in the 1970s [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In West Africa, the forest-dwelling 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>furcifer</italic> is known to circulate amongst rural villages and is capable of transmitting sylvatic DENV to resident human populations. In the study by Diallo and colleagues, this vector, along with other vectors such as 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>luteocephalus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>vittatus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were susceptible to infection with both sylvatic and urban strains of DENV-2, although the latter two vectors displayed a lower susceptibility to infection [
