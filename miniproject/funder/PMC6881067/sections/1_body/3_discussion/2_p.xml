<p>In Malaysia, the most common strain of DENV-3 has been from genotype III, which has circulated in the country for more than three decades and is one of the most widely distributed DENV genotypes globally [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. All DENV-3-RNA-positive samples in the current study belonged to genotype V, a lineage that was identified by Wittke et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] as a group of viruses that were previously classified as genotype I [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], but displayed amino acid changes that distinguished them from this genotype. Hence the DENV-3 viruses were separated into five main groups with the addition of the fifth genotype. Viruses belonging to genotype V include old Asian viruses and have not been associated with cases of DHF until recently, when a fatal case of DHF due to this genotype was identified in Brazil in 2003 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The same genotype V virus was detected in patients in Colombia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and in field-captured 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes in dengue-endemic areas in Thailand in 2011 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Thus far, this genotype has not been reported in Malaysia. All DENV-3 isolates in this study were closely related to the early Asian isolates, however as the sequence available in this study was only from the CprM region of the genome a detailed assessment of the relationship between the different strains could not be carried out. Further study on the full sequence of this genotype will be necessary to determine the origins and pathogenicity of the virus.
