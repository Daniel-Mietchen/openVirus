<p>Evidence of the ability of sylvatic DENV to emerge from an enzootic cycle to infect humans, as well as their presence in urban vector populations in this study, raises concerns over the potential of these viruses to cause significant outbreaks in the future. There have been recent reports of human infections with highly divergent strains of DENV-1 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and DENV-2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] in travellers returning from Borneo to Australia. The ability of these suspected sylvatic strains to spill over and cause human disease raises significant public health concerns especially with increased travel and exposure of susceptible populations. The growing population of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> and its opportunistic feeding behaviour would make it the most likely vector for transmission of DENV to both primate and non-primate hosts which may act as virus reservoirs in urban settings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, thus far there is no experimental evidence of this route. The current study was also based on relatively short sequence lengths of less than 500nt and confined to two localities within the Klang Valley. Hence more extensive molecular epidemiology studies will be required to ascertain virus lineage and whether detected virus strains are also present in other parts of the country. It is unclear if the sylvatic DENV-4 lineage detected in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> larva in this study will be present in adult mosquitoes for onwards transmission and subsequently cause similar disease in humans and warrants further work into the vector competence of vectors infected with this virus. Nevertheless, the possibility of such infections will need to be taken into account in future prevention and control programs in the country.
