<p>DENV is a 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> with four antigenically distinct serotypes, namely DENV serotype 1 to serotype 4 (DENV-1 to DENV-4) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The virus circulates in two distinct transmission cycles; the sylvatic cycle between the vector mosquito and non-human primates, and the human transmission cycle involving domestic and peridomestic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Sylvatic strains of DENV serotypes 1, 2 and 4 have been isolated from sentinel monkeys in Peninsular Malaysia, with the presence of sylvatic DENV-3 inferred based on the seroconversion of sentinel monkeys [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007889.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Compared to sylvatic DENV strains detected in Africa, phylogenetic studies have noted the presence of a wider diversity of sylvatic DENV strains in Malaysia, suggesting that a DENV ancestor most likely originated in the Asian region and subsequently diverged into at least four DENV serotypes that are currently circulating [
