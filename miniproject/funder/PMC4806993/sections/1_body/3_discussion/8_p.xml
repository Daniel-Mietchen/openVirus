<p>Our study's findings may be a useful basis for future efforts to forecast EV-A71 HFMD epidemics in Malaysia. Occurrence of EV-A71 epidemics may be predicted by seroprevalence rates in children and influenced by temperature and number of rain days. The changing population immunity, the effects of climate variables on the survival and spread of EV-A71 in the environment, the change in virus genetic diversity, and changing probability of transmission of EV-A71 due to changes in host behavior under certain climatic conditions may explain the seasonal cyclical patterns. Time-series analysis of real-time, high-quality surveillance and seroprevalence data may provide efficient detection and effective forecasting of EV-A71 epidemics. Future research may also focus on the potential influence of other HFMD enteroviruses in the cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics.</p>
