<p>The well-recognized cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics seen in some countries has been attributed to the time taken for accumulation of enough susceptible children in the population. In Tokyo, the overall EV-A71 seroprevalence dropped to its lowest point in 6 years during the months just preceding an epidemic in 1973, including an absence of antibodies in children &lt;4 years old [

Our study is unusual as it charts seroprevalence over a long period of time, covering 18 years and 6 epidemics, and we showed that changes in population immunity in children appear to be the major driving force of the observed cyclical epidemics. Specifically, we demonstrated that falls in seroprevalence were clearly associated with higher odds of a subsequent epidemic. Seroprevalence in both 1–6 and 7–12 years age groups increased in epidemic years, suggesting that both groups are involved in disease burden and transmission. The higher HFMD rates seen in children aged 1–6 years is most likely due to their greater susceptibility (as shown by their lower seroprevalence rates in non-epidemic years), but it may also be due to under-reporting in older children, who often have milder disease [
