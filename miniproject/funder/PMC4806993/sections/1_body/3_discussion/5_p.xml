<p>Estimation of the basic reproduction ratio (R
 <sub>0</sub>), or the number of secondary cases arising from an infectious case, has been widely used to study the dynamics of transmission of infectious diseases such as SARS and influenza [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The R
 <sub>0</sub> of EV-A71 has been estimated as 5.48, which is considered as moderately infectious [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The EV-A71 R
 <sub>0</sub> was higher than the estimated CV-A16 R
 <sub>0</sub> of 2.5, suggesting that EV-A71 is more transmissible. For such a transmissible virus, the epidemic size is mainly dependent on the size of the susceptible population [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Following a viral epidemic, most of the population at risk would become immune. It may then take 2–3 years for the susceptible population to be replenished by newborns, and to be large enough for the R
 <sub>0</sub> to increase to &gt;1, hence leading to a cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics every 2–3 years. A similar study should be conducted to determine the R
 <sub>0</sub> to further understand EV-A71 transmission dynamics in Malaysia.
