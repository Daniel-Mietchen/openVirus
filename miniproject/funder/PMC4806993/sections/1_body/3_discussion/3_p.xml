<p>The highest age-specific incidence of HFMD is seen in children &lt;2 years old (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004562.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This is consistent with the significant differences in age-specific EV-A71 seroprevalence seen between non-epidemic and epidemic years in those &lt;2 years old, particularly in the &lt;6 month (from 47.7% to 64.0%, p = 0.016) and 6 months to 1 year age groups (from 35.9% to 64.3%, p = 0.0016). If an EV-A71 vaccine, such as the inactivated vaccine that has recently shown promise in phase 3 trials [
