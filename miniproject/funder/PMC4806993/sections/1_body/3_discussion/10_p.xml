<p>In conclusion, falls in seroprevalence in children aged 1â€“12 years old are the major driving force of the cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics seen in Malaysia over 18 years. Nevertheless, possible interplay between seroprevalence with climatic variables and virus antigenic variations is evident and warrant future study. The highest age-specific incidence of disease, as shown by surveillance figures and seroprevalence rates, occurred in children &lt;2 years. Together with the seasonal and cyclical patterns observed, this study has provided important data which will impact vaccine planning, timing and target populations for vaccine programs.</p>
