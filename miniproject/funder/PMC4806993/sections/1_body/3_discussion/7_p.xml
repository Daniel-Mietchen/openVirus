<p>Overall, in other published studies, EV71-infected children have detectable neutralizing antibody titers against all the EV71 genotypes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Previous studies in humans, monkeys, rabbits and mice showed that neutralization antibody levels against different genotypes may vary, but overall human anti-serum generally does cross-neutralize strains of different genotypes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004562.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Lower neutralization titers may not reflect antigenic shift sufficient to lead to immune escape. To date, no cases of recurrent EV-A71 infection have been reported, suggesting the presence of life-long protective immunity against EV-A71. While enteroviruses clearly undergo antigenic evolution, complete immunological escape in EV-A71 seems to be rare, thus EV-A71 is generally considered to be a single serotype antigenically. Any possible clinical significance and contribution of reduced cross-protective immunity towards new epidemics will require further confirmation.
