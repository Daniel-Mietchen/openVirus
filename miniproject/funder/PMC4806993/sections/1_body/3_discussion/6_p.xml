<p>The present study also showed that Malaysian epidemics are characterized by peaks of increased genetic diversity, often with genotype changes. While the increased diversity may simply reflect a larger number of infections, we cannot exclude that new variants with antigenic changes may escape population immunity and contribute to cyclical epidemics. Although found in less than a quarter of Malaysian EV-A71, the positive selection pressure sites found at positions 98 and 145 of the VP1 protein have been previously reported [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Up to 4-fold neutralization reduction was seen in sera from children, adults and rabbits tested against an EV-A71 VP1-98K/145Q/164E mutant, and all neutralization titers were â‰¥ 1:16. However, viruses with all three mutations concomitantly have not yet been seen in nature. The significance of the antigenic variation will require more detailed longitudinal serological studies. If immune escape is not needed or plays only a minor role to produce the cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics, a significant accumulation of susceptible children between epidemics will be enough to support large-scale transmission and another epidemic.
