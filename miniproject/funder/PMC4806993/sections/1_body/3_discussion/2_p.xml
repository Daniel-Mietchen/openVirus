<p>We identified seropositive children from as early as 1995 and 1996, suggesting that EV-A71 was already circulating before the first documented epidemic in 1997. The presence of seropositive young children in interepidemic years shows that ongoing transmission occurs between epidemics. This is supported by laboratory reports of EV-A71 isolated in low numbers during interepidemic years [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which may affect environmental survival of enteroviruses. In the present study, the overall likelihood of an epidemic was influenced by temperature and rain days, but not rainfall or ultraviolet radiance. The effects of these climatic factors on virus survival and spread will require further investigation. The relationships of HFMD with climatic variables remain to be explored in detail in Malaysia, particularly as individual states may have widely varying weather.
