<p>This is consistent with the observed general trend of EV-A71 seroprevalence spiking during reported EV-A71 epidemic years, and seroprevalence falling between epidemics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004562.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). These results showed that younger children aged 1–6 years old had lower seroprevalence in non-epidemic years, indicating greater susceptibility, which may explain the higher HFMD incidence in this age group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004562.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The higher seropositive rates and GMT levels seen during epidemic years are likely to reflect recent infection. HFMD incidence in older children aged 7–12 years is considerably lower; thus, the higher GMT levels seen during epidemics are more likely to represent re-exposure to EV-A71 or milder infection resulting in under-reporting. Taken together, both the incidence rates and the seroprevalence data suggested that HFMD caused by EV-A71 affects susceptible children aged 1–12 years, and most frequently affects younger children aged 1–6 years.
