<p>To further investigate the driving force of diversification in EV-A71, selective pressure on the Malaysian EV-A71 VP1 was examined. The mean dN/dS (ratio of nonsynonymous substitution rate to synonymous substitution rate) was 0.058, and evolution of EV-A71 was driven by strong purifying selection with over 62% of the analyzed codons under negative selection pressure. Two codons at positions 98 and 145 were under positive selective pressure, likely resulting in the emergence of new virus variants or lineage extinction. About 9.8% (27/275) of the sequences showed E98K, 3.6% (10/275) were E145Q, and 9.1% (25/275) were E145G and these could be observed in different genotypes across different EV-A71 epidemics (
