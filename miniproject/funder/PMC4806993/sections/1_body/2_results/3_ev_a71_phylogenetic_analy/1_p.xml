<p>Many subgenotypes were co-circulating during EV-A71 epidemics. Subgenotypes B3, B4, C1 and C2 were present during the 1997 epidemic, but only subgenotypes B4 and C1 continued to circulate till 2001 and 2003, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004562.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). After 2003, subgenotype B5 became the sole genotype circulating in Malaysia. A Bayesian Skyride plot was used to estimate the evolutionary dynamics of EV-A71 in Malaysia over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004562.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Sharp, transient rises of genetic diversity were observed in the reported epidemic years 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2008/2009, and 2012. The decline in the effective population seen after the 1997 epidemic may coincide with purifying selection against subgenotypes B3 and C2. The decline in the effective population observed after the 2000 and 2003 epidemics may indicate purifying selection against subgenotypes B4 and C1, respectively. After 2006, when only subgenotype B5 was circulating, interepidemic viral diversity showed overall decline punctuated by spikes during the epidemic years of 2008/2009 and 2012.
