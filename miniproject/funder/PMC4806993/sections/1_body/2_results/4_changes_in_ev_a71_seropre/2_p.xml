<p>To further understand the relationship between recurrent EV-A71 epidemics and other factors such as seroprevalence, age and climatic variables, time series analysis was performed (
 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The monthly seroprevalence was positively associated with the odds of an epidemic period in the univariate analysis (OR for every 10% increase in seroprevalence, 1.40; 95% CI 1.18–1.65; 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for plausible confounding factors such as age, temperature, rainfall, rain days, and ultraviolet radiance (adjusted OR for every 10% increase in seroprevalence, 1.45; 95% CI 1.24–1.69; 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001). This means that every 10% increase in monthly seroprevalence is associated with 45% higher odds of an epidemic, which is consistent with the observation that seroprevalence rates are higher during epidemics. We then examined whether relative changes in seroprevalence over time were associated with epidemics. Every 10% decrease in EV-A71 seroprevalence between preceding and current months was not significantly associated with epidemics in univariate analysis; but there was a significant association in multivariate analysis (aOR, 1.16; CI 1.01–1.35; 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.034). This shows that every 10% fall in monthly seroprevalence compared to the preceding month is associated with 16% higher odds of an epidemic.
