<p>Interaction between seroprevalence, age and epidemic periods was first evaluated in the model for possible heterogeneous effects in different strata of age groups. The association between a 10% increase in monthly seroprevalence and odds of an epidemic was 1.41 (95% CI 1.16–1.71) in those aged 1–6 years and 1.23 (95% CI 0.94–1.61) in those aged 7–12 years. The association between a 10% decrease between the preceding and current months and odds of an epidemic was 1.13 (95% CI 0.95–1.35) in those aged 1–6 years and 1.05 (95% CI 0.82–1.33) in those aged 7–12 years. The model incorporating the interaction terms of monthly seroprevalence with age groups and changes between seroprevalence of preceding and current months with age groups was tested, but showed non-significant interactions (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.30). This suggests that age did not modify the association between the two measures of seroprevalence and epidemic period.
