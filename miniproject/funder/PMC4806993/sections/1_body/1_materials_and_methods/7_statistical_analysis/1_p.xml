<p>We used cross-sectional time series analysis to determine the associations between epidemic periods and changes in seroprevalence. EV-A71 epidemic periods were categorized based on reported epidemic years obtained from limited laboratory confirmation and published reports [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We categorized time of our study into six distinct clusters: 1995–1997, 1998–2000, 2001–2003, 2004–2006, 2007–2009, and 2010–2012. A cluster of time consists of months before the epidemic and during the epidemic year. Epidemic periods were defined as the years 1997, 2000, 2003, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2012. The seroprevalence rate was defined as the proportion of the samples tested which had a neutralization titer ≥1:8. The association of seroprevalence and epidemic months were modeled using generalized estimated equations population average models adjusted for confounders which are biologically plausible or have been previously described; these factors were age (1–6 years and 7–12 years), and climatic variables (monthly temperature, rainfall, rain days, and ultraviolet radiance). Interaction between seroprevalence, epidemic periods and age was also evaluated for possible heterogeneous effects or associations.
