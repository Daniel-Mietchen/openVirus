<p>We used phylogenetic analysis and selective pressure to investigate the role of genetic diversity in the cyclical patterns of EV-A71 epidemics. EV-A71 VP1 gene sequences of Malaysian isolates were retrieved from GenBank and aligned with Geneious R6 (Biomatters Ltd, New Zealand). A total of 275 VP1 sequences reported from Malaysia between 1997 and 2012 were available for analysis (

 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] as the general time reversible model with rate variation among sites (GTR+G). Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo method in BEAST 1.7.4 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], run for 30 million iterations with a 10% burn-in. All runs reached convergence with estimated sample sizes of &gt;200. The clock model was uncorrelated lognormal relaxed and the tree prior was coalescent GMRF Bayesian Skyride, allowing the generation of a plot of relative genetic diversity, which reflects the change in effective population size over time [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Amino acids were only selected when positively identified by the two different codon-based maximum likelihood methods, which were single likelihood ancestor counting and fixed effects likelihood.
