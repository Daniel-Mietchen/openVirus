<p>Overall national incidence rates of notified HFMD from 2006 to 2012 were available from the Ministry of Health, Malaysia. However, as the statutory notification of HFMD came into enforcement only in October 2006, cases prior to this were underreported. The monthly numbers of HFMD cases for each of the 13 states and 2 federal territories were available only between 2008 and 2014. The case definition for reporting HFMD is a child with mouth/tongue ulcers and/or maculopapular rash/ vesicles on the palms and soles, with or without a history of fever. This data is syndromic, without laboratory confirmation of the viral agent. As diagnostic virology facilities are not widely accessible, there is scanty data on causative viral agents. Consequently, EV-A71 epidemic years, with limited laboratory confirmation, were obtained from published reports [
