<p>The selected serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes. The neutralizing titer of each serum was determined by a microneutralization assay as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], with modifications. Two-fold serial dilution of each serum sample was performed from 1:8 to 1:32. An aliquot of 90 μl of each dilution was mixed with 90 μl of 1000 tissue culture infective dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of EV-A71 strain UH1/PM/97 (GenBank accession number AM396587) from subgenotype B4. The serum-virus mixture was then incubated at 37°C for 2 hours in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Each serum dilution was transferred into a 96-well plate in triplicate. A suspension of 100 μl containing 1 x 10
 <sup>4</sup> rhabdomyosarcoma (RD, ATCC no. CRL-2061) cells was then added. Pooled positive sera of known titer were included in each assay as positive controls, using previously described criteria for reproducibility [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Wells containing diluted serum, virus alone, and uninfected RD cells were also included as controls. The plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> and examined for cytopathic effects (CPE) after 5 days. Neutralizing antibody titer was defined as the highest dilution that prevents the development of CPE in 50% of the inoculated cells. A sample was considered positive if the neutralizing titer was ≥1:8 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Good cross-neutralization of serum against EV-A71 of different subgenotypes has been observed (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004562.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Nevertheless, sera from children ≤3 years collected in 2013 were used to verify the concordance of neutralization titers between the UH1 strain and a clinical virus isolate from subgenotype B5 (GenBank accession number JN316092) isolated in 2006 (39 sera) and a clinical isolate from subgenotype C1 (GenBank accession number JN316071) cultured in 1997 (32 sera). These were the genotypes circulating in Malaysia between 1997–2012 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. High concordance in seropositive/seronegative status was obtained between UH1 and B5 virus (97%, 38/39 sera) and UH1 and C1 virus (81%, 26/32 sera); hence, this supports our use of the B4 virus alone for all the neutralization assays.
