<p>Serum samples were randomly picked from archived residual sera collected for routine virology and bacteriology tests in the Diagnostic Virology Laboratory, University of Malaya Medical Center, in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. Samples from patients with suspected HFMD were excluded. A total of 1,769 sera from children aged between 1 to 12 years old, collected between 1995 and 2012, were tested for EV-A71 neutralizing antibodies. Between 52 and 200 samples were collected for each year, except for 2009, when only 30 samples from children were available. Samples were divided into 1–6 years (pre-school) and 7–12 years (primary school) age groups for most analyses. A further 372 serum samples from children &lt;1 year were analyzed separately, as these may contain maternal antibodies.</p>
