<p>Cyclical epidemics may be due to various factors, including changes in pathogen antigenicity, variations in host population immunity, and environmental drivers [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but it is unclear whether these antigenic changes are the cause of recurrent epidemics. Most EV-A71 studies showed presence of cross-protective immunity against other genotypes following infection with a given genotype and high concordance in neutralization titers between the same genotypes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Hence, changes in herd immunity are likely to be more important. As EV-A71 disease mainly affects young children below the age of 5, cyclical patterns of epidemics could be due to the accumulation of a new generation of susceptible children every few years, enabling sustained transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, direct evidence for this is scanty, as most EV-A71 seroprevalence studies are point prevalence studies.
