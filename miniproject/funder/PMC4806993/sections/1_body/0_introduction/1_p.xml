<p>Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease, characterized by vesicles on the hands and feet, and ulcers in the mouth. Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is one of the main causative agents of HFMD apart from coxsackieviruses (CV) A6, A10, and A16 [

 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, is a small, non-enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus. Substantial genetic diversity is observed in EV-A71. EV-A71 can be divided into three major genotypes, A, B and C, based on a cut-off nucleotide divergence value of 17–22% [
