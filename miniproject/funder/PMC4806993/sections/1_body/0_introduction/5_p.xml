<p>In this study, we used 2,141 serum samples collected from children over an 18-year period encompassing 6 epidemics, and determined the association between seroprevalence rates and cyclical patterns of reported EV-A71 epidemics in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We hypothesized that falls in EV-A71 seroprevalence rates were associated with new epidemics.</p>
