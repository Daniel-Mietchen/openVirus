In Malaysia, since the first EV-A71 epidemic in 1997, recurrent cyclical epidemics have occurred every 2&#x02013;3 years for reasons that remain unclear. We hypothesize that this cyclical pattern is due to changes in population immunity in children (measured as seroprevalence). Neutralizing antibody titers against EV-A71 were measured in 2,141 residual serum samples collected from children &#x02264;12 years old between 1995 and 2012 to determine the seroprevalence of EV-A71. Reported national HFMD incidence was highest in children &#x0003c;2 years, and decreased with age; in support of this, EV-A71 seroprevalence was significantly associated with age, indicating greater susceptibility in younger children. EV-A71 epidemics are also characterized by peaks of increased genetic diversity, often with genotype changes. Cross-sectional time series analysis was used to model the association between EV-A71 epidemic periods and EV-A71 seroprevalence adjusting for age and climatic variables (temperature, rainfall, rain days and ultraviolet radiance). A 10% increase in absolute monthly EV-A71 seroprevalence was associated with a 45% higher odds of an epidemic (adjusted odds ratio, aOR1.45; 95% CI 1.24&#x02013;1.69; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Every 10% decrease in seroprevalence between preceding and current months was associated with a 16% higher odds of an epidemic (aOR = 1.16; CI 1.01&#x02013;1.34 <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.034). In summary, the 2&#x02013;3 year cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics in Malaysia is mainly due to the fall of population immunity accompanying the accumulation of susceptible children between epidemics. This study will impact the future planning, timing and target populations for vaccine programs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is a major cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. Since the first outbreak in Malaysia in 1997, EV-A71 epidemics have occurred every 2&#x02013;3 years, in 2000, 2003, 2006, 2008/2009, and 2012. As the reasons for this cyclical pattern are not known, we hypothesize that it is due to changes in population immunity in children. In this study, we measured the EV-A71 neutralizing antibody prevalence in serum collected from children &#x02264;12 years old between 1995 and 2012, covering 18 years and 6 epidemics. HFMD incidence was highest in children &#x0003c;2 years, and seroprevalence increased with age, and was higher during epidemics compared to non-epidemic periods. Peaks in EV-A71 genetic diversity coincided with reported EV-A71 epidemics. Decreases in EV-A71 seroprevalence over time were significantly associated with subsequent epidemic periods. This suggests that epidemics lead to high levels of population seroprevalence; but during the 2&#x02013;3 years between epidemics, the population of young children with no immunity is replenished and increases, making it more likely that a new epidemic will occur. This is the first study to show that the cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics is associated with changes in EV-A71 seroprevalence.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research work was funded by High Impact Research grant (E00013-20001), University Malaya Research Grant Scheme (RG522-13HTM) and postgraduate research grant PG033-2014B from University Malaya; and the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FP022-2014A) from the Ministry of Education, Malaysia.

Enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) is one of the main causative agents of HFMD apart from coxsackieviruses (CV) A6, A10, and A16 [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. EV-A71, which belongs to the genus <italic>Enterovirus</italic> of the family <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, is a small, non-enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus. Substantial genetic diversity is observed in EV-A71.

In Sarawak, a clear 3-year recurrent cyclical pattern has been shown, with EV-A71 epidemics occurring in 1997, 2000, 2003 and 2006 [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics occurring every 3&#x02013;4 years has also been described in Japan [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Singapore [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Cyclical epidemics may be due to various factors, including changes in pathogen antigenicity, variations in host population immunity, and environmental drivers [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Shifts in genotype often accompany new epidemics [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], but it is unclear whether these antigenic changes are the cause of recurrent epidemics. Most EV-A71 studies showed presence of cross-protective immunity against other genotypes following infection with a given genotype and high concordance in neutralization titers between the same genotypes [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Hence, changes in herd immunity are likely to be more important. As EV-A71 disease mainly affects young children below the age of 5, cyclical patterns of epidemics could be due to the accumulation of a new generation of susceptible children every few years, enabling sustained transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, direct evidence for this is scanty, as most EV-A71 seroprevalence studies are point prevalence studies.</p><p>In this study, we used 2,141 serum samples collected from children over an 18-year period encompassing 6 epidemics, and determined the association between seroprevalence rates and cyclical patterns of reported EV-A71 epidemics in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

In Malaysia, HFMD became a statutorily notifiable disease only from October 2006, although national surveillance data does not include the causative viral agents. A notable exception is Sarawak, the worst affected state in Malaysia, which established sentinel and laboratory-based surveillance of HFMD in 1998, and clearly showed recurrent EV-A71 epidemics coinciding with large spikes in HFMD rates occurring at 2&#x02013;3 year intervals [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We have found that national HFMD rates, which were not virus-specific, accorded with EV-A71 seroprevalence, spikes in genetic diversity of EV-A71, and published reports of laboratory-confirmed epidemic years. Together, this showed that EV-A71 epidemics also occurred in similar 3 year cycles in Malaysia. We found clear support for our hypothesis, showing that statistically significant decreases in population seroprevalence (as a proxy for immunity) are temporally associated with subsequent epidemics, after adjustment for age, temperature, rainfall, rain days, and ultraviolet radiance.</p><p>We identified seropositive children from as early as 1995 and 1996, suggesting that EV-A71 was already circulating before the first documented epidemic in 1997. The presence of seropositive young children in interepidemic years shows that ongoing transmission occurs between epidemics. This is supported by laboratory reports of EV-A71 isolated in low numbers during interepidemic years [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Based on the HFMD monthly distribution from 2008&#x02013;2014, a seasonal pattern was observed, with incidence peaking between May to June. In USA, HFMD epidemics occur during summer and autumn months [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Taiwan has also showed higher incidence in the summer months [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and in Guangzhou, incidence peaked in April/May and September/October [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The location-specific factors leading to seasonal epidemics have not been clearly defined, but could include climatic factors, such as the association with relative humidity and mean temperature in Taiwan [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], which may affect environmental survival of enteroviruses. In the present study, the overall likelihood of an epidemic was influenced by temperature and rain days, but not rainfall or ultraviolet radiance. The effects of these climatic factors on virus survival and spread will require further investigation. The relationships of HFMD with climatic variables remain to be explored in detail in Malaysia, particularly as individual states may have widely varying weather.</p><p>The highest age-specific incidence of HFMD is seen in children &#x0003c;2 years old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0004562.g002">Fig 2</xref>). This is consistent with the significant differences in age-specific EV-A71 seroprevalence seen between non-epidemic and epidemic years in those &#x0003c;2 years old, particularly in the &#x0003c;6 month (from 47.7% to 64.0%, p = 0.016) and 6 months to 1 year age groups (from 35.9% to 64.3%, p = 0.0016). If an EV-A71 vaccine, such as the inactivated vaccine that has recently shown promise in phase 3 trials [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], were introduced into routine immunization programs, children would have to be vaccinated at least by the age of 6 months, and possibly earlier [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. As most children in Malaysia and other Asian countries [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] are seropositive by 5 years, an effective vaccine could prevent EV-A71 HFMD, as well as the severe associated neurological complications that mainly affect the very young [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The well-recognized cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics seen in some countries has been attributed to the time taken for accumulation of enough susceptible children in the population. In Tokyo, the overall EV-A71 seroprevalence dropped to its lowest point in 6 years during the months just preceding an epidemic in 1973, including an absence of antibodies in children &#x0003c;4 years old [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In Guangdong, China, seroprevalence gradually dropped from 2007 to 2009, before a large epidemic in 2010 [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In Taiwan, there was evidence of fewer EV71 seroconversions in 1994&#x02013;1997, before the 1998 epidemic [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Our study is unusual as it charts seroprevalence over a long period of time, covering 18 years and 6 epidemics, and we showed that changes in population immunity in children appear to be the major driving force of the observed cyclical epidemics. Specifically, we demonstrated that falls in seroprevalence were clearly associated with higher odds of a subsequent epidemic. Seroprevalence in both 1&#x02013;6 and 7&#x02013;12 years age groups increased in epidemic years, suggesting that both groups are involved in disease burden and transmission. The higher HFMD rates seen in children aged 1&#x02013;6 years is most likely due to their greater susceptibility (as shown by their lower seroprevalence rates in non-epidemic years), but it may also be due to under-reporting in older children, who often have milder disease [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Estimation of the basic reproduction ratio (R<sub>0</sub>), or the number of secondary cases arising from an infectious case, has been widely used to study the dynamics of transmission of infectious diseases such as SARS and influenza [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The R<sub>0</sub> of EV-A71 has been estimated as 5.48, which is considered as moderately infectious [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The EV-A71 R<sub>0</sub> was higher than the estimated CV-A16 R<sub>0</sub> of 2.5, suggesting that EV-A71 is more transmissible. For such a transmissible virus, the epidemic size is mainly dependent on the size of the susceptible population [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Following a viral epidemic, most of the population at risk would become immune. It may then take 2&#x02013;3 years for the susceptible population to be replenished by newborns, and to be large enough for the R<sub>0</sub> to increase to &#x0003e;1, hence leading to a cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics every 2&#x02013;3 years. A similar study should be conducted to determine the R<sub>0</sub> to further understand EV-A71 transmission dynamics in Malaysia.</p><p>The present study also showed that Malaysian epidemics are characterized by peaks of increased genetic diversity, often with genotype changes. While the increased diversity may simply reflect a larger number of infections, we cannot exclude that new variants with antigenic changes may escape population immunity and contribute to cyclical epidemics. Although found in less than a quarter of Malaysian EV-A71, the positive selection pressure sites found at positions 98 and 145 of the VP1 protein have been previously reported [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These mutations appeared at the terminal branches with changes from E98K, E145Q and E145G. Amino acid position 98 is part of the BC loop and position 155 is part of the DE loop, both of which are immunogenic loops of VP1 [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A recent study measured cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers against viruses with mutations at residues 98, 145 and 164 [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Up to 4-fold neutralization reduction was seen in sera from children, adults and rabbits tested against an EV-A71 VP1-98K/145Q/164E mutant, and all neutralization titers were &#x02265; 1:16. However, viruses with all three mutations concomitantly have not yet been seen in nature. The significance of the antigenic variation will require more detailed longitudinal serological studies. If immune escape is not needed or plays only a minor role to produce the cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics, a significant accumulation of susceptible children between epidemics will be enough to support large-scale transmission and another epidemic.</p><p>Overall, in other published studies, EV71-infected children have detectable neutralizing antibody titers against all the EV71 genotypes [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and cross-protective immunity between genotypes is generally considered to be high [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Previous studies in humans, monkeys, rabbits and mice showed that neutralization antibody levels against different genotypes may vary, but overall human anti-serum generally does cross-neutralize strains of different genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0004562.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Lower neutralization titers may not reflect antigenic shift sufficient to lead to immune escape. To date, no cases of recurrent EV-A71 infection have been reported, suggesting the presence of life-long protective immunity against EV-A71. While enteroviruses clearly undergo antigenic evolution, complete immunological escape in EV-A71 seems to be rare, thus EV-A71 is generally considered to be a single serotype antigenically. Any possible clinical significance and contribution of reduced cross-protective immunity towards new epidemics will require further confirmation.</p><p>Our study's findings may be a useful basis for future efforts to forecast EV-A71 HFMD epidemics in Malaysia. Occurrence of EV-A71 epidemics may be predicted by seroprevalence rates in children and influenced by temperature and number of rain days. The changing population immunity, the effects of climate variables on the survival and spread of EV-A71 in the environment, the change in virus genetic diversity, and changing probability of transmission of EV-A71 due to changes in host behavior under certain climatic conditions may explain the seasonal cyclical patterns. Time-series analysis of real-time, high-quality surveillance and seroprevalence data may provide efficient detection and effective forecasting of EV-A71 epidemics. Future research may also focus on the potential influence of other HFMD enteroviruses in the cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is that we used a convenience sample of residual diagnostic sera from a single hospital. However, it would be difficult to otherwise obtain such an extensive collection of serum samples from healthy children over many years. When compared to a random cluster survey, convenience sampling has also been shown to give similar estimates of seroprevalence to 5 vaccine-preventable viral diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0004562.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The convenience sample used here is likely to be appropriate for this study.</p><p>In conclusion, falls in seroprevalence in children aged 1&#x02013;12 years old are the major driving force of the cyclical pattern of EV-A71 epidemics seen in Malaysia over 18 years. Nevertheless, possible interplay between seroprevalence with climatic variables and virus antigenic variations is evident and warrant future study. The highest age-specific incidence of disease, as shown by surveillance figures and seroprevalence rates, occurred in children &#x0003c;2 years. Together with the seasonal and cyclical patterns observed, this study has provided important data which will impact vaccine planning, timing and target populations for vaccine programs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004562.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Summary of studies investigating the cross-reactivity neutralizing antibody responses to enterovirus A71 infection in humans and animals.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004562.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004562.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Malaysian EV-A71 VP1 sequences from 1997&#x02013;2012.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004562.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004562.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Seroprevalence rates of EV-A71 neutralizing antibody in children, 1995&#x02013;2012.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004562.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0004562.s004"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>STROBE checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0004562.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions.
