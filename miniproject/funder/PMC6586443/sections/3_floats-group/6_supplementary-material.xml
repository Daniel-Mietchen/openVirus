  <title>Peptides showing low correlation between plasma and saliva samples show low mean MFI and/or low variance.</title>
  <p>Scatterplots of correlation values (r
   <sub>xy</sub>) between saliva IgG and plasma IgG samples against mean (left) and variance (right) of log MFI for 256 peptides (EBV and HBV). These diagrams indicate that peptides that are either low in mean reactivity or vary little between samples (weak differentiation power) show low correlation values.
