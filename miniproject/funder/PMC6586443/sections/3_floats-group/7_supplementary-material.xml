  <title>Mean signal intensities and ranges of signal intensities are highly similar in plasma and saliva.</title>
  <p>Means and ranges of log2 MFI for 256 peptides (EBV and HBV) across 20 paired saliva IgG and plasma IgG samples are shown. This indicates a high concordance of relative IgG reactivities in saliva and plasma samples.</p>
