  <title>Schematic isolation protocol and purity of IgG isolation from human saliva and plasma samples.</title>
  <p>(A) Saliva was collected using a commercial saliva collection kit containing citrate buffer. Saliva/buffer mixture was then centrifuged and microfiltrated for removal of heavy components, particles and large molecules. A buffer exchange step with binding buffer was performed for subsequent affinity chromatography using Protein G resin. Plasma was prepared from venous blood and IgG was purified using a commercial purification kit. Saliva and plasma IgG were processed on different assay for subsequent analyses. (B) Non-reducing SDS page of saliva and plasma purified samples. Saliva and plasma isolates from 10 and 5 individuals are shown, respectively. Additionally, a commercial IgG standard is shown (lane 12) for comparative purposes. The most prominent bands are highly similar for all lanes. IgG bands are prominent between 100 and 250kDa marker positions. Average purity of saliva IgG isolates was 79% (± 13% SD) as determined by relative area under the curve (AUC) in the chromatograms (
