  <title>High accordance of IgG reactivities in paired plasma and saliva samples against individual peptides.</title>
  <p>(A, B) Plasma and saliva reactivities of representative EBV and HBV derived peptides. The identity line is shown in grey. (C) Distributions of Pearson correlation coefficients (r
   <sub>xy</sub>) between plasma and saliva intensities (green bars) for all 256 peptides (158 EBV and 98 HBV peptides) and null-distributions (red bars and black line, respectively) for comparison. Pearson’s r is shown instead of R
   <sup>2</sup> in C for reasons of clarity. 47% of all peptides have r
   <sub>xy</sub> &gt; 0.8, 83% have BH FDR &lt; 0.01 (analytical Null). For comparison of resulting correlation coefficients, the null distribution (expected distribution of r in case of zero correlation or random data) is calculated in two ways. The empirical null distribution is generated by random resampling from array data. The analytical null distribution is shown for the case of independent normal variables. Note: the slight positive skew of the empirical null distribution originates from the positive skew of the data (log2 MFI of samples), which is typical for microarray data. R
   <sup>2</sup> is Coefficient of determination (squared Pearson’s r).
