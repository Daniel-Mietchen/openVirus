  <title>Sample replicates and technical replicates show high similarity for an individual even when sampled more than six weeks separated.</title>
  <p>Hierarchical clustering of plasma IgG and saliva IgG samples analysed on EBV peptide microarrays. Technical replicates and sample replicates are included, see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218456.s011">S4 Table</xref> for a more detailed description. The grey line indicates the highest dissimilarity of samples from one individual. Single linkage was used as agglomeration method and (1 –Pearson’s r) was used as distance. Terminal edges are colored in red.
