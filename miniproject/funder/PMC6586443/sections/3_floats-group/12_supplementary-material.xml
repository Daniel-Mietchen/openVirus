  <p>MFI, reference titer values (anti-HBs titer) and predicted titer values for IgG samples isolated from saliva and plasma. Paired plasma and saliva samples were available from 21 individuals, plasma samples were available from additional 17 individuals. Reference titer values for all individuals were measured in plasma samples (see
