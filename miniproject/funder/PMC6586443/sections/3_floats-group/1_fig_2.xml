  <title>HBV antibody titer determination in plasma and saliva.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>Hepatitis B surface antigen subtype ad (HBsAg ad) was used as antigen on self-printed microarrays for titer determination in an indirect immunoassay format.</bold> (A) Plasma and saliva signal intensities for 21 paired human samples. The identity line is shown in grey. (B) Assay calibration with anti-HBs antibody standard. The linear regression line is shown in solid black. Prediction bounds are indicated with red and green dashed lines. (C) Plasma and saliva titer values as determined by the reference routine diagnostic lab (abscissa) and titer predictions from purified plasma IgG and purified saliva IgG as determined with our assay (ordinate). R
   <sup>2</sup> of the linear regression is 0.73 (n = 59). The solid line shows the identity line, the dashed line shows the regression fit. Small jitter was added (in the graph, not the data) to (1000,1000) points in C for better illustration (to prevent points lying on top of each other). Paired plasma and saliva samples were available for 21 individuals. Additional plasma samples were available for 17 individuals. Data for all 3 graphs can be found in

   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218456.s010">S3</xref> Tables. R
   <sup>2</sup> is Coefficient of determination (squared Pearsonâ€™s r).
