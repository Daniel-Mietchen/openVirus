  <title>Pairwise clustering of saliva and plasma samples for all individuals.</title>
  <p>Heatmap of log2 MFI for saliva IgG and plasma IgG peptide microarrays is shown. Data was normalized according to the Materials and Methods part. Top color bars (red, blue) indicate saliva and plasma samples, respectively. Left color bar indicates peptides derived from EBV or HBV, as well as blank and control spots. Log2 MFI values of 20 paired samples are shown for 256 peptides and control peptides (process control peptides and blank spots).</p>
