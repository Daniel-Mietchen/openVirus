<p>Frozen aliquots of saliva/buffer mixture were thawed at room temperature. 4mL of saliva/buffer mixture was buffer exchanged in binding buffer (100mM sodium phosphate 150mM NaCl pH 7.2) and concentrated to 200μL using an Amicon 30k centrifugal filter device (Merck UFC803024). IgG was purified from this concentrate using a 96-well format Protein G column kit (Thermo 45204) according to the kit manual. In brief, the columns were pre-rinsed with binding buffer, 200μL of buffer exchanged sample was applied to the columns and incubated for 30min with moderate agitation at RT. Subsequently, columns were washed 4 times with binding buffer, bound IgG was eluted with 400μL of 100mM glycine pH 2.5 and pH was adjusted to 7.2 with 1M sodium phosphate pH 9. The eluate was buffer exchanged with deionized H
 <sub>2</sub>O and concentrated to 35μL using a Microcon 10k centrifugal filter device (Merck MRCPRT010) yielding a final concentration of roughly 0.15μg/μL or a total of 5.3μg IgG. Protein concentration was measured by spectrophotometry (Biotek Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer with Take 3 module). Purity of IgG isolated from saliva was evaluated by SDS page as described below and by quantification of IgA on an in-house developed Luminex IgA quantification assay. The Luminex IgA quantification assay is based on a sandwich immunoassay. Capture antibody: Mouse anti-Human IgA Secondary Antibody (Thermo SA1-19258). Detection Antibody: Biotin-SP (long spacer) AffiniPure F(ab')₂ Fragment Goat Anti-Human Serum IgA, α Chain Specific (Jackson Immuno 109-066-011). Streptavidin-PE (Jackson Immuno 016-110-084) was used for detection and signals were read on a Luminex Flexmap 3D System. Samples were diluted in PBS with 1% BSA and PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma, P9416) was used as wash buffer. The assay was calibrated with IgA standard (Sigma i4036) at concentrations 0, 1, 2.1, 4.2, 8.3, 16.6 μg/mL. For all assayed samples (n = 4), IgA signals were below limit of detection (LOD) of 1μg/mL.
