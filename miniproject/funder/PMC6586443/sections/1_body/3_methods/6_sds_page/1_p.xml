<p>SDS page was run with slight overloading of lanes to enhance visibility of impurities. 2.5μg of purified IgG (plasma and saliva) were applied to each well of precast polyacrylamide 4–12% gradient gels (Thermo NP0329BOX). Gels were run in 1x MOPS buffer (Thermo NP0001) with non-reducing conditions. Additionally, Pageruler Plus protein ladder (Thermo 26619) and human IgG standard (Sigma i2511) were run on two lanes. Gel was imaged and analysed using Chemidoc Touch with Imagelab 5.2.1 (Biorad).</p>
