<p>Processing of microarrays was done equally for plasma and saliva IgG samples. Arrays were blocked with blocking buffer (PBS pH 7.4, 3% skimmed milk powder, 0.1% Tween-20) for 30 min with agitation (150rpm on plate shaker) at RT and washed three times with PBST (PBS pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween-20). Slides were spin-dried and incubated with 100μL of 0.02μg/μL sample IgG (2μg total IgG) in blocking buffer with agitation (150rpm) for 1.5 hours at RT. After washing for three times with PBST, slides were incubated with goat anti-human IgG Alexa 647 detection antibody (Invitrogen A21445) diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer with agitation for 1 hour at RT in the dark. Slides were washed another three times with PBST, two times with H2O and spin-dried immediately after the final wash step. Fluorescence intensity in the red channel (excitation laser 635nm, emission filter 676/37nm) was scanned with a Tecan PowerScanner.</p>
