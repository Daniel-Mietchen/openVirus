 <italic>Hepatitis B virus</italic> Surface Antigen ad (HBsAg ad, Biorad PIP002) was printed on standard format 2D Epoxy microarray slides (PolyAn 104 00 221) using an InkJet printing system (ArrayJet Marathon Argus). HBsAg was prepared at a concentration of 0.25mg/mL in 25mM phosphate buffer pH 8 + 0.02% SDS and subsequently mixed 1:1 (v/v) with pure ethylene glycol to increase viscosity for InkJet printing (60% relative humidity at RT). Slides were kept at 60% relative humidity and RT during printing and for 2 hours afterwards. Printed slides were stored at 4Â°C under vacuum. An international Anti-Hepatitis-B surface antigen (Anti-HBs) immunoglobulin standard (07/164, NIBSC, South Mimms, UK) was used for assay calibration. The Anti-HBs standard series for assay calibration was prepared in blocking buffer (PBS pH 7.4, 3% skimmed milk powder, 0.1% Tween-20) and processed like other samples (see Microarray processing).
