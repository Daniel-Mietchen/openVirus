<p>Two different commercial peptide microarrays (JPT Berlin, Germany) mapping linear peptide epitopes of 
 <italic>Epstein-Barr virus</italic> (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA, Swiss-Prot ID P03211) and 
 <italic>Hepatitis B virus</italic> large envelope protein (HBV large envelope protein, Swiss-Prot ID P17101) were used. The EBV array consists of 158 peptides spotted in triplicates (RT-MW-EBV-EBNA1, JPT Berlin), the HBV array consists of 98 peptides spotted in triplicates (RT-MW-HBV-LEP, JPT Berlin) resulting in 256 analysed peptides. The linear peptide epitopes were derived as peptide scan from the protein antigens in terms of 15-mer peptides with 11 amino acids overlap.
