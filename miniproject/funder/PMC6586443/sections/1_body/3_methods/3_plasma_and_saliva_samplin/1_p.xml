<p>Paired plasma and saliva samples were collected from healthy individuals simultaneously. All individuals had no known diseases by the time of sampling and 2 week afterwards. Saliva was collected according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a commercially available saliva collection system (Greiner 881002). In the course of collection the saliva is diluted roughly 1:1 with 4mL of 39mM citrate extraction buffer (see manufacturer’s instructions) and stored on ice. The collection procedure thus yields roughly 8mL of 1:1 saliva/buffer mixture, where 4mL of the mixture is used for further processing (see below). Within 30min after collection, the saliva/buffer mixture was immediately centrifuged at 2,200xg for 10min at room temperature (RT). The supernatant was micro-filtrated with 5μm and 0.45μm syringe filters (Merck SLSV025LS and SLHVM25NS) to remove mucous components and subsequently the filtrate was frozen at -20°C. EDTA plasma was prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions immediately after collection (Greiner 456023) and aliquots were frozen at -20°C.</p>
