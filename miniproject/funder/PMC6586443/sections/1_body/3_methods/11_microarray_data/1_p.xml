<p>Fluorescence images of microarrays were processed with GenePix Pro 6.0 (Molecular devices) to quantify median fluorescence intensity (MFI), local background intensity (BG) and to identify low quality or damaged spots. No background correction was performed. Data was median-normalised to log2 MFI of 9 (or MFI = 512) for EBV and HBV arrays. Spots were removed from analyses if either: spot was flagged (flag = -100) or spot diameter was lower than 41 or higher than 150 (EBV) or 180 (HBV). Duplicate or triplicate spots were averaged. Then (averaged) data of EBV and HBV arrays were combined and normalised by adjusting the global median intensity of all HBV arrays to the global median intensity of all EBV arrays. EBV and HBV microarray data is available in the gene expression omnibus (GEO) repository [
 <xref rid="pone.0218456.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] with accession number GSE117142. EBV and HBV array data can be accessed separately with accession numbers GSE117140 and GSE117141, respectively. HBsAg protein array data is provided in the supplement (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218456.s009">S2 Table</xref>). HBsAg protein array data was not background corrected or normalized.
