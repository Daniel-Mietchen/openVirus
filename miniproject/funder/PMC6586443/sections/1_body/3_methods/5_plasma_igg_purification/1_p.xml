<p>Plasma IgG was purified using a 96-well format Melon Gel kit (Thermo 45208) according to the kit manual with a slightly modified protocol. In brief, 15μL of plasma were diluted in 95μL of purification buffer, applied to the resin, incubated for 5 min with moderate agitation at RT and centrifuged at 1000g for 1min to obtain the purified IgG (roughly 1mg/mL in 100μL purification buffer). Purity was evaluated by SDS page.</p>
