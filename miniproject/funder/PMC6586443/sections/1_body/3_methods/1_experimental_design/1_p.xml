<p>The goal of this study was to test our hypothesis that IgG profiles in plasma and saliva are highly similar for each individual. Confirming this hypothesis eventually leads to the conclusion that any plasma IgG based assay can, in principle, easily be adapted as saliva based assay and demonstrates the great potential of saliva based medical diagnostics. This was a study on voluntary healthy individuals and all subjects consented to participate in the study. No samples were excluded. All samples were de-identified except for sex and smoking status. Plasma and Saliva IgG samples were analysed on protein and peptide microarrays. Additionally, plasma samples were sent to a routine medical diagnostics lab for anti-HBV antibody titer determination.</p>
