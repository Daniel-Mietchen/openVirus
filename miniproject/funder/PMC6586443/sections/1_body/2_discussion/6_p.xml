<p>In the context of the presented IgG profiling on peptide microarrays this means that we needed a procedure which takes all features (signal intensities of peptides and proteins) of two samples and calculates a similarity (or dissimilarity) measure between the two samples. We used 1 –Pearson’s r as distance metric. We then assigned a posterior probability of match or mismatch to each sample pair using the empirical conditional distribution and a pre-specified prior probability. All match probabilities increased to probabilities higher than the prior and all mismatch probabilities increased to probabilities lower than the prior. Note that choosing a different prior probability does not change the result qualitatively. Sensitivity and specificity of the according classical classification problem are each 100% or ROC AUC is 1. This can be considered a perfect result with respect to matching of plasma and saliva samples of each individual. The IgG profiles are unique for each person and are highly similar between saliva and plasma (at least for our study cohort and our measurement technology).</p>
