<p>Our hypothesis was that IgG profiles in plasma and saliva are highly similar for each individual. By means of consecutively showing high similarity of IgG reactivity profiles between plasma and saliva against multiple antigens we provide evidence for accepting this claim on a subset of the IgG profile and argue for generalisation to the entire IgG profile. The presented work thus provides a solid scientific basis for the development of saliva IgG based assays in the evolving field of saliva based diagnostics. With IgG being a rather large biomolecule, it is likely the case that many more molecules of diagnostic and prognostic interest, like hormones and metabolites, which are usually isolated from plasma are accessible through saliva. Although concentrations of most of the medically and scientifically interesting molecules in saliva are relatively low as compared to blood, we and others [

 <xref rid="pone.0218456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] could show that extraction and quantification of the molecules is feasible and practically utilisable. We emphasize that our study does neither provide a specific clinical test nor a specific medical application, but should be seen as an approach for showing that the IgG reactivities in saliva and plasma are generally highly similar for each individual. Nevertheless, the drawn conclusions provide a solid basis for numerous potential applications of saliva based diagnostics like e.g. (i) antibody titer determination for rapid verification of vaccination status; (ii) infection diagnostics and monitoring of epidemics or pandemics; (iii) testing of autoantibodies against tumour associated antigens or for diagnosis and monitoring of autoimmune disorders; (iv) monitoring of anti-rhesus antibodies in pregnancy and (v) testing of blood compatibility.
