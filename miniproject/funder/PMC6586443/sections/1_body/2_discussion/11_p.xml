<p>Practically the saliva based assays could potentially be implemented as lateral flow tests or microfluidic chips. The pore size of the device or an initial filter would thereby be designed in a way that mucins and other heavy components of the saliva sample are restrained, while antibodies (or other molecules of interest) can pass and subsequently are enriched on a capture platform. Detection and quantification can thereby be done by means of an indirect immunoassay with any enzyme or label based detection system like electrochemical or colorimetric detection. For non-enzymatic assays the test strips could potentially even be dried after sample application. In this way large numbers of samples could be collected and analysed conveniently and at low cost.</p>
