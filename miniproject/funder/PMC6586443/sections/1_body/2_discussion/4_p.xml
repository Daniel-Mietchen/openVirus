<p>We showed that IgG profiles of plasma and saliva are highly similar for the 256 antigens used in our study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g004">Fig 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218456.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Although IgG antibodies against 256 antigens are only a small subset of the whole immunological repertoire of IgG antibodies, we suggest that still the results are generalizable. Before we continue with our argumentation we therefor need to address some general considerations about showing equality and inequality in a scientific/statistical sense in the context of immunological profiles.
