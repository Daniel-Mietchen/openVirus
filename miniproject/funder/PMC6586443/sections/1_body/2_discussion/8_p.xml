<p>For the presented analyses of IgG profiles and the resulting conclusions it is basically of minor relevance which particular subset of antigens (epitopes) is investigated or whether protein or peptide antigens are used, as long as there are at least a certain number of reactive antigens capable of discriminating between samples (otherwise technical noise would dominate the resulting data). Considering the thoughts above, there is yet no indication against generalisation of the results to the whole immunological profile, although we can only observe the profile partially. It is thus highly improbable that the analyses accidentally work only for the currently investigated subset, but not for any other subset. Or put another way, there is no indication that a certain subset of IgG idiotype gets into saliva and yet another subset does not. A more general “proof” of equality for plasma and saliva IgG profiles by means of an exhaustive analysis (e.g. with an antigen array covering “all possible antigens”) is currently unfeasible due to the above mentioned technical reasons.</p>
