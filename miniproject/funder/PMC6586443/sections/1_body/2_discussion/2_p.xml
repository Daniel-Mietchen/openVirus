<p>We could show the diagnostic potential of saliva by implementing a procedure for anti-HBV antibody (HBsAg ad antigen) titer determination from saliva. The procedure was calibrated in order to infer plasma IgG titer levels from saliva IgG measurements. Titer values determined from saliva and plasma with our assay were compared to values determined by a reference lab from plasma (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Concordance is reasonably high between reference values and our assay (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.73). Comparing saliva and plasma reactivities (against HBsAg) of our assay reveals even higher concordance for paired samples (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.91). This is in agreement with our initial hypothesis that IgG profiles in plasma and saliva are highly similar for each individual.
