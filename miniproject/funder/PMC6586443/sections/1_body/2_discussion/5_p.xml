<p>Equality, inequality and statistical testing: It is in practice inherently hardly possible to define a scientific methodology for testing equality on continuous scales if no commonly accepted definitions of equality and inequality exist. This is i.e. the reason why the Null-hypothesis cannot be accepted in classical null hypothesis testing (e.g. T-test) if one fails to reject it. For continuous scales there are hardly situations where resulting values are exactly identical and thus the null hypothesis is strictly true, so we in principle anyway need bounds defining equality and inequality [

A possible solution to this could e.g. be that one tries to find conditional probability distributions of similarity measures for equality (match) and inequality (mismatch) for the specific problem. The resulting values can then be assigned to either distribution with a certain probability for a reasonable sample set/size. This approach is similar to a classical classification problem and one could thus calculate measures like sensitivity, specificity or ROC AUC. These values could further be tested on significance with various methods if desired [
