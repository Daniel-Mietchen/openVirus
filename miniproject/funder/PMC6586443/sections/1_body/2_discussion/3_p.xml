<p>After showing high similarity of signal intensities between plasma and saliva for one HBV protein antigen, we generalised the result in a first step by performing correlation analyses on paired saliva and plasma samples of 20 individuals assayed on peptide microarrays (256 peptide antigens). The overall agreement of relative intensities in saliva and plasma is high (47% of the peptides show correlation coefficient r
 <sub>xy</sub> &gt; 0.8), see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g003">Fig 3</xref>. This indicates the general possibility of inferring relative and absolute plasma IgG reactivities from saliva IgG. In this way, standard plasma IgG based assays can, in principle, easily be adapted as saliva based assays by calibration, as shown in this work exemplarily for anti-HBV antibodies.
