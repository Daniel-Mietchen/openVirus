<p>Definition of the immunological profile: The immunological profile of a person can be seen as a kind of immunological fingerprint. One could try to define the immunological profile e.g. as the complete immunological repertoire of a person by means of the concentrations of each antibody idiotype. However, the complete immunological (IgG) profile of a person is practically not measurable as the immunoglobulin repertoire (number of different idiotypes) in humans is at least 10
 <sup>11</sup> and probably even several orders of magnitude greater [

 <xref rid="pone.0218456.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, the immunological profile shows a temporal variation due to the dynamics of the immune system and changing environmental antigens (“The fingerprint changes over time.”). It is thus practically impossible to generate a complete immunological profile of a person with currently available technologies, at least to the best of our knowledge. Even the latest sequencing based technologies might not be capable of generating a full profile as not the sequence of the antibodies, but the final overall 3D structure (which is hard to predict) of the paratope is eventually defining the idiotype. As a consequence, one could anyway only generate an IgG profile on a subset of the immunological profile of a person and find good arguments which make generalisation of the results plausible.
