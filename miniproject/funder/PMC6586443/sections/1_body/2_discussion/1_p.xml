<p>Due to the relatively high heterogeneity of saliva across individuals as compared to plasma or blood (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec001">Introduction</xref>), isolation of analytes from saliva is challenging. Still, we were able to develop a robust method for isolation of IgG from saliva (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g001">Fig 1</xref>) with high average purity (79% ± 13% SD). The procedure shows high robustness against various saliva compositions as we had samples from smokers and non-smokers, young and elderly individuals (24.4–56.5 years), as well as women and men. Average IgG yield of purified saliva samples was 5.3μg (final 0.15mg/mL in 35μL) from 2mL of saliva (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218456.s008">S1 Table</xref>) which is roughly factor 2 lower than previously reported values [
 <xref rid="pone.0218456.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The average amount of saliva required for our microarray experiments (2μg of purified IgG) was thus 0.75mL, the minimally required amount was 1.8mL for the sample with lowest concentration. The absolute IgG yield for each sample could potentially be enhanced by protocol optimization. However, our focus was high purity and high concentration of the isolated IgG antibodies. IgA content of purified saliva samples was below LOD of 1μg/mL. Although purification strategies for saliva and plasma are largely different (depletion and affinity purification, respectively), bands in gel electrophoresis and subsequent microarray analyses show highly similar profiles. This further emphasizes the suitability of the developed purification procedure.
