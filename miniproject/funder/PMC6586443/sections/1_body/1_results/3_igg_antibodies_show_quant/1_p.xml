<p>In the following we show that, additionally to the relative reactivities against the HBsAg protein antigen (shown above), also the relative reactivities against peptide antigens (15 amino acids) show high similarity for saliva and plasma samples of all tested individuals. This serves as a first generalisation step from one HBV antigen to multiple antigens of the immunological profile. Paired saliva and plasma samples were taken from 20 individuals and IgG was isolated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Isolated IgG was assayed on peptide microarrays with 158 linear epitopes of 
 <italic>Epstein-Barr Virus</italic> (EBV) and 98 of 
 <italic>Hepatitis B virus</italic> (HBV) antigens. We used EBV and HBV peptide microarrays due to the expected high reactivity resulting from high prevalence (EBV) and high vaccination coverage rate (HBV) and the good reproducibility due to chemical synthesis of the peptides and commercial availability.
