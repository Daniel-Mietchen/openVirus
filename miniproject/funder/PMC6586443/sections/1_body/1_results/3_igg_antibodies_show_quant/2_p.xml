<p>Reactive peptides show a linear relationship and high accordance of signal intensities between saliva and plasma samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Almost half of the peptides (47%) show Pearsonâ€™s r greater than 0.8 or R
 <sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.64 for signal intensities in saliva and plasma. All other peptides, except for 2 out of 256, show relatively high r &gt; 0 as compared to the null distributions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). The peptides with low correlation values generally show low mean values and/or low variance of fluorescence intensities indicating low or unspecific reactivity of the according peptides (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218456.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Moreover, mean signal intensities and intensity ranges (max minus min) are highly similar in plasma and saliva samples for all peptides (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218456.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). This indicates, additionally to relative intensities, the high similarity of absolute intensities and hence relative quantities (fraction of antibodies relative to all antibodies in the according body fluid). The assays were normalized by using the same amount of IgG for saliva and plasma arrays and by median normalization between arrays.
