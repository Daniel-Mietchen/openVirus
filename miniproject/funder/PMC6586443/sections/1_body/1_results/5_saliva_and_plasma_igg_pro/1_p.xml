<p>Looking at all pairwise distances between samples relieves that the match (intra-individual) and mismatch (inter-individual) distances do not overlap in the histograms (

Based on the microarray-data from each sample, one could derive the probability that a specific pair of plasma and saliva samples comes from the same individual. We derive these probabilities in order to emphasize the high accordance of plasma and saliva IgG profiles by means of a hypothetical example from forensics.
