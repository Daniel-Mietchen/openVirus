<p>We developed a method for isolating IgG from human saliva with high purity as the most important prerequisite for subsequent analyses. In short, saliva was centrifuged for removing heavy components, microfiltrated for removing particles and large molecules and subsequently buffer exchanged with binding buffer for purification by Protein G affinity chromatography (

For comparison of purity and yield, we prepared plasma from venous blood and isolated plasma IgG using a commercial Melon Gel isolation kit. Additionally, a commercial IgG standard was used. Average IgG yield was 5.3μg (range 1.7–12.5 μg) from 2mL saliva and 54.8μg (range 40–76.45μg) from 15μL plasma (

All lanes, including the commercial IgG standard, show comparably prominent IgG bands between 100 and 250kDa marker positions. Saliva purified IgG samples showed hence reasonably high purity for further processing. Comparison of concentrated and microfiltrated saliva with purified IgG is shown in
