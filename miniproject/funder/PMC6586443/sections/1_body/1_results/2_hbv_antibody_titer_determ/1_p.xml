<p>As a first proof of principle for showing the equality of plasma and saliva IgG reactivity, we show similarity for a well characterised anti-
 <italic>Hepatitis B virus</italic> (anti-HBV) antibody which is reactive against a HBV surface antigen. This serves as an illustration for practical feasibility of a saliva IgG based diagnostic routine, as the developed system is suitable for inferring anti-HBV antibody titer (plasma titer) from saliva. Although there are potentially other applications of higher relevance in industry and academia, we have still chosen HBV antibody titer determination as a pilot example as there is generally a high HBV vaccination coverage rate in Austria and we could thus expect positive signals with reasonable variance in our study cohort (n = 38). We want to emphasize, that this should serve as an illustrative example of one possible clinical application. Still, the main focus of the paper is not to develop a specific test which can be used in routine diagnostics, but to show that the IgGs found in blood are accessible from saliva, independent of certain specificities (idiotypes). For the following analyses, we used customized self-printed protein microarrays with recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen subtype ad (HBsAg ad) for quantification of anti-HBV antibody reactivities. Signal intensities measured in plasma and saliva show high concordance for all 21 individuals (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.91) for which paired saliva and plasma samples were available (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The assay was calibrated using an anti-Hepatitis-B surface antigen (Anti-HBs) antibody standard from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC). Coefficient of determination (COD) for the calibration is R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.93 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For comparison with the antibody titer predicted from our assay, the antibody titer was determined for all individuals from their respective plasma samples by an external routine medical diagnostic lab. This plasma titer was used as a reference for saliva and plasma samples. In contrast, we used our protein-microarray based assay for prediction of the antibody titer values from purified plasma IgG and purified saliva IgG. COD between reference and predicted titer values is R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.73 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Please note that for 7 out of 59 samples (12%), which are far off the diagonal line, there is a relatively high disagreement between values from our assay and the reference lab. This is not contradictory to the previous claim that we can infer IgG reactivity in plasma from saliva IgG. The disagreement is seen in predicted titer values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), but not in measured signal intensities of plasma and saliva (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and thus is considered a systematic error in titer determination. The differences in titer determination arise presumably as (i) the reference lab uses a mixture of 
 <italic>HBsAg ad</italic> and 
 <italic>HBsAg ay</italic> subtypes; (ii) we use purified IgG, in contrast to whole plasma as used by the reference lab (routine medical diagnostic labs commonly use whole plasma for titer determination). This might result in different matrix effects; (iii) our assay structure (direct immunoassay with fluorescent detection) is different from the assay used by the reference lab (sandwich electro-chemiluminescence immunoassay), see
