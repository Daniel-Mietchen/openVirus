<p>We continued comparing plasma and saliva IgG profiles of the 20 individuals on the 256 peptide antigens (see EBV and HBV peptide arrays above). Hierarchical clustering results in pairwise clustering of saliva and plasma IgG samples for all 20 individuals (

Furthermore, the high intra-individual similarity of IgG profiles remains even for samples (same person, same body fluid) taken repeatedly at different days more than 6 weeks separated from initial sampling (
