<p>Antibodies isolated from blood or saliva could be potentially used for diagnosis and monitoring of diseases and medical conditions related to or associated with (IgG) antibodies in humans. Numerous potential applications have been described for various diseases like: autoimmune disorders (multiple sclerosis [

 <xref rid="pone.0218456.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218456.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]), viruses (HIV [

 <xref rid="pone.0218456.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], to name just a few. Some of these have already been shown to be detectable and (in principle) diagnostically utilizable in saliva [

 <xref rid="pone.0218456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and to date one saliva based HIV test is already on the market [
 <xref rid="pone.0218456.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, all of the mentioned studies investigated only specific, disease related antibody idiotypes or sets of idiotypes. A more general approach, detached from a specific application or medical condition, is still missing in scientific literature.
