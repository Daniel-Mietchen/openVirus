<p>The increasing expenses of healthcare systems and the increasing number of patients require an increase in efficiency in all healthcare related processes. A promising opportunity to increase efficiency in diagnostic, screening or monitoring applications is the usage of saliva as diagnostic fluid due to good sample accessibility and a large variety of potential diagnostic and monitoring possibilities [

Diagnosis of diseases and screening e.g. for epidemics is frequently done stationary by physical examination and by performing blood tests. Using saliva instead of blood has potential benefits especially for screening a high number of people or for usage in decentralized regions like for point of care (POC) or home testing: (i) sampling of saliva is simple, does not necessarily need trained staff and is usually readily available; (ii) saliva collection does not need health care professionals for drawing blood and in principle not even sterile goods as in case of blood sampling—for many applications saliva could be microbiologically stabilized after collection; (iii) collection can be done anywhere and processing can be done centrally if the analyte of interest can be stabilized; (iv) high numbers of samples can be collected easily. However, several factors cause saliva to be a relatively heterogenic body fluid among individuals as compared to e.g. blood or plasma. These factors include: (i) age related and genetically determined effects which cause differences in viscosity or relative water, protein (e.g. mucins, enzymes and antibodies) as well as ion content; (ii) smoking as this could cause high particle load and discoloration of saliva; (iii) differences in salivation; (iv) microbiome in the oral cavity; (v) disease associated alterations like increased blood content due to bleedings in the oral cavity or associated structures and many more. These differences could be challenging for sample collection and preparation and potentially interfere with subsequent analyses [

Furthermore, many analytes of interest are found in much lower concentration as compared to blood which additionally challenges the analysis procedures and methods [
