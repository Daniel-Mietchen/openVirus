<p>Our hypothesis is that IgG profiles in plasma and saliva are highly similar for each individual. The immunological profile of an individual is for now formally defined as the reactivity of IgGs of that individual against a certain set of antigens. It can hence be seen as an immunological fingerprint for a certain set of antigens. For the sake of readability, a more detailed consideration of the immunological profile as a concept is provided in the Discussion part. By showing high similarity of the immunological profiles in plasma and saliva, we show that the diagnostic potential of saliva is not limited to diseases localized in the oral cavity or anatomically and physiologically associated structures, but is extended to the whole body or, more specifically, at least to any IgG antibody which can be found in blood. So the IgG antibodies found in blood are also accessible from saliva, this is our main result. In the present work we do not focus on the development of a particular diagnostic application for saliva, but we aim at showing that it is in principle possible to develop/adopt a diagnostic test which is based on human plasma IgGs also for saliva. The document is structured in the following way: We show that (i) we can isolate saliva IgG with high purity; (ii) we are able to infer anti-HBV-antibody (plasma-)titer from saliva; (iii) relative IgG antibody reactivities are highly similar in saliva and plasma and we can thus infer plasma IgG reactivities from saliva; (iv) immunological profiles are highly similar in saliva and plasma. Note that (ii)â€“(iv) are consecutive steps of generalisation. Due to the nature of the immune system it is inherently only possible to observe (iii) and (iv) on a subset of the immunological profile. The validity of generalisation from a subset to the whole immunological profile of an individual is argued in the Discussion part. We thus provide a general framework and present data for showing high similarity (or effectively equality) of the immunological IgG antibody repertoire in plasma and saliva.</p>
