Currently only few individual molecules were investigated for their diagnostic capabilities in saliva. A systematic comparison of IgG antibody profiles in saliva and plasma is still missing in scientific literature. Our hypothesis is that IgG profiles in plasma and saliva are highly similar for each individual. As a consequence, one could implement practically any plasma based IgG assay (classical serology) as saliva based assay. In other words, the IgG antibodies found in blood are also accessible from saliva. We confirm our hypothesis by comparing IgG reactivities towards protein and peptide antigens. We isolated saliva IgG with high purity and demonstrate that plasma IgG reactivities (classical serology) can be inferred from saliva. As a showcase we perform Hepatitis B virus antibody (plasma-)titer determination from saliva. Additionally we show that plasma and saliva IgG profiles of 20 individuals are highly similar for 256 peptide antigens and match (unsupervised) with high probabilities. Finally, we argue for generalisation to the complete IgG antibody profile. The presented findings could contribute greatly to the development of saliva based diagnostic methods of numerous antibody based tests.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004061</institution-id><institution>Oesterreichische Nationalbank</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15952</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weinh&#x000e4;usel</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by the Jubil&#x000e4;umsfond (Anniversary Fund) of the Austrian National Bank (&#x000d6;sterreichische Nationalbank) project number 15952 (grant recipient - Andreas Weinh&#x000e4;usel) and by the research programme Research Studios Austria by the FFG (&#x000d6;sterreichische Forschungsf&#x000f6;rderungsgesellschaft mbH) under grant agreement number 859182, project PepPipe (grant recipient - Andreas Weinh&#x000e4;usel).

A promising opportunity to increase efficiency in diagnostic, screening or monitoring applications is the usage of saliva as diagnostic fluid due to good sample accessibility and a large variety of potential diagnostic and monitoring possibilities [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Diagnosis of diseases and screening e.g. for epidemics is frequently done stationary by physical examination and by performing blood tests. Using saliva instead of blood has potential benefits especially for screening a high number of people or for usage in decentralized regions like for point of care (POC) or home testing: (i) sampling of saliva is simple, does not necessarily need trained staff and is usually readily available; (ii) saliva collection does not need health care professionals for drawing blood and in principle not even sterile goods as in case of blood sampling&#x02014;for many applications saliva could be microbiologically stabilized after collection; (iii) collection can be done anywhere and processing can be done centrally if the analyte of interest can be stabilized; (iv) high numbers of samples can be collected easily. However, several factors cause saliva to be a relatively heterogenic body fluid among individuals as compared to e.g. blood or plasma. These factors include: (i) age related and genetically determined effects which cause differences in viscosity or relative water, protein (e.g. mucins, enzymes and antibodies) as well as ion content; (ii) smoking as this could cause high particle load and discoloration of saliva; (iii) differences in salivation; (iv) microbiome in the oral cavity; (v) disease associated alterations like increased blood content due to bleedings in the oral cavity or associated structures and many more. These differences could be challenging for sample collection and preparation and potentially interfere with subsequent analyses [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The saliva composition can additionally be altered by the collection procedure or any form of stimulation like e.g. using chewing gums, by psychological stimulation or the usage of extraction solutions [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, accurately defined sampling procedures and circumstances are essential for reproducible analyses. Furthermore, many analytes of interest are found in much lower concentration as compared to blood which additionally challenges the analysis procedures and methods [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Antibodies isolated from blood or saliva could be potentially used for diagnosis and monitoring of diseases and medical conditions related to or associated with (IgG) antibodies in humans. Numerous potential applications have been described for various diseases like: autoimmune disorders (multiple sclerosis [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], inflammatory bowel disease [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]), viruses (HIV [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], dengue [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], measles, mumps &#x00026; rubella [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]), antibodies against tumour associated antigens [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and parasites [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], to name just a few. Some of these have already been shown to be detectable and (in principle) diagnostically utilizable in saliva [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and to date one saliva based HIV test is already on the market [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, all of the mentioned studies investigated only specific, disease related antibody idiotypes or sets of idiotypes. A more general approach, detached from a specific application or medical condition, is still missing in scientific literature.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that IgG profiles in plasma and saliva are highly similar for each individual. The immunological profile of an individual is for now formally defined as the reactivity of IgGs of that individual against a certain set of antigens. It can hence be seen as an immunological fingerprint for a certain set of antigens. For the sake of readability, a more detailed consideration of the immunological profile as a concept is provided in the Discussion part. By showing high similarity of the immunological profiles in plasma and saliva, we show that the diagnostic potential of saliva is not limited to diseases localized in the oral cavity or anatomically and physiologically associated structures, but is extended to the whole body or, more specifically, at least to any IgG antibody which can be found in blood. So the IgG antibodies found in blood are also accessible from saliva, this is our main result. In the present work we do not focus on the development of a particular diagnostic application for saliva, but we aim at showing that it is in principle possible to develop/adopt a diagnostic test which is based on human plasma IgGs also for saliva. The document is structured in the following way: We show that (i) we can isolate saliva IgG with high purity; (ii) we are able to infer anti-HBV-antibody (plasma-)titer from saliva; (iii) relative IgG antibody reactivities are highly similar in saliva and plasma and we can thus infer plasma IgG reactivities from saliva; (iv) immunological profiles are highly similar in saliva and plasma. Note that (ii)&#x02013;(iv) are consecutive steps of generalisation. Due to the nature of the immune system it is inherently only possible to observe (iii) and (iv) on a subset of the immunological profile. The validity of generalisation from a subset to the whole immunological profile of an individual is argued in the Discussion part. We thus provide a general framework and present data for showing high similarity (or effectively equality) of the immunological IgG antibody repertoire in plasma and saliva.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>High purity IgG isolation from saliva</title><p>We developed a method for isolating IgG from human saliva with high purity as the most important prerequisite for subsequent analyses. In short, saliva was centrifuged for removing heavy components, microfiltrated for removing particles and large molecules and subsequently buffer exchanged with binding buffer for purification by Protein G affinity chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). For comparison of purity and yield, we prepared plasma from venous blood and isolated plasma IgG using a commercial Melon Gel isolation kit. Additionally, a commercial IgG standard was used. Average IgG yield was 5.3&#x003bc;g (range 1.7&#x02013;12.5 &#x003bc;g) from 2mL saliva and 54.8&#x003bc;g (range 40&#x02013;76.45&#x003bc;g) from 15&#x003bc;L plasma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218456.s008">S1 Table</xref>).

All lanes, including the commercial IgG standard, show comparably prominent IgG bands between 100 and 250kDa marker positions.

This serves as an illustration for practical feasibility of a saliva IgG based diagnostic routine, as the developed system is suitable for inferring anti-HBV antibody titer (plasma titer) from saliva. Although there are potentially other applications of higher relevance in industry and academia, we have still chosen HBV antibody titer determination as a pilot example as there is generally a high HBV vaccination coverage rate in Austria and we could thus expect positive signals with reasonable variance in our study cohort (n = 38). We want to emphasize, that this should serve as an illustrative example of one possible clinical application. Still, the main focus of the paper is not to develop a specific test which can be used in routine diagnostics, but to show that the IgGs found in blood are accessible from saliva, independent of certain specificities (idiotypes). For the following analyses, we used customized self-printed protein microarrays with recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen subtype ad (HBsAg ad) for quantification of anti-HBV antibody reactivities. Signal intensities measured in plasma and saliva show high concordance for all 21 individuals (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91) for which paired saliva and plasma samples were available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The assay was calibrated using an anti-Hepatitis-B surface antigen (Anti-HBs) antibody standard from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC). Coefficient of determination (COD) for the calibration is R<sup>2</sup> = 0.93 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For comparison with the antibody titer predicted from our assay, the antibody titer was determined for all individuals from their respective plasma samples by an external routine medical diagnostic lab. This plasma titer was used as a reference for saliva and plasma samples. In contrast, we used our protein-microarray based assay for prediction of the antibody titer values from purified plasma IgG and purified saliva IgG. COD between reference and predicted titer values is R<sup>2</sup> = 0.73 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Please note that for 7 out of 59 samples (12%), which are far off the diagonal line, there is a relatively high disagreement between values from our assay and the reference lab. This is not contradictory to the previous claim that we can infer IgG reactivity in plasma from saliva IgG. The disagreement is seen in predicted titer values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), but not in measured signal intensities of plasma and saliva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and thus is considered a systematic error in titer determination.

For the calculation of the posterior probability of each individual, the distance values of that individual were thereby withheld from estimation of conditional match and mismatch distributions in order to avoid overestimation of the posterior probability (This could inherently lead to non-monotonic posteriors (dependent on dist<sub>xy</sub>), but is negligible here). The prior matching probability P(match) is chosen as 0.001 assuming an a-priori chance of match being 1/1000. Practical example: Imagine a criminal case with 1000 potential suspects and only 1 saliva trace. The posterior probability for each person is the probability that the saliva trace stems from this person. As the posterior probability is here calculated for illustration purposes and the actual choice of the prior does not qualitatively change the resulting posterior probabilities, 1/1000 is considered a reasonable choice. The minimal match posterior is roughly 0.08 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), which is an increase in matching probability from 1/1000 to roughly 1/12.5. All other matching samples have higher posteriors, with 10 of 20 samples having matching probability of practically 100%. All estimated posteriors of mismatch samples decrease below the prior. For our practical example, this means that only for the person the saliva trace stems from, the probability increases to values higher than 1/1000, for all other suspects it decreases to values lower than 1/1000. The high change in probability from prior to posterior is essentially a consequence of low overlap of the estimated conditional probability distributions and results in high sensitivity and specificity of match and mismatch decisions. The variances of the match and mismatch distributions could potentially be further reduced by automatization and standardization of the whole assay, especially saliva sample preparation, and by using a higher number of antigens (peptide or protein) which are differentially reactive between individuals. However, already with 256 antigens a high individual matching probability is achieved due to low overlap of the estimated distributions. This indicates a high accordance of saliva and plasma IgG profiles.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec008"><title>Discussion</title><p>Due to the relatively high heterogeneity of saliva across individuals as compared to plasma or blood (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec001">Introduction</xref>), isolation of analytes from saliva is challenging. Still, we were able to develop a robust method for isolation of IgG from saliva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g001">Fig 1</xref>) with high average purity (79% &#x000b1; 13% SD). The procedure shows high robustness against various saliva compositions as we had samples from smokers and non-smokers, young and elderly individuals (24.4&#x02013;56.5 years), as well as women and men. Average IgG yield of purified saliva samples was 5.3&#x003bc;g (final 0.15mg/mL in 35&#x003bc;L) from 2mL of saliva (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218456.s008">S1 Table</xref>) which is roughly factor 2 lower than previously reported values [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The average amount of saliva required for our microarray experiments (2&#x003bc;g of purified IgG) was thus 0.75mL, the minimally required amount was 1.8mL for the sample with lowest concentration. The absolute IgG yield for each sample could potentially be enhanced by protocol optimization. However, our focus was high purity and high concentration of the isolated IgG antibodies. IgA content of purified saliva samples was below LOD of 1&#x003bc;g/mL. Although purification strategies for saliva and plasma are largely different (depletion and affinity purification, respectively), bands in gel electrophoresis and subsequent microarray analyses show highly similar profiles. This further emphasizes the suitability of the developed purification procedure.</p><p>We could show the diagnostic potential of saliva by implementing a procedure for anti-HBV antibody (HBsAg ad antigen) titer determination from saliva. The procedure was calibrated in order to infer plasma IgG titer levels from saliva IgG measurements. Titer values determined from saliva and plasma with our assay were compared to values determined by a reference lab from plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Concordance is reasonably high between reference values and our assay (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.73). Comparing saliva and plasma reactivities (against HBsAg) of our assay reveals even higher concordance for paired samples (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.91). This is in agreement with our initial hypothesis that IgG profiles in plasma and saliva are highly similar for each individual.</p><p>After showing high similarity of signal intensities between plasma and saliva for one HBV protein antigen, we generalised the result in a first step by performing correlation analyses on paired saliva and plasma samples of 20 individuals assayed on peptide microarrays (256 peptide antigens). The overall agreement of relative intensities in saliva and plasma is high (47% of the peptides show correlation coefficient r<sub>xy</sub> &#x0003e; 0.8), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g003">Fig 3</xref>. This indicates the general possibility of inferring relative and absolute plasma IgG reactivities from saliva IgG. In this way, standard plasma IgG based assays can, in principle, easily be adapted as saliva based assays by calibration, as shown in this work exemplarily for anti-HBV antibodies.</p><p>We showed that IgG profiles of plasma and saliva are highly similar for the 256 antigens used in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218456.g004">Fig 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218456.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Although IgG antibodies against 256 antigens are only a small subset of the whole immunological repertoire of IgG antibodies, we suggest that still the results are generalizable. Before we continue with our argumentation we therefor need to address some general considerations about showing equality and inequality in a scientific/statistical sense in the context of immunological profiles.</p><p>Equality, inequality and statistical testing: It is in practice inherently hardly possible to define a scientific methodology for testing equality on continuous scales if no commonly accepted definitions of equality and inequality exist. This is i.e. the reason why the Null-hypothesis cannot be accepted in classical null hypothesis testing (e.g. T-test) if one fails to reject it. For continuous scales there are hardly situations where resulting values are exactly identical and thus the null hypothesis is strictly true, so we in principle anyway need bounds defining equality and inequality [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A possible solution to this could e.g. be that one tries to find conditional probability distributions of similarity measures for equality (match) and inequality (mismatch) for the specific problem. The resulting values can then be assigned to either distribution with a certain probability for a reasonable sample set/size. This approach is similar to a classical classification problem and one could thus calculate measures like sensitivity, specificity or ROC AUC. These values could further be tested on significance with various methods if desired [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>In the context of the presented IgG profiling on peptide microarrays this means that we needed a procedure which takes all features (signal intensities of peptides and proteins) of two samples and calculates a similarity (or dissimilarity) measure between the two samples. We used 1 &#x02013;Pearson&#x02019;s r as distance metric. We then assigned a posterior probability of match or mismatch to each sample pair using the empirical conditional distribution and a pre-specified prior probability. All match probabilities increased to probabilities higher than the prior and all mismatch probabilities increased to probabilities lower than the prior. Note that choosing a different prior probability does not change the result qualitatively. Sensitivity and specificity of the according classical classification problem are each 100% or ROC AUC is 1. This can be considered a perfect result with respect to matching of plasma and saliva samples of each individual. The IgG profiles are unique for each person and are highly similar between saliva and plasma (at least for our study cohort and our measurement technology).</p><p>Definition of the immunological profile: The immunological profile of a person can be seen as a kind of immunological fingerprint. One could try to define the immunological profile e.g. as the complete immunological repertoire of a person by means of the concentrations of each antibody idiotype. However, the complete immunological (IgG) profile of a person is practically not measurable as the immunoglobulin repertoire (number of different idiotypes) in humans is at least 10<sup>11</sup> and probably even several orders of magnitude greater [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Additionally, the immunological profile shows a temporal variation due to the dynamics of the immune system and changing environmental antigens (&#x0201c;The fingerprint changes over time.&#x0201d;). It is thus practically impossible to generate a complete immunological profile of a person with currently available technologies, at least to the best of our knowledge. Even the latest sequencing based technologies might not be capable of generating a full profile as not the sequence of the antibodies, but the final overall 3D structure (which is hard to predict) of the paratope is eventually defining the idiotype. As a consequence, one could anyway only generate an IgG profile on a subset of the immunological profile of a person and find good arguments which make generalisation of the results plausible.</p><p>For the presented analyses of IgG profiles and the resulting conclusions it is basically of minor relevance which particular subset of antigens (epitopes) is investigated or whether protein or peptide antigens are used, as long as there are at least a certain number of reactive antigens capable of discriminating between samples (otherwise technical noise would dominate the resulting data). Considering the thoughts above, there is yet no indication against generalisation of the results to the whole immunological profile, although we can only observe the profile partially. It is thus highly improbable that the analyses accidentally work only for the currently investigated subset, but not for any other subset. Or put another way, there is no indication that a certain subset of IgG idiotype gets into saliva and yet another subset does not. A more general &#x0201c;proof&#x0201d; of equality for plasma and saliva IgG profiles by means of an exhaustive analysis (e.g. with an antigen array covering &#x0201c;all possible antigens&#x0201d;) is currently unfeasible due to the above mentioned technical reasons.</p><p>We thus suggest generalisation of the results as: (i) One could anyway only observe a subset of the IgG profile due to the high number of possible different antibodies in the immunological repertoire; (ii) There is yet no indication that the results only hold for a specific subset of the IgG antibodies and that we accidentally picked one of these subsets.</p><p>Our hypothesis was that IgG profiles in plasma and saliva are highly similar for each individual. By means of consecutively showing high similarity of IgG reactivity profiles between plasma and saliva against multiple antigens we provide evidence for accepting this claim on a subset of the IgG profile and argue for generalisation to the entire IgG profile. The presented work thus provides a solid scientific basis for the development of saliva IgG based assays in the evolving field of saliva based diagnostics. With IgG being a rather large biomolecule, it is likely the case that many more molecules of diagnostic and prognostic interest, like hormones and metabolites, which are usually isolated from plasma are accessible through saliva. Although concentrations of most of the medically and scientifically interesting molecules in saliva are relatively low as compared to blood, we and others [<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0218456.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] could show that extraction and quantification of the molecules is feasible and practically utilisable. We emphasize that our study does neither provide a specific clinical test nor a specific medical application, but should be seen as an approach for showing that the IgG reactivities in saliva and plasma are generally highly similar for each individual. Nevertheless, the drawn conclusions provide a solid basis for numerous potential applications of saliva based diagnostics like e.g. (i) antibody titer determination for rapid verification of vaccination status; (ii) infection diagnostics and monitoring of epidemics or pandemics; (iii) testing of autoantibodies against tumour associated antigens or for diagnosis and monitoring of autoimmune disorders; (iv) monitoring of anti-rhesus antibodies in pregnancy and (v) testing of blood compatibility.</p><p>Practically the saliva based assays could potentially be implemented as lateral flow tests or microfluidic chips. The pore size of the device or an initial filter would thereby be designed in a way that mucins and other heavy components of the saliva sample are restrained, while antibodies (or other molecules of interest) can pass and subsequently are enriched on a capture platform. Detection and quantification can thereby be done by means of an indirect immunoassay with any enzyme or label based detection system like electrochemical or colorimetric detection. For non-enzymatic assays the test strips could potentially even be dried after sample application. In this way large numbers of samples could be collected and analysed conveniently and at low cost.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec009"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec010" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Experimental design</title><p>The goal of this study was to test our hypothesis that IgG profiles in plasma and saliva are highly similar for each individual.

EDTA plasma was prepared according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions immediately after collection (Greiner 456023) and aliquots were frozen at -20&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Saliva IgG purification</title><p>Frozen aliquots of saliva/buffer mixture were thawed at room temperature. 4mL of saliva/buffer mixture was buffer exchanged in binding buffer (100mM sodium phosphate 150mM NaCl pH 7.2) and concentrated to 200&#x003bc;L using an Amicon 30k centrifugal filter device (Merck UFC803024). IgG was purified from this concentrate using a 96-well format Protein G column kit (Thermo 45204) according to the kit manual. In brief, the columns were pre-rinsed with binding buffer, 200&#x003bc;L of buffer exchanged sample was applied to the columns and incubated for 30min with moderate agitation at RT. Subsequently, columns were washed 4 times with binding buffer, bound IgG was eluted with 400&#x003bc;L of 100mM glycine pH 2.5 and pH was adjusted to 7.2 with 1M sodium phosphate pH 9. The eluate was buffer exchanged with deionized H<sub>2</sub>O and concentrated to 35&#x003bc;L using a Microcon 10k centrifugal filter device (Merck MRCPRT010) yielding a final concentration of roughly 0.15&#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;L or a total of 5.3&#x003bc;g IgG. Protein concentration was measured by spectrophotometry (Biotek Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer with Take 3 module). Purity of IgG isolated from saliva was evaluated by SDS page as described below and by quantification of IgA on an in-house developed Luminex IgA quantification assay. The Luminex IgA quantification assay is based on a sandwich immunoassay. Capture antibody: Mouse anti-Human IgA Secondary Antibody (Thermo SA1-19258). Detection Antibody: Biotin-SP (long spacer) AffiniPure F(ab')&#x02082; Fragment Goat Anti-Human Serum IgA, &#x003b1; Chain Specific (Jackson Immuno 109-066-011). Streptavidin-PE (Jackson Immuno 016-110-084) was used for detection and signals were read on a Luminex Flexmap 3D System. Samples were diluted in PBS with 1% BSA and PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma, P9416) was used as wash buffer. The assay was calibrated with IgA standard (Sigma i4036) at concentrations 0, 1, 2.1, 4.2, 8.3, 16.6 &#x003bc;g/mL. For all assayed samples (n = 4), IgA signals were below limit of detection (LOD) of 1&#x003bc;g/mL.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Plasma IgG purification</title><p>Plasma IgG was purified using a 96-well format Melon Gel kit (Thermo 45208) according to the kit manual with a slightly modified protocol.
