  <meta-value>All the simulated data are included as Supporting Information files. The trees obtained by Avila et al. are protected by the confidentiality agreements inherent to the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). Due to privacy reasons, the sensitivities associated with HIV infections, and the representativeness of the SHCS dataset, neither the SHCS sequencing data, nor the phylogenies obtained from these data, can be made publicly available. A sub-sample of 500 sequences is available on Genbank from a previous publication (Kouyos et al. JID 2010, accession numbers GU344102â€“GU344671). All SHCS data can be used for projects that conform with the SHCS guidelines, conditional on approval by the SHCS Scientific Board. Information about how to submit project proposals can be found at
