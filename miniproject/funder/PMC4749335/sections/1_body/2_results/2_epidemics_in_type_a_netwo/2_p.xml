<p>ARIs varied widely across simulations. For instance, at cutpoint 0.02, on networks with bridge weights set at 0.25, clusters obtained from the complete linkage method produced ARIs between 0, meaning that we concluded in the absence of clusters, to 0.88, yielding a variance of 0.02. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g004">Fig 4</xref> gives mean island recovery rates across distance requirements under the different weighting schemes for the cluster definitions stated previously. Overall, we observed low to moderate correspondence between transmission clusters and communities, with mean recovery rates lower when epidemics spread on unweighted networks. Around the optimal cutpoint, clusters obtained under Def. 4 tended to agree more with the island structure, as evidenced by
