 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> emphasize how weighting affects cluster recovery. In clusters resulting from the use of hierarchical clustering with complete linkage, from above 0.58 when bridge weights were set at 0.25, the ARI decreased to approximately 0.43 in the unweighted network case. Weighting also improved optimal recovery rates for Def. 1, 2, and 3, although the variation was much smaller.
