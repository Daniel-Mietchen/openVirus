 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> further suggest that complete linkage worked better under a wider range of cutpoints. However, past this optimal range, Def. 2 produced greater overlap with the islands. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref> show that even under the optimal percentile threshold, Def. 3 produced clusters that overlapped modestly with the islands, although it did slightly outperform Def. 1 and Def. 2 under optimal setting.
