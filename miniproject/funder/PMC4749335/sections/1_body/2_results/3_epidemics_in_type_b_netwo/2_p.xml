<p>As before, we observed large variations in ARIs across simulations. For example, on networks with bridge weights taking value 0.25, clusters obtained using the complete linkage method, at optimal cutpoint 0.04, had ARIs ranging from 0.02 to 1, producing a variance of approximately 0.02. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows that all cluster definitions could be tuned to recover the island structure fairly accurately. In the weighted case (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), optimal island recovery reached over 0.90. Once again, hierarchical clustering (Def. 4) tended to perform better, but the difference in optimal recovery rates was rather small. Like before, Def. 2 clearly outperformed other definitions at higher cutpoints. The improved performance of clade-based definitions was not a surprise. After all, in type B networks, all epidemic outbreaks in the smaller islands form clades in the phylogeny.
