<p>A visual inspection of the phylogeny can however reveal the existence of community structure, as emphasized by 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g003">Fig 3</xref>, which shows an epidemic simulated on a weighted network of type A. We attributed a weight of 0.25 to bridges, thus multiplying by 4 the mean time required for the virus to cross to another island. Both islands ended up saturated. We can easily identify the branch in the phylogeny supporting the subtree representing the sub-epidemic in the pink island. This pattern is typical: when a sufficiently large number of infection events take place after a bridge is crossed, we generally observe a subphylogeny supported by a long branch, consequence of the limited number of between-island, compared to within-island, connections.
