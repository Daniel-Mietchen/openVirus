<p>Each island was a fully-connected graph. In epidemics on fully-connected graphs, the incidence rate is proportional to the number of edges connecting infected subjects to their susceptible neighbours. Per lineage however, the transmission rate decreases with the number of infected individuals. In a phylogeny, this translates to short branches right after a crossing event, and then an increase in branch lengths.</p>
