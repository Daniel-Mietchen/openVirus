<p>The plotted phylogeny clearly emphasizes that any clustering method assuming that a cluster is a clade cannot achieve high island recovery, as infected individuals from the same island may not form a clade. Indeed, in our example, infected individuals in the orange and the purple islands formed a clade in the phylogeny, while infected individuals in the green island did not. In general, individuals from an island with ongoing transmission do not induce a clade if one of these individuals transmits to a new island.</p>
