<p>We show a simulated network on the right in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g002">Fig 2</xref>. Each island is identified by a colour: purple, orange, and green. The virus was introduced in the green island and then travelled to the purple island. A subject in the green island was also responsible for transmitting the virus to the orange island. On the left in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g002">Fig 2</xref>, we have the epidemicâ€™s phylogenetic representation. Branch colour indicates on which island sequences are evolving and transmissions are taking place. Tip label colours indicate to which transmission cluster, black or grey, a given sequence belongs and are matched with node colours in the network graph. We obtained those clusters by applying the WPGMA method (Def. 4) and selecting the cutpoint that maximized correspondence between islands and clusters. The network graph emphasizes the limited correspondence between the transmission clusters we obtained and the islands. Indeed, subjects in the grey cluster were found on all three islands and shared the green island with the 10 subjects in the black cluster.
