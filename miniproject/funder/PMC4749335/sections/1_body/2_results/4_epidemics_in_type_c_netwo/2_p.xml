<p>Because of the larger size of the epidemics, variability in ARIs obtained across simulations was lower than before. For example, in networks with bridge weights set to 0.25, at optimal cutpoint 0.025, clusters inferred using the complete linkage method lead to ARIs ranging from 0.39 to 0.70, with a variance of 0.003. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g006">Fig 6</xref> presents mean island recovery rates across distance requirements under the different weighting schemes and cluster definitions. Despite considerable differences between networks of type A and type C, the results were similar to those outlined before. Once again, hierarchical clustering algorithms (Def. 4) suggested transmission clusters that overlapped more with islands, and among those algorithms, the complete linkage method performed better, as it worked better under a wider range of cutpoints and produced slightly higher suprema.
