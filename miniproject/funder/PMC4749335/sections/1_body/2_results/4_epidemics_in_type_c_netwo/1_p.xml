<p>The more realistic networks were of mean size 985.70, with mean degree 5.70, mean clustering coefficient 0.37, and mean shortest path length 5.64. Islands had sizes ranging from 5 to 16, with mean 9.84. Approximately 9.63% of islands were of size 5. The island size distribution frequency decreased slowly, but systematically, with increasing size until it reached 2.90% for islands of size 16 (

Communities returned by the label propagation algorithm overlapped strongly with the islands, with an ARI close to 0.99. With an ARI of 0.80, the communities proposed by the walktrap algorithm still matched the islands rather closely. Epidemics on type C networks had an estimated reproduction number of 2.35.
