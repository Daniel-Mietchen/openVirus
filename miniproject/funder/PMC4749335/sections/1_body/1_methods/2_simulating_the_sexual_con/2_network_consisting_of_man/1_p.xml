<p>In the first network structure, we find 13 islands of 20 subjects each, with each island being a 
 <italic>fully-connected graph</italic>, and one bridge linking any two islands. In a fully-connected graph, all vertices are connected to each other. We let bridge weights take values 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1. In the latter case, the network is unweighted.
