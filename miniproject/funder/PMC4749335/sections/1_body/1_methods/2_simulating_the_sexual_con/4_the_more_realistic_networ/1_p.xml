<p>The more realistic networks are made of 100 islands each. To ensure that all islands are accessible, we first link islands in a chain. We then create additional bridges by connecting any two vertices belonging to different islands with probability 0.00075. As in networks of types A and B, we consider networks in which bridge weights take values 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.</p>
