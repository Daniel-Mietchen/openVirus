<p>Further, islands in these networks are of variable size. We sample island sizes independently from an empirical distribution obtained by inspection of the maximum likelihood phylogeny for HIV-1 subtype B sequences used in [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All viral sequences come from participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). We use this phylogeny to partition the 5395 sampled HIV-positive subjects into transmission clusters. We consider co-clustered sets of subjects whose viral sequences are separated by a tree distance of at most 0.1 nt/bp, forming a 
 <italic>clade</italic> of size 5 or more, with this clade having bootstrap support greater than 70%. A set of tips forms a clade if and only if there is a node in the tree with its descending tips corresponding exactly to this set of tips. Based on these criteria, we obtain a list of clusters, for which we derive a cluster size distribution. This distribution may have gaps and so, we apply a loess smoother to it [
