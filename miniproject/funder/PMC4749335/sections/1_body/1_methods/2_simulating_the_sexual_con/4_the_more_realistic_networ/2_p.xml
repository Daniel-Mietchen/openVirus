<p>We introduce preferential attachment by making each island a 
 <italic>Barabasi-Albert</italic> graph [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our simulations, each subnetwork is generated by first creating three interconnected subjects. New subjects are then added one by one. When introduced into the network, a subject randomly forms three connections with existing subjects, who become first-degree neighbours. The probability that a subject is selected increases linearly with his degree. We call this 
 <italic>linear preferential attachment</italic>.
