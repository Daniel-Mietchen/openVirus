<p>Because [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] are working with empirical HIV sequencing data, many HIV-positive subjects who would co-cluster with individuals in the sample may be missing. This incomplete sampling may result from undiagnosed subjects or diagnosed subjects that could or would not participate in the SHCS [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In order to account for this, we assume that each known infection is connected to either 0, 1, or 2 unknown infections, with an average of 1 unknown infection.
