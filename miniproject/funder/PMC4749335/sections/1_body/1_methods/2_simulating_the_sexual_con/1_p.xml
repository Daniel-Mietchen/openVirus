<p>In each simulation, we simulate a sexual contact network, and then, an epidemic spreading onto it. We simulate epidemics on three classes of randomly-generated networks, all within the framework of undirected interconnected-islands models: two deliberately simplistic, called “type” A and “type B”, and the other, called “type C”, tailored in such a way that it displays prominent features of real sexual contact networks. Weights in our networks modulate distance between any two connected subjects. In unweighted networks, any two connected subjects are at arbitrary distance 1. In weighted networks, we attribute weights below 1 to edges serving as bridges. Distance between any two subjects is equal to one over the sum of weight values for edges on the shortest path between them. It follows that the two subjects delimiting a bridge are more distant when we attribute it a lower weight. In each weighted network, we give all bridges the same weight.</p>
