<p>The second network structure consists of one central island of size 60, representing a foreign sexual contact network, connected by single bridges to 25 islands of size 20. Each small island is a fully-connected graph. We implement weighting exactly as before. The set of small islands represents disjoint sexual contact subnetworks in a population of interest.</p>
