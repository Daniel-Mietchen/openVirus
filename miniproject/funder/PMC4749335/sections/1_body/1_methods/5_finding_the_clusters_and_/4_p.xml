<p>Methods in definition 4 are standards in agglomerative hierarchical clustering, which involves recursively combining the two clusters that are closest one to another [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The three selected methods differ in how they define inter-cluster distance. In the average linkage method, distance between two clusters is an average of genetic distance within all non-co-clustered pairs of elements from these clusters. In the complete linkage method, this distance is instead the maximum distance within those pairs. In WPGMA, distance between two clusters is the distance between two elements, one in each cluster, each deemed the most representative of its cluster.
