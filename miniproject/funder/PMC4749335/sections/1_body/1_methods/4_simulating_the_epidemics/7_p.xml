<p>In order to reduce the probability of epidemics going extinct too early, we use a shifted exponential distribution to generate time until removal. In other words, this time corresponds to the sum of a fixed time and a value simulated from an exponential distribution. It follows that the distribution of time until removal is bounded below by a value greater than zero. The shift gives all newly-infected subjects a minimum amount of time to potentially transmit the virus to their susceptible neighbours. A subject enters the “removed” state at the moment of diagnosis and so, this delay is understood as reflecting the time it takes for an infection to become diagnosable.</p>
