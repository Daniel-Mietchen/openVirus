<p>We represent each simulated epidemic with a transmission tree connecting the infected individuals. We terminate a lineage, that is, we obtain a tip, upon an individual leaving the “infected” state and entering the “removed” state. In the analyses, we consider only the subtree connecting all tips corresponding to removed individuals. This phylogeny lets us partition those subjects into transmission clusters. This scheme reflects real data collection, in which an infection can only be recorded after diagnosis.</p>
