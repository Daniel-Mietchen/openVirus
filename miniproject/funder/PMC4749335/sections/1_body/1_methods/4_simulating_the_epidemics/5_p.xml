<p>Transmission time along any edge follows an exponential distribution with rate directly proportional to the associated weight, or equivalently, inversely proportional to the distance between the subjects delimiting the edge. In type A and type B networks, we stop simulating new infections once 60 subjects have entered the “removed” state. In type C sexual contact networks, because of their large size, we raise this requirement to 200 subjects. If an epidemic fails to reach this threshold, we discard it along with the sexual contact network on which it was simulated. We then generate a new network and a new epidemic. We simulate epidemics until 300 manage to reach the threshold.</p>
