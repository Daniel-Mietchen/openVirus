<p>In type A sexual contact networks, epidemics result from one random introduction of the virus. In type B networks, we randomly introduce the virus once in the large island, but we assume that only subjects in the small islands can be observed. It follows that removed subjects in the large island are not counted for the purpose of determining when to stop the simulations, as they belong to a foreign epidemic. Thus, the tips in the phylogenies representing the simulated epidemics only correspond to removed individuals in the small islands. Given the large size of the type C networks, we increase the number of introductions to two. This increase also aims to produce a more plausible epidemic, as multiple introductions are common in practice [
