<p>Time in the simulation of epidemics corresponds to genetic distance. In other words, it is understood as the expected number of mutations divided by the number of loci in the DNA alignment. Under a strict molecular clock assumption, genetic distance translates directly to calendar time. We represent each simulated epidemic by a rooted phylogeny, with which, if needed, we can obtain simulated samples of DNA sequences. To get such a sample, first, we simulate a 
 <italic>root sequence</italic>, that is, the genetic makeup of the virus that first entered the sexual contact network, assuming equal frequency for all four bases. Evolution along the phylogeny follows a continuous time Markov process, whose rate matrix we inferred from a subsample of HIV-1 subtype B sequences collected in Montreal, Qu√©bec, Canada. By letting the root sequence evolve along the phylogeny, we obtain the required sample.
