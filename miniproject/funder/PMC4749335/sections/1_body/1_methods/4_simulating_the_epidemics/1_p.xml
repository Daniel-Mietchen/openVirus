<p>Subjects can be in one of three states: “susceptible”, “infected”, or “removed”. All subjects start in the “susceptible” state. After introduction of the virus in the network, susceptible subjects may contract the virus from an infected neighbour, at which point they enter the “infected” state. Infections are eventually diagnosed, and subjects move to the “removed” state. In the context of HIV, removal corresponds to diagnosis and uptake of HAART, which prevents transmission by drastically reducing the viral load.</p>
