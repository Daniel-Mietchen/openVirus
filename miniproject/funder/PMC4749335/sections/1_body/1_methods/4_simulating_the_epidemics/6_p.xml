<p>The minimal size requirement ensures that all sampled epidemics are of the same size and span more than one community, which makes comparisons across and within scenarios more straightforward. Indeed, since an increase in the distance between islands reduces mean time to extinction, without the size requirement, scenarios with more distant islands would involve systematically smaller epidemics, with more of them becoming extinct before a single bridge is crossed. In that extreme case, the ARI for community recovery would be trivially 0, which could be misleading. Indeed, the ARI is meaningful only when the data are partitioned in a non-trivial way. Further, averaging ARIs obtained on epidemics of different sizes would be questionable, since epidemic size affects the difficulty of the clustering problem.</p>
