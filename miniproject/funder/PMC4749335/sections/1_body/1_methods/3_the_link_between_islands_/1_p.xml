<p>In our analyses, we assume that each island is a community. We ensure that two conventional community-detection algorithms validate this assumption. That is why we measure, with the adjusted Rand index (ARI) [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], correspondence between subjectsâ€™ island and community membership indices, with the latter indices produced by the walktrap and label-propagation community-detection algorithms [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The ARI is equal to the ratio of correctly co-clustered and separated elements to the total number of pairs of elements, with a correction term for chance. It is bounded above by 1, which in our case indicates perfect overlap between islands and communities. It gives insight similar to the adjusted mutual information score.
