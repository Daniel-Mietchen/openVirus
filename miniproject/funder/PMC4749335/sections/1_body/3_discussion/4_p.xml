<p>In summary, current widely-used phylogenetic clustering methods (Def. 2 and 3, which are extensions of Def. 1) often failed to recover sexual contact network communities reliably. A major drawback was their assumption that clusters form clades in the phylogeny, while many clusters were not clades, like in the epidemics simulated in type A and type C networks. Conventional hierarchical clustering methods outperformed the more sophisticated methods in the case where clusters were not clades, and produced similar performance in networks where clusters always formed clades, like in networks of type B. However, particularly for epidemics in type A and type C networks, hierarchical clustering was still far from optimal. Therefore, we call for new clustering methods improving on existing approaches, by dropping for instance the clade assumption.</p>
