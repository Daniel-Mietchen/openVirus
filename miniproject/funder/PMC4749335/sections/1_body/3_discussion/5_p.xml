<p>Understanding the link between HIV transmission clusters and community structure in sexual contact networks could help inform policymaking to curb HIV incidence in MSMs. This work stresses the need for new clustering algorithms that focus on community recovery, which remains limited and incidental under current methods. We speculate that covariate information, such as sociodemographic characteristics, could be helpful in community detection, and could best be integrated within a novel parameteric approach that, unlike conventional methods, would not rely on the clade assumption and ad hoc requirements.</p>
