<p>Disagreements persist about the interpretation of transmission clusters inferred from phylogenies [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The present work illustrates how transmission clusters obtained by applying common methods may overlap only partially with islands in the underlying network, especially when epidemics result from a small number of introductions. Because hierarchical clustering methods do not require clusters to be clades in the phylogeny, they tended to produce clusters that corresponded more closely to islands. The three clade-based methods performed almost as well as hierarchical clustering when we simulated under scenarios where each transmission chain within an island formed a clade (type B networks). Since the simulated islands form clear-cut communities, we conclude that community structure cannot be inferred reliably using the existing phylogenetic clustering tools.
