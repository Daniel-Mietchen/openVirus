<p>The present study does have limitations. Real genotyping data from a mapped transmission network was unavailable and so, we had to rely on simulations. It follows that we cannot establish without a doubt that our results would generalize beyond the scenarios we selected. Nevertheless, the similarities between the results we obtained across network types make us confident that our conclusions are reasonably robust to the characteristics of the network structure. We recognize that the networks we simulated are major simplifications of empirical networks, but they do exhibit some important properties of real sexual contact networks, namely moderate to high clustering, community structure, and low mean shortest path lengths.</p>
