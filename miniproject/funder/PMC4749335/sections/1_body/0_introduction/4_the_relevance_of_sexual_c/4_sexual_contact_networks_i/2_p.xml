<p>Sexual contact networks in MSMs are characterized by high clustering, assortative mixing, and the presence of several nodes with a distinctively larger degree [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Clustering, in a contact network graph, refers to the frequency at which any pair of nodes share a common neighbour. The existence of several distinctive high-degree nodes may result from 
 <italic>preferential attachment</italic>, which implies that each subject, when forming a new connection, tends to prefer individuals with an already large number of connections. Preferential attachment leads to graphs with several “hubs”, nodes with an exceptionally high number of neighbours. The resulting degree distribution, called a 
 <italic>power-law distribution</italic>, therefore has a heavy right tail. Communities may result from a combination of assortative mixing and preferential attachment.
