<p>Quick transmission chains for HIV correspond to 
 <italic>transmission clusters</italic>, loosely defined as sets of HIV-positive individuals whose viruses share a “close” common genetic ancestor [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. How close this common ancestor ought to be is typically decided in an ad hoc way. Sets of co-clustered subjects have viruses that are not only close in genetic terms, but also distinct from any viruses from non-co-clustered subjects.
