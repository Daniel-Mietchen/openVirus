<p>The existence of numerous transmission clusters, because of their correspondence with quick transmission chains, may explain the difficulties in containing HIV-1 incidence in MSMs [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but its link with community structure in MSM sexual contact networks is poorly understood. Assessing the contribution of community structure to HIV-1 incidence in MSMs may be helpful to design more effective intervention strategies. With this goal in mind, our study looks specifically at how well transmission clusters map onto communities in a graph. In other words, findings in the present study will help understand the extent to which HIV-positive MSMs in the same transmission cluster tend to belong to the same community, defined with respect to a graph, within a known network structure with easily-distinguishable communities.
