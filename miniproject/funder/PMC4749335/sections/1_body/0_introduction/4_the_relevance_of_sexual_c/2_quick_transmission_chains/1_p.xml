Such groups can only be formed through series of infection events close in time. Indeed, the fast evolution of HIV-1 ensures that correspondence in the genetic makeup of viruses in different subjects indicates not only epidemiologic relatedness, but also a recent viral common ancestor. In other words, sets of genetically similar infections must result from chains of quickly-occuring transmissions. We stress that a quick transmission chain does not necessarily involve a first individual transmitting the virus to a second individual, who then infects a third one, and so on. We can also have a single infected subject transmitting the virus to an arbitrary number of individuals in a short amount of time. The “chain” is defined with respect to transmission events, irrespective of the transmission path.
