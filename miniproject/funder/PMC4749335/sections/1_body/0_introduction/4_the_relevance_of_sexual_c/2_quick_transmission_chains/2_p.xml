<p>Understanding the reasons for the existence of quick transmission chains is crucial, as it could inform public health interventions in MSMs. For instance, the WHO now advocates Treatment as Prevention (TasP) [

 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], TasP is unlikely to succeed in significantly reducing incidence rates, since HIV-1 is rarely diagnosed so early [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Indeed, the detection of numerous quick transmission chains may suggest that early transmissions are mainly responsible for the rising HIV-1 incidence rates in MSMs [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this context, TasP could still potentially prevent a number of infections, but would be unsuccessful in containing the epidemic.
