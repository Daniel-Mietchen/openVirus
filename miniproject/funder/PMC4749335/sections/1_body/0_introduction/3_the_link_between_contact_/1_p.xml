<p>Several studies have looked at the link between contact networks and phylogenies, producing seemingly mixed conclusions. [

 <italic>clustering</italic> in a contact network graph, defined as the propensity of pairs of connected nodes to share a common neighbour, affects epidemics, in terms of their phylogenies. They found that changes in network clustering result in very little variation in trees. [

 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] by, among other things, looking at a family of dynamic networks. Unlike the latter, they found only a modest direct effect of network configuration on phylogenies. Another study presents an attempt to directly reconstruct a sexual contact network, underlying HIV transmission, based on epidemiological and genetic information [
