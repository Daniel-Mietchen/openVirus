<p>Communities in sexual contact networks could very well leave a footprint in the observed epidemiologic history. On one hand, we expect quick (early) transmission within a recently-infected community. Indeed, right after a virus infects a first node in a community, the number of edges leading to uninfected nodes is high, which decreases the mean time until the next infection event. In other words, when the virus enters a new community, the number of 
 <italic>exposed</italic> subjects, that is, uninfected neighbours of infected subjects, tends to rise quickly, and the incidence is expected to spike as a result. On the other hand, we expect slow (late) transmission between different communities [
