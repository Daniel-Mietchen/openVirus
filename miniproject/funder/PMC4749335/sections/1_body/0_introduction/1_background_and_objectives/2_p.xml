<p>We conventionally represent a sexual contact network with a graph whose 
 <italic>nodes</italic>, also called 
 <italic>vertices</italic>, correspond to individuals, and edges, to a sexual association between them. Connected nodes are called 
 <italic>neighbours</italic>. The number of neighbours for a given node is called its 
 <italic>degree</italic>, and the 
 <italic>degree distribution</italic> is one of the defining features of contact network graphs. The sexual contact network therefore maps potential transmission paths for sexually-transmitted pathogens. A graph may also be characterized by 
 <italic>community structure</italic>, that is, it may contain distinctive, non-overlapping sets of nodes within which we observe a high connection density [

 <italic>communities</italic>.
