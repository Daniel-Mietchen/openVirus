<p>Our study explores the association between communities and epidemic spread, the transmission history being represented with a bifurcating tree known as a 
 <italic>phylogeny</italic>. 
 <italic>Phylogenetic methods</italic> make use of sequencing data to reconstruct the ancestral history of a set of organisms, such as HIV-1, and it is still unclear to what extent community structure can be recovered from the phylogeny.
