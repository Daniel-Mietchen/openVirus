<p>Basic epidemiologic models rest on the

In the presence of random mixing, each individual in a population has a small and equal probability of coming into contact with any other individual, which can lead to very quick epidemic spread. For sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) however, the random mixing hypothesis fails to hold: STIs spread within sexual contact networks, that limit their propagation. In particular, the random mixing assumption seems ill-suited for modelling HIV-1 epidemics [
