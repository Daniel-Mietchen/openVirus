<p>In 
 <italic>undirected interconnected-islands models</italic> however, characterized by disjoint subnetworks connected by bridges (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g001">Fig 1</xref>), it is straightforward to make all algorithms return the optimal partition: in these models, each island corresponds to a community. Although simplistic, such networks are not entirely unrealistic. Islands could be thought of as subnetworks in separate countries, cities, or neighbourhoods. They can also result from a high degree of 
 <italic>assortative mixing</italic>. Assortative mixing refers to the tendency of subjects to form connections with individuals sharing similar characteristics, for example, age, socio-economic status, or profession. A high degree of assortative mixing tends to produce easily-distinguishable regions in the contact network graph, made up of nodes representing similar subjects. More specifically, sociodemographic characteristics such as age could contribute to producing islands within a localized sexual contact network.
