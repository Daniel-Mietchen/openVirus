<p>Computing the modularity of all possible node partitions quickly becomes intractable as network size increases and so, communities in graphs are usually found heuristically. For example, the 
 <italic>walktrap</italic> and 
 <italic>label propagation</italic> algorithms are two basic community-detection algorithms [

In large, complicated graphs, different algorithms may yield vastly different results, whose validity can be assessed based on substantive criteria such as a priori knowledge of the relatedness of subjects in the network, if this information is available, or through the modularity score.
