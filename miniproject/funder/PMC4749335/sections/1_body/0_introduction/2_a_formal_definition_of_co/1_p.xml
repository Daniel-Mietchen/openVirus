<p>There are two requirements for a set of nodes to be called a community: a large enough proportion of nodes in the set must be connected to one another, and the set must be sparsely connected to external nodes [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Formally, a proposed split of nodes into communities is evaluated using a 
 <italic>modularity</italic> score [
 <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Different node partitions are proposed and scored, the objective being to identify the partition that maximizes this score: a higher maximum modularity implies a more apparent community structure.
