  <title>Estimates of island recovery for epidemics on type B sexual contact networks, measured with the adjusted Rand Index (ARI).</title>
  <p>Fig A indicates the mean ARI across cutpoints for the different cluster definitions applied to epidemics simulated on unweighted networks. In Fig B, we show corresponding results for weighted networks with between-island transmission rate equal to 25% the within-island transmission rate. In Fig C, each curve gives mean island recovery rates across between-tip distance percentile requirements in Def. 3 for networks with between-island transmission rates 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% the within-island transmission rate. Fig D gives the optimal ARIs across between-island transmission rates. Each curve represents the maximum achieved mean island recovery under the different cluster definitions. For example, the values at bridge weight 0.25 are the suprema in Fig B, as well as the supremum of the red curve in Fig C. Def. 1-4 correspond to the methods for cluster detection described in the Methods section.</p>
