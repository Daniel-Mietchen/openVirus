  <title>Phylogeny and associated unweighted network graph for a simulated epidemic.</title>
  <p>Branch colour indicates on which island transmission and evolution takes place, while tip label colour indicates cluster membership based on snipping the WPGMA dendrogram at height 0.007. Only islands with at least one infected vertex are displayed. Vertex and edge colours are matched with tip label and branch colours, respectively. A white vertex with a teal frame is infected, but undiagnosed. A white vertex with frame color matching that of the island is uninfected.</p>
