Conventionally, we represent sexual contacts in a population with a graph, that can reveal the existence of communities. Phylogenetic methods help infer the history of an epidemic and incidentally, may help detecting communities. In particular, phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 epidemics among men who have sex with men (MSM) have revealed the existence of large transmission clusters, possibly resulting from within-community transmissions. Past studies have explored the association between contact networks and phylogenies, including transmission clusters, producing conflicting conclusions about whether network features significantly affect observed transmission history. As far as we know however, none of them thoroughly investigated the role of communities, defined with respect to the network graph, in the observation of clusters.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>The present study investigates, through simulations, community detection from phylogenies. We simulate a large number of epidemics over both unweighted and weighted, undirected random interconnected-islands networks, with islands corresponding to communities. We use weighting to modulate distance between islands. We translate each epidemic into a phylogeny, that lets us partition our samples of infected subjects into transmission clusters, based on several common definitions from the literature. We measure similarity between subjects&#x02019; island membership indices and transmission cluster membership indices with the adjusted Rand index.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results and Conclusion</title><p>Analyses reveal modest mean correspondence between communities in graphs and phylogenetic transmission clusters. We conclude that common methods often have limited success in detecting contact network communities from phylogenies. The rarely-fulfilled requirement that network communities correspond to clades in the phylogeny is their main drawback. Understanding the link between transmission clusters and communities in sexual contact networks could help inform policymaking to curb HIV incidence in MSMs.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>L.V.&#x02019;s research stay at the D-BSSE was partly funded by the ThinkSwiss program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://thinkswiss.tumblr.com/About">http://thinkswiss.tumblr.com/About</ext-link>).

In the presence of random mixing, each individual in a population has a small and equal probability of coming into contact with any other individual, which can lead to very quick epidemic spread. For sexually-transmitted infections (STIs) however, the random mixing hypothesis fails to hold: STIs spread within sexual contact networks, that limit their propagation. In particular, the random mixing assumption seems ill-suited for modelling HIV-1 epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>We conventionally represent a sexual contact network with a graph whose <italic>nodes</italic>, also called <italic>vertices</italic>, correspond to individuals, and edges, to a sexual association between them. Connected nodes are called <italic>neighbours</italic>. The number of neighbours for a given node is called its <italic>degree</italic>, and the <italic>degree distribution</italic> is one of the defining features of contact network graphs. The sexual contact network therefore maps potential transmission paths for sexually-transmitted pathogens. A graph may also be characterized by <italic>community structure</italic>, that is, it may contain distinctive, non-overlapping sets of nodes within which we observe a high connection density [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We call these sets <italic>communities</italic>.</p><p>Communities in sexual contact networks could very well leave a footprint in the observed epidemiologic history. On one hand, we expect quick (early) transmission within a recently-infected community. Indeed, right after a virus infects a first node in a community, the number of edges leading to uninfected nodes is high, which decreases the mean time until the next infection event. In other words, when the virus enters a new community, the number of <italic>exposed</italic> subjects, that is, uninfected neighbours of infected subjects, tends to rise quickly, and the incidence is expected to spike as a result. On the other hand, we expect slow (late) transmission between different communities [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. After all, in a contact network sense, communities have to be distinctive, which implies that their member nodes tend to be considerably more frequently connected with one another than with non-member nodes.</p><p>Our study explores the association between communities and epidemic spread, the transmission history being represented with a bifurcating tree known as a <italic>phylogeny</italic>. <italic>Phylogenetic methods</italic> make use of sequencing data to reconstruct the ancestral history of a set of organisms, such as HIV-1, and it is still unclear to what extent community structure can be recovered from the phylogeny.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>A formal definition of community structure</title><p>There are two requirements for a set of nodes to be called a community: a large enough proportion of nodes in the set must be connected to one another, and the set must be sparsely connected to external nodes [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Formally, a proposed split of nodes into communities is evaluated using a <italic>modularity</italic> score [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Different node partitions are proposed and scored, the objective being to identify the partition that maximizes this score: a higher maximum modularity implies a more apparent community structure.</p><p>Computing the modularity of all possible node partitions quickly becomes intractable as network size increases and so, communities in graphs are usually found heuristically. For example, the <italic>walktrap</italic> and <italic>label propagation</italic> algorithms are two basic community-detection algorithms [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several more sophisticated approaches can also be used [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In large, complicated graphs, different algorithms may yield vastly different results, whose validity can be assessed based on substantive criteria such as a priori knowledge of the relatedness of subjects in the network, if this information is available, or through the modularity score.</p><p>In <italic>undirected interconnected-islands models</italic> however, characterized by disjoint subnetworks connected by bridges (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0148459.g001">Fig 1</xref>), it is straightforward to make all algorithms return the optimal partition: in these models, each island corresponds to a community. Although simplistic, such networks are not entirely unrealistic. Islands could be thought of as subnetworks in separate countries, cities, or neighbourhoods. They can also result from a high degree of <italic>assortative mixing</italic>. Assortative mixing refers to the tendency of subjects to form connections with individuals sharing similar characteristics, for example, age, socio-economic status, or profession. A high degree of assortative mixing tends to produce easily-distinguishable regions in the contact network graph, made up of nodes representing similar subjects. More specifically, sociodemographic characteristics such as age could contribute to producing islands within a localized sexual contact network.</p><fig id="pone.0148459.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0148459.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>A simple undirected interconnected-islands network, representing subjects living in three different islands, corresponding to cities.</title><p>The graph was randomly-generated.

Despite an increase in the proportion of individuals treated with <italic>highly active antiretroviral therapy</italic> (HAART), the incidence rate of HIV in MSMs in the United States has increased by an estimated 12% between 2008 and 2010.</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Quick transmission chains</title><p>Studies have revealed the existence of <italic>quick transmission chains</italic> in HIV epidemics among MSMs [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], that is, distinct groups of infected subjects with genetically-similar viruses. Such groups can only be formed through series of infection events close in time. Indeed, the fast evolution of HIV-1 ensures that correspondence in the genetic makeup of viruses in different subjects indicates not only epidemiologic relatedness, but also a recent viral common ancestor. In other words, sets of genetically similar infections must result from chains of quickly-occuring transmissions. We stress that a quick transmission chain does not necessarily involve a first individual transmitting the virus to a second individual, who then infects a third one, and so on. We can also have a single infected subject transmitting the virus to an arbitrary number of individuals in a short amount of time. The &#x0201c;chain&#x0201d; is defined with respect to transmission events, irrespective of the transmission path.</p><p>Understanding the reasons for the existence of quick transmission chains is crucial, as it could inform public health interventions in MSMs. For instance, the WHO now advocates Treatment as Prevention (TasP) [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the potential of TasP to curb the HIV-1 epidemic in this subpopulation depends in great part on the timing of onward transmission. If it tends to occur mostly within the first month after infection, corresponding to the <italic>acute infection stage</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], TasP is unlikely to succeed in significantly reducing incidence rates, since HIV-1 is rarely diagnosed so early [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Indeed, the detection of numerous quick transmission chains may suggest that early transmissions are mainly responsible for the rising HIV-1 incidence rates in MSMs [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this context, TasP could still potentially prevent a number of infections, but would be unsuccessful in containing the epidemic.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Transmission clusters</title><p>Quick transmission chains for HIV correspond to <italic>transmission clusters</italic>, loosely defined as sets of HIV-positive individuals whose viruses share a &#x0201c;close&#x0201d; common genetic ancestor [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. How close this common ancestor ought to be is typically decided in an ad hoc way. Sets of co-clustered subjects have viruses that are not only close in genetic terms, but also distinct from any viruses from non-co-clustered subjects.</p><p>Numerous studies have used phylogenetics for transmission cluster inference, and have reported the existence of large transmission clusters in HIV epidemics among MSMs [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Clustering, in a contact network graph, refers to the frequency at which any pair of nodes share a common neighbour.

Assessing the contribution of community structure to HIV-1 incidence in MSMs may be helpful to design more effective intervention strategies. With this goal in mind, our study looks specifically at how well transmission clusters map onto communities in a graph. In other words, findings in the present study will help understand the extent to which HIV-positive MSMs in the same transmission cluster tend to belong to the same community, defined with respect to a graph, within a known network structure with easily-distinguishable communities.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec013"><title>Methods</title><p>Since we do not know of any extensively mapped sexual contact network for MSMs and infection tracing is difficult in this population [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we have no choice but to rely on simulations.</p><sec id="sec014"><title>Simulating the sexual contact networks</title><p>In each simulation, we simulate a sexual contact network, and then, an epidemic spreading onto it. We simulate epidemics on three classes of randomly-generated networks, all within the framework of undirected interconnected-islands models: two deliberately simplistic, called &#x0201c;type&#x0201d; A and &#x0201c;type B&#x0201d;, and the other, called &#x0201c;type C&#x0201d;, tailored in such a way that it displays prominent features of real sexual contact networks. Weights in our networks modulate distance between any two connected subjects. In unweighted networks, any two connected subjects are at arbitrary distance 1. In weighted networks, we attribute weights below 1 to edges serving as bridges. Distance between any two subjects is equal to one over the sum of weight values for edges on the shortest path between them. It follows that the two subjects delimiting a bridge are more distant when we attribute it a lower weight. In each weighted network, we give all bridges the same weight.</p><sec id="sec015"><title>Network consisting of many islands of equal size (Type A)</title><p>In the first network structure, we find 13 islands of 20 subjects each, with each island being a <italic>fully-connected graph</italic>, and one bridge linking any two islands.

To ensure that all islands are accessible, we first link islands in a chain. We then create additional bridges by connecting any two vertices belonging to different islands with probability 0.00075. As in networks of types A and B, we consider networks in which bridge weights take values 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, or 1.</p><p>We introduce preferential attachment by making each island a <italic>Barabasi-Albert</italic> graph [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our simulations, each subnetwork is generated by first creating three interconnected subjects. New subjects are then added one by one. When introduced into the network, a subject randomly forms three connections with existing subjects, who become first-degree neighbours. The probability that a subject is selected increases linearly with his degree. We call this <italic>linear preferential attachment</italic>.</p><p>Further, islands in these networks are of variable size. We sample island sizes independently from an empirical distribution obtained by inspection of the maximum likelihood phylogeny for HIV-1 subtype B sequences used in [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. All viral sequences come from participants in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). We use this phylogeny to partition the 5395 sampled HIV-positive subjects into transmission clusters. We consider co-clustered sets of subjects whose viral sequences are separated by a tree distance of at most 0.1 nt/bp, forming a <italic>clade</italic> of size 5 or more, with this clade having bootstrap support greater than 70%. A set of tips forms a clade if and only if there is a node in the tree with its descending tips corresponding exactly to this set of tips. Based on these criteria, we obtain a list of clusters, for which we derive a cluster size distribution. This distribution may have gaps and so, we apply a loess smoother to it [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Because [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] are working with empirical HIV sequencing data, many HIV-positive subjects who would co-cluster with individuals in the sample may be missing. This incomplete sampling may result from undiagnosed subjects or diagnosed subjects that could or would not participate in the SHCS [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In order to account for this, we assume that each known infection is connected to either 0, 1, or 2 unknown infections, with an average of 1 unknown infection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>The link between islands and communities</title><p>In our analyses, we assume that each island is a community. We ensure that two conventional community-detection algorithms validate this assumption. That is why we measure, with the adjusted Rand index (ARI) [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], correspondence between subjects&#x02019; island and community membership indices, with the latter indices produced by the walktrap and label-propagation community-detection algorithms [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0148459.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The ARI is equal to the ratio of correctly co-clustered and separated elements to the total number of pairs of elements, with a correction term for chance. It is bounded above by 1, which in our case indicates perfect overlap between islands and communities. It gives insight similar to the adjusted mutual information score.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Simulating the epidemics</title><p>Subjects can be in one of three states: &#x0201c;susceptible&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;infected&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;removed&#x0201d;. All subjects start in the &#x0201c;susceptible&#x0201d; state. After introduction of the virus in the network, susceptible subjects may contract the virus from an infected neighbour, at which point they enter the &#x0201c;infected&#x0201d; state. Infections are eventually diagnosed, and subjects move to the &#x0201c;removed&#x0201d; state. In the context of HIV, removal corresponds to diagnosis and uptake of HAART, which prevents transmission by drastically reducing the viral load.</p><p>We stop simulating new transmissions once a predetermined number of subjects are in the &#x0201c;removed&#x0201d; state or, trivially, once the epidemic becomes <italic>extinct</italic>, that is, all infected subjects have moved on to the &#x0201c;removed&#x0201d; state.</p><p>We represent each simulated epidemic with a transmission tree connecting the infected individuals. We terminate a lineage, that is, we obtain a tip, upon an individual leaving the &#x0201c;infected&#x0201d; state and entering the &#x0201c;removed&#x0201d; state. In the analyses, we consider only the subtree connecting all tips corresponding to removed individuals. This phylogeny lets us partition those subjects into transmission clusters. This scheme reflects real data collection, in which an infection can only be recorded after diagnosis.</p><p>In type A sexual contact networks, epidemics result from one random introduction of the virus. In type B networks, we randomly introduce the virus once in the large island, but we assume that only subjects in the small islands can be observed. It follows that removed subjects in the large island are not counted for the purpose of determining when to stop the simulations, as they belong to a foreign epidemic. Thus, the tips in the phylogenies representing the simulated epidemics only correspond to removed individuals in the small islands. Given the large size of the type C networks, we increase the number of introductions to two. This increase also aims to produce a more plausible epidemic, as multiple introductions are common in practice [<xref rid="pone.0148459.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Transmission time along any edge follows an exponential distribution with rate directly proportional to the associated weight, or equivalently, inversely proportional to the distance between the subjects delimiting the edge. In type A and type B networks, we stop simulating new infections once 60 subjects have entered the &#x0201c;removed&#x0201d; state. In type C sexual contact networks, because of their large size, we raise this requirement to 200 subjects. If an epidemic fails to reach this threshold, we discard it along with the sexual contact network on which it was simulated. We then generate a new network and a new epidemic. We simulate epidemics until 300 manage to reach the threshold.</p><p>The minimal size requirement ensures that all sampled epidemics are of the same size and span more than one community, which makes comparisons across and within scenarios more straightforward. Indeed, since an increase in the distance between islands reduces mean time to extinction, without the size requirement, scenarios with more distant islands would involve systematically smaller epidemics, with more of them becoming extinct before a single bridge is crossed. In that extreme case, the ARI for community recovery would be trivially 0, which could be misleading. Indeed, the ARI is meaningful only when the data are partitioned in a non-trivial way. Further, averaging ARIs obtained on epidemics of different sizes would be questionable, since epidemic size affects the difficulty of the clustering problem.</p><p>In order to reduce the probability of epidemics going extinct too early, we use a shifted exponential distribution to generate time until removal. In other words, this time corresponds to the sum of a fixed time and a value simulated from an exponential distribution. It follows that the distribution of time until removal is bounded below by a value greater than zero. The shift gives all newly-infected subjects a minimum amount of time to potentially transmit the virus to their susceptible neighbours. A subject enters the &#x0201c;removed&#x0201d; state at the moment of diagnosis and so, this delay is understood as reflecting the time it takes for an infection to become diagnosable.</p><p>Time in the simulation of epidemics corresponds to genetic distance. In other words, it is understood as the expected number of mutations divided by the number of loci in the DNA alignment. Under a strict molecular clock assumption, genetic distance translates directly to calendar time. We represent each simulated epidemic by a rooted phylogeny, with which, if needed, we can obtain simulated samples of DNA sequences. To get such a sample, first, we simulate a <italic>root sequence</italic>, that is, the genetic makeup of the virus that first entered the sexual contact network, assuming equal frequency for all four bases. Evolution along the phylogeny follows a continuous time Markov process, whose rate matrix we inferred from a subsample of HIV-1 subtype B sequences collected in Montreal, Qu&#x000e9;bec, Canada. By letting the root sequence evolve along the phylogeny, we obtain the required sample.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Finding the clusters and assessing correspondence to islands</title><p>There is no widely-accepted method for partitioning samples of sequencing data into transmission clusters, and different methods tend to yield contradicting results.

Once again, hierarchical clustering (Def. 4) tended to perform better, but the difference in optimal recovery rates was rather small. Like before, Def. 2 clearly outperformed other definitions at higher cutpoints. The improved performance of clade-based definitions was not a surprise.

Islands had sizes ranging from 5 to 16, with mean 9.84. Approximately 9.63% of islands were of size 5. The island size distribution frequency decreased slowly, but systematically, with increasing size until it reached 2.90% for islands of size 16 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0148459.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

The present work illustrates how transmission clusters obtained by applying common methods may overlap only partially with islands in the underlying network, especially when epidemics result from a small number of introductions. Because hierarchical clustering methods do not require clusters to be clades in the phylogeny, they tended to produce clusters that corresponded more closely to islands. The three clade-based methods performed almost as well as hierarchical clustering when we simulated under scenarios where each transmission chain within an island formed a clade (type B networks). Since the simulated islands form clear-cut communities, we conclude that community structure cannot be inferred reliably using the existing phylogenetic clustering tools.</p><p>The present study does have limitations. Real genotyping data from a mapped transmission network was unavailable and so, we had to rely on simulations. It follows that we cannot establish without a doubt that our results would generalize beyond the scenarios we selected. Nevertheless, the similarities between the results we obtained across network types make us confident that our conclusions are reasonably robust to the characteristics of the network structure. We recognize that the networks we simulated are major simplifications of empirical networks, but they do exhibit some important properties of real sexual contact networks, namely moderate to high clustering, community structure, and low mean shortest path lengths.</p><p>The island network model has the important advantage of comprising unambiguous communities. If transmission clusters do not approximate communities in such networks, it is unlikely they will correspond to communities in other network models.</p><p>In summary, current widely-used phylogenetic clustering methods (Def. 2 and 3, which are extensions of Def. 1) often failed to recover sexual contact network communities reliably. A major drawback was their assumption that clusters form clades in the phylogeny, while many clusters were not clades, like in the epidemics simulated in type A and type C networks. Conventional hierarchical clustering methods outperformed the more sophisticated methods in the case where clusters were not clades, and produced similar performance in networks where clusters always formed clades, like in networks of type B. However, particularly for epidemics in type A and type C networks, hierarchical clustering was still far from optimal. Therefore, we call for new clustering methods improving on existing approaches, by dropping for instance the clade assumption.</p><p>Understanding the link between HIV transmission clusters and community structure in sexual contact networks could help inform policymaking to curb HIV incidence in MSMs. This work stresses the need for new clustering algorithms that focus on community recovery, which remains limited and incidental under current methods. We speculate that covariate information, such as sociodemographic characteristics, could be helpful in community detection, and could best be integrated within a novel parameteric approach that, unlike conventional methods, would not rely on the clade assumption and ad hoc requirements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting
