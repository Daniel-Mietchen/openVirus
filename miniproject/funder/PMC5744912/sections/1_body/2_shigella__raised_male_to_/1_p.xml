<p>Shigellosis is a diarrheal illness caused by several species of the bacterium 
 <italic>Shigella</italic>. 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> is transmitted by direct or indirect contact with human feces, often via contaminated food, water, or fomites [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002474.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Prior to the 1970s, 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> incidence was highest among children &lt;5 years of age, their caretakers, and travelers to less developed countries. Recognition of 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> as a potential STI began in the 1970s with outbreaks among men who have sex with men (MSM) in the US [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002474.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Sexual transmission of 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> likely occurs during oral-anal sex (e.g., anilingus or rimming) or digital-anal sex (e.g., fisting) [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002474.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. During the 1970s and 1980s, 
 <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> rates increased in the US among adult males, even as overall rates and rates among children declined [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002474.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Routine case reports for 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> do not include information about sexual practices, but the widening disparity between adult male and female case rates strongly suggested male-male sexual transmission. Increases in 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> among men in the US and England between 2004 and 2015—despite declining or steady rates among women and children—support the reemergence of 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> as an STI among MSM [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002474.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> strains among MSM have demonstrated increasing multidrug resistance over the past 5 years [
