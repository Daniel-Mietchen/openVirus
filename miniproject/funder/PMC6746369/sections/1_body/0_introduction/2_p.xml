<p>A number of studies from high income countries have described concurrency patterns among MSM, but little research has described concurrency in low-to-middle income countries, in Latin America, or among TW specifically. In the US and Australia there is evidence that compared with non-MSM, MSM are 2–3 times more likely to report sexual concurrency, and MSM are more likely to be in open relationships with a primary partner or to have an agreement in place that one or both partners may have other sex partners [

Limited quantitative and qualitative research suggest that MSM in main partnerships have adopted behavioral strategies such that condomless anal intercourse (CLAI), even in the context of concurrent partnerships, carries little risk of HIV transmission[

One such strategy, termed “negotiated safety,” typically requires two conditions: first, both partners must test negative for HIV and disclose their status, and second, any sex outside the main partnership will be “relatively safe” (e.g. use of condoms or refrain from anal sex)[
