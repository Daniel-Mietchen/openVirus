<p>In Peru, there is an ongoing high-incidence HIV epidemic largely among MSM and TW. Between 2010–2016, new HIV infections increased by 24% in Peru, and gay men and other MSM had an estimated HIV prevalence over 15%[

Since current prevention efforts are failing to reduce HIV incidence among MSM and TW, empirical estimates of the levels of sexual concurrency, correlates of concurrency, and information about the interaction of concurrency with CLAI can inform more targeted HIV prevention activities. The aims of this paper are to provide insight in the nature of concurrency and CLAI patterns among Peruvian MSM and TW by quantifying the level of concurrency, describing individual-level characteristics associated with concurrent partnerships, and identifying factors associated with condomless anal intercourse (CLAI) within the context of concurrent partnerships.
