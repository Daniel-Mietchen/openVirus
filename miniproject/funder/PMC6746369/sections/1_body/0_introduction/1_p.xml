<p>Worldwide, men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TW) are disproportionately burdened by HIV [
 <xref rid="pone.0222114.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Biologic risk factors associated with MSM and TW compared to non-MSM and non-TW—among these a higher lifetime numbers of partners and a higher per-act probability of transmission of HIV during anal versus vaginal sex (1.4% vs 0.08%)—likely drive this disparity[

Sexual concurrency, or the practice of having sex with a partner in between two acts of sex with another partner, increases the risk of HIV transmission, even beyond the risk associated with having multiple serial partners (i.e. one after another in time, with no overlap in partnerships) [

Under serial monogamy, HIV can only be transmitted to partnerships beginning later in time, whereas under concurrency, HIV acquired from a partnership that began later in time can be transmitted back to a partnership that began earlier in time, if the earlier relationship is still ongoing. In other words, serial monogamy provides a “protective sequence” of partners, compared to having multiple partners that overlap in time. Furthermore, once an individual with concurrent partners acquires infection from one partner, transmission to the another concurrent partner(s) can occur without the potential delay involved in ending the previous relationship and starting a new one [
