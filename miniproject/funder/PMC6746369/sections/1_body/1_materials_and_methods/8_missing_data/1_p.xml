<p>Participants for whom relational duration could not be calculated based on the information provided by the participant in the questionnaire were excluded from this analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we imputed relational dates based on the following assumptions: for partnerships in which the date of first sexual encounter with a partner was reported but there was no date of most recent sexual encounter, the date of most recent sex was imputed based on the type of partner (stable, casual, or anonymous) and whether or not the respondent reported that s/he thought sex would occur again in the future. The sexual partnership was considered ongoing for stable and casual partners for whom it was unknown whether sex would occur in the future; the date of most recent sex was imputed as the midpoint between date of first sex and the date of their interview for stable partners with whom sex would not occur again; for anonymous partners and for casual partners whose relationship status was not ongoing, sex was considered a one-time event. The results from the analyses with imputed relational data were similar to the results from the analysis using only complete data, and thus only cases with complete data are presented in this paper.</p>
