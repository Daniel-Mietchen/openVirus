<p>This paper presents a secondary analysis of data collected between June and October 2011 as part of the Peruvian Biobehavioral Survey, a nationwide survey of MSM and TW. A total of 5,137 Peruvian MSM (n = 4,440, 86.4%) and TW (n = 697, 13.6%) from five Peruvian cities (Lima/Callao, Iquitos, Ica, Piura, Pucallpa) were enrolled and completed the questionnaire. Participants were eligible for the study if they were at least 18 years of age, assigned male sex at birth, and had at least one male or TW sexual partner in the previous 12 months. This convenience sample was recruited through posters, flyers, informational meetings, and outreach by peer educators at venues frequented by MSM and TW (e.g. saunas, adult movie theaters, video arcades, nightclubs, bars, beauty parlors, and sporting arenas). To reflect the sexually active population, the present analysis is limited to the 2,405 MSM and 414 TW who reported at least one male or TW partner in the three months preceding interview, and who had complete data regarding the dates of first and most recent sex with each partner.</p>
