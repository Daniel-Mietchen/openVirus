<p>We described sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics associated with concurrency in the three months preceding interview and used Pearson’s Chi-squared test to evaluate factors associated with concurrency. Bivariate analyses using Poisson regression with a log link and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were used to estimate the prevalence ratio (PR) of each covariate associated with concurrent partnerships (any vs. none). Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used in lieu of logistic regression because the outcome, concurrency, was common (&gt;10%). Stepwise backward multivariate Poisson regression was used to estimate the adjusted prevalence ratio of concurrency associated with each variable. Covariates were considered for the full multivariate analysis if they were associated with concurrency in bivariate analyses (p-value &lt;0.10) and maintained in the multivariate model if p≤0.05. In an attempt to identify characteristics associated with concurrency above and beyond those associated with having multiple partners, the multivariate analysis was adjusted for total number of male or TW partners in the previous three months. The final model was constructed by selecting the covariates that minimized both the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC).</p>
