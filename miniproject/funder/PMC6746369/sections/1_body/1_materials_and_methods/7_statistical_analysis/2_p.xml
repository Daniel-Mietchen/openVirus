<p>As we were interested in differential condom use by partner type (stable vs. non-stable) among those with concurrent partners, we calculated the proportion of respondents with each combination of concurrent partners (two stable partners, two non-stable partners, or one stable and one non-stable partner), and the proportion of those with a concurrent stable and non-stable partner who reported CLAI. Two sets of bivariate analyses were conducted with generalized estimating equations (GEE) using Poisson regression to estimate the prevalence ratio of participant characteristics associated with 1) CLAI with a stable partner among those reporting a stable partner, and 2) CLAI with a non-stable partner among those reporting a non-stable partner. Since up to three dyads were possible for each respondent, estimates were adjusted for this within-person correlation structure. Although we hypothesized that there would be confounding by sociodemographic variables of age, education, income, role, and sex worker status, adjustment did not change the point estimate of the significant predictors, and no adjustment was made in the final analyses.</p>
