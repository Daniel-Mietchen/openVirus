<p>Concurrency was calculated using methods recommended by UNAIDS[
 <xref rid="pone.0222114.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. According to these methods, we asked participants about the date of first sex (day, month, and year) and date of most recent sex (day, month, and year) with their three most recent sexual partners. These dates were used to calculate the duration of each partnership, and assess whether there was an overlap between partners. We calculated the 3-month cumulative prevalence of at least one instance of concurrency (proportion of participants with any overlap in the 3-months preceding interview) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.
