<p>The 3-month cumulative prevalence of concurrency in our study population was 25.9% (N = 783; 95% CI: 24.4–27.5%). Transgender participants were significantly more likely to report a concurrent partner in the previous three months compared to cisgender participants (30.7% vs 25.2%, p = 0.014). The total number of male partners in the previous three months was positively associated with having concurrent partners for both cisgender and transgender participants (
 <xref rid="pone.0222114.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among cisgender participants, a higher number of stable partners was associated with increased prevalence of concurrency, and among transgender participants, reporting one stable partner was associated with increased prevalence of concurrency compared to those who reported no stable partners (aPR = 1.63, 95% CI: 1.12–2.39). Cisgender participants in older age groups had a significantly higher prevalence of 3-month cumulative concurrency compared to those in the youngest age group. Among cisgender participants, those with concurrent partners were significantly more likely to have tested for HIV in the past, and to have reported condomless anal intercourse (aPR = 1.29, 95% CI: 1.10–1.50).
