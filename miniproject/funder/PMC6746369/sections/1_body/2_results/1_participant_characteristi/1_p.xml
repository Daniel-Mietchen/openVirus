<p>Of the 5,137 MSM and TW included in the national survey who completed the questionnaire, 3,949 reported at least one male or TW partner in the previous three months, and of these 3,019 provided complete relational timing data that allowed us to calculate concurrency status (
 <xref rid="pone.0222114.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The characteristics of the 930 participants who reported at least one male/TW partner, but were missing complete relational timing data are presented in supplemental Appendix 1. The median age of respondents in this sample was 26 (IQR: 21–34), 14% were TW, and 63% identified as homosexual. In the three months preceding interview, participants reported a median of three male or TW sex partners in the previous three months (IQR: 1–6), and one-third had at least one stable partner and three-quarters had at least one non-stable partner. Nearly 8% (n = 241) screened positive for HIV and over 60% reported at least one previous HIV test.
