<p>No factors we explored were significant predictors of CLAI with a stable partner among cisgender MSM (
 <xref rid="pone.0222114.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Among transgender participants, those who had concurrency consisting of a stable and non-stable partner were significantly more likely to report CLAI with their one stable partner compared to those who had two concurrent stable partners (PR = 3.12, 95% CI: 1.13–8.63). Among cisgender participants, predictors of CLAI with a non-stable partner included alcohol use disorder (PR = 1.36, 95% CI: 1.06–1.75), and living in Lima (PR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.34–2.17). Among cisgender participants with a non-stable partner, those with a concurrent stable partner were significantly less likely to have CLAI with the non-stable partner than those with two concurrent non-stable partners (PR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.45–0.71). No factors we explored were significant predictors of CLAI with a nonstable partner among transgender participants.
