<p>To test for evidence of negotiated safety, we explored condom-use patterns among participants who reported at least one instance of concurrency between a stable and non-stable partner. Participants reporting any concurrency (N = 783) provided detail on 1270 total overlapping partnerships. Combined, MSM and TW had 31% (95% CI: 29â€“34%) overlapping stable and non-stable partners, and a considerable proportion of participants with a concurrent partnership between a stable and non-stable partner had CLAI with both partners (20%, 95% CI: 16%-24%). A majority of partnerships showed behavior consistent with negotiated safety; either using condoms with both partners (45%, 95% CI: 40%-50%) or preferentially having CLAI with the stable partner only (30%, 95%CI:26%-35%). These proportions did not differ significantly between cisgender and transgender participants.</p>
