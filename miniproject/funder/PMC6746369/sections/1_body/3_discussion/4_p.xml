<p>Additionally, we hypothesized that there would be evidence in this population of negotiated safety, a practice in which main partners mutually agree to use condoms with non-main partners in order to honor a commitment to their primary partner and to protect themselves from STIs, including HIV [

Although this survey did not ask participants directly about their motivations for condom use, our data suggest that condoms are used differentially with stable compared to non-stable partners in concurrent partnerships. Among those who used condoms differentially by partner type, the majority either had CLAI with only the stable partner or with neither partner; on the other hand, only a small proportion had CLAI with only their non-stable partner. Our data also suggest that condom use with concurrent partners may be different between MSM and TW. Among MSM, CLAI with a non-stable partner was less common among those with a concurrent stable partner compared to those whose concurrent partner was non-stable. Among TW, CLAI with a stable partner was more common among those with a concurrent non-stable partner compared to those with two concurrent stable partners. Future research should explicitly ask about motivations for condom use with stable and non-stable partners in order to better interpret these findings.
