<p>In conclusion, our study suggests that concurrency is common, but that patterns of concurrency and condom use may be different between TW and MSM. Future research should explore differential condom use with stable and non-stable partners to better understand behavioral factors that may alter vulnerability to HIV in TW compared to MSM. In the meantime, targeted interventions, such as frequent HIV testing, treatment of alcohol use disorder, and PrEP for HIV-negative individuals with concurrent partners may be appropriate to reduce HIV acquisition and transmission in both MSM and TW.</p>
