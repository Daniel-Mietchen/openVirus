<p>This study used data from the 2011 Peruvian Biobehavioral Survey to quantify concurrency, to evaluate factors associated with concurrency, and to assess condom use with concurrent partners among MSM and TW in Peru. We found that while both Peruvian MSM and TW have a high prevalence of concurrent sexual partners, TW reported significantly higher cumulative 3-month prevalence of concurrency compared to cisgender MSM (30% vs 25%, respectively). Our estimate of concurrency among MSM is comparable to previous estimates of concurrency in other MSM populations in Western countries,[

Our study is one of few to specifically report the prevalence of concurrency in TW populations, and suggests that patterns of concurrency and condom use may be different among TW compared to MSM. Historically in the HIV literature, data regarding MSM and TW have been conflated; however, analyzing TW and MSM as separate populations improves the ability to identify distinct social or behavioral factors that may increase vulnerability to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV[
