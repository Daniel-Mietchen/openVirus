<p>This study elucidated the convergence of transmission-related risk factors, particularly among MSM: alcohol use disorder (AUD), condomless anal intercourse (CLAI), and concurrent sexual partnerships. A substantial proportion (20%) with concurrent partners did not use condoms with either their stable or non-stable partner, consistent with previous studies which found a considerable proportion of the population is unlikely to use condoms with any partner, even if these partners overlap in time [
