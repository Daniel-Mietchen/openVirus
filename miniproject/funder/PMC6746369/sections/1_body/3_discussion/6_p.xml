<p>The results of this study should be interpreted with the following limitations in mind. First, individuals were only included in this analysis if they had complete data on first and most recent dates of sex with up to their three most recent partners. It is possible that those with missing data are systematically different from those with complete data, resulting in a biased estimate of concurrency. However, a sensitivity analysis with imputed dates suggests that the inference drawn from this study is robust. Second, the population included in the Biobehavioral Surveillance was a convenience sample and may not be representative of the general MSM and TW population. Recruitment was conducted at social venues, including bars and nightclubs, and at venues frequented by sex workers, possibly resulting in higher levels of alcohol use and risky sexual behavior. On the other hand, individuals sampled for participation in this study had a lower than expected HIV prevalence (8%), compared to over 20% prevalence in previous studies.[

 <xref rid="pone.0222114.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] This could be due to the fact that those at higher risk had tested positive for HIV previously, and therefore chose not to participate in a screening study. Finally, PrEP was not available at the time this study was conducted but has since considerably changed the landscape of HIV prevention [
