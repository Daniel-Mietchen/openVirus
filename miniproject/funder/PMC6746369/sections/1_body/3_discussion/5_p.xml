<p>It is possible that negotiated safety could be an effective risk reduction technique if practiced consistently and at high levels in these populations, but further modeling studies and empirical data is needed to confirm this hypothesis. In the absence of these data, condom use and frequent HIV testing may be appropriate and acceptable risk reduction techniques for both MSM and TW populations, given the already observed high-level uptake of these behaviors. Given the high proportion of MSM and TW with concurrent partners, and the known impact of concurrency in driving HIV epidemics, consideration of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for those with concurrent partners, particularly those who do not use condoms consistently, may also be appropriate.</p>
