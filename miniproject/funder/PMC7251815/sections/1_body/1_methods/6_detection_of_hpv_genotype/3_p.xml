<p id="Par45">The assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The first reaction was a Pre-PCR step that included 10 μl of PCR Mix A and 10 μl of PCR Mix B and 5 μl of the extracted sample DNA. The PCR reactions were performed on the CFX96 real-time PCR machine (Bio-Rad, California, USA). Each PCR product was mixed with 65 μl of Hybridization buffer and incubated at 45 °C for 60 min on a microarray slide. Slides were washed with buffer, dried and read on the Microarray Scanner and EUROArray Scan software that detects signal strength in terms of immunofluorescence units.</p>
