<p id="Par36">Women aged 18â€‰years and above, presenting with or without symptoms of possible reproductive tract infections were included. Whereas, women who underwent hysterectomy or claimed not to have any kind of previous sexual intercourse were excluded. Since specimen collection may include a mild invasive procedure, pregnant women were excluded from this study for safety reasons. On the other hand, all nonpregnant women who were approached, voluntarily participated in the study, knowing that the screening was free of charge.</p>
