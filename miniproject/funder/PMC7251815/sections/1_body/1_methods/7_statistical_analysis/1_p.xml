<p id="Par46">Data analysis was performed using SPSS (version 20.0). Descriptive analysis including frequencies, percentages and averages were used when appropriate to describe the population under study. Prevalence was calculated to indicate the number of subjects carrying STIs among the recruited sample. A chi-square test was used to assess the association between exposures and outcomes expressed as categorical variables. The threshold for significance was set at alpha 0.05. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to calculate odds of infection relative to variables that showed significance at the bivariate level. Odds ratios were considered significant if the 95% confidence interval excluded 1.</p>
