 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Positive controls were kindly donated by Addenbrooke’s hospital clinical microbiology laboratory, Cambridge, UK. The 12.5 μl duplex or quadriplex PCR reactions included 12.5 μl of Platinum Quantitative PCR SuperMix-UDG (Invitrogen Carlsbad,CA), 3 mM MgSO4, 6.25 pmol of forward and reverse primers, 2.5 pmol of fluorogenic probes, and 5 μl of purified nucleic acid. The reaction was initiated by two heating steps at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 2 min followed by 45 amplification cycles with the following conditions: 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. The appropriate fluorescence reading was performed at 60 °C.
