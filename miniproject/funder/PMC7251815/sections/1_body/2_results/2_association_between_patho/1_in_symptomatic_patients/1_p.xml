 <italic>N</italic> = 257) reported having genital clinical symptoms, of whom 64% (
 <italic>N</italic> = 165) were positive for the tested pathogens. A high rate of 
 <italic>U.parvum</italic> and 
 <italic>G.vaginalis</italic> coinfection was observed (
 <italic>N</italic> = 103), among which only 49% were seen as symptomatic. No significant association was however observed between the presence of studied pathogens (when detected as single or multiple infections) and the presence of any symptoms (
