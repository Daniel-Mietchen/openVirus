 <bold>)</bold> with different prevalence rates and percentages. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> reveals the presence of 17 HR-HPV genotypes detected in the samples; the highest rates being recorded for types 16 (38%, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 13) and 18 (21%, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 7). A lower prevalence of LR-HPV was observed where 11 LR-HPV genotypes were identified, with the highest number of patients being recorded for types 54 (17.6%, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 6) and 42 (11.7%, 
 <italic>N</italic> = 4). HPV genotypes were grouped on the basis of their presence as single, double, triple or more genotypes (Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>); the highest percentage was observed as a single HPV genotype reaching 44% (
 <italic>N</italic> = 15). HPV genotype 16 was found as a single genotype in five women (33%). As the number of coinfecting HPV genotypes increases, the percentage of women positive for more than one genotype decreases from 24% (
 <italic>N</italic> = 8) for 2 types, to 12% (
 <italic>N</italic> = 4) for 3 types, reaching 3% (
 <italic>N</italic> = 1) for 8 simultaneous genotypes (Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). The authors were not able to propose a pattern of HPV genotypes prevalence among positive samples that has reached a statistical significance (Table S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>).
