 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> presents univariate and multivariate logistic regression results for the presence of infection with the demographic and behavioral characteristics which appeared to be significant at the bivariate level. The univariate logistic regression odds ratio showed that being older or ever married were protective, while consuming alcohol or using an IUD were risk factors. In the multivariate analysis, after controlling for all characteristics significant at the bivariate level, only younger age and the use of IUD remain risk factors for infection. In fact, women appear to be 3 times more at risk of infection if they are between the ages of 18–29 compared to women older than 50. The use of an IUD more than doubles the risk of infection for women.
