<p id="Par66">Our study has found that among the mollicutes, 
 <italic>U.parvum</italic> was the most frequently detected microorganism with an overall prevalence of 34.9%, and the most isolated single pathogen. 
 <italic>U.parvum</italic> was frequently associated with increased positivity for 
 <italic>G.vaginalis</italic>, however, no significant association was found between the detection of both pathogens and symptoms. Neither 
 <italic>U.parvum, U.urealyticum</italic>, nor 
 <italic>G.vaginalis</italic> seem to be significantly associated with symptoms in females when isolated as a single pathogen; their role in the female urogenital tract therefore remains unknown, although reported cases have shown that these infections can cause cervicitis and bacterial vaginosis [
