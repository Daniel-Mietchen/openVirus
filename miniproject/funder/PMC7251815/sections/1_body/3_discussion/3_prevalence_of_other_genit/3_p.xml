<p id="Par68">New diagnostic assays such as nucleic acid testing improved the detection of 
 <italic>T.vaginalis</italic> especially in asymptomatic individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This may explain why the prevalence of 
 <italic>T.vaginalis</italic> infection in our study was higher (2%) than the one found in a previous study conducted in Lebanon (1.2%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. 
 <italic>T. vaginalis</italic> was also reported to be low in other industrialized countries [
