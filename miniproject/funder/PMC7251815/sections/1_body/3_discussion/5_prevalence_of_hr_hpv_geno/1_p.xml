<p id="Par72">In any country, it is necessary to know the HPV genotype distribution to assess the effectiveness of vaccines recommended by the gynecologists. The predominance of HR-HPV in our study favors the recommendation of HPV vaccination. Currently available HPV vaccines are Gardasil, Gardasil 9, and Cervarix [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]; all 3 vaccines prevent infections with HPV types 16 and 18. Although Gardasil 9 protects against infection with additional HPV types such as 6, 11, 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58; it excludes other types of infections prevalent in the region such as type 51, 26, 39 and 73. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, HPV 51 and HPV 26 has been defined as human carcinogens [
