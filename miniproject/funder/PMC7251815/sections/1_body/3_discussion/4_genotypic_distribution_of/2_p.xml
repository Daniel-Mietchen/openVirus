<p id="Par70">Data on the prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV infection in Lebanon are limited. The most frequently detected HPV genotypes among women were the HR-HPVs. Our study found that HPV16 (38%), HPV 18 (21%) HPV51 (18%), HPV 26 (15%), HPV39 (15%), and HPV 73 (12%) were the six predominant genotypes in the sample.
