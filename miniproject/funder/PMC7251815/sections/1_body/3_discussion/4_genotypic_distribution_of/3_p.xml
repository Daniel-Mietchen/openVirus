<p id="Par71">WHO has issued a document on controlling cancer in the Eastern Mediterranean region where only 35% of cervical cancer were reported at early stages while the rest were discovered at later stages; the latter are usually associated with bad prognosis and minimal recovery rate [

Another meta-analysis study, conducted at the international level, showed that at an unspecified point in time, 11.7% of women with normal cervical cytological findings were positive for HPV infection; of which 70% were carcinogenic HPV types. The main variables affecting such data were age and geography [

In Lebanon, most clinicians use cytology screening for cervical cancer once a year instead of HR HPV-based screening, which may affect the early detection and treatment of women. Adding to that, the national prevalence of “ever used” of the PAP smear is 35% [
