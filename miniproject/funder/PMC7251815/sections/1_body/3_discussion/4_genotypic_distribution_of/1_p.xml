The prevalence of HPV in our study sample was 6.7% which is in concordance with the results of a meta-analysis that was conducted in 2012 on HPV in the MENA region [

The latter could be explained by new acquisitions of the virus following a new sexual partner, changes in sexual practices, reactivation of the latent uncleared infection due to reduced immunity with aging or survival bias due to death of women who developed cervical cancer [
