<p id="Par64">The aim of the present epidemiological study was to investigate the prevalence of STIs among women using a highly reliable, sensitive and cost effect diagnostic test for simultaneous detection of microorganisms. The results showed that STI pathogens are found in both symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Clinical management and treatment of these pathogens in asymptomatic individuals are challenging. On the other hand, the absence of pathogens in the presence of symptoms could be explained by the presence of microbiomes not yet identified or by disease of non-microbial origin.</p>
