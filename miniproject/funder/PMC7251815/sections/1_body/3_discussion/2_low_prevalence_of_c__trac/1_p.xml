<p id="Par65">This study presented a low prevalence of both 
 <italic>C.trachomatis</italic> (0.8%) and 
 <italic>N.gonorrhoeae</italic> (0.2%) including one asymptomatic coinfection. Our results were comparable to other studies in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA) and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) which reported a prevalence ranging from 2.5 to 4.2% for 
 <italic>C.trachomatis</italic> and 0.1 to 0.6% for 
 <italic>N.gonorrhoeae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The prevalence of both bacteria are reported to be higher in UK, France and American regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The low prevalence of these infections in Lebanon may relate to the fact that the majority of women were married and probably faithful to their husbands; few women reported to have multiple sexual partners.
