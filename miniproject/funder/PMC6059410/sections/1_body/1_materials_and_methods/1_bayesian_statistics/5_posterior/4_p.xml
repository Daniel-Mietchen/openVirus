<p>The full conditional of 
 <italic>q</italic> does not have a closed form. The forms of the diagnosed random variables are the same. Random variable estimates were obtained using Metropolis-Hastings nested within a Gibbs sampler over 100,000 iterations with R version 3.3.3 [
 <xref rid="pone.0200126.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The proposal distribution was a truncated normal distribution since the hyperparameter 
 <italic>q</italic> cannot be negative, using package rmutil [
 <xref rid="pone.0200126.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], centered at the previous value of the parameter. Proportions 1 through 9 were sampled consecutively, followed by hyperparameter 
 <italic>q</italic>. The trace plots quickly converged within 200 iterations, and the first 2000 samples were removed. Code is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200126.s003">S3</xref> and
