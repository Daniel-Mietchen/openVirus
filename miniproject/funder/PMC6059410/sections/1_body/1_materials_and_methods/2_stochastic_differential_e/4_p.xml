<p>Due to the magnitude of the scale of this system we assume that all events will happen, and the source of the stochasticity is primarily reporting issues. Tau leap algorithm was used to preform the stochastic simulations. A time step of 1 year was selected, and the population at time 
 <italic>t+1</italic> is the numerical solution of the population at time 
 <italic>t</italic> and random noise from a 
 <italic>NOR</italic>(0,
 <italic>σ</italic>), where 
 <italic>σ</italic> is 10% of the population at time 
 <italic>t</italic>
