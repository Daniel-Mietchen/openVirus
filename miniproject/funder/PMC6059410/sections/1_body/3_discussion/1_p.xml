<p>We were able to obtain conservative estimates of the proportional changes in the diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV-infected populations using hierarchical Bayesian statistics. Our estimates suggest that the proportion of infected individuals who are undiagnosed is decreasing by approximately 2.8% each year from 2005 to 2013, while the proportion of diagnosed individuals is increasing by approximately 3.6%. We used the proportional change as constraints on a system of stochastic differential equations. This allowed us to estimate the transmission and diagnosis rates. We were able to recover reasonable parameter estimates and population dynamics using this methodology. To learn more about the cause of the decrease in the undiagnosed population, we considered some scenarios that would affect the epidemiological parameters: exhaustion of the at-risk population, lack of access to care, and reduction in viral load by anti-retroviral therapy.</p>
