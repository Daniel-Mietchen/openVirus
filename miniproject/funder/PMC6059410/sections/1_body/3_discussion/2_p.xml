<p>We were able to recover the diagnosed population dynamics when we altered the parameters to reflect these scenarios with the exception of including exhaustion of susceptibles. Modeling transmission as a function of the size of the at-risk population caused the size of the infected populations to increase rapidly. In the other scenarios some interesting dynamics could be observed in the undiagnosed population. Lack of access to care was simulated by considering diagnosis rate a constant unaffected by the size of the undiagnosed population. This resulted in an improvement in the likelihood of observing the data (

Anti-retroviral therapy usage also improved the overall recovery, but this effect was weaker for the undiagnosed population dynamics. Although the undiagnosed population size is dependent on the quality of the data available on the diagnosed population of that year, these results indicate that the scenarios that maximizes the probability of observing the diagnosed population also maximizes the probability of observing the diagnosed population estimates.
