<p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) progresses in three stages. The first stage lasts approximately 3 months and individuals in this stage are approximately 10 to 25 times more effective at transmitting the disease [

Efforts to improve the diagnosis rate include educational programs, as an individual’s perceived risk was shown to be highly correlated with the individual obtaining multiple HIV tests [
