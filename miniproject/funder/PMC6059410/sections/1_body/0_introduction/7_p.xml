<p>In this work we use coupled statistical and mathematical methodology to study the relationships between the three hypothesized causes and their respective population dynamics. We use hierarchical Bayesian statistics to get estimates for the size of the infected populations and their proportional changes across the years. These estimates are used to calculate epidemiological parameters for a system of stochastic differential equations. Currently we are not aware of any similar methods in the literature. Such a problem is challenging as the proportional change across the populations is a hyperparameter controlling the yearly proportions, which each have their own statistical model. This results in a large model that must be studied numerically.</p>
