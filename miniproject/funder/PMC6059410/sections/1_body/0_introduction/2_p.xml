<p>After diagnosis, infected individuals have the opportunity to take anti-retroviral therapy (ART) that reduces their viral load and retards the progression of the disease, providing an improvement in life expectancy [

 <xref rid="pone.0200126.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The earlier that ART is received the higher the reduction in transmission events, particularly if obtained during the initial stage of HIV [

 <xref rid="pone.0200126.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. ART therapies could eradicate the epidemic in a population with high prevalence of infection even without the additional effect of behavioral changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0200126.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Mathematical models estimate that the HIV epidemic could be reduced to less than 1% of the population infected (elimination phase) with universal testing and by providing ART consistently to newly diagnosed individuals [

 <xref rid="pone.0200126.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Patients tend to report their adherence as much higher than it actually is, but studies indicate that even low adherence may be sufficient for control of the epidemic [
