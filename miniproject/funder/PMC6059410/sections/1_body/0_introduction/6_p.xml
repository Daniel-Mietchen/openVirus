<p>The difficulty in studying this system mathematically lies in parameter estimates. A minimal model of this system requires at least three parameters: transmission of the disease, diagnosis of the disease, and death due to the disease. Since knowledge about the undiagnosed population is restricted to those who have been diagnosed, estimates of these parameters are generally forced to assume that this population is representative of the whole.</p>
