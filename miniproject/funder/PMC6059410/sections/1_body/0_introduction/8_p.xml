<p>The resulting simulations give insight into the implications of the estimated undiagnosed population on epidemiological parameters. Our model suggests that the undiagnosed population may be larger than current estimates while recovering population dynamics. The best recovery of the dynamics observed in the existing data occurs when the increase in the diagnosed population due to diagnosis is greater than the decrease in the undiagnosed population. We hope this study will help inform future efforts to improve the situation of infected individuals and prevent future outbreaks.</p>
