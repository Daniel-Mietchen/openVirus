<p>Estimates using CD4 levels of newly diagnosed individuals suggest that the undiagnosed population is decreasing between 2005â€“2013 in the US [

The size of the at-risk population is not easy to estimate since it depends on behavior. High risk populations include individuals in poverty and men who have sex with men (MSM) [

 <xref rid="pone.0200126.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. As the at-risk population decreases the number of diagnoses will also decrease, which will cause the estimated number of undiagnosed individuals to decrease.
