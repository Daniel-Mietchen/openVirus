<p>Since it seems likely that most or all of these scenarios affect the infected population simultaneously, we analyze all their possible combinations (

 <xref rid="pone.0200126.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. To determine the best cause, we quantify the goodness of fit by determining the relative likelihood of observing the data given the mean and variance of the stochastic simulations. These probabilities are given in
