<p>Lack of access to care, ART usage, or their combined resulted in the best recovery of the data for both the undiagnosed and diagnosed populations. Under the ART scenario, the diagnosed population has been reduced by 96%, resulting in a dynamic reduction in the transmission rate. We originally estimate the transmission rate to be 3.4% of the total infected population. This is close to the literature estimate of around 4-6% of infected individuals transmitting HIV to an at-risk individual [

 <xref rid="pone.0200126.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. With the majority of the diagnosed population removed, the effective transmission rate is much lower. Under the LAC scenario, there is a constant diagnosis rate. This represents a yearly reduction in the undiagnosed population and increase in the diagnosed population of 3.6%. This means the diagnosed population grows faster than the undiagnosed population is reduced. Although lack of access to care in the undiagnosed population would mean the data are inaccurate, in our case the best fitting model is consistent for both subpopulations.
