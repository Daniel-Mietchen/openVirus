<p>Bayesian estimates for the proportions of diagnosed or undiagnosed individuals was obtained concurrently with the estimated proportional change. The prior distribution was chosen to be a beta for the proportions and a gamma for the proportional changes. The likelihood function was a binomial, representing the chance of randomly selecting a diagnosed or undiagnosed individual from a pool of infected individuals. The posterior did not have a closed form. Due to the symmetry of the posterior samples we summarize them using their mean and variance. The posterior means of the proportions for both undiagnosed and diagnosed estimates are very close to the original data (
