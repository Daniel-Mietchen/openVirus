<p>Recent estimates place the cost of influenza pandemics at upward of $500 billion per year [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this context, an investment of at least $1 billion per year in the biomedical research effort to achieve a solution for protection against pandemic influenza seems justified. In addition, efforts to develop a universal influenza vaccine, even before reaching this goal, will likely lead to improved seasonal vaccines, with the potential to reduce morbidity rates and save tens of thousands of lives each year. Solving this problem is potentially achievable with todayâ€™s technology, and with an organized and sustained focus on interventions for influenza and other potential emerging infectious threats, more advanced approaches could be rapidly developed.
