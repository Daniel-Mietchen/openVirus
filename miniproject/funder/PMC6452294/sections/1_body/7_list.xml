  <p>By harnessing high-throughput sequencing and computational biology, more sophisticated algorithms based on sequence analysis, glycan patterns, and other features that may anticipate high transmissibility can be developed for predicting the next dominant strain[
   <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The prudent study of gain-of-function mutations would allow scientists to learn more about what molecular signatures to look for.

  <p>Improving strain selection for seasonal vaccines would increase the likelihood of an antigenic match between the vaccine and dominant circulating strains and thereby improve the utility of current vaccine technology[
   <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The current vaccines could be further improved by better standardization of the neuraminidase content, adjustment of antigen doses, addition of improved adjuvants, and production in cell substrates that minimize the likelihood of viral adaptations and changes in protein sequences[
   <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].

  <p>Precisely defining the B-cell repertoire and epitope-specific phenotypes involved in the response to influenza infection and vaccination would provide insight into the problem of “original antigenic sin” described by Thomas Francis in 1960 and the related phenomenon of immunodominance[
   <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Prior influenza immunity and poorly understood antigenicity patterns make it difficult to reshape and broaden the antibody response using current vaccines[
   <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Defining all the ways antibody can bind and neutralize influenza structurally and establishing a new nomenclature for describing antigenic sites across both influenza A groups as well as influenza B would reduce confusion and improve communication between scientists[
   <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, learning which features of vaccine-induced local or systemic immune responses result in sustained serum antibody responses may inform vaccine formulation and delivery approaches.

  <p>Understanding more precisely the B-cell and antibody responses would allow the application of protein engineering for antigen design and display using molecular targets and antibody lineage end points to guide iterative design modifications[

  <p>The role of CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in determining the efficacy of a B-cell response is an area of active investigation; however, more work in this area may be required to solve the problem of durability and maintenance of antibody responses[

  <p>The direct role of CD4
   <sup>+</sup> or CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T-cell effector functions and whether those cells require localization in mucosal tissue or lymph nodes to effectively protect against respiratory viral pathogens are poorly understood. Optimizing vaccine formulation and delivery route and modality is dependent on acquiring this type of knowledge[
   <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

  <p>Defining the importance of including specific antigenic targets, such as the head or stem domains of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, or the M2 ectodomain in universal vaccines, and determining whether they are more effective when used in combination or alone could be accomplished through both vaccine protection and natural history studies that provide a better understanding of protective immunity [
   <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9–12</xref>].

  <p>Understanding the mechanistic correlates of immunity generated by immunization with live attenuated vaccines may reveal the importance of secretory immunoglobulin A and intraepithelial T cells that require induction of immunity to occur at the mucosal surface[

  <p>Defining both the virological and host immune response patterns associated with transmissibility would allow better modeling of population dynamics and factors that could best interrupt transmission cycles[
   <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This could be particularly important for identifying distinct vaccination strategies for different target populations, including in societal settings in which transmission dynamics and target populations vary[
   <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

  <p>Using human challenge studies and improving animal models of influenza infection and transmission may help answer some of these questions[
   <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, the utility of animal models hinges on selecting those that are most relevant to human pathogenesis and immunity. Improving the characterization of and expanding the reagents for these models would not only benefit influenza vaccine development but would also provide answers to immunological questions relevant to other respiratory virus infections and emerging infectious diseases in general.
