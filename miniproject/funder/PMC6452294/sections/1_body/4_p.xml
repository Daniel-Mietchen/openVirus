<p>In 1918, there were approximately 1.8 billion persons living on earth; today, there are more than 7 billion [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. If a pandemic similar to that of 1918 occurred today, how would the devastation compare? Because of rapid international travel, the spread of a new virus would be faster than it was in 1918, when spread was largely related to the movement of troops at the end of World War I. Today, population density is higher and cities are larger, providing a more favorable environment for a rapidly spreading virus. Although we now have more sophisticated medical care, the availability of hospital beds and life support equipment would probably not be sufficient to manage an outbreak equivalent in magnitude to that of 1918.
