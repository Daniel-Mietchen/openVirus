<p>New vaccines are often derived by exploiting new technologies [

Seventy years ago, the ability to grow high titers of influenza virus in chicken eggs made the current inactivated influenza vaccine approach feasible. Although we have made major advances in understanding the virology, immunology, epidemiology, genetics and clinical consequences of influenza virus disease, current vaccines, updated annually to protect against anticipated seasonal virus strains, are at best 60% effective and often less so [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Antigenic drift resulting from mutations in critical proteins of the influenza virus allows the virus to evade the strain-specific immunity elicited by current vaccines. Moreover, over the past hundred years, antigenic shifts or major changes in influenza strains have resulted in pandemics, occurring in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009. Thus, influenza has proved itself time and again to be not only a pandemic threat, but a pandemic inevitability. Concurrently, modern forms and volume of travel have made it easier for viruses to spread rapidly around the globe [
