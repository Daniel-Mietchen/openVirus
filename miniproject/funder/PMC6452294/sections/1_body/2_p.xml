<p>During the last 10 years, newer technologies have emerged, stimulating scientists to answer old questions in new, more precise ways and to ask novel questions that could not previously be addressed [

Scientific advances that directly benefit vaccinology include monoclonal antibody isolation and identification, structural biology, protein engineering, and antigen delivery amenable to platform manufacturing approaches. Molecular- and atomic-level information about the immune-viral interface combined with new capacities for surveillance and rapid response to pandemics are shaping a new conceptual framework for vaccine development. As a result of these advances, high-level, broad, and durable immunity against the large universe of influenza viruses may now be within reach [
