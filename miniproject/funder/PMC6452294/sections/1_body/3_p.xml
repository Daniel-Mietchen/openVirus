 <italic>The Journal of Infectious Diseases</italic> was motivated by the confluence of the 1918 influenza pandemic centenary and the new opportunities afforded by technological advances and breakthroughs along with the improved understanding of influenza biology. We have gathered information, opinions, and ideas from thought leaders in immunology, virology, epidemiology, and vaccinology to address the challenge of developing a universal influenza vaccine and articulate some of the knowledge and technical gaps that remain.
