<p>If there were sentinel events as in 1918 and in 2009—a small spring epidemic preceding the fall pandemic—current vaccine manufacturing approaches would not be sufficiently fast or scalable for worldwide distribution to preempt pandemic spread. Therefore, development of a universal influenza vaccine that can reliably protect against drifted seasonal strains and pandemic strains without biannual reformulation is imperative. Ideally, this vaccine would not need to be given every year; however, even if annual vaccination was required but antigenic components needed updating only every 5–10 years, it would still be a significant advance over the current system.</p>
