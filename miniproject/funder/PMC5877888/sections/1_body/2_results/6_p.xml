<p>Our results suggest that once the patient samples are taken, the patients are unlikely to continue transmitting to others. In fact, the median number of sampled ancestors for most RMDS clusters is zero. Very few clusters belonging to the 215D, 108I, 181C and 190A data sets have significantly more than zero sampled ancestors. Overall, the probability of being removed from the infectious pool upon sampling is above 89% (smallest median estimate) for patients infected with sensitive strains. There is much uncertainty in the estimates of the removal probability for resistant strains, which range from 44% (215D; 95% HPD: 0.7-84%) to 95% (138A; 95% HPD: 81-100%),</p>
