<p>For each resistance mutation we quantify the between-host fitness cost as the ratio 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>Î»</sub> of the transmission rate of the drug resistant strains divided by the transmission rate of the drug sensitive strain. Among the considered resistance mutations, only the 90M mutation in the protease gene was found to have significantly higher fitness than the drug sensitive strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006895.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The following mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found to be less fit than the sensitive strains: 67N, 70R, 184V, 219Q. The highest posterior density intervals of the transmission ratios for the remaining resistance mutations (41L, 103N, 108I, 138A, 181C, 190A, 210W, 215D, 215S) all included the threshold one, suggesting that these mutations do not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV Cohort Study.
