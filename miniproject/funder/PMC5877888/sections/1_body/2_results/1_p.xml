<p>After applying the selection criteria described in the Methods section, we obtained 15 RMDS with 8 (181C &amp; 190A) to 56 (41L) clusters per resistance mutation comprising a total of 311 (190A) to 1014 (138A) sequences (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006895.t001">Table 1</xref>). The total number of patients included in the study after applying the above criteria is 2614. Most clusters contain very few resistant samples. Sensitive samples are allowed to occur in multiple RMDS. Histograms of the numbers of (i) all and (ii) resistant samples per cluster are shown in
