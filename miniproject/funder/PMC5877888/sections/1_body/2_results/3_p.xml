<p>We quantify the transmission dynamics of the drug sensitive virus samples by estimating the effective reproduction number,

 </sub>, through time. This yields one estimate for each of the 14 RMDS, which agree with one another (depicted by 14 overlapping violin plots per time interval, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006895.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Our results suggest that

 </sub> was above 2 before 1994, below the epidemic threshold of one between 1994 and 2001 and around 1 after 2001.
