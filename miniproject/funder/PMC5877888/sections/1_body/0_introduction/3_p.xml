<p>In this study we employ a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness costs of major resistance mutations using data from the Swiss HIV cohort study (SHCS) and the associated drug resistance database. Our approach is based on stochastic birth–death–sampling processes, which have been shown to be suitable for the modelling of epidemic processes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In terms of the transmission tree a “birth” event corresponds to the infection of a new host, a “death” event corresponds to the host’s removal from the infectious pool (e.g. successful treatment). The removed host may or may not have been sampled before removal, which corresponds to the viral strain being sequenced and included in the SHCS.
