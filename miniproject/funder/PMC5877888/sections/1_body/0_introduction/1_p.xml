<p>The emergence and subsequent spread of drug resistant human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a major threat to the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral treatment. Around 10% of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV-1 and transmitted drug resistance (TDR) has been associated with a higher virological failure rate during treatment [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The dynamics of TDR depend largely on the respective resistance mutation and requires quantification of their fitness cost. Estimates of fitness costs, resistance evolution and reversion rates could previously only be obtained by comparing the replication kinetics of the virus after infection of cell cultures or more complicated experimental techniques [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. These methods are essential in understanding the type of fitness cost related to replication within the host. Here we are interested in a different type of viral fitness, namely the transmission fitness, which describes the success of a viral lineage in transmission between hosts.
