<p>The associated drug resistance database is a central, anonymised collection of all genotypic drug resistance tests performed on SHCS enrolees. The base data set used in this study contains the first HIV-positive (subtype B) samples of treatment na√Øve SHCS patients. Due to the availability of the SHCS biobank, in total more than 12000 genotypes could be generated retrospectively, making the SHCS one of the globally most densely sampled populations [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In particular, all patients with available samples present before the start of ART were retrospectively sequenced. This is of particular importance because in general, HIV drug resistance testing was not routinely performed before 2003 in Switzerland or even later in other countries. Hence, the sampling dates of the sequences included here range from as early as 1989 to 2015.
