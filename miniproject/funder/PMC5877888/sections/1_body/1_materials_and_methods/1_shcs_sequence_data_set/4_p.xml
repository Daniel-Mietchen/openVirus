<p>For each of the major resistance mutations we selected all clusters that contained at least one sequence in which the respective mutation was present. From the remaining samples that did not have the respective mutation, we removed sequences in which any of the other major resistance mutations were present (≤ 10%). Hence, the sequences in the resulting clusters are either ‘truly sensitive’, or contain the respective resistance mutation. From the resulting resistance mutation related data sets (RMDS) we included only those that met the following two criteria: Summing over all clusters (i) the total number of sequences is ≥ 25 and (ii) the number of resistant sequences is ≥ 10 (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006895.t001">Table 1</xref>). Numbers of resistant and total samples per RMDS per cluster are illustrated in
