<p>The resulting 5638 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were combined with the 4284 most closely related sequences selected from the LANL database using BLAST (allowing up to 10 hits per sequence; expect value = 1 × 10
 <sup>−30</sup>). The resulting 9922 sequences were aligned against the HBX2 subtype B reference strain and the alignment was stripped off the major resistance mutations listed by the IAS-USA [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A maximum likelihood phylogeny of the alignment was reconstructed in FastTree version 2.1.9 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] assuming a GTR model of molecular evolution with gamma distributed rate heterogeneity. The resulting phylogeny was used to identify all sub-epidemics with at least two samples for which a minimum of 80 per cent of the samples were from Switzerland [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the following we refer to these Swiss sub-epidemics as clusters. For computational reasons any cluster that contained more than 250 sequences was split at the root of the phylogeny and considered as two separate clusters.
