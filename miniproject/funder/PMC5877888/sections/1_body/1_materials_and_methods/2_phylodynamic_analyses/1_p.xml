<p>The 15 RMDS were analysed using the multi-type birthâ€“death model [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] in BEAST2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A single analysis was set up for each of the resistance mutations. The sequences were annotated with their date of sampling and type (sensitive or resistant) and the phylogenies for each cluster were reconstructed jointly with the epidemiological parameters. While the tree topology, tree height and length, the branch rate variation and sampled ancestors [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] were estimated separately for each of the clusters, the substitution rate and epidemiological parameters were estimated jointly for all clusters. The parameters that were estimated jointly for all clusters associated with a particular resistance mutation were informed by the phylogenies of these clusters together. For example, we estimate a single resistance evolution rate for each resistance mutation, such that all clusters contribute to the estimate of the resistance evolution rate. The unit of time used in our analyses is years, such that all rates estimated here are average rates per lineage per year.
