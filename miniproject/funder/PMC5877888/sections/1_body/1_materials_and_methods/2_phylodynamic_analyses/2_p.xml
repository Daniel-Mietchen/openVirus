 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006895.g001">Fig 1</xref> depicts the two-type birth–death model employed. Transmission events can only occur within each type, i.e. a transmission event caused by a sensitive strain results in a new infection with a sensitive strain and likewise for resistant strains. The migration rates estimated from sensitive to resistant lineages and back are equivalent to population-level rates of resistance evolution and reversion, respectively. Specifically, moving from the sensitive compartment to the resistant compartment is modelled through a resistance evolution rate, the opposite direction is determined by the resistance reversion rate. Both rates are assumed to be zero before significant usage of the related drug(s) in Switzerland. We consider drug usage as significant whenever the respective drug is prescribed to a minimum of one percent of patients within the SHCS. The NNRTI-related mutation 138A is an exception because it occurred in 0.5% to 5% of viruses from treatment-naïve patients even before the introduction of the related drug rilpivirine [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Hence, we do not assume the resistance evolution and reversion rates for the 138A mutation to be zero at any time. Instead we allow the rate to change in 2013, when usage of the respective drug in Switzerland became significant. The protease inhibitors related to resistance mutation 90M have been used in less than 1% of patients after 2008. Therefore, we allow the resistance evolution and reversion rates for the 90M mutation to change in a piecewise constant fashion, such that it is zero before 1996 and we obtain one estimate for the time during and one for after significant drug usage in Switzerland.
