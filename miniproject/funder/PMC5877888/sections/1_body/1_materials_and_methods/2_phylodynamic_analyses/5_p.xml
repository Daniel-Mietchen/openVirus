<p>Multiple independent instances were run for each RMDS, which were then combined, resulting in a combined Markov chain length of at least 250 million after burn-in. The resulting effective sample size of each parameter estimated is greater or equal to 200. This unusually long chain length was necessary due to the setup of the analyses: In each analysis we reconstruct the phylogenies for 8 to 56 clusters, many of which are very small (down to 2 samples), but some of which are fairly large (up to 184 samples), which makes operator optimisation difficult.</p>
