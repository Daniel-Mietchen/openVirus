<p>The 90M mutation in the protease and the 138A mutation in the reverse transcriptase have both previously been associated with TDR even in the absence of drugs [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In this study, they are the only resistance mutations that have as many as ten resistant samples per cluster. In fact, the 138A mutation occurs in the SHCS as early as 1995 although the drug (rilpivirine) was only introduced in Switzerland in 2013. It appears to be a natural polymorphism, which is present in 0.5% to 5% of viruses from treatment-naïve patients, although it is more common in subtype C than B [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Before 2013 the median resistance evolution and reversion rates are 0.008 (95% HPD: [0.005-0.01]) and 0.04 (95% HPD: [0.008-0.08]), respectively. There is much uncertainty in the resistance evolution rate (median 0.14, 95% HPD: [0.00009-0.43]) and reversion rate (median 0.20, 95% HPD: [0.0004-0.82]) after 2013, which is due to the interval 2013–2015 being relatively short. We estimate a transmission ratio of 1.09 (median; 95% HPD: [0.88, 1.34]) confirming that its fitness is similar to that of sensitive strains.
