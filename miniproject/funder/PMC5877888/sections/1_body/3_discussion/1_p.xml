<p>In this study we present a computational method to quantify the transmission cost of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations and assess it in the context of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, as the transmission of drug resistant strains is a big threat to the success of global HIV-containment programs (e.g. test-and-treat) [

The base data set used here is intentionally limited to samples from patients that have not undergone antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the time of sampling. Including ART experienced individuals would be problematic, because the transmission rates estimated from ART-naïve vs. ART-experienced individuals are likely confounded by several factors such as behavioural differences due to awareness of HIV status and the effect of ART on viral load and persistence of drug resistance mutations [
