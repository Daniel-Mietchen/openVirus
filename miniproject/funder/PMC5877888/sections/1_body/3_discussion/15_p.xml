<p>Our results regarding sampled ancestors and the removal probability suggest that patients infected with sensitive strains may be less likely to transmit after diagnosis than patients infected with resistant strains. However, there is considerable uncertainty in the removal probability estimates for resistant strains. This may be overcome by including all type B samples of the cohort (rather than only the treatment na√Øve first samples), which will be the subject of future work. In data sets where transmission frequently occurs after diagnosis and treatment, it would be advisable to include ART status into the analysis.</p>
