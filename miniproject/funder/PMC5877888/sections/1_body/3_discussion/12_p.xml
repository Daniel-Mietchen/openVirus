<p>For the 103N mutation in the reverse transcriptase we estimate a transmission ratio of 0.97 (95% HPD, [0.57-1.41]), which may imply that the mutation confers no significant fitness advantage or disadvantage. This major NNRTI mutation is associated with failure of current first-line treatment [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and currently is the most important NNRTI [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The lack of a disadvantage in transmission underlines the clinical importance of the 103N mutation in the context of TDR, particularly in resource limited settings.
