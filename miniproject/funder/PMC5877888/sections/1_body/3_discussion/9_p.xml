<p>The 90M mutation in the protease is another case of treatment-independent transmission [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our results suggest that it confers a significant fitness advantage over the sensitive lineages. While prescription of the drugs (saquinavir and nelfinavir) against which 90M confers resistance has ceased in Switzerland around 2008, the mutation still occurs in later samples. The latest sample showing the 90M mutation within a cluster was obtained in 2011. There are four 90M clusters that contain more than one resistant sample, three of which are driven by men having sex with men (MSM) and one that contains five resistant samples all of which are from heterosexual individuals falling together in a five-sample sub-cluster. Since this appears to reflect the situation in the Swiss HIV epidemic well [
