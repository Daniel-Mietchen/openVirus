<p>We are assuming that the transmission tree coincides with the phylogeny, which is based on assuming that there is little or no superinfection and that within-host coalescence time is short compared to the viral transmission time. In addition, we assume a constant between-host transmission ratio

 </sub>, which implies that transmission rate changes due to a changing number of susceptible individuals or a change in public health interventions have the same effect on sensitive and resistant hosts. This effect cancels out in the ratio. Note that between-host transmission fitness and within-host replication fitness are intertwined. Within-host replication fitness is one of the factors that contributes to the overall epidemiological fitness of a viral strain, which is commonly measured by the effective reproduction number [
