<p>There are two technical assumptions of the phylodynamic model that were made for computational reasons only: (1) the removal rate is constant through time and (2) resistance evolution rates can be averaged over (i) connected time periods of no or very little drug usage (&lt; 1%) and (ii) connected time periods of relevant usage (&gt; 1%), see Fig 1 within 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006895.s004">S1 Text</xref> (scenario A). For three of the RMDS (184V, 103N and 90M) we have performed the same analysis again with these assumptions relaxed to have changes in removal rates at two time points and direct dependance of the resistance evolution rates on the annual drug usage data in the SHCS (scenario B). While we see a small decrease in the estimated transmission ratios, the 95% HPDs largely overlap, resulting in qualitatively equivalent interpretations (see Section 1 within

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006895.s004">S1 Text</xref>). Additionally we have conducted a simulation study in which we simulate three sets of RMDS representative of the actual RMDS 184V, 103N and 90M under the more complex scenario B and reconstruct the trees and epidemiological parameters under the simpler scenario A. Although this does introduce some bias into our estimates we can robustly estimate the transmission ratio in all three simulation sets (see Section 2 within

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006895.s004">S1 Text</xref>). In particular, the simulation study presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006895.s004">S1 Text</xref> shows that we can differentiate among different types of between-host transmission fitness despite differences in population sizes.
