<p>Our approach is based on the assumption that a viral strain can be annotated with either of two types, sensitive or resistant. This is a strong simplification since the presence of multiple drug resistance mutations may impact viral fitness in a different way than a single mutation. However, most transmitted virus strains in this study contain either zero or one major resistance mutation. We did not include compensatory mutations in our analyses due to their rare occurrence in the data set. Furthermore, we do not distinguish among different risk groups in this study, as there does not appear to be any significant difference in TDR prevalence according to risk groups [
