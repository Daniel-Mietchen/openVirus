<p>Extensive propagation of the 103N and 90M mutations is unlikely in Switzerland and other resource-rich countries, where drug resistance testing is performed routinely to identify active drugs. Nevertheless, even in these settings it is crucial to diagnose HIV-positive individuals early to decrease the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance. The transmission potential of these mutations must be taken into account in the management of low-resource HIV-epidemics. Although the prevalence of transmitted drug resistance appears to be lower in African countries, for example, this may be due to the later introduction and roll-out of ART. Hence, there is a large risk of NNRTI-resistant viruses spreading quickly in such settings, which would make the management of the HIV-epidemics in resource-limited settings very difficult.</p>
