<p>Our selection criteria serve as a filter for those drug resistance mutations that are moderately prevalent and transmissible in Switzerland. Hence, they represent the most important drug resistance mutations to be considered in Switzerland from a clinical and public health perspective. However, this does not include very recently introduced drugs, as they may not cross our thresholds yet. More specifically, it is unlikely to have samples from ten or more patients with a specific mutation conferring resistance to a drug that was introduced less than two or three years ago. For our data set this would translate to any introductions after 2013.</p>
