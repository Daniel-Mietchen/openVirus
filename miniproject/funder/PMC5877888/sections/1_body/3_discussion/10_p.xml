<p>Note that these results are based on a relatively small sample size (Table 3 within 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006895.s004">S1 Text</xref>). However, others have also estimated a fitness advantage for the 90M mutation based on an independent data set [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been shown previously that 90M prevalence increased in the Swiss HIV cohort in recent years, although itâ€™s occurrence in patients failing treatment is declining [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006895.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These studies thus support that the 90M mutation has either a fitness advantage or at least no significant fitness cost.
