<p>The merits of molecular epidemiological approaches have been highlighted in previous studies, particularly for cases in which genetic data is combined with epidemiological, demographic and clinical data [

However, this is one of the first studies presenting a phylogenetic approach that allows direct quantification of population-level fitness costs of HIV resistance mutations from viral sequence data (annotated with sampling date and resistance type) alone. Hence, this approach may become particularly useful in assessing the risk of TDR in resource limited settings where resistance testing is possible but epidemiological, demographic and clinical data are missing. Furthermore, our approach is not only applicable to HIV but to any measurably evolving pathogen.
