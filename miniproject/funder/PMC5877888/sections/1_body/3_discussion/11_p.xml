<p>In contrast, the 184V mutation in the reverse transcriptase stands out as the one with the highest transmission cost (median transmission ratio: 0.43, 95% HPD: [0.18-0.66]). Being a major nRTI mutation the 184V is the only resistance mutation in this study that has no cluster with more than two resistant samples (apart from the 215Y RMDS for which we were not able to obtain reliable results, see Section 3.1 within 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006895.s004">S1 Text</xref>). Hence, it appears that while the 184V mutation evolves frequently under failing treatment, its high between-host transmission cost results in very short transmission chains.
