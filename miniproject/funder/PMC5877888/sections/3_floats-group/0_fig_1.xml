  <title>The two-type birth–death model with types ‘sensitive’ and ‘resistant’.</title>
  <p>Virus samples are grouped into the compartments by their resistance status (corresponding to a single major resistance mutation). Transmission at transmission rates λ
   <sub>
    <italic>s</italic>
   </sub> and λ
   <sub>
    <italic>r</italic>
   </sub> can only occur within the sensitive and resistant compartment, respectively. In either compartment, removal from the infectious pool occurs at rate 
   <italic>δ</italic>. The compartments are connected by (exponential) rates of resistance evolution and reversion.
