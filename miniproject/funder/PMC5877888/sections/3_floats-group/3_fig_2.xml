  <title>Maximum clade credibility trees of one cluster per drug class.</title>
  <p>Summary of the posterior distribution of the reconstructed phylogeny for one exemplary cluster in the 219Q, 138A, 184V, 103N and 90M RMDS. Exemplarily, the 103N cluster contains five resistant and seven sensitive samples. It has one sampled ancestor (indicated by the resistant sample with zero branch length), indicating that the respective patient transmitted to at least one other person after having been diagnosed with HIV.</p>
