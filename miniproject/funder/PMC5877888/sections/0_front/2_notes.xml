 <title>Data Availability</title>
 <p>The HIV sequence data was obtained as part of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), whose authors may be contacted at 
  <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.shcs.ch/contact" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.shcs.ch/contact</ext-link>. Due the representativeness of the dataset, the sensitivities associated with HIV infections, and to protect the privacy of patients enrolled in the study, a deposition of all sequence data in an open database is not possible at this time.
