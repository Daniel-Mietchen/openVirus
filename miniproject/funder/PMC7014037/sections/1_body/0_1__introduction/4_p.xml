<p>However, the relationship between dengue cases and meteorological features is highly complex and cannot be easily fitted by the classical time series model. The deep learning method offers more advantages for the health care field as compared with the traditional statistical model [

Lee et al. showed that artificial neural networks (ANNs) offer a potential benefit in forecasting fluctuations in the mosquito population (especially the extreme values). This method is better than traditional statistical techniques, such as the multiple regression model [

 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, LSTM is considered as one of the most advanced deep learning architectures for sequence learning tasks, such as speech recognition, or time series prediction [

 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. LSTM has been used to forecast influenza trends and the epidemics of hand, foot, and mouth disease successfully [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, a thorough search of the literature shows that few previous attempts deploying LSTM networks haves been carried out to predict dengue incidence and assess its performance. Current research is more concerned about areas with a high incidence of dengue fever, but it is difficult to perform prediction in areas with fewer dengue incidences. TL is an optimization method used to improve the learning of a new task through the transfer of knowledge from related learning tasks [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Correspondingly, TL may be used to improve the learning of models in areas with fewer dengue incidences.
