<p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus infection and is a climate-sensitive disease [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The symptoms include high fever, headache, vomiting, muscle and joint pains, and a skin rash [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In a small proportion of incidences, the disease develops into severe cases, resulting in bleeding, low levels of blood platelets, and blood plasma leakage or shock syndrome [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The dengue virus (five serotypes of the dengue virus) is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and is highly sensitive to environmental factors [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Meteorological conditions, such as temperature, precipitation, and humidity, have a significant impact on the spread of dengue fever (DF) as the conditions help to increase the population density of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As temperature and precipitation increase, the stages of development of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> larvae to pupa become shorter, thereby increasing the population growth of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Conversely, high temperatures above 35 Â°C or heavy precipitation may reduce DF transmission by decreasing the survival rate of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Beside meteorological variables, socio-economic factors also influence the spread of DF [
