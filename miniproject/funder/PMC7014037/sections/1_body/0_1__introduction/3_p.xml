<p>In the absence of effective antiviral agents capable of treating dengue infection, early and accurate forecasts of dengue using different methods might minimize the threat and help the government to implement effective control measures. Numerous studies attempted to predict the incidence of DF using meteorological factors and vector population density or social media data. For example, Shi et al. established a set of statistical models using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method to improve the forecasting of dengue in Singapore [

However, it is difficult to track DF in a timely manner because of the delayed local mosquito data reports, and most social media data that have received popular attention are not the outputs of instruments designed to produce valid and reliable data amenable for scientific analysis [
