<p>Therefore, this study added lag to the collected data set to consider temporal characteristics. In addition, thorough testing of all the areas selected was performed to examine the modelâ€™s robustness. The model prediction performance of this study was verified by comparing it with different prediction algorithms, including a deep learning method and an infectious disease prediction model that uses time series analysis.</p>
