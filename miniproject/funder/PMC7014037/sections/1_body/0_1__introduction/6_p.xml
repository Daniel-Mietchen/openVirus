<p>Ultimately, by using this studyâ€™s obtained results, it should be possible to construct a model that can predict monthly dengue cases in real time. Such a model can not only accurately predict the number of DF cases in areas with a high incidence of dengue fever but also forecast the trend of DF in areas with fewer dengue incidences, which might be helpful for the local government and community to respond early to the disease.</p>
