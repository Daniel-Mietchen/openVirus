<p>There have been a large number of relevant documents on the study of the impact of meteorological factors on dengue fever. However, most of the research models are limited to short-term analysis, and the cumulative effect and hysteresis of relevant factors are not considered, which limits this research results. At the same time, the geographical differences and research materials of different spatial scales will bring about a lack of comparability in the research results. Based on the LSTM method, this study achieved an accurate prediction of DF cases for high-risk areas in mainland China, using long-term time series dengue cases and the data of meteorological variables. This method might be used for the large-scale prediction of other dengue-like diseases.</p>
