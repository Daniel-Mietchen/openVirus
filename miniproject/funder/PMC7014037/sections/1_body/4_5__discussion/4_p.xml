<p>In this study, the dataset was relatively small for deep learning models, and the neural network model was less effective for low-resource training, although the climate has been proven as a driving force for DF [

However, TL can improve the model to some degree, but it is required that the source and target tasks should be the same [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The TL is an optimization method to improve the learning of a new task through the transfer of knowledge from related learning tasks. In our study, TL is applicable in similar climate regions, and it can improve the learning of a new model in areas with fewer dengue incidences through transfer from the already trained model in areas with high dengue incidences.
