<p>Dengue outbreaks in mainland China are often caused by the virus being carried by returning travelers or visitors to China from dengue-endemic areas elsewhere, and most of the dengue cases occur in autumn [

In addition, we observed a wide band of numbers of monthly dengue cases ranging from 0 to 18,569 cases, which makes it difficult to predict dengue cases. To obtain accurate forecasting of non-linear time series, such as the prediction of infectious disease, it is crucial to model the long-term dependency in time series data. The periodic patterns spanning multiple time steps are difficult for a typical machine learning method to identify, but this can be achieved by the LSTM network [

 <xref rid="ijerph-17-00453-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> showed that the setting of the time step affected the model performance and the model obtained got the best parameters when the time step was set to 12, which suggested that the underlying mechanism of dengue outbreak may be related to long-term climate change. Thus, the LSTM neural network was chosen to develop a DF prediction model that can accurately predict the prevalence of dengue in a timely manner.
