<p>However, our research has some limitations. First, the LSTM model takes a large amount of time for training compared to other machine learning models; however, the impact is not significant since the data collected in this study were from a small-sized dataset. Second, we could not obtain accurate predictions in some cities by using any model in this study, probably because we failed to consider other relevant potential socio-economic factors [
