<p>The predictive accuracy and goodness-of-fit of our LSTM model is superior to the other models in Guangdong, which is Chinaâ€™s most dengue-hit area (

 <xref rid="ijerph-17-00453-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. In terms of prediction accuracy, the LSTM neural network model has a lower RMSE in most cities than other models. By the LSTM model being applied in more cities in mainland China, we found that the LSTM failed to capture the characteristics of viral transmission in areas with a low dengue incidence. This problem can be solved using TL in areas in the vicinity of Guangzhou with high RMSE (by LSTM). It can be seen that the LSTM model or the LSTM model trained by transfer learning in the outbreak period was closer to the observations (
