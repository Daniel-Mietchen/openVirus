<p>Judging from the national legal infectious disease report in the past five years, the incidence of dengue fever in China has continuously been high. According to the predicted data of the model, the government can track dengue dynamics to carry out targeted prevention and control measures. To date, different dengue forecast models have been developed [

 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) has introduced the China Infectious Disease Auto-mated-alert and Response System (CIDARS) for the detection of dengue outbreaks, but reports of the spread of dengue by the system are delayed, because this method is dependent on the numbers of notified dengue cases [

 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-00453" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These models are unable to track dengue fever in a timely manner, and there is room to improve the modelâ€™s predictive performance, due to the fact that the local mosquito data cannot be updated quickly in China. However, dengue case data and meteorological data can be updated promptly in relevant departments. Thus, mosquito data were discarded, and monthly dengue cases and meteorological data were chosen to develop a DF prediction model.
