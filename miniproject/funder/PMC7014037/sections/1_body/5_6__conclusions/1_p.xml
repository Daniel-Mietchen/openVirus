<p>This study proposed an LSTM-based model, which enabled us to efficiently predict monthly dengue cases using meteorological data and dengue cases in 20 cities of mainland China. Several candidate models were also implemented in order to appraise the performance of the LSTM-based model. Briefly, the LSTM-based model could identify periodic patterns spanning multiple time steps in non-linear time series. Moreover, integrating LSTM and transfer learning could improve the prediction accuracy. We conjecture that the proposed LSTM and LSTM-TL model might be used for the large-scale prediction of other dengue-like diseases.</p>
