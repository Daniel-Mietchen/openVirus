<p>The predictive accuracy of dengue cases for each model from 2017 to 2018 and during the outbreak are shown in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-00453-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. According to the predictive accuracy for the two prediction periods, the LSTM model by TL training has a lower RMSE in most cities than the BPNN model, GAM model, SVR model, and GBM models. Our LSTM method reduced the average RMSE predictions by 12.99% to 24.91% as compared with the estimated dengue cases of other previously published models, and the average RMSE predictions in the outbreak period decreased by 15.09% to 26.82% (
