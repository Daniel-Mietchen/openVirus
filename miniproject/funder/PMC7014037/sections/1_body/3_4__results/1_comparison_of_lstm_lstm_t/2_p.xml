<p>The LSTM model, by TL training, has a lower RMSE in most cities than the LSTM model by training using only local data. Among the cities, Qingyuan, Dongguan, Shenzhen, Foshan, and Zhongshan are in the same province as Guangzhou, and the distance from Guangzhou is not more than 100 km. The predicted reductions in RMSE in these cities are significant, at 34.6%, 47.4%, 30.3%, 26.9%, and 32.5%, respectively. The RMSE prediction results significantly declined in these cities in the vicinity of Guangzhou because TL can improve the model to some degree, but it is required that the source and target tasks should be the same [
