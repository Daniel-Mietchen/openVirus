<p>This study constructed an LSTM-based DF prediction model, and compared its performance with other candidate models, i.e., back propagation neural network (BPNN), generalized additive model (GAM), support vector regression (SVR), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). The overall framework of this study is illustrated in
