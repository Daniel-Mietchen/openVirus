<p>The input data consist of the natural logarithm (NL) of the human dengue cases and meteorological condition variables of the current month. The output data are the log-values of dengue cases in the subsequent month. The normalized data were divided into a training set and testing set. The data from 2005 to 2016 were used as the training set, and the data from 2017 to 2018 were used as a test set, which are the unseen data during the training. The comparison of the model performance proceeded using the predicted value of the inverse logarithm.</p>
