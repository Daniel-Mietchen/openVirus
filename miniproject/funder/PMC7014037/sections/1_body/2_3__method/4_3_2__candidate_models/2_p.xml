<p>In addition, we also computed other models that have been applied in dengue prediction. The BPNN model has shown excellent performance in multivariate time series prediction. For the BPNN model, an optimal parameter (include the number of neurons in the hidden layer and learning rate) was selected to avoid overfitting and improve the predictive performance [
