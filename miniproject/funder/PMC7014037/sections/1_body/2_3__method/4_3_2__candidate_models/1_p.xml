<p>For LSTM, we designed two model training routes: One was used to train the LSTM model using the local data only; the second was used to train a pre-train model using data from Guangzhou and train models of other cities using transfer learning (TL). Moreover, the Guangzhou data were selected to train the pre-training model as they contained a large number of DF cases. This was the LSTM model that learns the concepts of mapping the input (meteorological data and dengue cases data) and output data (dengue cases in the next month). The model fit of the Guangzhou data was the starting point for the model of the second city.</p>
