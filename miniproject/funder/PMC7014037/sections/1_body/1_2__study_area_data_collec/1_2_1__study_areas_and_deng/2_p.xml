<p>A total of 250 cities in China reported dengue cases from 2005 to 2018 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-00453-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), and this period shows an increasing trend of dengue human cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-00453-f001">Figure 1</xref>C). The top 20 cities (i.e., Guangzhou, Foshan, Sinsong Panna, Dehong, Chaozhou, Zhongshan, Hangzhou, Zhanjiang, Fuzhou, Jiangmen, Shenzhen, Nanning, Zhuhai, Lincang, Shantou, Dongguan, Yangjiang, Putian, Qingyuan, and Zhaoqing) with the highest incidence of dengue were selected as the study areas in this study (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-17-00453-f001">Figure 1</xref>Dâ€“W), and the dengue data of Guangzhou were thus chosen to train the pre-training model. Moreover, all of these study areas have frequent economic and cultural communication with the nations of Southeast Asia, where dengue has been hyperendemic for decades [
