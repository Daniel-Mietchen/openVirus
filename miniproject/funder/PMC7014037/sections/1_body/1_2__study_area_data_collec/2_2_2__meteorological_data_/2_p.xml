<p>Attribute reduction for these meteorological variables was carried out using high correlation filtering and low variance filtering. The four variables (i.e., maximum wind speed, extreme wind speed, mean wind speed, and minimum pressure) were deleted as they had the smallest variance in all the study areas. Moreover, the two highest related meteorological variables (i.e., mean minimum temperature, mean air temperature) were removed. In total, 10 valid attributes (i.e., nine meteorological variables and one epidemiological variable) were considered in our study, and the feature parameters are shown in
