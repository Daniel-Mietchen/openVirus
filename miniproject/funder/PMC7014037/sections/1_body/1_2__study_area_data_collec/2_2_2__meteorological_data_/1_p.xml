<p>The meteorological data of these cities were obtained from the National Meteorological Information Center (NMIC). A total of 15 meteorological variables (i.e., extreme wind speed, maximum wind speed, mean wind speed, minimum pressure, maximum pressure, average pressure, mean water pressure, minimum air temperature, maximum air temperature, mean air temperature, average of daily highest temperature, average of daily lower temperature, average of daily precipitation, number of days with rainfall, and average of relative humidity) was retained with no missing values in the raw data. The LSTM model might be overfitted if all variables are used for neural network model training. Overfitting improves the model performances on the training set; however, it works poorly on the test set, indicating that the generalization ability of the model is weak [
