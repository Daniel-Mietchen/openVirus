Although uncertainty in the predictions were substantial, both model variants successfully reproduced heterogeneity in transmission intensity across provinces, particularly in South Sudan. Based on the likelihood criteria, out of nine study settings, the model variant providing the better predictions of the observed age-seroprevalence profiles was the FOI model in seven settings and the R0 model in two settings (
