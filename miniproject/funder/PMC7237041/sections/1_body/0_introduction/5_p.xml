<p>Accelerated urbanization and increasing human population mobility might increase the contribution of the urban transmission cycle to the global YF burden. Urban cases have the potential to trigger explosive outbreaks that can place a substantial burden on health systems, as well as causing significant social and economic impacts. Both the large number of cases arising in urban outbreaks, and the higher connectivity of affected populations compared to the, typically, much more remote settings in which sylvatic transmission occurs, make international spread more likely. Thus, accounting for specific features of urban transmission will be useful to assess the risk of urban outbreaks and refine the estimates of vaccine impact.</p>
