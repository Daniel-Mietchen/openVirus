<p>The model we developed combines a risk-map derived from occurrence data with transmission intensity estimates in order to infer burden. Such an approach also provides valuable results for other diseases, such as dengue [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while providing better insight about spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the burden of the disease, especially for the post-PMVCs period. Uncertainty in our results is substantial, covering more than one order of magnitude for some estimates. As our model integrates all existing data on YF that are currently available for Africa, such uncertainty reflects the current lack of accurate knowledge regarding YF incidence and epidemiology.
