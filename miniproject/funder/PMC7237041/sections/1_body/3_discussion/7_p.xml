<p>While the FOI model variant assumes a constant local infection risk for those unvaccinated, the

 </sub> model variant relies on the assumption of endemic equilibrium, which allows long periods without transmission if population-level vaccination coverage exceeds the CVC and therefore suppresses transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While for an epidemic disease this might appear an unrealistic assumption, one can consider that over the course of many years the higher incidence during epidemics balances the low incidence in inter-epidemic periods to achieve the equilibrium level on average. The endemic equilibrium assumption might also appear unrealistic for low transmission settings, especially in Eastern Africa. However, both model variants were designed in order to converge in the absence of vaccination. Thus, in large regions of Eastern Africa with no history of vaccination, both model variants resulted in similar burden estimates (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008304.s009">S6D Fig</xref>). We can thus consider that the endemic equilibrium assumption did not yield to massive overestimation in the disease burden for low-transmission settings. Neither model variant completely captures the epidemic character of the disease driven by rapid depletion of susceptible hosts during explosive outbreaks, slow host renewal in inter-epidemic periods and sporadic disease reintroductions. By design, these models are also unable to account for short-term changes in disease transmission that could have resulted from recent changes in land use or other ecosystems degradation. Instead, these models were designed to capture spatial heterogeneity in the burden and estimate long-term average vaccine impact.
