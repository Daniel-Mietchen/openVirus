<p>The two model variants we developed exhibited substantial differences in resulting estimates of YF burden and vaccine impact, especially for the recent period. By integrating herd effects as an important component of urban transmission, the impact of vaccination estimated in the

 </sub> model was roughly twice that estimated in the FOI model, which represents sylvatic transmission. Cases’ characteristics and environmental assessment suggested a sylvatic origin of the 2016 Uganda outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, the lack of a large number of urban cases indicates a primarily sylvatic source for the 2017–2018 Nigeria outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On the contrary, the 2016 YF outbreak in Angola provided evidence of a large contribution of the urban transmission cycle [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. None of these model variants we developed was correct, as both were considering a unique YF transmission cycle, and neither model performed systematically better than the other in predicting transmission intensity, suggesting that the transmission cycle to preferably consider may depend on the setting. The estimates from both models should therefor by seen as two extreme scenarios of sylvatic or human-to-human, transmission only, with no or maximized herd effects, respectively. The reality of yellow fever transmission probably lies within these bounds. Better understanding the relative contribution of the different transmission routes may affect control strategies. While vaccination prevents both sylvatic and urban transmission, vector population control interventions appear relevant in urban settings but may not be feasible to protect populations exposed to sylvatic mosquitoes. A recent study tried to disentangle the contribution of each transmission cycle in Brazil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, this analysis relied on detailed spatiotemporal and genomic data not currently available for Africa.
