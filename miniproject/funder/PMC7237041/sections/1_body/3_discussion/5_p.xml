<p>The models used to estimate the burden and subsequently the impact of vaccination are fitted to data of reported YF events over a 30-years period in order to smooth over the long and irregular cycles of epidemic activity sweeping across the continent, such as the re-emergence during 1985â€“95 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These data show a pattern of near-ubiquitous presence in large swathes of West Africa, with more patchy presence in Central and East Africa, which in turn determine the gradient in transmission intensity seen in the model. Due to the very widespread YF presence in West Africa, the model lacks resolution for estimating the exact level of transmission intensity in this area. Under-reporting of cases and transmission intensity are estimated by fitting serological surveys data from Central and Eastern Africa. Unfortunately, high quality surveys from West Africa are lacking. Of note, our validation assessment revealed that the model produces reasonable predictions across settings exhibiting varying levels of seroprevalence (
