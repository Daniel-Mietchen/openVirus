<p>Using local estimates of the potential for urban outbreaks for PMVCs prioritization, we explored several vaccination scenarios ranking from a parsimonious strategy focussed on high-risk areas to an ambitious large-scale approach targeting the vast majority of provinces within the at-risk region. The individual assessment for each strategy was conducted under optimistic assumptions, thus resulting expected vaccine impact is overestimated; however this choice may not have massively affected the comparison across strategies. Recent years have shown that efforts to control YF outbreaks were highly constrained by the stock of vaccine doses available for emergency situation [

By contrasting the impact of several scenarios with the corresponding vaccine demand, and also by suggesting a sequence of implementation within each scenario, this study helps in the search for optimal vaccine allocation. We do acknowledge however that a realistic strategy will need to take into account further factors such as operational or political concerns.
