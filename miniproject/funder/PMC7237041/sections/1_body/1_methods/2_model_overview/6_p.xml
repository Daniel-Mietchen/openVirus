<p>The main difference in the dynamics of the FOI and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> models lies in the way they respond to vaccination. In the FOI model, the susceptible population is reduced by vaccination but the per-capita risk of infection of remaining susceptible individuals remains unchanged, always resulting in a non-zero number of new infections with imperfect vaccination coverage. In contrast, the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> model responds non-linearly to vaccination coverage: if, for a specific year, vaccination activities happen to increase the immunized proportion of the population above the herd immunity threshold, 
 <italic>1 âˆ’ 1/ R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> (the formula defining the critical vaccination coverage), then we assumed that no new infection will be expected in that year. In that case, the unvaccinated proportion of the population is indirectly but fully protected by herd immunity. Note that when there is no history of vaccination, the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> model reproduces the FOI model.
