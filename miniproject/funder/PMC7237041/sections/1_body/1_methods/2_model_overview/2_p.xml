<p>The GLM provides estimates of the probability of any YF report across the endemic zone over the 30-year period considered. In a second step, we describe this probability of a report as dependent on the number of infections and on the unknown rate of under-reporting (which was assumed to vary between but not within countries). This latter parameter was calibrated to independent estimates of transmission intensity, obtained by fitting 12 serological surveys performed in 11 African countries.</p>
