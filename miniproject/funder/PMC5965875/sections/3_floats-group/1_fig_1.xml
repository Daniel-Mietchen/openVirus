  <title>Clinical and laboratory parameters in patients with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome infected with Puumala or Dobrava virus.</title>
  <p>The number of patients with measured individual parameters is shown on the right-hand edge of the picture. The length of the solid line shows the median of symptom duration; the start of the line equates to the median day of symptom onset (see Tables 
   <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197661.t002">2</xref> and 
   <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197661.t003">3</xref>). The dashed line indicates days of illness where at least four measurements were obtained (dashed lines for diuresis in patients with Dobrava virus start only at day 6 of illness; PT and aPTT measurements have a relatively small number of patients with sufficient measurements). Light shaded area corresponds to days of illness when up to 50% of patients were still hospitalized. Dark shaded area corresponds to days of illness when up to 33% of patients were still hospitalized. Definitions: fever: ≥38.0°C; oliguria: ≤500 mL/day; polyuria: ≥2500 mL/day; systolic blood pressure (BP): ≤90 mmHg; platelet count: &lt;130 x 10
   <sup>9</sup>/L; leukocytosis: &gt;10 x 10
   <sup>9</sup>/L; elevated creatinine: &gt;97 μmol/L; diminished eGFR: &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m
   <sup>2</sup>; elevated serum ALT: &gt;0.56 μkat/L; elevated CRP: &gt;5 mg/L; elevated procalcitonin (PCT): &gt;0.5 μg/L; prolonged prothrombin time (PT): &gt;1, activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT): &gt;36 s. PUUV, Puumala virus; DOBV, Dobrava virus.
