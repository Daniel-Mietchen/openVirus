<p>In Slovenia, a small Central European country of approximately 20,000 km
 <sup>2</sup> and with two million inhabitants, several small mammal species have been confirmed to harbor hantaviruses: 
 <italic>Apodemus flavicollis</italic> (Dobrava virus, genotype Dobrava, DOBV), 
 <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic> (Dobrava virus, genotype Kurkino, DOBV-Kurkino), 
 <italic>Myodes glareolus</italic> (Puumala virus, PUUV), 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>areanus</italic> (Seewis virus), 
 <italic>Microtus agrestis</italic>, 
 <italic>Microtus arvalis</italic> and 
 <italic>Microtus subterraneus</italic> (Tula virus). Three of the viruses, namely the DOBV, DOBV–Kurkino and PUUV, cause disease in humans, with significant differences in the severity of illness. Disease caused by PUUV and DOBV- Kurkino has usually a mild clinical course with a fatality rate &lt;1%, whereas DOBV infections cause a more severe form of HFRS with an approximate 10% case fatality rate [

In the 31-year period from 1985 to 2015, 544 cases of HFRS (136 infected with DOBV, 4 infected with DOBV-Kurkino and 404 with PUUV) were identified in Slovenia; 188 of these were diagnosed in 2012, when the largest epidemics of HFRS occurred.
