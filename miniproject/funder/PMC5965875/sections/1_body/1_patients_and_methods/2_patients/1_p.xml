<p>The study comprised patients with HFRS hospitalized in three Slovenian hospitals (General Hospital Murska Sobota, University Medical Center Ljubljana, and General Hospital Novo mesto) in the years 2012–2013, for whom information was obtained prospectively, and a subset of patients participating in previous studies in the years 2007–2011 [

 <xref rid="pone.0197661.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0197661.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. All the patients fulfilled three basic criteria: (a) an illness clinically compatible with HFRS and substantiated with at least two of three findings (fever &gt;38°C, acute renal failure, thrombocytopenia); (b) acute hantavirus infection confirmed by immunofluorescence assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0197661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; and (c) available serial (at least every other day during a minimum period of 5 days) follow-up of clinical findings and laboratory parameters. The patients were grouped according to the etiology (HFRS caused by PUUV or DOBV), each of the two groups being further classified into subgroups with mild or severe disease. The latter classification was based on clinical and laboratory parameters [

 <xref rid="pone.0197661.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Criteria for severe HFRS were: 1. The need for dialysis, or 2. The lowest systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg and/or clinical signs of shock, or 3. Thrombocytopenia &lt;50 x109/L and the presence of a) bleeding and/or b) renal failure manifested with oliguria (diuresis &lt;500 mL/day) and/or &gt;4 x higher than the upper normal level of urea or creatinine.
