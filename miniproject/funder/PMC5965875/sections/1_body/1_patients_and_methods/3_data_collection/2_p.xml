 <xref rid="pone.0197661.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For determination of the hantavirus genotype and daily viral load, total RNA was extracted from whole blood samples using TRIzol™ Reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Hantavirus RNA was quantified in a multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR assay specific for Slovenian DOBV and PUUV, as previously described [
