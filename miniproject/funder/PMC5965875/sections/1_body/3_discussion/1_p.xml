<p>Our study provides detailed information on the onset, duration, and magnitude of clinical signs/symptoms and laboratory abnormalities in HFRS, together with information on the proportion of Slovenian patients with individual abnormalities present during the course of illness. The study corroborates previous findings on the course and outcome of HFRS, including the frequency of the main clinical signs/symptoms and laboratory abnormalities [

 <xref rid="pone.0197661.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A more severe clinical course in patients infected with DOBV was suggested by the higher proportion of patients fulfilling the criteria for severe disease, such as the presence of oliguria/anuria and the need for dialysis; higher proportions of patients with ascites, pleural effusions, and major bleeding; and longer hospitalization. Although not all the differences were statistically significant they showed identical tendencies (
