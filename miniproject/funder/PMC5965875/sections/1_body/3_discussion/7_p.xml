<p>Not all patients with HFRS but only those hospitalized in a subset of Slovenian hospitals and for whom serial clinical findings and laboratory parameters were available were enrolled in the present study, which might represent selection bias. The other main limitations of the study are the small number of patients with DOBV infection and the incomplete capture of some laboratory and clinical data (collection errors), resulting in serial evaluation of individual parameters in fewer patients. In addition, since chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound were not performed daily, we possibly missed some information on the frequency, onset, and duration of pulmonary infiltrates and pleural/abdominal effusions. Furthermore, in contrast to symptoms, some HFRS signs and nearly all laboratory parameters could be (reliably) evaluated only during hospitalization (the median time of illness before hospitalization was 5 days). Thus, the actual onsets of signs and laboratory parameters were most likely to be earlier than recorded in our study; consequently, the durations of abnormalities could be longer if monitored systematically from the very beginning of the disease.</p>
