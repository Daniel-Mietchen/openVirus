<p>Eighty-one out of 155 (53%) HFRS patients treated in three Slovenian hospitals in the period 2007–2013 had available serial clinical findings and laboratory parameters and thus fulfilled the study inclusion criteria. Of these 81 patients, 48 (59%) were enrolled in the study in the years 2012 and 2013 (for them information was obtained prospectively) while 33 participated in previous studies in the years 2007–2011 [

 <xref rid="pone.0197661.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]; the latter represent all patients for whom serial clinical findings and laboratory parameters were available. The median age of the patients was 39 (range 18–81) years; 66 patients (81%) were male. Among the 81 patients, 66 were infected with PUUV and 15 with DOBV, genotype Dobrava. The main assumed route of infection was through inhalation during outdoor activities (e.g., farmers, recreational activities, gardeners, bricklayers) or during cleaning of basements or attics. One quarter of patients recalled direct contact with rodents 2–3 weeks before disease onset. In 41/81 (51%) patients the illness began between June and August. Primary care physicians referred the patients to hospital with various diagnoses, most commonly with unspecified febrile illness, enterocolitis, or acute pyelonephritis; HFRS was the referral diagnosis in only four cases (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197661.t001">Table 1</xref>). The initial symptoms of illness began 5 (1–12) days before admission to hospital: 5 (1–11) days in patients infected with PUUV and 6 (3–12) days in patients with DOBV. The median hospitalization time was 10 (4–74) days; the corresponding durations of hospitalization for PUUV and DOBV infected patients were 10 (4–32) and 22 (7–74) days, respectively (
