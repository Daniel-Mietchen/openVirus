  <title>Ethics approval</title>
  <p>The International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) institutional veterinarian or a technician under instruction from the veterinarian collected samples from clinically affected animals. The sampling of animals for a clinical diagnosis did not require ethical approval. Permission to sample animals was granted by the Kapiti Plains Ranch management and the registered resident veterinarian. Animals were sold for slaughter, as is the normal practice at the Kapiti Plains Ranch. Also, clinically-healthy animals were sampled during a concurrent vaccine study reviewed and approved by the ILRI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) 2016–02; the Directorate of Veterinary Services, Republic of Kenya granted approval for the vaccine trial (VACC/I/VOL.XV/79).</p>
