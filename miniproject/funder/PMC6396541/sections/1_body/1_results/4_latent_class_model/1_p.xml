<p id="Par59">The posterior estimates of sensitivity and specificity for each diagnostic are given in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> and the distributions are plotted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The results suggest that the indirect ELISA is less appropriate as a diagnostic test in clinically ill animals, presumably because they may have not mounted an antibody response, with a sensitivity of 63.3% (95% PCI 54.4–71.1%) and specificity of 62.6% (95% PCI 39.2–84.9%) while the nested PCR is more appropriate with a sensitivity of 96.1% (95% PCI 90.7–99.7%) and specificity of 92.9% (95% PCI 76.1–99.8%). The sensitivity and specificity of clinical diagnosis was 99.1% (95% PCI 96.8–100.0%) and 71.5% (95% PCI 48.0–97.2%), respectively.
