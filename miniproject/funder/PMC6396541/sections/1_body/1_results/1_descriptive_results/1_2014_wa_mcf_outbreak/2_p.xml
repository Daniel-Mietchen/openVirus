<p id="Par51">There was no significant difference in WA-MCF incidence between sexes, OR 1.00 (95% C.I. 0.71–1.37). However, there was a significant difference in WA-MCF incidence between age groups with steers, heifers and cows more likely to have WA-MCF compared to calves. The OR for steers was 4.53 (95% C.I. 2.29–10.03), heifers 3.85 (95% C.I. 2.00–8.37), and cows 2.79 (95% C.I. 1.44–6.07) respectively (Additional file
