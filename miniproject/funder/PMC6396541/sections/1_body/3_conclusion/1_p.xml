<p id="Par68">The practicality of WA-MCF diagnosis in the field relies on clinical signs. This study demonstrates that clinical diagnosis is an effective method to identify affected animals. However, the possibility of incorrectly classifying animals based on clinical signs may result in unnecessary financial loss. Indirect ELISA was shown to be a poor test in comparison to nested PCR, which is a more appropriate confirmatory test for acute WA-MCF. The future of WA-MCF diagnosis should be aimed at developing penside techniques for fast detection in the field.</p>
