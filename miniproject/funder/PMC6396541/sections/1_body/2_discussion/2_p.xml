<p id="Par61">The incidence of WA-MCF in 2014 was 8.7% and in 2015 was 3.7%. This agrees with previous estimates of the incidence of WA-MCF in Kenya to be 3â€“12% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The reduction in incidence between 2014 and 2015 was likely due to the implementation of wildebeest avoidance measures to reduce contact between cattle and wildebeest on the ranch, including fencing and actively grazing cattle away from wildebeest herds. The incidence in 2016 (1.5%) was less than previous years and this reflects the lower numbers of wildebeest observed on the ranch in 2016. The reduced numbers of wildebeest on the ranch in 2016 may have been the result of drought [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Previous research in the study area has demonstrated that wildebeest migrate into and out of the area depending on plant biomass, which is dependent on rainfall [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This could result in decreased transmission if wildebeests are prevented from returning to preferred grazing areas or increased transmission through increasing the number of non-migrating wildebeest populations close to cattle herds.
