<p id="Par63">This study demonstrated that when laboratory confirmation of clinical diagnosis is required, nested PCR is a more effective tool for diagnosing WA-MCF than the indirect ELISA. The effectiveness of PCR has been reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the nested PCR is expensive, requiring specialized equipment and trained personnel, which means it is not easily accessible. The poor performance of the ELISA is likely due to the lack of antibody production in some cattle with WA-MCF, since susceptible animals may fail to develop measurable levels of antibody before death [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This is reflected in the high positive predictive value of the ELISA, showing that a positive serological test is good evidence to support a diagnosis of WA-MCF whereas a negative test has no predictive value. This is also supported by the BAI which demonstrated a reasonable agreement between the indirect ELISA and the PCR in detecting positive cases and poorer agreement between the tests in detecting negative cases [
