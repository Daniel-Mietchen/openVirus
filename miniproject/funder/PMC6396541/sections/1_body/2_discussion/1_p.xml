<p id="Par60">The outbreaks of WA-MCF in 2014 and 2015 occurred between the months of April and July. This coincides with the period of the highest transmission of WA-MCF in Kenya reported between March and June [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The outbreak in 2016 was the longest and occurred between the months of March to September. Changes in rainfall and pasture availability are likely to affect wildebeest calving seasons and this may explain the variation in the timing of outbreaks. Increased stress on wildebeest through pregnancy or nutritional deficits can also result in longer periods of transmission [
