<p id="Par65">There were six ELISA-positive animals/PCR-negative animals. These results may indicate subclinical infection, recovered animals or animals infected with an antigenically cross-reactive herpesvirus. Subclinical infection of cattle with SA-MCF has been reported previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However a previous serosurvey for WA-MCF in Tanzania only detected 1% seropositive cattle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The role of subclinically infected animals in the epidemiology of WA-MCF in east Africa warrants further investigation.
