<p id="Par62">The results of this study confirm earlier reports that all age classes of cattle are susceptible to WA-MCF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Steers, heifers and cows were more likely to develop WA-MCF compared to the calves in 2014, while heifers and cows were more likely to develop WA-MCF compared to the calves in 2015. This is similar to a previous study in Tanzania where 36% of respondents indicated that the disease affected mainly adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Calves were less likely to be affected than other age classes. Calves tend to be kept near the homestead and hence may not spend as much time as adults in the wildebeest grazing areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and can also be suckling rather than grazing.
