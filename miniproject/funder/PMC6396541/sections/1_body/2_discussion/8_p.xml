<p id="Par67">The reduced specificity of clinical diagnosis highlights the potential for non-MCF cases to be misclassified. Since some of the WA-MCF clinical signs are non-specific (fever, depression anorexia, diarrhoea and bilateral corneal opacity) there is the potential for diseases with similar clinical presentations, such as East Coast fever (ECF), to be misdiagnosed as WA-MCF [

The costs of WA-MCF outbreaks are direct through death of animals and loss of production. Some money can be recouped by selling acutely sick animals at 50% market value [

The four animals classified as WA-MCF cases by clinical diagnosis but PCR and ELISA negative resulted in US$1200 loss. The sale of non-MCF cases could be avoided with improved diagnostics.
