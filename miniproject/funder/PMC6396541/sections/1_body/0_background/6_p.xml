<p id="Par48">There is currently no vaccine or treatment available for WA-MCF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The current control method for WA-MCF in affected regions is preventing interaction between cattle and wildebeest carriers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Cattle owners attempt to reduce losses through disposal of sick cattle or through disease avoidance strategies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. WA-MCF affected cattle will be sold at less than 50% of the market value of healthy cattle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Avoidance strategies mean that cattle-keepers graze their animals on poorer pastures away from wildebeests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The energy requirements during cattle movement over hundreds of kilometers and poor quality of alternative pastures reduce milk production and affect body condition reducing market value of cattle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There are also labour and travel related costs of avoiding WA-MCF with family members spending up to three months away from home [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].
