<p id="Par49">The annual incidence of WA-MCF in Kenya is estimated to be 3 to 12% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The absence of a simple and cost effective diagnostic test for AlHV-1 may contribute to underreporting and misdiagnosis of WA-MCF cases and may explain the high variability in the reported annual WA-MCF incidence rates in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Currently cattle keepers clinically diagnose animals with WA-MCF without laboratory confirmation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The objective of this study was to report the impact of WA-MCF on a commercial ranch and assess the performance of clinical diagnosis compared to laboratory diagnosis as a disease management tool.
