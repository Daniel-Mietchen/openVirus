 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] with peak incidence occurring between March and June [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The south western region of Kenya forms the location of the three major wildebeest areas [

These are the Maasai Mara ecosystem, including the Maasai Mara National Reserve, extending into the Serengeti in Tanzania; the Athi-Kaputiei environment including the Nairobi National Park, and the Athi-Kaputiei plains; and the Amboseli-Kilimanjaro ecosystem including the Amboseli National Park and extending into Mt. Kilimanjaro in Tanzania [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Differential diagnoses include bovine viral diarrhea (BVD)/mucosal disease, rinderpest, foot and mouth disease (FMD), bluetongue and vesicular stomatitis. Laboratory diagnosis is confirmed by positive serology or PCR [
