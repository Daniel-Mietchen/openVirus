<p id="Par43">Malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) is a fatal viral illness of cattle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The causative viruses of MCF belong to subfamily 
 <italic>Gammaherpesvirinae</italic>, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] genus 
 <italic>Macavirus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Worldwide there are two main viruses responsible for MCF in cattle; these are alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV-1), resulting in wildebeest associated malignant catarrhal fever (WA-MCF), and ovine herpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2), resulting in sheep (
 <italic>Ovies aries</italic>) associated malignant catarrhal fever (SA-MCF). WA-MCF primarily occurs in sub-Saharan Africa and is confined to geographical regions where cattle graze with wildebeest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Both blue and black wildebeest (
 <italic>Connochaetes testaurinus</italic> and 
 <italic>C. gnou</italic> respectively) exist as natural hosts for AlHV-1 [
