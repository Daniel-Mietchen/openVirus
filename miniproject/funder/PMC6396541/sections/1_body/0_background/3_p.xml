<p id="Par45">Several diagnostic tests for the detection of antibodies to MCF viruses have been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These assays use AlHV-1 as the antigen since this virus can be propagated in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]
 <bold>.</bold> Serological tests used to identify AlHV-1 infection include indirect ELISA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], competitive inhibition (CI)- ELISA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], virus neutralization test (VNT) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and indirect fluorescent antibody test [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The indirect ELISA depends on a polyclonal response, which may be more robust in detecting sick animals with partial or low antibody titres compared with the CI-ELISA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In MCF-susceptible hosts like cattle, no virus-neutralizing antibody response is induced, hence antibodies are detected using ELISA, indirect immunofluorescence or Western blot [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
