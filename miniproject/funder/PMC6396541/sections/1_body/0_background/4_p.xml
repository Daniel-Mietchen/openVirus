<p id="Par46">An important tool for the molecular diagnosis of MCF is PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The first PCR assay for detecting AlHV-1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was described in 1990 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and since then several DNA based assays have been developed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These can differentiate AlHV-1 from other macaviruses and have higher diagnostic sensitivity than ELISA assays for diagnosis of MCF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. DNA based assays previously used for the detection of AlHV-1 include nested PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], consensus PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and real time PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] .
