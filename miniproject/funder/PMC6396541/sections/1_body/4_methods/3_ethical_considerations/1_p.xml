<p id="Par71">The International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) institutional veterinarian or a technician under instruction from the veterinarian collected samples from clinically affected animals. The collection of diagnostic specimens from clinically sick animals did not require ethical review. Permission to sample animals was granted by the Kapiti Plains Ranch management and the registered resident veterinarian. Suspect cases of WA-MCF were sold for slaughter, as is the normal practice at the Kapiti Plains Ranch. Post mortem examinations were conducted on two animals that died suddenly in 2014 and one in 2016; the cause of death was confirmed to be WA-MCF. The pathological findings are not reported here. Clinically healthy animals were sampled during a concurrent vaccine study reviewed and approved by the ILRI Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) 2016â€“02; the Directorate of Veterinary Services, Republic of Kenya granted approval for the vaccine trial (VACC/I/VOL.XV/79).</p>
