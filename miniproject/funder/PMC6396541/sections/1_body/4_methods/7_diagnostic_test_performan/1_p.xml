   <p id="Par89">A Hui-Walter latent class model was used to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of clinical diagnoses, nested PCR and indirect ELISA in the absence of a gold-standard [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The model was adapted for three tests in 1 population [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The latent class approach assumes that none of the tests is a “gold standard” [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and the tests are conditionally independent, such that if the true disease status of an animal is known, then the outcome of one test does not change our confidence in the outcome of the other test [
