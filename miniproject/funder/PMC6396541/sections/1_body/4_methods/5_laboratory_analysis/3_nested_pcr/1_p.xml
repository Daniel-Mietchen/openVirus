<p id="Par81">Amplification reactions were performed using previously described primers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The PCR reaction mix was 25 μL and contained 12.5 μL of oneTaq Universal Master Mix (New England Biolabs; containing OneTaq® DNA polymerase, dNTPs, buffer components), 5 pmol forward primer, 5 pmol reverse primer and a minimum of 50 ng of sample DNA. The initial round of nested PCR was performed using outer forward and outer reverse primers, C500–1: TACGGGTGCCCTGACATTTCATCTCTTTTG; and C500–2: ATAACTGGTTGATGTGGCAGATGCATCTAT respectively.
