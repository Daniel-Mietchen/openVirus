<p id="Par83">Thermocycling conditions for both rounds of amplification were: 95 °C for 5 min; followed by 34 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min; 55 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 2 min; and 72 °C for 7 min. PCR products (6 μL) were electrophoresed at 80 V through 2.0% (

 <italic>v</italic>) agarose containing 4 μL GelRed (Biotium, 10,000x) per 100 ml gel. Gels were photographed by ultraviolet light for PCR product analysis. The positive control was DNA extracted from the blood of cattle that were confirmed to have died of WA-MCF. Sterile water served as negative controls.
