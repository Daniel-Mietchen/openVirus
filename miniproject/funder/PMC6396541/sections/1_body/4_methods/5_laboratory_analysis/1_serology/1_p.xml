<p id="Par74">Sera were separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C (Avanti J-E Centrifuge, Beckman Coulter, USA). Sera were screened for antibodies to WA-MCF by indirect ELISA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Ninety-six-well microtitre plates (Greiner Bio-One, Austria) were coated with 50 μL of 5 μg/mL of virus positive or negative ELISA antigen in 0.1 M carbonate buffer of pH 9.6. Virus-positive and negative ELISA coating antigens were produced at the Moredun Research Institute from cell-free culture fluid of bovine turbinate (BT) cells infected with attenuated AlHV-1 C500 and from uninfected BT cells respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The plates were covered with parafilm and left overnight at 4 °C. The plates were then washed six times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and 0.02% Tween 20. This was followed by blocking each well with 100 μL of 4% non fat dried milk/PBS, covering with parafilm for one hour at room temperature. The plates were then washed twice with PBS/Tween 20. An aliquot of 50 μL of sample sera diluted in 2% non fat dried milk/PBS/Tween 20 (1:500) was then added in duplicate to pairs of positive and negative antigen wells. Known positive and negative serum samples were included in all plates as controls. The plates were covered with parafilm and left for 1.5 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed six times with PBS/Tween 20. This was followed with the addition of 50 μL per well of 1:1000 rabbit antibovine IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Sigma Aldrich, USA) diluted in 2% non fat dried milk/PBS/Tween 20 and left for one hour at room temperature after covering with parafilm. The plates were washed six times with PBS/Tween 20. Tetramethylbenzidine
 <bold>(</bold>TMB) substrate (50 μL) was added to each well and colour change allowed to develop for five minutes. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 0.1 M hydrochloric acid in every well. The plates were read by at 450 nm for evaluation of the optical densities (OD) (Synergy HT, Biotek, USA). ELISA values were calculated by subtracting the mean of the negative antigen OD values from the mean of the positive antigen OD values for every sample. Inter-plate variations were adjusted by a correction factor (CF), which was applied to all of the plates that used the same positive and negative control sera over the screening period. The first plate run in a sequence with the same negative and positive controls was used in calculating the CF. The CF was calculated from the mean ELISA value of the positive and negative controls from the first plate by the equation below, which was applied to all the subsequent plates.
