<p id="Par40">To compare complement activations by HAdV-3 and HAdV-7, the anaphylatoxin C3a, a split fragment of C3 (the step where classical, lectin, and alternative pathways of complement activation merge), was measured in vitro. As shown (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), HAdV incubation with serum, compared with NHS incubation alone, resulted in a marked increase of C3a at 2, 4 and 10 mins. Importantly, elevation of C3a by HAdV-7, compared with HAdV-3, was statistically higher at 2 mins (
