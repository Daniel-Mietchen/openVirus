<p id="Par41">To better understand the differences in adenovirus-induced airway inflammation, we established a mouse respiratory infection model for human adenovirus. In this model, assays of viral load in the lung tissues revealed that virus copies of HAdV-7-infected groups were higher than those of HAdV-3-infected groups at 3, 5 and 7 days of infection, particularly on day 3, when virus copies in the HAdV-7 group were 1.5-fold higher than the HAdV-3 group (

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Pulmonary inflammation in mice was also observed following HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infection at each time point and found to gradually increase from day 3 to day 5, decreasing on day7. Compared with HAdV-3-infected mice, lung tissue damage of HAdV-7-infected mice was also higher on all days of infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Consistent with the morphological changes, the total number of cells in BALF was higher, compared with those in the control group on all days (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c-e); importantly, the HAdV-7 group showed a significantly greater increase in these cells, in comparison with the HAdV-3 group (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d-e). Specifically, abundant macrophages and smaller number of lymphocytes, neutrophils infiltrated into the BALF at all days post-infection. Whereas the neutrophils registered a slight rise, only on day 3, followed by dramatic decrease, the lymphocyte and macrophage numbers remained persistently elevated through days 5 and 7. In addition, macrophages in BALF of the HAdV-7 group were significantly higher than the HAdV-3 group after 5 and 7 days of infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d-e), while the lymphocytes exhibited significant difference only on day 5 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). Neutrophils in BALF of the HAdV-7 group was not significantly different compared with that of the HAdV-3 group at all time points (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c-e). Together, these results showed that HAdV-7 infection induced a relatively more severe acute airway inflammation.
