<p id="Par39">Cytotoxicity assay may serve as a measure of cellular distress induced by viral infection. As shown (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), at a low MOI of 25 VPs/cell, viability of HAdV-7-infected cells was slightly higher than that of the HAdV-3-infected cells, but there was no statistically significant difference. In contrast, at high MOI of 250 VPs/cell, HAdV-7 induced a remarkably greater decrease in cell viability at both 2 and 4 h post-infection (26.5 and 42.6%, respectively;
