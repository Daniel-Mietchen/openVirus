<p id="Par35">Among the 8248 NPAs, 289 specimens were identified as positive for adenovirus, of which HAdV-3 (127) and HAdV-7(131) were the most common types. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, age and gender distribution, underlying disease, and coinfection were comparable between HAdV-3 and HAdV-7. Co-infection with other respiratory viruses were observed in 57.5 and 40.5% of patients infected with HAdV-3 and HAdV-7, respectively. The most common clinical manifestations of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infections, such as cough, wheezing, croup, dry rales, moist rales and fever, including the peak of febrile body temperature (&gt; 39 °C), were not significantly different. In contrast, pneumonia was the most common diagnoses of the patients. Among the 131 HAdV-7-infected patients, 31.3% were diagnosed as having severe pneumonia, significantly higher than that of the HAdV-3-infected patients (31.3% vs 16.5%, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.005). When the median duration of hospitalization was analyzed, we found that the HAdV-7 inpatients had a longer mean duration of hospitalization, 8.2 ± 0.6 days (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.031). Several severe outcomes, toxic encephalopathy, and respiratory failure were significantly higher in patients with HAdV-7 infection compared with those with HAdV-3 (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), but no statistically significant differences were found in ICU admission, pleural effusion, suspicious BO and intracranial infection. Notably, one child, infected by HAdV-7, exhibited complications of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).
