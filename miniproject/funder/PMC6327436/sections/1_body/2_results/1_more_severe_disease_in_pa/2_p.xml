<p id="Par36">Laboratory findings for the HAdV-7-positive inpatients were also significantly different from those infected by HAdV-3 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Specifically, the HAdV-7-positive inpatients had lower white blood cell count (10.28 ± 0.51 vs. 11.69 ± 0.46 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> cells/L; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.041), platelet count (259.9 ± 11.38 vs. 370.2 ± 14.22 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> cells/L; 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001). In contrast, hemoglobin and C-reactive protein levels, and the percentages of lymphocytes, neutrophils and positive sputum culture were found to be statistically similar.
