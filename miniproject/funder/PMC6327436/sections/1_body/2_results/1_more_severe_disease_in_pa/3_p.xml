<p id="Par37">In the chest radiographs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), alveolar infiltration, consolidation and pleural effusion were more frequently observed with the HAdV-7 patients compared to HAdV-3 patients but they did not differ significantly. Increased lung texture and interstitial inflammation showed a similar proportion. Two patients infected with type 3, and four patients infected with type 7, had atelectasis. Notably, two patients infected with adenovirus type 7 had complications with pneumothorax.
