<p id="Par38">Since type-specific adenovirus infection is known to cause different tissue tropisms and clinical manifestations as indicated before, viral loads and fitness of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 were evaluated in several human epithelial cells to determine if there were differences. As shown (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a), at 48 h post-infection, HAdV-7 replicated to a higher number of viral copies than HAdV-3 in all three cell lines tested, namely, A549, HEK-293 and 16HBE cells. HAdV-7 also exhibited stronger growth than HAdV-3 in A549 cells at 24, 36 and 60 h post-infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). In comparing the competitive fitness between HAdV-3 and HAdV-7, however, no significant difference was observed. Lastly, HAdV-7 loads were significantly higher than those of HAdV-3 at 12, 24, 36 and 72 h post-infection (
