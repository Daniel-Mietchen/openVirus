<p id="Par49">The severity of adenoviral infection, as studied in Chongqing, China, may be correlated to human adenovirus type 7 (HAdV-7) instead of type 3 (HAdV-3). Overall, strain of the HAdV-7 type caused a more severe pneumonia and an exacerbated cytokine response, which also paralleled their more robust replication in cell culture, as compared to HAdV-3. While the exact mechanism of the type-specific pathogenicity merits further investigation, these findings may eventually contribute to better control and treatment of adenoviral infection.</p>
