<p id="Par17">Human adenovirus is well-recognized as an important pathogen of respiratory tract infection in childhood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. More than 70 HAdV serotypes are further subdivided into seven species (A-G) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]; however, species B (HAdV-3,7,11 and 14), C (HAdV-1,2,5 and 6), and E (HAdV-4) are the ones most associated with respiratory infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Epidemiological studies have reported an approximately 5–10% HAdV-positive rate among acute respiratory tract infections in children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Adenovirus infections may in fact result in high morbidity and mortality in children, and fatality rates for untreated severe HAdV pneumonia or disseminated disease may exceed 50% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Severe adenovirus infection in children can be complicated with pleural effusions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], respiratory failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], myocarditis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and central nervous system dysfunction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], leading to either mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal life support, even death. Unfortunately, effective adenoviral vaccine for children and specific antiviral drugs against human adenoviruses are currently not available.
