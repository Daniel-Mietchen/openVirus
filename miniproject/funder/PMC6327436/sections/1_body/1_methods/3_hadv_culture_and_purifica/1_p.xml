<p id="Par23">The HAdV-3 (CQ5291) and HAdV-7 strains (CQ4411) used in this study were originally isolated from NPAs of children infected with HAdV. The virus was purified using a standard cesium chloride gradient centrifugation procedure, as described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The concentration of viral particles (VPs) was determined by spectrophotometry according to the A
 <sub>260</sub> value. The virus concentration was calculated as VPs/ml = A
 <sub>260</sub>*dilution*10
