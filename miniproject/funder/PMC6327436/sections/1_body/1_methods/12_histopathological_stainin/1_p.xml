<p id="Par32">Mice were sacrificed at 3, 5, and 7 d after infection for pathological analyses. The left lung lobe was collected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, dehydrated, and then embedded in paraffin. Lung tissue blocks were cut into 4 μm thick sections that were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin to evaluate lung tissue pathology associated with HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infection.</p>
