<p id="Par26">A549 cells were infected with a mixture HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 at a ratio of 1:1 and MOI of 10 VPs/cell in standard 12-well cell culture plates, and incubated as described under ‘Viral growth kinetics’. Media supernatants and cells were harvested at 0, 2, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 h post-infection. Virus copies were quantified at each indicated time point by qPCR described earlier [
