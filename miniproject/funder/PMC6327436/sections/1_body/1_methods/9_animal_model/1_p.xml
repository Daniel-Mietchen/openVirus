<p id="Par29">Female BALB/c mice, 6–8-week old, were purchased from the Animal Laboratory of Chongqing Medical University and housed in a dedicated pathogen-free facility at Chongqing Medical University. The use of all experimental animals strictly met the ethical requirements of the Animal Committee of Chongqing Medical University (license numbers: SYXK(Yu) 2012–0001). The mice under anesthesia were infected intranasally (i.n.) with 5 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> VPs/ml of HAdV-3 or HAdV-7 in 100 μl. Mock-infected mice were instilled with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) under the same conditions. Mice were processed after 3, 5, and 7 days of infection.
