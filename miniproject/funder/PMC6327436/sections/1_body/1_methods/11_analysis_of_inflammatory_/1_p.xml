<p id="Par31">After 3, 5, and 7 days of infection (4 mice in each time point in every group), the animals were euthanatized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (150 mg/kg). The left pulmonary hilum was closed by clamping, in order to collect BALF from the right side. The specific steps were as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Briefly, bronchoalveolar lavage was performed using 0.25 ml of ice-cold sterile PBS for a total of 6 times. BALF was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min in cold (4 °C). The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at 80 °C for subsequent cytokine measurements. The precipitate was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and the total number of cells was counted under a microscope. The cells were centrifuged, smeared onto slides, fixed, and stained with Diff Quik (Baxter Healthcare Corp, Deerfleld, Miami, FL) to analyze and classify white blood cells. Cell counting was performed using a microscope. A total of 200 random cells was counted from each slide and included macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils.
