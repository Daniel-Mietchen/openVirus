<p id="Par22">NPAs from HAdV-positive patients were inoculated into HEp-2 cell monolayers and cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored for 10 days. Viral DNA and RNA were extracted from 200 μL aliquots of the NPA samples by a QIAampMinElute Virus Spin kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). HAdV-positive samples were used to amplify the hexon hypervariable regions (HVRs) 1–6 and fiber genes for subsequent sequencing [
