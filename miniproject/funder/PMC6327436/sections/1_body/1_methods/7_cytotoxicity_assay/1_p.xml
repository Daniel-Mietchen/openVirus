<p id="Par27">A549 cells (2.0 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>) were seeded in each well of 96-well flat bottom plates and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> overnight. Thereafter, the media were removed, and cells were infected with HAdV-3 or HAdV-7 (low MOI = 25 VPs/cell, or high MOI = 250 VPs/cell). Infected and uninfected cell viability were assayed at 2, 4, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h post-infection and the absorbance was determined as described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Cell viability was expressed as the ratio, and the mean (mean ± SEM) of 5 replicates of two strains was presented.
