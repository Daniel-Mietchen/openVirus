<p id="Par25">A549 cells at 80% confluency in 12-well plates were infected with either HAdV-3 or HAdV-7 (MOI = 25 VPs/cell). After 1 h adsorption with rocking every 15 min, the inoculum was removed, 1 ml of fresh DMEM-F12 with 10% FBS was added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The culture media were harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 96 h post-infection. TCID
 <sub>50</sub> was used to titer the virus at each time point.
