<p id="Par24">Three cell lines (A549, 16HBE, and HEK-293) at 80% confluency in 12-well plates were infected with either HAdV-3 or HAdV-7 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 VP/cell. Viruses were cultured as previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The culture supernatants and cells were sampled at 48 h post-infection. Viral loads were quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Briefly, 25 μl reaction mixtures were prepared by adding 5 μl of sample nucleic acid extract to 20 μl of iQ Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), primers and probes. The sequences of primers and probes for qPCR and the amplification conditions have been detailed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The real-time HAdV primer sequences were as follows: HAdV-3 forward, 5′- GGGAGACAATATTACTAAAGAAGGTTTGC-3′, HAdV-3 reverse, 5’-CAACTTGAGGCTCTGGCTGATA-3′. The sequence of the HAdV-3 probe was 5’-CACTAC“T”GAAGGAGAAGAAAAGCCCATTTATGCC, which was labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) and internally quenched at “T” with Black Hole Quencher-1 on the 5′- end and phosphate on the 3′-end. The forward primer sequences of HAdV-7 were 5’-GAGGAGCCAG ATATTGATATGGAATT-3′, The reverse primer sequences of HAdV-7 were: 5’-AATTGACATTTTCCGTGTAAAGCA-3′, and probe, 5’-AAGCTGCTGACGCTTTTTCGCCTGA-3′. The HAdV-7 probe was labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) on the 5′-end and 3′-terminally quenched with Black Hole Quencher-1. The thermal cycling condition was as follows: one cycle of 3 min at 95 °C; 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C; and 1 min at 60 °C.
