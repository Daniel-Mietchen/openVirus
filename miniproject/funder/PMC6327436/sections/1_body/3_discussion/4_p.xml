 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] have shown that the complement is strongly activated by a wide range of negative-strand RNA viruses, including parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), Nipah virus (NiV), mumps virus (MuV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). For each of these viruses, C3 played an essential role in effective in vitro neutralization by normal human serum (NHS). Here, we explored human adenovirus-induced complement activation to test whether there are differences in infectious HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 in vitro with normal human serum (that contain anti-adenovirus antibodies). As our results demonstrate, higher C3a levels, observed in HAdV-7 infection, rapidly activated human complement within 2 min. Thus, our results also implicate the plasma level of C3a as a marker of the early innate response to adenovirus [
