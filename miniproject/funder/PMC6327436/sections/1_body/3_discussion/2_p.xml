<p id="Par44">In the current study, we have compared and correlated the biological characteristics of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 with their properties ex vivo and in vitro. First of all, the results of cellular infectivity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) indicated that A549, 16HBE, and HEK-293 are susceptible cell lines for the growth of adenovirus ex vivo. Furthermore, a difference of viral loads recorded in A549 and 16HBE cell lines between adenovirus 3 and 7 indicated differential inflammatory reactions were produced from infection of host respiratory epithelial cells by HAdV stimulated the innate immune system that might partially explain the role of HAdV-7 infection in the pathogenesis of a more severe pneumonia. This is likely because the airway epithelial cells not only serve as a passive barrier to infectious particles but also actively participate in the innate immune response to foreign antigens. The immune response of epithelia to infection and antigen exposure involves the release of chemokines and cytokines into the submucosa, which initiates an inflammatory reaction [

The result of cell viability also provided useful information that was important for understanding type-specific viral virulence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that the differences observed in the replication, fitness, and virulence of the two adenoviruses are dependent on virus type.
