However, epidemiologic reports have suggested that nearly all highly severe or fatal adenoviral diseases in children are associated with HAdV-7 rather than HAdV-3. Here, we conduct in-depth investigations to confirm and extend these findings through a comprehensive series of assays in vitro and in vivo as well as clinical correlates.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A total of 8248 nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples were collected from hospitalized children with acute respiratory infections in Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from June 2009 to May 2015. Among 289 samples that tested positive for HAdVs, clinical data of 258 cases of HAdV-3 (127) and HAdV-7 (131) infections were analyzed. All HAdV-positive samples were classified by sequencing the hexon and fiber genes, and compared with clinical data and virological assays. We also performed in vitro assays of virus quantification, viral growth kinetics, competitive fitness, cytotoxicity and C3a assay of the two strains. Mouse adenovirus model was used to evaluate acute inflammatory responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Clinical characteristics revealed that HAdV-7 infection caused more severe pneumonia, toxic encephalopathy, respiratory failure, longer mean hospitalization, significantly lower white blood cell (WBC) and platelet counts, compared to those of HAdV-3. In cell culture, HAdV-7 replicated at a higher level than HAdV-3, and viral fitness showed significant differences as well. HAdV-7 also exhibited higher C3a production and cytotoxic effects, and HAdV-7-infected mice showed aggravated pathology and higher pulmonary virus loads, compared to HAdV-3-infected mice. Macrophages in BALF remained markedly high during infection, with concomitant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-6), compared HAdV-3 infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">These results document that HAdV-7 replicates more robustly than HAdV-3, and promotes an exacerbated cytokine response, causing a more severe airway inflammation. The findings merit further mechanistic studies that offer the pediatricians an informed decision to proceed with early diagnosis and treatment of HAdV-7 infection.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Disease severity</kwd><kwd>Adenovirus</kwd><kwd>HAdV-3</kwd><kwd>HAdV-7</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010909</institution-id><institution>Young Scientists Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81301424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zang</surname><given-names>Na</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par17">Human adenovirus is well-recognized as an important pathogen of respiratory tract infection in childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

Furthermore, a difference of viral loads recorded in A549 and 16HBE cell lines between adenovirus 3 and 7 indicated differential inflammatory reactions were produced from infection of host respiratory epithelial cells by HAdV stimulated the innate immune system that might partially explain the role of HAdV-7 infection in the pathogenesis of a more severe pneumonia. This is likely because the airway epithelial cells not only serve as a passive barrier to infectious particles but also actively participate in the innate immune response to foreign antigens. The immune response of epithelia to infection and antigen exposure involves the release of chemokines and cytokines into the submucosa, which initiates an inflammatory reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The results of co-infection of the two viruses indicated that distinctive fitness is type-specific and not interaction. The result of cell viability also provided useful information that was important for understanding type-specific viral virulence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that the differences observed in the replication, fitness, and virulence of the two adenoviruses are dependent on virus type.</p><p id="Par45">The complement system plays important roles in innate immunity and is vital in the protection against invading pathogens. The complement cascade can be initiated through three main pathways: classical, lectin, and alternative. The classical pathway is mainly antibody-dependent. It is activated by interaction of C1q (a subunit of the first complement protein C1) with the Fc portion of the IgM or IgG immune complex, although activation can also be achieved in an antibody-independent manner by some membrane components of viruses, bacteria and fungi. The lectin pathway is first activated when the mannose-binding lectin, a structural homologue of C1q, binds to carbohydrate moieties on the surface of pathogens, including yeast, bacteria and viruses. The alternative pathway is antibody-independent; it is spontaneously activated on biological surfaces, as well as in plasma and other body fluids, when the level of C3 hydrolysis remains consistently low. This spontaneous cleavage readily initiates amplification of the activation cascades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although every pathway is triggered independently, all of the complement cascades culminate in the central cleavage of C3 and the generation of its active fragments C3a and C3b, which can bind covalently to viral components to aid in opsonization and phagocytosis. Furthermore, complement activation also mediates the inflammatory reaction via the generation of anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Therefore, activation of the complement system leads to inflammation, opsonization, and membrane perturbation.</p><p id="Par46">Previous studies by Johnson et al. and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] have shown that the complement is strongly activated by a wide range of negative-strand RNA viruses, including parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), Nipah virus (NiV), mumps virus (MuV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and Newcastle disease virus (NDV). For each of these viruses, C3 played an essential role in effective in vitro neutralization by normal human serum (NHS). Here, we explored human adenovirus-induced complement activation to test whether there are differences in infectious HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 in vitro with normal human serum (that contain anti-adenovirus antibodies). As our results demonstrate, higher C3a levels, observed in HAdV-7 infection, rapidly activated human complement within 2 min. Thus, our results also implicate the plasma level of C3a as a marker of the early innate response to adenovirus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">In previous studies, our group successfully established a HAdV-7 pneumonia model in the laboratory mouse, and studies in this in vivo model suggested that HMGB1 is a mediator of HAdV-7-induced pulmonary inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Our current study has addressed whether different types of human adenovirus infection result in distinct inflammatory reactions in vivo. In this study, we clearly observed robust virus growth, and also documented significantly higher viral load in HAdV-7-infected mice at 3&#x02009;days post-infection. These results are different from those reported by Kajon et al. in which only low levels of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 replication were seen at the early stage of infection in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. We speculate that the apparent discrepancy is due to the effect of different experimental animal models and detection methods used. Adenovirus infection is characterized pathologically by a time-dependent progression in the type of inflammatory cells present. The initial inflammation is a neutrophilic interstitial infiltration with neutrophilic alveolitis. Subsequently, monocytes become evident and, finally, predominantly lymphocytic infiltrates appear. During the acute stage of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infection, we also found that the total number and classes of cells in BALF increased, primarily accounted for by macrophages. Neutrophils only transiently increased at 3&#x02009;days post-infection. A mixture of mononuclear cells (macrophages and lymphocytes) exclusively became evident at 5 and 7&#x02009;days post-infection. Macrophages were most prominent than neutrophils and lymphocytes at all time points. These results are fully consistent with several studies, including those of Kajon et al., which showed that HAdV-3 and HAdV-7-induced pneumonia mainly produces neutrophil infiltration at 1 and 2&#x02009;days post-infection, and affects macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Apart from phagocytosing and killing the pathogens, macrophages also secrete chemokines to recruit cells to the sites of infection. Yoon et al. found that adenovirus type 7 produced a more robust IL-6 and IL-8 response than adenovirus 3 in human bronchial epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Diaz et al. compared cytokine responses between type 7 and type 3, and documented significantly higher production of interferon-&#x003b3; from type 7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Similarly, subsequent production of IL-1&#x003b2;, induced by macrophages, also reached the highest levels after 3, 5, and 7&#x02009;days of HAdV-3 and HAdV-7 infection. Asgari et al. have reported that engagement of the C3a receptor triggers IL-1&#x003b2; processing and release via caspase-1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The results are consistent with the immune response of the epithelia to adenovirus infection and antigen exposure, which involves the release of chemokines and cytokines into the submucosa and initiates an inflammatory reaction. Lastly, complement activation mediates the inflammatory reaction via anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection. The inflammation then leads to the recruitment of phagocytes that help clear the invaders. Collectively, we conclude that these innate immune responses play an important role in the initial defense against adenovirus infection.</p><p id="Par48">Although our results implicate a novel type-specific relationship between adenoviral infection, it has potential limitations. The data presented herein only interrogated virological differences; however, adenovirus infection is a very complex process that involves not only the structural proteins of the virus, such as fiber, hexon, and penton, but also includes host and environmental factors. Nonetheless, our data confirm that severe adenovirus infection was associated with HAdV-7 rather than HAdV-3. The significance of the study lies in that the pediatrician should be aware of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of HAdV-7 infection in children in clinical practice. The findings should also stimulate further studies of mechanisms of the different pathogenicity among human adenovirus serotypes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par49">The severity of adenoviral infection, as studied in Chongqing, China, may be correlated to human adenovirus type 7 (HAdV-7) instead of type 3 (HAdV-3). Overall, strain of the HAdV-7 type caused a more severe pneumonia and an exacerbated cytokine response, which also paralleled their more robust replication in cell culture, as compared to HAdV-3. While the exact mechanism of the type-specific pathogenicity merits further investigation, these findings may eventually contribute to better control and treatment of adenoviral infection.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BALF</term><def><p id="Par5">Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAdV-3</term><def><p id="Par6">Human adenovirus type 3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAdV-7</term><def><p id="Par7">Human adenovirus type 7</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IFN-&#x003b3;</term><def><p id="Par8">Interferon-&#x003b3;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-1&#x003b2;</term><def><p id="Par9">Interleukin-1&#x003b2;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-6</term><def><p id="Par10">Interleukin-6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOI</term><def><p id="Par11">Multiplicity of infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHS</term><def><p id="Par12">Normal human serum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NPA</term><def><p id="Par13">Nasopharyngeal aspirate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>qPCR</term><def><p id="Par14">Quantitative PCR</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF-&#x003b1;</term><def><p id="Par15">Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VP</term><def><p id="Par16">Viral particles</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We thank Professor Rong Zhou, Dr. Xingui Tian, and colleagues (State Key Lab of Respiratory Disease, Guangzhou Medical University, China) for kind assistance in various areas of the study.</p><p>We would like to acknowledge the assistance of the patients and their caregivers involved in the study, the staff in the Department of Respiratory Medicine and the Department of Intensive Care Unit of Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Chongqing Medical University help for nasopharyngeal aspirates collection.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par50">This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China for Young Scholars (81301424).
