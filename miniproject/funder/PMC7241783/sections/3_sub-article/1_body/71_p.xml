<p>The analysis uses an age-structured SEIR model with an age structure to consider indirect benefits of vaccination. I would like to see more details on the model, and model parameters (i.e., infection rate and recovery rate). Do the authors estimate the model parameters? How vaccination is incorporated in the model? In which parameter does age matters? All of these details are important to understand the procedure and to interpret the results.</p>
