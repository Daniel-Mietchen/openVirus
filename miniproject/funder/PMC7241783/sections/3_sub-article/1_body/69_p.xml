<p>Finally, I would also suggest that the authors consider adding to their sensitivity analysis by estimating the impact on their results of the assumption that the Italian contact matrix can be substituted for the Spanish population. Contact patterns can be a key determinant for cost-effectiveness of some vaccination programmes and making assumptions here can be problematic. Even countries that participated in the POLYMOD study still like to perform sensitivity analyses on their contact matrices now and again.</p>
