<p>The probability of an outpatient visit per influenza case was estimated from the total number of cases in Primary Care visits (International Classification of Primary Care, Second edition code: R80 influenza) [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] and the total population in Spain [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], between 2011 and 2014. An equal probability was assumed for NHR and HR patients due to the lack of a reliable Spanish source. For children, outpatient visits were further divided between uncomplicated and complicated cases, which were defined as cases that present otitis media [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and pneumonia or other complications [
