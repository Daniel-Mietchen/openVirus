<p>The economic model is an age-structured decision tree model developed in Excel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233526.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The age-stratified symptomatic influenza cases (output of the dynamic model described above) were used as inputs to the economic model. Based on available economic data, the age groups were re-categorized (0–1 years, 2–4 years, 5–14 years, 15–19 years, 20–49 years, 50–64 years 65–69 years, 70–74 years and 75+ years), using age-distribution data of the Spanish population [
