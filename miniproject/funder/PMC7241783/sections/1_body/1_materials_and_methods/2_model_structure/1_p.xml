<p>The model is a variation on the compartmental SEIR epidemiological model: susceptible to infection (S), exposed but not infectious (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R) (and therefore immune for a certain time period). In the present model a vaccination compartment was added to include individuals protected by the vaccine. The model considered B virus cross-protection, which accounts for people vaccinated or infected with one B lineage that are partially protected against the opposite B lineage. It also uses a population contact matrix based on data from Italy [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], as no contact matrix directly estimated on Spanish population was available at the time of the study, and population contact characteristics are assumed to be similar in both countries. We considered a latent period of one day and a contagious period of 4.8 days [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. We assumed that the vaccination campaign was completed ahead of the start of the epidemic with a progressively increasing coverage starting on week 44 and ending on week 50 each year. Asymptomatic infections are also accounted for and assumed to represent a third of all infections [
