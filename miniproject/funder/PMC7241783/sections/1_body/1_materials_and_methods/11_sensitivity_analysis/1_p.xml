<p>A deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the individual impact of each parameter on the results, using 95% confidence intervals of the parameters when available. Results of the deterministic sensitivity analysis were presented in a Tornado diagram. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to assess the robustness of the results using the commonly accepted distributions: Beta for probabilities, Lognormal for costs and Gamma for utilities and lost workdays. A total of 1,000 iterations were calculated and the results were presented as 95% credibility intervals for the main model outputs.</p>
