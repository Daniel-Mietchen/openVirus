 <sub>vi</sub> and b
 <sub>yi</sub> for the first year i = 2011. The final state of year i was the initial state of year i + 1. Then it was calibrated b
 <sub>vi</sub> + 1 and b
 <sub>yi</sub> + 1 for year i + 1, taking into account the population immune status acquired in previous years. Each year, the population was vaccinated with a TIV containing the B lineage used the respective year.
