<p>Other influenza modelling approaches, including static models, compute the expected probability of infection without vaccination. In contrast, this dynamic model approach allows the impact of vaccination to be directly accounted for, as the estimates are computed under a given vaccination coverage, vaccine composition, and vaccine efficacy (in this case, TIV). The calibration uses a Nelderâ€“Mead simplex algorithm with a least square fitness function. The model and calibration process are implemented in R and take approximately 45 minutes to compute on a 2.9 GHz microprocessing quadricore. The calibration results depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0233526.g002">Fig 2</xref> show the robustness of the dynamic model.
