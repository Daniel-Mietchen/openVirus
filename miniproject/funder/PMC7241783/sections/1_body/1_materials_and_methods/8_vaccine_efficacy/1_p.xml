<p>Vaccine efficacy against influenza A and B was calculated by strain (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Victoria and B/Yamagata). In all cases, it was estimated on the basis of Díaz-Granados et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and by age (CDC unpublished data). The same relative efficacy by age was assumed between different strains and between NHR and HR individuals. The model considered cross-protection between B lineages, estimated from mismatched efficacy data of Díaz-Granados et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Potential heterosubtypic immunity between A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 has not been documented.
