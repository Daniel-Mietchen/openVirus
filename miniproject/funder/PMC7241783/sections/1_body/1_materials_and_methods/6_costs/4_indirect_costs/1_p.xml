<p>Days of productivity loss due to outpatient visit or hospitalization were only assigned to adults (â‰¥18 years) and were obtained from Galante et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We used the friction costs method approach to count productivity losses [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] and labor elasticity adjustment factor [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], as detailed in a previous publication [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The friction cost limits productivity losses of long-term absence to a friction period [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and the labor elasticity adjustment quantifies the proportion of reduction in effective labor time due to absence. The friction period was set at 40 days [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and the elasticity of labor was 0.8 [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Days of productivity loss were multiplied by daily earnings [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], assumed equal across all age groups.
