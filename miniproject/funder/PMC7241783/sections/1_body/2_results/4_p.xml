<p>In the last scenario, where patients ≥65 years old were vaccinated with QIV, 125,835 cases would have been avoided per influenza season (1,006,680 during the whole period), together with 9,689 outpatient visits, 2,967 hospitalizations and 180 deaths, a reduction of 13%, 19% and 20%, respectively (

Due to the switch from TIV to QIV, vaccination costs would have been incremented by €25 million, although €480,882 would have been saved in outpatient visits, €13 million in hospitalizations and €2 million in influenza-related deaths. €4 million of productivity losses would have been saved additionally from a societal perspective (
