<p>A total of 138,707 influenza B cases would have been avoided per season replacing TIV by QIV in all eligible populations (scenario 1) (1,109,654 cases avoided during 8 influenza seasons), with an impact in all age groups (

Consequently, related to influenza B, 10,748 outpatient visits, 3,179 hospitalizations and 192 deaths would have been avoided per season (85,982, 25,429 and 1,538 during the whole period), a reduction of 15%, 20% and 21%, respectively (

Regarding discounted costs, the replacement from TIV to QIV would have led to an increase per year of €27 million in vaccine costs (€219 million for 8 seasons); although it would have saved €0.5 million in outpatient visit costs, €13 million in hospitalization costs, and €3 million in costs of influenza-related deaths (€4 million, €107 million and €20 million during all seasons, respectively). An additional €5 million of productivity losses would have been saved from the societal perspective (€37 million for all 8 seasons) (
