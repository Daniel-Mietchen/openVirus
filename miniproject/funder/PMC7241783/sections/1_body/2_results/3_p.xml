<p>In both additional scenarios QIV showed reductions of influenza B cases. Specifically, in scenario 2, where &lt;65-year-old patients were vaccinated with QIV, 23,382 cases would have been avoided per season (187,057 during the 8 influenza seasons), which would have led to avoid 1,883 outpatient visits, 447 hospitalizations and 27 deaths (a reduction of 3% in all cases) (

The replacement to QIV for part of the population would have implied additional €3 million in vaccine costs, whereas €95,591 would have been saved in outpatient visit costs, €2 million in hospitalization costs and €364,087 million in influenza-related deaths costs. From a societal perspective, €1 million of productivity losses would have been saved (
