<p>Economic evaluation of health interventions is a useful tool to inform the decision-making process in a resource constrained health system [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. A previous research on five European countries estimated on the basis of a static health economic model, that the use of QIV instead of TIV throughout 10 seasons (from 2002–2003 to 2012–2013, 2009–10 pandemic excluded) could have prevented up to 150,964 cases of influenza, 13,181 primary care visits, 4,042 hospitalizations and 1,511 deaths, as well as an absenteeism of 18,546 workdays. Altogether, more than 24 million € (21 million € of direct costs and 3 million € of indirect costs) could have been saved [

For communicable infectious diseases like influenza, as vaccination may also impact disease transmission, a dynamic model provides a more realistic simulation of disease transmission, capturing changes in the probability of infection over time [

 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Hence, dynamic modeling represents the most appropriate approach to quantify the health and economic impact of QIV against seasonal influenza [

The aim of this study was to understand and quantify retrospectively the potential public health and economic impact of influenza vaccination with QIV compared to TIV (current standard of care), between 2011 and 2018 seasons in Spain, according to different vaccination scenarios.
