<p>Twice each year, the WHO recommends the strains of influenza viruses that should be included in the influenza vaccine for the following epidemic season. Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV), which includes two influenza A subtypes (H1N1 and H3N2) and two influenza B lineages (B/Victoria and B/Yamagata), have been included in these recommendations since the 2013–2014 season, together with the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) [

 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Overall, an estimated 53.9% of influenza B samples during this period were the influenza B strain not included in the vaccine [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a result, vaccine effectiveness of TIV was reduced [
