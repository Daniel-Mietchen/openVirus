<p>At global level, the annual incidence rate of influenza is 5–10% in adults and 20–30% in children [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In Spain, influenza also constitutes a substantial clinical and socioeconomic burden for society. According to data of the 
 <italic>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</italic> (ISCIII), there are around 600,000 confirmed cases of influenza in adults and 300,000 in children annually [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It has been estimated that influenza causes 1.3 million medical consultations every year, more than 140,000 emergency visits [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], 51,000 hospitalizations [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and between 8,000 and 14,000 deaths in Spain [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The total impact of seasonal influenza in Spain costs up to 145–1,000 million euros per year [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hospitalization cost is the key driver, whereas for outpatient care indirect costs, due to absenteeism in the workplace, may be 3.5 times higher than direct costs.
