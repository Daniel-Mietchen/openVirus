<p>In Spain, a cost-effectiveness model of QIV versus TIV, based on a static, lifetime, multi-cohort state transition model has been published previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This analysis, using a one-year scenario, showed that QIV (compared with TIV) would have prevented 18,565 influenza cases, 407 influenza-related hospitalizations and 181 deaths [

The reduction of influenza B cases and hospitalizations in our dynamic model was higher than the results of the static model, which can be partially explained by the risk reduction of virus transmission (indirect effect). In both static and dynamic models, the cost of QIV was the same (€9.50) and the cost of TIV was similar (€7.00 and €7.15, respectively), as well as most of the inputs used to populate both models. The costs from the payer perspective were higher with QIV due to a higher vaccine price in both cases; and the difference was offset due to lower indirect costs associated with QIV (societal perspective). Although in both analyses the results showed a QALY gain with QIV, the ICER of QIV over TIV from a societal perspective was €8,748/QALY gained with the static model [
