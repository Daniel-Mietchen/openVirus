<p>Until now, the most common approach to economic evaluations of vaccines are cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, although they do not capture all vaccine externalities [

 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Therefore, the benefits of dynamic models for economic analyses of vaccines have been demonstrated in many studies, such as in

 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. This Spanish study evaluated the efficiency of seasonal influenza vaccination using both a static and dynamic model approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Study results showed that influenza vaccination was not efficient when using static models whereas it was efficient through a dynamic model. This difference was caused by indirect effects on the non-vaccinated population (herd protection) which were not reflected in the static model, although they could be greater than the direct effect [
