<p>In England, a cost-effectiveness analysis of QIV found that it could be cost-effective for all targeted groups, but especially for children aged 2–11 years [

The rationale could be differences in vaccination programs, in England all children attending primary schools are vaccinated, while in Spain only high-risk children are vaccinated and the coverage is low, then herd protection of vaccinating children to protect other age groups would be greater in England than in Spain. Secondly, no GP consultations or hospitalisations for those individuals aged 65 years and older are attributed to influenza B on average each season, while in Spain this age group, as well as children &lt; 5 years, has the higher rates hospitalisations related with influenza.
