<p>Recently, two guidelines have been published with the objective of providing a consensus on how to apply economic evaluation to infectious diseases vaccines [

 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Both studies recommend that infectious disease models should be dynamic, in order to reflect that vaccination programs can change the infectious disease dynamics. Therefore, vaccination programmes for infectious diseases have an indirect benefit on non-vaccinated individuals by preventing onward transmission in vaccinated people, which cannot be easily captured by static models. Even so, as indicated by the WHO, in some specific circumstances a static approach could be considered; for example when vaccinated groups are unlikely to change population disease transmission substantially (like â‰¥ 65-year-old population) [
