<p>The results of this study show that the population ≥65 years is the population that most benefit from the switch from TIV to QIV. In scenario 1, when all eligible groups were vaccinated with QIV, relative difference (compared with TIV) in avoided cases with ≥65-years and &lt;65 years were 25% and 13%, respectively; and in scenario 3, when only ≥65-year population was vaccinated with QIV, 24% and 11% additional cases were avoided. The higher number of avoided cases led to avoid a higher number of outpatient visits, hospitalizations and deaths in ≥65-year-old patients. These results were as expected, since in Spain, influenza vaccination is recommended to all population ≥65 years and &lt;65 years at high risk. In addition, vaccination coverage of ≥65-year-old population is the highest. Even more, nowadays 10 of the 17 Autonomous Communities have started to include QIV in their influenza vaccination campaigns.
