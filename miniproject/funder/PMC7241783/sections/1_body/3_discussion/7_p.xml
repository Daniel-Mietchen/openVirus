<p>This study has limitations given that different assumptions were necessary. Probability of flu complications and QALY loss for influenza B were not available, so we used data for influenza in general, although no significant differences between influenza A and B have been shown in clinical burden [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Because inter-individual contact data for the Spanish population were not available, we used an Italian contact matrix [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] assuming that population contact characteristics between Spain and Italy are similar. We also used data related to the natural history of influenza from other countries, however it is widely accepted that influenza natural history is similar among countries. Finally, despite the use of a dynamic model, which represents the recommended method for infectious disease vaccination programs [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], our approach did not capture other vaccination benefits like e.g. the reduction of antimicrobial drugs utilization that reduce antimicrobial resistance [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] or seasonal collapse of hospital services due to influenza outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0233526.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These variables would have likely increased the burden of influenza to the healthcare system.
