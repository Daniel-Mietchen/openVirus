<p>Our study suggests that the replacement of TIV by QIV in all eligible populations at current vaccination coverage rates would prevent 138,707 influenza B cases per year in Spain. In detail, 23,382 cases would be prevented if the population &lt;65 years switched from TIV to QIV and 125,835 cases if the population ≥65 years was vaccinated with QIV. Consequently, outpatient visits, hospitalizations and deaths would be avoided in all scenarios. Although the complete switch from TIV to QIV to all age groups implies an increase in vaccination cost, the reduction of healthcare costs would compensate, showing that QIV is a highly cost-effective alternative both from payer and societal perspective, with an ICER clearly below the usually mentioned Spanish threshold of €25,000 per QALY [

Whether budget impact restrictions do not allow complete switching in a single influenza season, population ≥65 years will obtain the greater benefit due to its higher vaccination coverage rates and burden of illness related with hospitalization.
