<p>Reviewer #1: Thank you for addressing my comments. I agree with your comments on the difference between the PHE study and yours. A key difference between the two was the impact of vaccination of English school children, making any vaccination of other population groups less impactful. I can now recommend this manuscript for publication.</p>
