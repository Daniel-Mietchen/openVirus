<p>There are three scenarios, and I wonder how the three scenarios are selected in a relation to healthcare policy in Spain. What is the current recommendation and is there any argument to change the recommendation? Also I would like to see some discussion of the results. At the end, which scenario is favored in terms of cost-effectiveness?</p>
