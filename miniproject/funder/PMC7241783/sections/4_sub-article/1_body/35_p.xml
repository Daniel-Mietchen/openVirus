<p>The most important comment that I can make is that the Discussion section fails to mention the context of this analysis by comparing the results presented here to other cost-effectiveness analyses on quadrivalent influenza vaccines in other countries. This analysis found that the QIV would be highly cost-effective for all target populations, whereas other studies (notably one conducted by Public Health England) found the opposite - that is, QIV was cost-effective for the elderly population, but it was less likely to be cost-effective for younger populations, mainly due to the existing QLAIV vaccination programme in schools. Other countries have found different results driven the local epidemiology of influenza B. It would therefore be really helpful to this manuscript if reference could be made to other countries and their CEAs in this domain.</p>
