<p>Response: To our knowledge, there is no contact matrix directly estimated on the Spanish population. All European inter-individual matrices display similar features, in particular the assortativeness of contacts among similar age-groups, hence we do not expect any qualitatively significant variations. Nevertheless, we are aware of this potential limitation of the study and we acknowledge it in the discussion. </p>
