<p>Response: We agree with the reviewer that the model was not described in large details as it was previously published in another publication. Following the reviewerâ€™s advice, we have added more information regarding the latent and contagious period considered. We have also added information regarding the timing of influenza vaccination (coverage rates by age-group were already in the text). The details of the calibration procedure and its results are already in the method section of the manuscript. However, we chose not to show the estimated probabilities of infection as they are model-dependent and not meaningful for the reader, but they are available upon request. </p>
