<p>To facilitate replicable sequencing in different settings, we provide detailed instructions for each stage of sample processing. Each stage independently is relatively simple, requiring standard molecular techniques, such as PCR, or adherence to step-by-step protocols. However, as an end-to-end protocol, it is intensive and ideally undertaken by experienced laboratory workers. The workflow needs to accommodate constraints on working hours and fit with other workloads to enable routine implementation. Realistically, the estimated 15-hour workflow for sample-to-sequence (for a batch of 24 samples) should be conducted over a 2â€“3 day period, but could be performed rapidly when required. Feedback from our training workshops indicated that hands-on training was valued and provided an appreciation of what it takes to produce quality sequence data. However, while useful as an introduction to MinION sequencing, workshops should be followed by extended one-on-one training and continued use to achieve full competency in performing the workflow.</p>
