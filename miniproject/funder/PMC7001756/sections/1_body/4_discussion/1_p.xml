<p>Through a series of sequencing applications and trainings conducted in different settings between 2017â€“2019, we demonstrate the feasibility of a cost-effective, in-country pipeline for WGS of RABV using the MinION. Although challenges exist, we show they are not insurmountable. Our pipeline offers both a scalable, low cost workflow that can be particularly beneficial for sequencing a large set of archived samples and a rapid sample-to-sequence turnaround for priority samples to inform decision-making for disease management. We share our protocols and guidance to facilitate WGS of RABV, even in resource-limited settings, discuss its limitations and prospects for ongoing application.</p>
