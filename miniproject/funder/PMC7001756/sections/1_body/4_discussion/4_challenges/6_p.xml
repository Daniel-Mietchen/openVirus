<p>PCR bias may preferentially amplify specific haplotypes in a sample (

This has implications for the use of this type of data in intra-host diversity studies and our results indicate it can contribute to consensus sequence variation between platforms/approaches. Our comparisons between samples sequenced on different platforms (MinION vs Illumina) and with different methodology (PCR vs metagenomic) indicate that intra single nucleotide variation (iSNV) can change the nucleotides that hold the majority frequency in RABV consensus sequences. The extent to which this occurs may be influenced by the frequency of primer mismatches, depth of coverage and initial viral input ( 
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Grubaugh 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019
 </xref>). Minor consensus variation has no impact on our objective of using phylogenetic-based methods to identify variants and spatio-temporal-genetic patterns. However, it does indicate that this sequencing approach will require some adjustment to accommodate in-depth analysis, such as inferring who-infected-whom and measuring intra-host diversity. Grubaught 
 <italic>et al.</italic>’s experimental approach to “correct” such biases in amplicon-generated sequence data could be applied to limit false positive consensus assignments and accurately estimate within-host diversity in future.
