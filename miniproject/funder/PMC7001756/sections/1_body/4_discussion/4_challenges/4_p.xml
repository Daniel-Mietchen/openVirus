<p>RNA extraction from brain tissue was time-consuming and typically yields a low viral proportion after depletion of host genomic DNA (

  <italic>et al.</italic> (2017)
 </xref> have shown that complete viral genome sequence can be obtained from Whatman Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) card samples without RNA extraction, which opens avenues for refining this part of the protocol and simplifying sample field collection and storage. Efforts to sequence from FTA card samples in Tanzania have shown promise, producing partial genome data (K. Brunker, unpublished report), and may be an option in future for field surveillance.
