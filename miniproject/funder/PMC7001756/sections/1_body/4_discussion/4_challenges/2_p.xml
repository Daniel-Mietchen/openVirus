<p>More generally, logistical challenges impact on infectious disease research in LMICs, from sample collection difficulties to limited internet and reliable electricity supplies and sourcing of reagents and consumables. A recent study found only two thirds of hospitals providing surgical care in 21 LMICs have a continuous electricity source or an available generator (

To overcome these issues, we used a lab-in-a-suitcase approach, with portable equipment to enable quick setup in different locations using battery power if required. However, maintaining a cold chain was problematic. Access to generator backed -20°C (for reagents) and -80°C (RNA storage) freezers was limited, even in research facilities, and minor issues often taken for granted in UK labs (e.g. access to ice for benchwork with reagents) were common. ONT have recently developed a field version of some of their sequencing kits, containing lyophilised reagents to mitigate cold chain constraints. Lyophilised reagents could be an option for future work but are expensive and would require significant bulk purchasing to be affordable. Moreover, few local suppliers can provide sequencing-specific reagents and a considerable mark-up is added to already monopolised prices in research-rich countries like the UK/USA. Ordering directly from the company comes with its own difficulties, including expensive shipment costs, import taxes and airway bills for the delivery of reagents under cold-chain conditions. Delays at customs can compromise reagent viability and occurred frequently on our sequencing trips. To promote in-country scientists and genomic research, better solutions are needed for sustaining a reliable, affordable supply chain for reagents and consumables.
