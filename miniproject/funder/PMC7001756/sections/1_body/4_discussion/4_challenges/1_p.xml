<p>Sub-optimal storage due to frequent power cuts and limited local storage facilities are a challenge in LMICs. Previously we have encountered difficulties in WGS of RABV samples archived in laboratories under variable conditions for up to a decade due to RNA damage (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). We found that the amplicon-based approach ensured not only efficient viral read throughput on the MinION but also that samples varying in quality could be sequenced in the same way and with the best chance of success (a worst-case scenario approach). Generating longer amplicons for RABV sequencing ( 
 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr">Nadin-davis 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017
 </xref>) has proven difficult for samples typical of these conditions (K. Brunker, unpublished report) but may be an option for 
 <italic>in situ</italic> sequencing when samples are fresh. We were unable to perform quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) on samples during field trips due to lack of equipment, but if available, this could inform the sequencing approach and aid as a diagnostic tool (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019
 </xref>). In addition, sequencing can usefully validate diagnostic results, e.g. a cat sample in the Philippines was determined positive by dRIT but shown to be negative during sequencing preparation (K. Brunker, unpublished report). Notes from the dRIT on this sample indicated it had been difficult to interpret, therefore the sequence information provided vital data to confirm the sample had been misdiagnosed as a false positive.
