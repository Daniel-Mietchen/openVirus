<p>There is potential for cross-sample contamination, particularly when working with amplicon sequencing. This can occur both during library preparation and the bioinformatic stage of barcode demultiplexing following sequencing (

 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">Quick 
  <italic>et al.</italic> (2016)
 </xref>, we took precautions to minimise amplicon contamination in pre-PCR areas, reagents and equipment, such as physical separation between pre- and post-PCR areas, regular decontamination and aliquoting of reagents. We also processed and sequenced negative controls (in most runs) to assess the degree of contamination, finding a low level of amplicon contamination in most sequencing runs. However, the proportion of reads in the negative control relative to the total number of reads per run was low (median [range]=0.03 [0-1.5]%) for runs prepared outside of training workshops i.e. in normal working conditions. Contamination was most problematic in regions where products overamplified in certain samples, increasing the risk of cross-over to other samples. This could be mitigated by limiting the number of PCR cycles for high viral titre samples, if they can be assessed by qPCR prior to sequencing. Unsurprisingly, contamination was higher during training exercises (see underlying data; 
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Brunker, 2019b</xref>) and any sequencing results from training should therefore be repeated for validation.
