<p>WGS using portable nanopore technology is a rapidly moving field, with protocols and pipeline developments evolving quickly. Although this comes with the caveat that protocols have to evolve to keep up with changes, these developments bring cost savings and improve accuracy. New refinements are expected to reduce costs further from a current estimate of ~£60 to £35 per sample, according to projections with flowcell re-use or the smaller low cost Flongle flowcell. Moreover, ongoing optimisation to reduce reagent use (K. Brunker, unpublished report) indicate that this can be reduced even further to the point where sample preparation/RNA extraction, rather than sequencing itself, become the most costly aspect of the protocol. Improvements to pore chemistry, kits and basecalling software have significantly improved the error rate, often considered the MInION’s Achilles heel. Single read accuracy has improved from 20% error rate of early phase 2014 releases to &lt;5% error rate with R9.4.1 pore chemistry (

 <sup>2</sup> sequencing technology and error correcting algorithms reaching ~99.3-99.9% consensus accuracy (

 </xref>). A major benefit of nanopore sequencing is the ability to convert raw data to basecalled sequence data in real-time. Although we did not have a GPU powered laptop to take advantage of this function, it offers an even speedier resolution for time-critical sample analysis to inform decision-making. ONT’s MinIT, a portable data processing unit, offers similar functionality but with the flexibility to use with different laptops.
