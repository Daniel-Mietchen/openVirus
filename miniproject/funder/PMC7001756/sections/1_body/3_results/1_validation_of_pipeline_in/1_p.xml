<p>Amplicons from sample RV3227 sequenced on the NextSeq platform produced over 22million mapped reads and an average read depth of 6971 with &gt;99% genome coverage. The same sample sequenced using the PCR-free metagenomic approach on the NextSeq produced 9498 mapped reads (0.4% of the total reads sequenced) with &gt;99% genome coverage. Consensus sequences from each approach were identical. Amplicons from sample RAB16025 were sequenced on both NextSeq and MinION platforms, and metagenomic sequencing was also performed. Comparison between the three consensus sequences revealed 100% identity between Illumina consensus sequences (metagenomic vs PCR) and 99.98% identity between Illumina and MinION sequences. There were two SNPs between Illumina and MinION consensus sequences, highlighted in
