<p>21 participants from veterinary and public health laboratories across Tanzania, Kenya and the Philippines took part in four-day sequencing workshops held in-country. Each participant prepared one sample during group laboratory sessions, providing hands-on experience of end-to-end preparation for MinION sequencing. Participants typically had experience in molecular laboratory methods such as PCR but most had never prepared sequencing libraries before. Feedback questionnaires revealed that participants were overall very satisfied with training workshops but indicated a desire for more comprehensive bioinformatics training. At the end of each workshop, participants were asked to submit a mini research proposal and a commitment from their research institute to support MinION genomic work in order to obtain a MinION starter pack and additional reagents. In total, four MinION starter kits were provided to groups of researchers from the workshops to kick-start the application of their new training skills for genomics research. At the time of writing none of the groups had conducted sequencing mostly due to problems procuring additional reagents (either due to funding or supplier issues). However, we have offered ongoing support e.g. provision of extra reagents, linking up with local expertise to ensure projects can be completed and all are expected to sequence within the next few months.</p>
