<p>RABV samples were sequenced across a range of settings in Kenya, Tanzania and the Philippines between 2017–2019 ( 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). Using a lab-in-a-suitcase approach provided the flexibility to ensure that the necessary resources were available for sequencing in resource-limited settings but also in well-resourced laboratories if particular equipment was not available. In total, 84 brain tissue samples and one salivary gland sample were processed from sample to sequence in their respective country of origin. For all samples, a consensus was generated for all sites across the genome where coverage was ≥20x ( 
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Brunker, 2019a</xref>). The majority of samples (~80%) achieved &gt;90% genome coverage at a depth of at least 20x ( 
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Brunker, 2019b</xref>). Due to practical constraints, sequencing run times varied; therefore, the total throughput from each run was different. Instances where coverage dropped below 20x may have been improved with longer sequencing times.
