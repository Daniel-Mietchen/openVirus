<p>The total processing time from sample to sequence-ready library for a batch of 24 samples was ~15 hours ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Sequencing run length varied batch to batch and was determined by practical constraints and the expected output required for 100x read coverage for 
 <italic>n</italic> samples in a run (and assuming loss of reads during demultiplexing). Typically, we found 5–8 hours was sufficient to get adequate coverage for multiplexed runs. For most samples, the time taken to process them end-to-end was 2–3 days when accounting for reasonable working hours (which are often restricted in laboratories) and processing a large number of samples (up to 24) for each run. The most time-consuming parts of the protocol were sample preparation for RNA extraction due to variation in the quality of brain tissue; PCR setup for a large number of samples (24 samples = 48 PCR reactions); and the normalisation of PCR products for sequencing libraries - samples with high concentrations of DNA often required an additional dilution step to provide suitable volumes (&gt;1μl) for pooling after normalisation ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). Workflow times can be reduced with multiple workers (estimated timings assume only one person is doing the work) and good preparation e.g. prior tube labelling/setup, the preparation of next steps during incubations, preparation of stock solutions ahead of time etc, but careful work is required to follow workflow steps to avoid mistakes and introducing contamination.
