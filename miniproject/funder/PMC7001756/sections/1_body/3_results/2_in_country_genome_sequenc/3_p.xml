<p>Negative controls were included in each batch of samples processed and sequenced in most runs. Contamination was found in some batches, particularly during group training exercises (e.g. Philippines workshop batch), highlighting the importance of this quality control step. When contamination was detected during PCR quantification steps (concentration &gt;1ng/Î¼l), sample preparation was repeated from RNA extraction. However, some cross-contamination was not apparent until sequencing; therefore, a negative control should always be included in the sequencing library. A low level of cross-contamination was noted in all sequencing runs (a few hundred reads), often caused by amplicons with particularly high levels of amplification.</p>
