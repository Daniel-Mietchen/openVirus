<p>Major and minor clade assignments were obtained for all sequences using RABV-GLUE (see example in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>), even for sequences with very poor consensus genome coverage of coding regions (as little as 15.1%; see underlying data; 
 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Brunker, 2019b</xref>). Philippines sequences were all identified as Asian SEA4, a minor clade so far detected exclusively in the Philippines ( 
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Saito 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">Tohma 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>, source: RABV-GLUE). Subdivision within the Philippines subclade indicates regional phylogeographic structure, as found previously ( 
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr">Saito 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr">Tohma 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>) but also further subdivision that may indicate structure at a finer spatial resolution ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>). Tanzanian sequences were all from the Africa 1b lineage, as found previously ( 
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Brunker 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Brunker 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>). Interestingly, we detected two minor RABV subclades in Kenya; Africa 1a and Africa 1b ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). The limited RABV genetic data available for Kenya prior to our work (one WGS, nine complete/partial nucleoprotein sequences) are all Africa 1b subclade.
