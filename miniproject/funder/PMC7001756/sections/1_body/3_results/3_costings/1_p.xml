<p>We estimated the full cost of sample-to-sequence preparation for RABV samples to give a better understanding of the costs involved to process field collected samples ( 
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">Brunker, 2019c</xref>). The cost reduced as improvements to the protocol and multiplexing capacity were made. Early runs, which had a low number of samples per flowcell and were used mainly for validation, were approximately £160 per sample. This reduced to ~£60 per sample at full multiplexing capacity, i.e. 24 samples per flowcell ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). Furthermore, the development of an effective washing procedure for flowcell reuse (“Nuclease-flush”, Oxford Nanopore) means that, potentially, multiple runs per flowcell could be achieved. Therefore, we anticipate that this will reduce even further to ~£35 to £45 per sample (based on 2–6 reuses of one MinION flowcell). For example, a similar PCR-based sequencing approach for Zika virus in Brazil was able to yield ~150 samples per flowcell by making use of the nuclease-flush between runs (S. Hill, University of Oxford, personal communication). In comparison, sample shipment to the UK followed by sample-to-sequence costs for an Illumina-based metagenomic approach used previously for RABV WGS costs an estimated ~£205 per sample ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). In terms of bioinformatic/data management costs, the SSDs used were typically purchased for £75–80 but are an optional component of the workflow and therefore not included in the overall estimate.
