<p>Genomic surveillance can inform global efforts to eliminate dog-mediated rabies and may be particularly valuable during the endgame, when the disease can circulate for extended periods at low levels ( 
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Klepac 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>). Endemic rabies typically circulates at low levels in dog populations (e.g. 58 to 384 cases per 100,000 dogs in low to high incidence settings in Tanzania, 
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Hampson 
  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2016
 </xref>) and during endgame stages incidence can drop below detectable levels with traditional surveillance, often based on laboratory-based confirmation of submitted suspect cases. Enhanced surveillance including integrated bite case management can increase case detection up to ten-fold (

  <italic>et al.,</italic> 2019
 </xref>) and genetic data from cases detected during this period is critical in determining their role in maintaining circulation and dispersing infection. For example: differentiating dog rabies variants from other wildlife variants (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007
 </xref>); distinguishing ongoing endemic transmission from incursions (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>;

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>). Furthermore, the capacity for an informed rapid response to newly detected cases will be pivotal for control efforts to succeed (
