<p>Here we establish methods for rapid whole genome sequencing (WGS) of rabies viruses (RABV) using the MinION sequencer, including a workflow from sample to sequence and the associated bioinformatics pipeline. We also incorporate procedures for downstream analysis, interpretation, and management of genomic data in a surveillance context. Through testing and replication of methods across different locations in Kenya, Tanzania and the Philippines we demonstrate the feasibility of real-time sequencing of RABV to rapidly inform policy decisions and disease management. We further highlight the potential for cost savings that could make routine genomic surveillance of rabies affordable in low-resource endemic settings.</p>
