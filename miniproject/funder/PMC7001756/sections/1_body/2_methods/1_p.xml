<p>Rabies positive samples were processed under a range of conditions to generate near whole genome sequences for viral characterization and phylogenetic analysis. Here we describe the sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines and validation process, detailing adaptations required for different settings. Our aim was to establish a protocol that could be used under minimal laboratory infrastructure; therefore, the approach is supported by a lab-in-a-suitcase platform: a portable toolkit to support the steps required to get from sample to sequence (

The ARTIC network, a Wellcome funded project to develop the application of genomic surveillance for viral outbreak response, provides comprehensive open-source resources for laboratory and sequencing work, bioinformatics, phylogenetics and analysis. We take advantage of these resources for our rabies workflow. They can be found here on the
