<p>Workshops were conducted in Kenya (11 participants) and the Philippines (10 participants) to provide hands-on training in MinION library preparation, sequencing and basic bioinformatics. Participants typically had a background in molecular biology but most had never prepared sequencing libraries. RABV RNA from local archived samples was used for sequencing following the sample-to-sequence method described above. Basic bioinformatic training included an introduction to the command line and use of the lab-on-an-SSD resource with the RABV version of the pipeline. In addition to workshops, training of local researchers was conducted on a one-to-one or small group basis at every opportunity. Consent from participants was requested as part of a questionnaire to give feedback on training workshops. Only those that consented provided feedback (75% of participants). Given that no identifying or sensitive information was collected, no ethical approval was sought for this questionnaire.</p>
