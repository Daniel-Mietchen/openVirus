<p>Brain tissue samples were collected by field officers and veterinarians from suspect rabid animals as part of rabies surveillance and research projects across Kenya (n = 9), Tanzania (n = 26, with 2 archived samples processed in the UK) and the Philippines (n = 52). These samples were accessible through existing collaborations and time allowed for their processing whilst optimizing our protocols and delivering training workshops, therefore numbers do not necessarily represent the surveillance capacity in each locality. Samples were obtained predominantly from domestic dogs but also included livestock and wildlife samples; details are provided as underlying data (

(RG18.01, Gyeongi-do, Republic of Korea), were used to confirm rabies positive cases in the field in Tanzania. These kits have been validated as an effective rabies field diagnostic tool (

In the Philippines samples were tested by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) using the fluorescent antibody test (FAT) (
