 </bold> Major and minor clade assignments were obtained for newly generated RABV sequences using Maximum Likelihood Clade Assignment (MLCA) as implemented in RABV-GLUE ( 
 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr">Singer 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018
 </xref>). MCLA uses RAxML's Evolutionary Placement Algorithm ( 
 <xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr">Stamatakis, 2014</xref>) to select high-likelihood branch placements for a query virus sequence in a previously calculated phylogeny of virus reference strains. The reference phylogeny in RABV-GLUE was reconstructed using maximum likelihood, and contains a representative set of RABV sequences obtained from recent studies of RABV diversity (

  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr">Troupin 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>). Following MLCA, RABV-GLUE was used to import relevant sequences from GenBank to compare to the new sequence data from each area i.e. East Africa and the Philippines. GenBank sequences were curated from the same minor clade associated with each area according to MLCA and both GenBank and MinION sequences were filtered to include only sequences with &gt;90% genome coverage. For sequences produced for this study that was 24 out of 34 sequences from East Africa and 44 out of 52 sequences from Philippines. Alignments were produced using MAFFT ( 
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Katoh &amp; Standley, 2013</xref>) implemented in RABV-GLUE. Maximum likelihood phylogenies were produced for each of the alignment sets using RAxML implemented in RABV-GLUE with a General Time Reversible model of nucleotide substitution with the gamma model of rate heterogeneity and a proportion of invariant sites and 1000 bootstraps. Outgroups consisting of RABV genomes from other minor clades were included in tree building.
