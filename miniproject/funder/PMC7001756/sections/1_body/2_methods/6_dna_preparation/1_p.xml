<p>Protocols and reagents varied slightly due to availability and as protocols evolved; the latest version of the protocol is available on the GitHub resource and Figshare (

Initially, extracted RNA was reverse transcribed using Protoscript II First Strand Sequencing kit (E6560, NEB) under manufacturer’s instructions. At later stages this was changed to Lunascript RT Supermix (E3010, NEB) in a reduced reaction volume of 10μl (2μl Lunascript + 3μl nuclease-free water +5μl RNA). Multiplex PCR was conducted with 2 to 2.5 µL of cDNA, the RABV primer scheme and Q5 High Fidelity Hot-Start DNA Polymerase (M0493, NEB) following the two-step PCR protocol (

 </xref>), with the following PCR cycling conditions: 98°C heat inactivation for 30sec, followed by 30–40 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 15sec and a combined extension/annealing step of 65°C for 5min. PCR products were purified using a 1x solid-phase reversible immobilization bead (SPRI) cleanup (Ampure XP, Beckman-Coulter or PCRClean DX,Aline Biosciences) and concentrations measured using a Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity kit (Q32851, Thermofisher) on a Qubit 3.0 fluorimeter (ThermoFisher). In field sites, or when standard thermocyclers in laboratories were unavailable, PCR was performed using a portable MiniPCR machine (Amplyus). This was powered by a lithium battery (PowerAdd Pilot Pro2 85Wh LiION 9-20V) for the full PCR cycle when power was intermittent or unavailable. A negative control (water) was included at the cDNA synthesis stage for each batch of samples and as part of the sequencing library. Some of the first runs in Tanzania did not include a negative control as part of the sequencing library as the protocol was still being finalised. However, a negative control up to the PCR stage was always included as part of sample preparation. If the negative control was &gt;1ng/μl by Qubit quantification, sample preparation was repeated from RNA extraction.
