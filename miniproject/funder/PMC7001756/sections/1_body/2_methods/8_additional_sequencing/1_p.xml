<p>Four samples shipped to the UK and extracted at APHA were sequenced using the metagenomic approach previously described ( 
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Brunker 
  <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). Briefly, this involved host genomic DNA depletion of extracted total RNA using the on-column DNase treatment in RNeasy plus mini kit (74134, Qiagen) followed by first- and second-strand cDNA synthesis with a cDNA synthesis system kit (04379012001, Roche) and library preparation with a Nextera XT sample preparation kit (FC-131-1024, Illumina).
