<p>The costs per sequenced sample were estimated for the MinION-based multiplex PCR approach and the previously used Illumina-based metagenomic approach (

 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Brunker

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref> and any transportation costs associated with the shipment of samples to laboratory facilities. Reagents and consumable costings assume a bulk buy for at least 100 samples. For metagenomic sequencing, costs were based on previous quotes from UK sequencing facilities to process RABV samples, including sample shipment from Tanzania to the UK.
