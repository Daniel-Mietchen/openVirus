<p>Genomic research has the potential to leap-frog LMICs to the forefront of infectious diseases surveillance and control, and facing challenges head-on will hugely benefit the future of public and veterinary health. Most countries with endemic dog-mediated rabies currently have limited local sequencing capacity. These countries also suffer a heavy burden of other neglected endemic diseases, that could benefit from genomic research. The approach that we present is affordable and readily deployable to such settings with limited infrastructure, overcoming issues that typically constrain routine genomics surveillance, including cold chain, electricity and internet. Moreover, the approach is scalable and low-cost (~£60 per sample) for both sequencing large numbers of samples and for rapid turnaround to inform disease management. We predict further improvements to sequencing performance including cost-effectiveness, speed and accuracy, with further optimization underway and protocols available to researchers (

Nonetheless, improvement to the supply and affordability of reagents for LMICs’ scientists is an area that needs addressing, as is the development of bioinformatics resources and translation of genomic research findings to digestible recommendations for policy-makers. Overall, this in-country application can support capacity building and the sustainability of routine genomic surveillance in LMICs, empowering local scientists to conduct cutting-edge research in their own backyard.
