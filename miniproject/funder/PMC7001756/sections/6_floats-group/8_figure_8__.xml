  <title>Progress towards elimination of dog rabies and role for genomic surveillance.</title>
  <p>Detected animal rabies cases are shown in grey and human rabies cases in red, based on surveillance data from Ecuador (from SIRVERA). Data were used to inform hypothetical scenarios relevant to rabies circulation in Latin America to illustrate examples of how genomic surveillance can add value. Stages of genomic surveillance corresponding to 
   <xref ref-type="other" rid="B1">Box 1</xref> are shown with examples of inferences from genomic surveillance indicated by asterisks.
