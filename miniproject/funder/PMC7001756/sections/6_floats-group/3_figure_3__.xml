   <bold>A</bold>) Table of laboratory workflow steps with estimated timings and details of important reagents/consumables; 
   <bold>B</bold>) Bioinformatics workflow diagram; 
   <bold>C</bold>) Estimated cost per sample for end-to-end rabies virus sequencing in-country using a PCR-based MinION approach versus the PCR-free metagenomic approach previously used in the UK. Costs assume a bulk buy of reagents for 100 reactions and a multiplex capacity of 24 samples per flowcell for MinION sequencing.
