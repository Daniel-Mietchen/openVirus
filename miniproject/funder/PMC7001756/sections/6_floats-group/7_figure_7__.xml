  <title>Maximum likelihood tree of rabies virus genomes from Kenya and Tanzania.</title>
  <p>Genomes belonging to two minor clades in the rabies virus Cosmopolitan clade are highlighted, Africa 1a and Africa 1b, which were sequenced in this study (tip shapes, n=24) and curated from GenBank (n=220). The country of origin and number of sequences in each minor clade are annotated on a map of Africa and the location of Pemba sequences from a 2016/17 outbreak is annotated on the tree, indicating multiple introductions from the mainland. Genbank sequences representing other minor clades ME1a, ME1b and ME2 (KX148162, KX148190, KX148191) were used as an outgroup (branch not shown). Maps were generated with package rWorldMaps in R.</p>
