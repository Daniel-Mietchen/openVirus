  <title>Maximum likelihood tree of rabies virus genomes from the Philippines.</title>
  <p>Genomes from the rabies virus Asian minor clade SEA4, which were sequenced in this study (n=44) and curated from GenBank (n=5). Colours indicate the administrative region associated with each sequence as shown on the map and internal node symbols indicate bootstrap support â‰¥80. Genbank sequences GU358653 and GU647092 representing Asian minor clades SEA2a and SEA2b were used as an outgroup (branch not shown). Administrative shapefiles were obtained from
