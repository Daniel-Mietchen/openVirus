<p> Two broad applications of the presented protocol are claimed by the authors such as characterization of circulating RABV diversity, and rapid in situ genomic surveillance of new cases, particularly during the endgame and I will agree that the error rate of the MinION will generally not interfere too much with such applications. However later in the discussion they presented many more applications of genetic data to inform surveillance (see Box 1, page 15: Current and prospective ways in which genetic data can be used to answer questions at different stages along the complex pathway towards elimination of rabies). Among the four main applications listed by the authors and their secondary objectives (10 are cited), at least 6 of them (listed below) will not tolerate cross contamination, ambiguities in the sequencing, and sequencing errors even in a very low percentage and therefore renders the proposed pipeline inapplicable for such studies.

   <p>Identify host associations to inform targeted vaccination.</p>

   <p>Assess lineage distribution in the context of political/administrative borders, quantifying transboundary risks.</p>

   <p>Determine the socio-ecological processes underlying local and long-distance transmission.</p>

  <list-item>
   <p>Identify epidemiologically connected areas that RABV lineages circulate between once control underway.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Discriminate variants to verify freedom from dog rabies or identify emergence of new reservoirs.</p>
  </list-item>
 </list> This should be made very clear in the discussion even if we may all share the authorâ€™s hope that further development in the technology will in the next years minimize the risk of sequencing errors.
