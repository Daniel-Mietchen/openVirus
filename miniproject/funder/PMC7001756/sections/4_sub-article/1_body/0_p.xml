<p>Brunker 
 <italic>et al.</italic> present an interesting paper describing an approach that can be used under minimal laboratory infrastructure and that could reduce the lag time from sample to sequence and epidemiological action in LMICs. They propose an in-country pipeline for rapid whole genome sequencing (WGS) of rabies viruses (RABV), one of the major neglected tropical disease causing a large public health and economic burden in Asia and Africa. The approach is based on the MinION sequencing technology, including a workflow from sample to sequence and the associated bioinformatics pipeline.
