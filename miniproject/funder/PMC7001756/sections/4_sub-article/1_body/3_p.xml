<p> There are many studies published by other authors showing that samples collected in a defined geographic area reflecting an endemic situation and during a limited period of time (a few months) differ only by a very low number of SNPs. Any errors concerning the distribution of these SNPs along the genomes and between the samples will have a dramatic effect on the phylogenetic tree reconstruction and the derived inferences.</p>
