<p> As mentioned by the authors, the MinION is so far not considered a high-throughput platform. One of the major risks is the potential for cross-sample contamination, particularly when working with amplicon sequencing. This was noticed by the authors “A low level of cross-contamination was noted in all sequencing runs (a few hundred reads), often caused by amplicons with particularly high levels of amplification”. This can occur both during library preparation and the bioinformatic stage of barcode demultiplexing following sequencing as written by the authors but the major risk lies in the preparation of the samples and their amplification. The authors stressed the fact that they took precautions to minimise amplicon contamination in pre-PCR areas, reagents and equipment. However, all clinical biology laboratories even in the developed countries have shifted to single tube amplifications to avoid these contaminations. It appears unrealistic to think that such contaminations will not happen in a significant percentage when performed in field conditions when many samples will be received and processed every day and at least 30 different amplicons generated for each of them. This will unfortunately happen independently of all authors’ efforts to train local people that are documented in this manuscript.  These cross contaminations and mislabelling of tubes will have a strong effect on the final whole genome sequences generated and consequently on some of the conclusions drawn from their phylogenetic analysis.</p>
