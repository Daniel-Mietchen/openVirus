<p> To this aim, samples from Kenya (n = 10), Tanzania (n = 24) and the Philippines (n = 52) were sequenced using three distinct technologies and 92 of them were sequenced in LMICs using the MinION sequencing technology. The protocol included RNA extraction and PCR amplification of 400bp amplicons across the entire genome (~11923bp), with an overlap of 50bp. Therefore, at least 30 different amplicons were needed to cover the whole RABV genome. The costs per sequenced sample were estimated for the MinION-based multiplex PCR approach and compared favorably with the previously used Illumina-based metagenomic approach. Therefore, the authors claimed that they demonstrate the feasibility of real-time sequencing of RABV to rapidly inform policy decisions and disease management. I would easily agree that the first objective is reached and I really consider that as a great achievement which deserves publication. But this does not seem to be fully the case for the second one (inform policy decision and disease management). Most of the limitations of the techniques are presented in the discussion. However, some of the limitations would require more discussion and others are simply not addressed at all although some of these dramatically weaken the ability of this approach to accurately inform epidemiological surveillance and complex epidemiological questions.</p>
