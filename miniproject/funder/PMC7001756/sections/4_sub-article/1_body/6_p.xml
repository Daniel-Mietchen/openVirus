<p> The authors are fair writing “Our comparisons between samples sequenced on different platforms (MinION vs Illumina) and with different methodology (PCR vs metagenomic) indicate that intra single nucleotide variation (iSNV) can change the nucleotides that hold the majority frequency in RABV consensus sequences. The extent to which this occurs may be influenced by the frequency of primer mismatches, depth of coverage and initial viral input”. This is further exemplified in Figure 4 where locations of single nucleotide polymorphisms between Illumina and MinION consensus sequences are shown (at least two on this example). However, I disagree with the rather superficial conclusion saying “Minor consensus variation has no impact on our objective of using phylogenetic-based methods to identify variants and spatio-temporal-genetic patterns”. This has to be demonstrated and is probably not the case for many of the applications of genomic data on surveillance. I would bet that the longer internal branches of the maximum likelihood tree linking the rabies virus genomes from Kenya and Tanzania to those collected from Genbank sequences illustrate these points. Further the authors should comment on the impact of the sites masked by ambiguity code N (coverage was &lt;20X) and their final proportion on the full genome sequences.</p>
