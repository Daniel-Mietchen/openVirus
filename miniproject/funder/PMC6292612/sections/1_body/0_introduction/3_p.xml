<p>Variation of VE was observed depending on the seroprevalence in the countries: for example, in CYD15, seroprevalence was higher in Brazil and Colombia than in Mexico and Puerto Rico (55.5%, 92.5%, 50.9% and 48.9% respectively), and so was efficacy (77.5%, 67.5%, 31.3% and 57.6% respectively) [

Moreover, during the year 3 of the long-term safety follow-up in CYD14, an excess in the number of dengue hospitalization and/or severe cases was found in the vaccinated younger age group (2 to 5 years old). Sanofi Pasteur performed additional analyses of long term follow up safety data to better understand whether these findings were due to age effect or previous exposure to dengue [
 <xref rid="pone.0207878.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and to assess the potential risk and/or benefit of vaccination of baseline-seronegative individuals. These analyses indicated that while vaccination in endemic areas confers predicted benefit on the population level, the vaccine performs differently in seropositive vs seronegative individuals, with baseline-seronegative individuals receiving the vaccine showing increased risk of hospitalized and severe dengue compared to placebo recipients, starting about 30 months post-first dose [

It is not clear if the possible age effect may be associated with pre-existing dengue exposure or age-specific differences (e.g. less-developed vascular physiology or immature immune responses in the younger age group). The World Health Organization thus concluded that a “‘prevaccination screening strategy’ would be the preferred option, in which only dengue-seropositive-persons are vaccinated [
 <xref rid="pone.0207878.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].” However, no point-of care diagnostic test is currently available that would allow rapid, sensitive, and specific prevaccination screening to determine baseline serostatus; the development of such a test has been outlined as a high research priority [
