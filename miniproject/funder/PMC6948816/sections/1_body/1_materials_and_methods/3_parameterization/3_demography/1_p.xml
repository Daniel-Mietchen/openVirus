<p>We based the initial age distribution of the population on data from the World Bank [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. For births, we computed a rate based on an average birth rate in Nicaragua of 2.2 births per woman, which was uniformly distributed over the female reproductive lifespan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We defined the period of reproductive age between 15 and 49 years. The ageing process was linear, increasing the age of each agent by 7 days at each 7-day time step.
