<p>We reintroduced ZIKV in the population after a delay of 
 <italic>d</italic> = {1, â€¦, 80} years in independent simulations. We chose this approach rather than continuous reintroductions to remove some of the stochasticity and assess more clearly the association between immunity decay and risk of an outbreak. As the probability of an extinction of the outbreak depends on the number of ZIKV cases reintroduced in the population, we considered three different values for the seed (1, 5 or 10 cases) and compared the results (Supporting information S1). Simulations using continuous reintroductions each year are presented in the Supporting information S1.
