<p>We assessed the consequences of future outbreaks of ZIKV infection in Managua, Nicaragua using a stochastic ABM. The model follows a basic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) framework and integrates processes related to ZIKV transmission, immunity, demography, adverse congenital outcomes and vaccination (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, Supporting information S1). We considered different scenarios about the duration of immunity, the timing and scale of ZIKV reintroductions in the population, and the timing and scale of a hypothetical vaccination program targeted towards 15 year old girls.
