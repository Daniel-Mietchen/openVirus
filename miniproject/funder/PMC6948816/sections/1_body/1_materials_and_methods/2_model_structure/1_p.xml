<p>We simulated a population of 10,000 individuals for 80 years (2017–2097). We assigned agents’ age and ZIKV infection status (susceptible 
 <italic>S</italic>, infected 
 <italic>I</italic> or immune 
 <italic>R</italic>). Initial conditions reflected the situation in Managua, Nicaragua in 2017, when there was no documentation of active transmission. In the outbreak-free period, we only considered demographic and immunity processes: births, deaths, ageing and, if applicable, loss of immunity and vaccination. Given the scarcity of these events at the individual level, we selected a long time-step of seven days and stochastically applied the transition probabilities at each time step for each agent. After a given time, ZIKV-infected cases were reintroduced in the population. Upon reintroduction, the time step was reduced to 0.1 days, and we evaluated the epidemic-related transition probabilities: Susceptible agents may become infected at a rate

 </sub> is the age-dependent transmission rate and N the total population size. Infected individuals may recover with a rate

We allowed six months for the outbreak to finish after introduction. Simulations were conducted independently for each combination of scenarios and repeated 1,000 times. In the baseline scenario, we assumed no vaccination, no loss of immunity and a reintroduction of 10 infected individuals.
