<p>Researchers in Managua, Nicaragua were the first to report the age-stratified seroprevalence of ZIKV antibodies in population-based surveys [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The first cases of autochthonous ZIKV infection in Nicaragua were reported in January, 2016, and an epidemic was observed between July and December of that year. Through case-based surveillance, the public health authorities of Nicaragua reported a total of 2,795 people with ZIKV detected by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR over this period [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The number of symptomatic infections is likely much higher, owing to under-reporting. Furthermore, ZIKV infection is asymptomatic in 33 to 87% of cases [

Shortly after the end of the 2016 epidemic, Zambrana et al. analyzed sera from two large population-based surveys in Managua to measure the prevalence of IgG antibodies against ZIKV in 2- to 14-year olds (N = 3,740) and 15- to 80-year olds (N = 2,147) [
