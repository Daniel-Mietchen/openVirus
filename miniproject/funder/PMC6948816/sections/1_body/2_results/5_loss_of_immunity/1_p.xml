<p>If protective immunity to ZIKV is not lifelong, the time window before observing a rise in the attack rates resulting from ZIKV reintroduction will shorten (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007978.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). For instance, if 15% of the those who were infected in 2016 lose their immunity after 10 years (a mean duration of immunity of 60 years), the time until the risk of outbreak upon reintroduction reaches 50% would be 14 years earlier (2033) than with lifelong immunity (2047). If 55% lose their immunity after 10 years (a mean duration of immunity of 15 years), in 2024, 50% of the introductions result in an outbreak, and the attack rate in 2047 is 47%. Loss of immunity over time would reduce the relative risk in the 15â€“29 year old age group (
