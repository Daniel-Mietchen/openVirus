<p>We considered additional model features that may impact our predictions in a sensitivity analysis (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007978.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and Supporting information S2). Accounting for seasonality or for a future increase in vector abundance would result in higher transmission rates. This would lead to a shorter time window until a rise in the risk of ZIKV outbreak, and higher overall attack rates. A future diminution of vector abundance would have the opposite effects. Human migration from rural areas to Managua, Nicaragua would lead to a sharper decline of protective immunity in the population, also lowering the time window before the next ZIKV outbreak. Finally, a continuous endemic circulation of ZIKV in the region would increase the probability of an outbreak early on and lead to more stochasticity.
