<p>The differences between age groups in both immunity and transmission will result in a disproportionate burden of infection in the 15–29 year age class. The relative risk of infection in this age group ranges from 1.2 to 1.6, compared with the general population if an outbreak occurs during the period 2032–2075 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007978.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). As most pregnancies occur in this age group, these women are also the most likely to experience a pregnancy with an adverse outcome. The increased risk of infection in this group implies that the number of adverse congenital outcomes resulting from a ZIKV outbreak during this period is likely to be higher than expected with a homogeneous distribution of immunity across ages. Assuming different values for the added risk of microcephaly after a ZIKV infection during the first trimester, we expect the mean number of additional microcephaly cases due to ZIKV infection resulting from the reintroduction of the virus in Managua, Nicaragua to reach 1 to 5 cases per 100,000 population in 2060 (
