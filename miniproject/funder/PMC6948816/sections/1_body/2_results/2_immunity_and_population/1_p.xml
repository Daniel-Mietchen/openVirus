<p>In our forward simulations, the expected population size increased by 42% between 2017 and 2097. Under the assumption that ZIKV infection results in lifelong protective immunity, population renewal will create an imbalance in the proportion immune in different age groups. We expect the overall proportion of the population with protective immunity to have halved (from 48% to 24%) by 2051 and to be concentrated among the older age classes (
