<p>Other ZIKV vaccination studies confirm our findings. However, they do not show the effect in risk groups nor assume herd immunity from previous outbreaks as we did; Durham et al. (2018) showed that immunizing females aged 9 to 49 years with a 75% effective vaccine and a coverage of 90%, would reduce the incidence of prenatal infections by at least 94% [
