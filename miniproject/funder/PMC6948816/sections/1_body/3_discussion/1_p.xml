<p>In this mathematical modelling study, we show that a new ZIKV outbreak in Nicaragua would affect proportionally more women in the young reproductive age range (15â€“29 years) than the general population, owing to the age-dependent infection pattern and population renewal. The risk of a new ZIKV outbreak in Nicaragua, after reintroduction, will remain low before 2035 because of herd immunity, then rise to 50% in 2047. If protective immunity to ZIKV decays with time, ZIKV recurrence could occur sooner. Timely introduction of targeted vaccination, focusing on females aged 15 years would both reduce the risk of adverse congenital outcomes and extend herd immunity, mitigating the overall risk of an outbreak and resulting in lower attack rates if an outbreak occurs.</p>
