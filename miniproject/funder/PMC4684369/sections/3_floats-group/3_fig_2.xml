  <p>Birth rate was held at a constant probability of 0.15 births/household/year and vector production was input using the field patch with the highest average rate of A. aegypti production. Dotted lines track the fraction of the population susceptible to dengue (S) and solid lines track the number of infectious people (I).</p>
