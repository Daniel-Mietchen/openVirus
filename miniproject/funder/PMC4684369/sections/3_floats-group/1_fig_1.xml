  <title>Schematic of dengue transmission system in an urban patch.</title>
  <p>Arrows represent causally increasing or self-enhancing effects, dots represent causally decreasing effects. For example, transmission between residents and mosquitoes on its own is self-enhancing because it amplifies the exposure of non-infected hosts to dengue. The transmission system is comprised of the interactions between the white boxes; yellow boxes are socio-ecological drivers of interest, represented as parameters in the ABM.</p>
