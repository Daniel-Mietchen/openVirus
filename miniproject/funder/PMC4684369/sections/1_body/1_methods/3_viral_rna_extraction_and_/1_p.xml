<p>Collected sera were used to extract viral RNA using QIAamp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen, Germany) following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was finally eluted with 60 μl of AVE buffer and stored at -80°C until use. Five microliters from each RNA extraction were used as template in a one-step multiplex RT-PCR reaction (Qiagen, One-Step RT-PCR kit) as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Primers used were designated to amplify 751 bp from the E/NS1 region (primers available upon request). Reactions were tested for positive amplification in 1% agarose gel. Those negative samples in the first amplification round were then subjected to a nested PCR. The extraction processes was carried out in a different place than the PCR in order to limit any chance of contamination and cross amplification. In addition, negative controls including water instead of RNA were used to validate the results. Finally, amplified products (from RT-PCR or nested PCR) were purified and then used as template for sequencing reactions in order to determine the dengue serotype. The identity of the amplicons was confirmed by comparing each sequence using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). See
