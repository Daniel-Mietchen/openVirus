<p>The simulation patch consists of a 2-dimensional 67-house grid taken from the urban planning grid of the two blocks in Armenia in which 22 children were found simultaneously with virus, herein referred to as a “PCR22 event” (see 
 <xref rid="sec017" ref-type="sec">results</xref> section). The simulation patch is surrounded by a buffer zone of two rows of houses that provides a potential refuge for emigrating mosquitoes and a source of immigrant mosquitoes. This allowed us to more realistically simulate transmission dengue dynamics in two blocks embedded in a larger urban area, eliminating any possible aggregation of humans, mosquitoes and/or infection that might arise as an artifact of hosts being confined in a 2-block area. Mosquito and human dynamics and behavior in buffer zone houses are parameterized identically to houses in the simulation patch, but outputs and analysis focus only the simulation patch.
