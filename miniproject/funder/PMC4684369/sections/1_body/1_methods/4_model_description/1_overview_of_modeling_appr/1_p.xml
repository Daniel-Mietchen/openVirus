<p>We used simulation as a tool to study the drivers and dynamics of a single dengue serotype over the course of 20 years (dt = 1 day) in a 2-block urban patch. Arboviral transmission contains many unknown variables relating to human, vector and viral ecology, whose interactions give rise to complex epidemiological dynamics. Given this reality and the small sample size of patches surveyed for dengue, we sought to improve our intuition of the historical interactions between social and ecological processes capable of generating the intense transmission observed in Armenia (see 
 <xref rid="sec017" ref-type="sec">results</xref>). The simulation provides a more detailed understanding of how epidemiological dynamics vary with concomitant variation in the force of viral introduction from outside the patch, host-vector contact within the patch and recruitment of susceptible humans. The schematic in
