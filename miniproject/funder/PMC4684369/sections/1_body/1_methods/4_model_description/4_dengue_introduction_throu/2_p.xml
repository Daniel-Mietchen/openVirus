 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] means that cases are rarely evenly distributed across the city. The spatial extent of transmission is thus a better indicator of risk than the total number of cases, as humans do not distribute their social behaviors evenly across the city. This is consistent with data from dengue endemic cities suggesting that humans visit only a few destinations further away from home and these vary stochastically over time[
