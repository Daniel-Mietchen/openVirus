<p>Our approach to modeling external dengue introduction into the simulation patch considers the viral introduction rate a function of the level of dengue transmission in the surrounding city, the exposure of susceptible residents to external infectious 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations and the exposure of infectious visitors to local 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations. The probability of introduction is given by the equation 
 <italic>p</italic>

  <italic>intro</italic>
 </sub> = 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> * 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>esv</italic>
 </sub>, where 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>esv</italic>
 </sub> is the probability of external
 <italic>-social-vector</italic> exposure and 
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> is a time-varying index describing the spread of dengue across neighborhoods in the surrounding city. 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>intro</italic>
 </sub> represents a Bernoulli probability applied twice in each house-day to describe (1) the probability that an infectious visitor is exposed to biting mosquitoes present in the house (see below and [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] for description of reduced visitor biting probability) and (2) the probability that a susceptible resident becomes exogenously infected. Note that if this second process is a success, then one susceptible resident in the house is infected at random, and if all residents are immune then only the first process (infectious visitor exposed to local mosquito bites) is applied. There is thus a reduced rate of dengue introduction with heightened local immunity. Introduction may also occur via the buffer zone (immigration of infectious mosquitoes, visits to buffer zone, bites on visiting buffer zone residents), but external introduction into the buffer zone occurs via human-mediated introduction as described above.
