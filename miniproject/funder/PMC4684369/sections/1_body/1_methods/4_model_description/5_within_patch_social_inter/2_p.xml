<p>In order to account for socially-mediated exposure to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> bites in the immediate vicinity of an individual’s house, each human is potentially bitten by mosquitoes in a Poisson-distributed number of houses in the simulation patch each day (with a visitor’s probability of being bitten in each). In the absence of field data, we assume that on average children (2–15 years old) have double the 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>-exposing visits of adults (mean of 3 and 1.5 visited houses/day, respectively). Each person randomly chooses a house to visit among a fixed set of contact premises. The probability that a person includes a premise in their contact set is defined by the sum of a distance-independent component, 
 <italic>link_p</italic> (applied to all premises) and a distance-dependent probability, 
 <italic>link_n/d^</italic>.
 <italic>5</italic> (applied only to houses on the same street), where 
 <italic>d</italic> is the distance between the residence and the potential contact premise.
