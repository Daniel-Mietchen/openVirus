<p>Initial household size and age structure in each house was taken from the demographic survey of the patch with highest observed transmission in Armenia (

Human birth rate and mortality, simulated by the random addition of a non-immune child (age 1) into a household, varies across a range that includes birth and age-specific death rates crudely estimated from Armeniaâ€™s 2005 census and 2009 vital statistics data. Given the short duration of the simulation in comparison to human life history, we did not expect human birth rate and mortality to strongly influence dynamics.
