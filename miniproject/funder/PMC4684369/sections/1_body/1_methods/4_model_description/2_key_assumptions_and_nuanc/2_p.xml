<p>An increasing number of studies identify human exposure to

 <italic>aegypti</italic> bites in places where they do not reside as important to dengue transmission, leading to diverse approaches to incorporating human movement into dengue transmission models [

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our focus on transmission in a two-block, purely residential area led to a natural distinction between modeling internal (contained within the patch) and external (outside the patch) social relationships. The latter lead to viral introduction into the simulation patch, whereas the former contribute to the force of transmission, although both internal and external social relationships generate differential mosquito contact between residents and visitors (Perkins’ feature 1). In our model mosquitoes bite in a single house in each timestep, as in other dengue models [

There is some evidence that PCR-positivity lasts longer than the duration of infectiousness to mosquitoes, and as such we assumed it was exponentially distributed with a mean of 7 days [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (as opposed to 5 days for infectiousness[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]).
