<p>Newly emerged host-seeking mosquitoes randomly appear in each house at a Poisson distributed daily rate whose parameter is a function of the houseâ€™s pupal count, sex ratio, pupal survival rates and durations of the pupal state and refractory period (period between female emergence and receptivity to mating). Pupal counts are assigned from one of 8 different 2-block patches in the La Fachada neighborhood in which we conducted 7 seasonal

In all sensitivity analyses (see below) vector production was varied by choosing a different patch to drive mosquito dynamics. Roughly an order of magnitude (x10) separated the patches with the highest and lowest frequency of highly productive houses (see below). Details about the following processes can be found in[
