<p>Our research team (based in the INS) displaced to the study neighborhoods 1–4 weeks following laboratory confirmation of dengue and conducted a 1-time visit to all premises in the city-block of the case’s residence and in the block across the street. Blood was drawn from assenting children below 16 years of age with consenting parents. In each consenting residence, we inspected all water-holding containers and enumerated all
