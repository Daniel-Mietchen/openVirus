<p>We carried out a pilot study of dengue in order to obtain point estimates of the prevalence of dengue virus in children in clusters of houses with evidence of recent transmission. Study patches, defined as two adjacent city blocks (ranging 50–138 houses, 182–369 residents), were located in six neighborhoods where we had conducted prior longitudinal studies of

Three of the neighborhoods (La Fachada, La Cumbre, Ciudadela 20 Julio) had the most DF cases (2004–2006) in each respective city, and the other three were respectively among the top four reporting neighborhoods. In collaboration with municipal health departments, we worked to continuously identify clinical dengue cases in children below 6 years old between August 2010 and March 2011. In order to detect early onset dengue cases, nursing students and health department personnel routinely visited houses, daycares and schools to inquire about children with fever. Within 24 hours of notification of a febrile child, health department physicians visited the child’s home, performed a clinical evaluation and took a blood sample in all suspect dengue cases. Blood isolates were sent to the National Virology Reference Laboratory in the Colombian National Institute of Health (INS) (Bogota) and recent dengue infection was confirmed using RT-PCR[
