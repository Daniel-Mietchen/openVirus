<p>In order to explore the fine-scale patterns of transmission we studied the frequency distributions of outbreak size generated by different parameter scenarios of the model. We limited our analysis to years 11–20 in order to focus on the situation in which the patch is embedded in an endemic neighborhood, as opposed to an area where dengue has recently invaded and the population is immunologically naïve. For infectious diseases in which it can be assumed that outbreaks are generated by independent introductions (i.e. no long-term persistence), comparison of the shape of the frequency distributions of outbreak size can indicate the explosiveness and the mechanisms that drive transmission in different areas or ecological conditions [
