<p>Given our finding that the value of

 </sub> drove the dynamical behavior of the system at the space and timescales of study (see 
 <xref rid="sec017" ref-type="sec">results</xref>), we then investigated how this variable conditioned the sensitivity of PCR22 events to each parameter in the model. For each of the three 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>esv</italic>
 </sub> values we carried out a univariate sensitivity analysis of all parameters, varying each at 50%, 25%, 100%, 125% and 150% of its default value, with the exceptions of vector production and survival. A more conservative variation scheme was implemented for the daily survival probability of vectors, as a 25% reduction from the default value virtually eliminated all transmission (

 <italic>aegypti</italic> pupae. We measured the average number of PCR22 events (simulation years 11â€“20), tabulated over 200 20-year model runs for each parameter value, leaving all others at their default levels (
