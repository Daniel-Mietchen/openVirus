<p>We also explored the frequency of PCR22 events across the simulated parameter space. In this analysis we used 1000 model runs for each parameter combination mentioned above, generating sufficient data to stratify outputs into categories of human birth and death rates (varied randomly across model runs). In order to evaluate how the drivers of PCR22 events evolve from the time when dengue is introduced into a completely naïve patch to an endemic situation we used classification and regression tree (CART) analysis to compare the effects of input variables on the average number of PCR22 events in the first 5 simulation years with years 11–20 (see

Because the regression trees depend entirely on the input parameters, some of which are arbitrarily defined, our goal was not to obtain predictive models for the frequency of PCR22 events, but to qualitatively explore the temporal changes in the topology of the best-fitting trees generated by a common set of parameters.
