<p>In order to link the model to the dengue viral surveys, we evaluated the historical conditions that could potentially give rise to simulated PCR22 event (see 
 <xref rid="sec017" ref-type="sec">results</xref> section). In order to determine how PCR22 events fit within the simulated epidemiological patterns we correlated the fit exponent 
 <italic>a</italic> and the average number of PCR22 events in years 11â€“20, using the model outputs described above. A strong correlation between 
 <italic>a</italic> and number of PCR22 events indicates that the latter are more likely to occur in historical conditions favoring larger outbreaks. The lack of correlation, by contrast, suggests that the occurrence of PCR22 events does not necessarily reflect long-term epidemiological patterns.
