<p>In this paper we synthesize field surveys with simulation experiments to investigate the drivers of dengue transmission in a pair of city-blocks. First, we use pilot surveys of dengue virus in children in order to obtain point estimates of dengue viral prevalence in 2-block patches, located in the historically highest transmission neighborhoods of 3 highly endemic Colombian cities. This field setting, ecologically very different from the rural villages of previous cluster studies, evidenced tremendous heterogeneity in the daily force of transmission. While a multitude of conditions may permit low levels of endemic transmission, in one patch we found in 22 of 23 children living in two adjacent blocks simultaneously positive for dengue serotype 2 (DEN2). In order to explore the historical conditions that allowed for such explosive transmission during an inter-epidemic period with presumably high levels of immunity, we then constructed an agent based model of the dengue system in the patch with the highest transmission. The model was parameterized with data from our longitudinal surveys of

The model’s daily time step and 20-year simulation period allowed us to integrate the timescales of transmission and those of human susceptible replenishment, thereby highlighting the interactions between human and vector ecology that drive dengue transmission in a group of neighboring houses. In particular, we focused on 4 ecological processes whose rates vary widely at small spatial scales (house, block, neighborhood) in typical dengue endemic cities: migration, long distance social contacts that may lead to viral introduction, birth rate and
