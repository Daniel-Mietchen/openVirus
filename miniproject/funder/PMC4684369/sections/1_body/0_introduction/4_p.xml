<p>Amplification of dengue virus is related to the multiple ecological processes affecting the vectorial capacity of

 <italic>aegypti</italic>, such as water infrastructure, housing density, vector control interventions, climate variation, etc. However, in areas with high vectorial capacity and a long history of dengue transmission, the potential for amplification events will be constrained if human susceptibility to an invading serotype cannot recover fast enough after prior epidemics[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The net rate of susceptible replenishment depends on two counter-acting forces: (1) the frequency of viral introduction and further depletion of susceptibility and (2) the entrance of new susceptible residents. Both of these are heavily influenced by human social processes and may vary at small spatial scales in endemic cities. For example, migrants from non-endemic rural areas often concentrate in particular areas and affect the spatial patterns of urban diseases [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Another example is the capacity of humans, through routine urban activities, to propagate dengue infection between isolated 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations within the city [

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Interactions between behavioral and demographic process determining net susceptible replenishment may therefore be important in driving heterogeneity in dengue dynamics.
