<p>Heterogeneous and stochastic infectious contact between 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and humans generates daily variation in the force of dengue transmission that theoretically drives the course of epidemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, previous work shows that because 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations emerge from only one or a few houses in a given area[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], some households receive a disproportionate amount of bites from 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> taking their first meal[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. When a member of these households becomes infectious, they can thus infect large numbers of mosquitoes, leading to &gt;80% of simulated secondary infections in a completely susceptible block[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such localized amplification of virus, if they did occur, would likely constitute an important mechanism of dengue persistence, as the opportunity to infect distant populations greatly increases when a large number of hosts are simultaneously infected [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Determining whether or not such intense amplification events actually occur is also of practical importance, because house-to-house surveys of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> pupal density are one of the most widely available means for entomological assessment of local dengue risk[
