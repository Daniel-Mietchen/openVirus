<p>We therefore need a better understanding of the drivers and dynamics of dengue transmission at daily timescales. Active virus in humans can be detected for roughly 5 days post-infection using a PCR assay[

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, since dengue in endemic areas is mainly an asymptomatic childhood infection[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], a direct estimate of the daily force of infection would require taking almost daily blood samples from healthy children in their homes. Previous studies have found clustering of dengue infections within a 100-200m radius, but at temporal scales of weeks to months[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The highest infection rate in a single cluster recorded in these studies comes from a rural village of Thailand, in which up to 65% of children in a 100m radius were found with evidence of recent dengue infection[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In this study, infection status was determined using a combination of serological and/or PCR methods, and summed over two sampling points 15 days apart [

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Antibodies associated with recent infection may linger for months post-infection and epidemiological evidence indicates that they provide cross-protection to other serotypes for years [

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, the available studies of house-level dengue transmission indicate that infection tends to cluster in neighboring houses, but they do not allow us to directly infer the intensity of transmission at daily timescales.
