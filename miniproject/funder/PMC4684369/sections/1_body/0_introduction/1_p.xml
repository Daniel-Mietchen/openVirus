<p>Dengue Fever (DF) is the most prevalent human arboviral disease and estimates of its global burden continue to grow [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. As a complex system, the macro-epidemiology of DF at city, regional and global scales derives from individual-level interactions between the virus’ two main hosts, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes and humans, which propagate the 4 serotypes of dengue virus. These are two host species whose activity patterns come together in the context of the domestic environment, which constitutes the main place of resting, feeding and development of both in urban areas. Studies overwhelmingly demonstrate that human dengue cases tend to reside in areas with transmission between residents and
