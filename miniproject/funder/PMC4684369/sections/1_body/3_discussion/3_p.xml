<p>Our ABM allowed us to address this question by integrating the timescales of epidemics (days, weeks) with the timescales of recovery of susceptibility at the patch level (years, decades). Overall, we found that social relationships exposing residents to 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> bites outside the patch determined both the density of susceptibles and the impact of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> pupal production on endemic transmission. While susceptible recruitment through net immigration of non-immune households and high birth rates increased the amplitude of local epidemics, these did not qualitatively influence the patterns of transmission because their affect was unidirectional. By contrast, external A. aegypti-exposing social relationships have multiple opposing effects due to the negative feedback created by susceptible depletion (

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and accordingly there was a strong increase in the frequency of PCR22 events when p
 <sub>esv</sub> was increased by an order of magnitude from 0.001 to 0.01. However, a further increase from 0.01 to 0.1 meant that over time there were too many susceptible individuals being exogenously immunized and thus the mosquitoes they infected did not bite enough susceptible hosts to generate epidemics. Simulated epidemics were unpredictable in both timing and magnitude, but clearly increased with the combination of many highly productive vessels and increased susceptible densities. This result underscores the importance of spatial aggregation in pupae as a driving force of heterogeneous host-vector mixing in dengue transmission and the need to account for this phenomenon in individual based models[
