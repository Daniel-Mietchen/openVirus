<p>Accordingly, we suggest that viral introduction rates in the PCR22 patch are unlikely to have resembled the sporadic pattern observed in our simulations at

 </sub> = 0.001, especially given the consistently high levels of DF reporting in the La Fachada neighborhood in the 10 years prior to our surveys. Low residence times and a high proportion of the population below 5 suggest the possibility of high rates of recruitment of non-immune individuals. However, our simulations indicate that if viral introduction occurs too frequently, non-immune immigration and birth rates must be unrealistically high to support the susceptible densities required to generate PCR22 events in simulation years 11–20. Another explanation is that prior DEN2 introductions did not generate sufficient amplification in local mosquito populations due to the stochastic and heterogeneous host-vector mixing. However, our model showed that initial epidemics (years 1–10) occurred in virtually all conditions simulated, except at very lowest levels of

Given these results we suggest that cross-protection from dengue serotypes 1, 3 and 4 played an important role in maintaining the DEN2 susceptible densities in the PCR22 patch. There is growing evidence that dengue serotypes generate multi-year cross-immunity, shaping both larger scale dynamics and leading to sero-epidemiological “memory” and serotype-specific heterogeneity in transmission at smaller spatial scales [

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We suggest that cross immunity induced by prior transmission of dengue serotypes 1, 3 or 4 lingered in the PCR22 patch during the last DEN2 epidemics. This cross-protection is likely to have subsequently waned, leaving DEN2 susceptible densities high enough to allow for explosive transmission.
