<p>Our simulations demonstrate the need to reflect on the constituent processes involved in the

 <sub>
  <italic>esv</italic>
 </sub> parameter and the reasons why these might vary at the level of 2-block patches. External social vector exposure represents the intersection between human space-time allocation and exposure to infectious 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in each activity space[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], both of which are strongly linked to different aspects of urban social behavior. One behavior in particular, visiting the homes of social contacts, has been linked to dengue propagation between relatively isolated

 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The probability of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> exposure in each visit will vary as a function of its duration[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and as such, familiar clustering of dengue epidemics is commonly observed[

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], as we did in the PCR22 patch. Species with central-placed activity patterns demonstrate a strong reliance on social activity in a central area close to home[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], as evidenced in the space-time allocation patterns of residents of dengue endemic neighborhoods in Peru [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Stronger local social relationships can play an important role in dengue epidemics at the neighborhood level [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], suggesting that patches with high levels of 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>esv</italic>
 </sub> are more likely to be embedded in neighborhoods with denser social networks among residents. Moreover, residents of lower income urban neighborhoods such as La Fachada are more likely to have stronger local social networks and greater preference for sharing local space [
