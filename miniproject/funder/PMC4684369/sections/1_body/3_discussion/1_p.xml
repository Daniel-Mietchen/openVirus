<p>Human social behavior and demography are known to influence the epidemiological patterns of dengue at scales of 100s to 1000s of meters and beyond, but their interactions with household level variation in host-vector contact are not well understood. Studies clearly demonstrate that dengue transmission occurs within and between neighboring houses [

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but also that immunity deriving from historical epidemiological patterns can drive local dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The urban block constitutes an important unit of dengue transmission because it is at this scale at which human demography and social relationships with the rest of the city intersect with three sources of heterogeneity [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] that determine the local potential for dengue transmission: differential exposure of residents and visitors to mosquito bites[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], aggregation across houses in the emergent vector population[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and finite densities of susceptible hosts[
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, because most dengue infections are sub-clinical, knowledge of the history of block-level transmission is very difficult to obtain. Our overarching aim was to develop a better understanding of the patterns and processes of dengue transmission in pairs of city blocks, located in some of the highest transmission neighborhoods of Colombia.
