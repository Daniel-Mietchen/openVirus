<p>In conclusion, we demonstrate the potential for intense and focalized outbreaks of dengue in highly endemic areas. Although this observation occurred in a pair of blocks with entomological and demographic conditions conducive to susceptible recruitment and viral amplification, our simulation model indicated that social relationships of residents beyond the 2-block area necessarily played a critical role in maintaining DEN2 susceptible densities. We suggest that highly dense social networks at the neighborhood scale can constrain dengue transmission in certain blocks by generating too much local viral introduction and preventing the growth of susceptible clusters. We recommend that future field studies focus on space-time correlations between rural immigration, birth rates and social behavior. All three of these traits constitute fundamental mechanisms of human adaptation in heterogeneous environments and may change in predictable ways in response to the changing socio-ecological conditions of dengue endemic cities [

Future models should also consider the possibility for interactions between social networks and cross-protection between serotypes, whereby the latter may alleviates the impact of highly connected social networks on depleting susceptibility.
