<p>What implications does this analysis of dengue transmission in 2 adjacent blocks have for dengue surveillance and control programs, which usually operate at the city or national level? One common detection-response action of dengue prevention programs is to apply vector control interventions (insecticides, larval habitat reduction) in the vicinity of dengue cases. We suggest that this is likely to be a fruitless activity during non-epidemic periods because clusters of cases are likely to be self-contained in pockets of susceptibility within areas where immunity pervades. Similarly, if city or nation-wide control programs use aggregate case numbers to evaluate early warning epidemic thresholds, this could be misleading if cases represent an intense, but geographically confined outbreak. Overall, our results dispute the existence of a direct causal relationship between the density of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and dengue risk in endemic cities, but support the targeting of long-term vector control programs in economically marginal neighborhoods. These represent areas where high rates of water storage, rural-to-urban migration and high fertility rates are likely to coincide.
