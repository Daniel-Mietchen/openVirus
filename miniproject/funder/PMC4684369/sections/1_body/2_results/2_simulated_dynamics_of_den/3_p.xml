<p>The histograms of outbreak size per viral introduction (
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>) further demonstrate the importance of social relationships with external areas in driving the general patterns of transmission. The tails of the distributions emerge at a frequency that varies inversely with 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>

 </sub>, suggesting that larger epidemics are proportionally more frequent in patches that are more socially isolated from surrounding areas. In other words where viral introductions are less frequent, they are more likely to generate explosive epidemics because of perpetually high susceptible densities (
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a,3d and 3g</xref>). By contrast, social behavior causing frequent viral introduction (
 <italic>p</italic>

 </sub> = 0.1) truncates the tail of the distribution as it approaches 100 infections. At 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>esv</italic>
 </sub> = 0.1 the constraints on susceptible density did not allow the emergence of the “fat tailed” [

 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>esv</italic>
 </sub> = 0.001 (large outbreaks more proportionally frequent than small/medium-sized outbreaks). Analysis of power law fits confirm that simulated PCR22 events occur more frequently under parameter scenarios conducive to outbreak size distributions with fatter tails (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref> for details). Unlike external social-vector contact, increased immigration of non-immune households had little effect on the overall shape of outbreak size distributions, despite increasing the frequency of larger outbreaks.
