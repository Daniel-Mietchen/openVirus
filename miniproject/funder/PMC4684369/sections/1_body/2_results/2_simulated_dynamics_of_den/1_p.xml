<p>In order to explore the potential drivers of such intense transmission in a highly endemic area, we carried out simulation experiments using 288 different combinations of external social-vector exposure, immigration, birth rate and vector production (250 replicates each). We isolated endemic dynamics by running each simulation for 10 years prior to analysis in order to ensure ample opportunity for dengue to invade the patch and generate a background level of immunity reflective of the social and ecological conditions of each parameter combination. Overall, we found that transmission intense enough to generate at least 22 residents simultaneously PCR positive during years 11â€“20 (PCR22 events) occurred in only about 1 out of every 6 trials (16.7%). Even in the parameter scenarios most conducive to explosive epidemics there was on average less than one PCR22 event per replicate.</p>
