<p>Overall transmission dynamics showed substantial stochastic variation in the appearance of outbreaks, particularly under conditions permitting susceptibility to build up between introductions (low-intermediate

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>), indicating variation in the timing and/or magnitude of initial epidemics during the first 10 years. At low

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, this allowed sufficient susceptible densities so as to maintain the potential for localized transmission of the intensity observed in La Fachada (
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2g</xref>). A qualitatively different transmission dynamic emerged when external social relationships generated constant viral introduction (

 </sub> = 0.1, 
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2c,2f and 2i</xref>). In this condition susceptible residents more frequently became infected in external areas, which combined with an increased frequency of infectious visitors, resulted more opportunity for autochthonous local transmission. This ultimately limited the possibility for explosive outbreaks, as susceptibility among residents remained persistently low during the 10 years. The role of susceptible density in limiting transmission at 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>esv</italic>
 </sub> = 0.1 is evidenced by the fact that moderately explosive outbreaks begin to stochastically emerge when immigration rates rose to 0.16 households/year (average of 1 non-immune family replacing a resident household every 6 years) (
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2i</xref>). Intermediate levels of external social vector contact (
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>esv</italic>
 </sub> = 0.01) generated a balance between sufficient viral introduction and sufficient time for susceptible populations to recover between introductions, increasing the frequency of explosive outbreaks over the course of the simulation (
