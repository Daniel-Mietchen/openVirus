Susceptible recruitment played an important role in PCR22 occurrence, with immigration of non-immune households having a much larger impact than fertility, due to the number of new susceptibles entering the simulation and their clustering in the same house. This is evidenced in the diminishing effects of increased fertility on PCR22 occurrence as immigration rates increased (
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). Nonetheless, both immigration and heightened birth rates both magnified the effects of vector production on PCR22 occurrence. Regression trees showed that these interactions between external social relationships, immigration of non-immune households and of the frequency of PCR22 events are specific to endemic dynamics, as PCR22 events during initial invasion (Years 1â€“10) occurred frequently under most experimental conditions (see
