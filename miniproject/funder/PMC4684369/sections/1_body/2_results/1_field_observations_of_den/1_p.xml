<p>Between August 2010 and April 2011 we searched for dengue virus in children living in 10 2-block patches containing the home of a dengue case (
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) located in six of the highest transmission neighborhoods of Colombia. All children testing positive must necessarily have become infectious within the 5â€“7 day window of detectable virus using the rtPCR assay [
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We found large variation in infectious rates among patches. In 8 of 10 patches less than 30% of children surveyed were PCR+, with no virus detected in 3 patches. In one patch (Ciudadela, Barranquilla), however, we found 9 of 16 children and in another (La Fachada, Armenia) 22 of 23 children with detectable virus (
 <xref rid="pone.0144451.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). No other clinical dengue cases were reported in the La Fachada neighborhood at the time of the survey. All PCR+ children in all patches were infected with serotype 2 (DEN2). Overall, parents/caretakers reported a recent fever in 11 of the total 55 PCR+ children, yielding an 80% asymptomatic rate. Socio-demographic and entomological variables recorded can be found in

 <xref rid="pone.0144451.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>), the shortest household residence time in the neighborhood (

However, given the stochastic nature of many processes involved in the transmission cycle, such as viral introduction, host-vector contact, mosquito survival and transmission, among others, we did not consider it possible to infer the drivers of variation by evaluating statistical predictors in only 10 patches. Nonetheless, our finding demonstrates the potential for highly intense and focalized dengue transmission.
