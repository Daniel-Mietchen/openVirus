<p>Considering the potential effects of different vaccine usage scenarios, under the baseline model, reactive vaccination (assuming two doses after the first 100 or 50 cases) was capable of producing important though relatively modest reductions in cases and deaths (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006807.g004">Fig 4</xref>, top row). These reductions were sensitive to the threshold number of cases before reactive vaccination was initiated: when the threshold was 100, reductions in mortality compared to no vaccination scenarios were unlikely to exceed 25% even assuming the vaccine was given without age or pregnancy restrictions; for a threshold of 50, mortality reductions of about 40% were plausible. In contrast, with no age-restriction on vaccine recipients and pre-emptive vaccination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006807.g004">Fig 4</xref>, bottom row), reductions in mortality of 100% were possible indicating that the herd immunity threshold had been reached. This was true whether two or three doses were administered, though in the former case uncertainty was far larger reflecting the lower precision in the estimated vaccine effectiveness of two doses (
