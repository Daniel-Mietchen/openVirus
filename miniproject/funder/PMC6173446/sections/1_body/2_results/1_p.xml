<p>The baseline model (Model 1a) gave good fits to the three epidemic curves, with the observed number of weekly cases usually within the 95% prediction intervals for observed cases (grey shaded region) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006807.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Under the baseline model the mean latent period was estimated to be 34 days, 95% CrI (29, 39) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006807.s006">S3 Appendix</xref>). Similar estimates were obtained in sensitivity analyses, though when the prior for the infectious period was based on a single patient with HEV genotype 1 (with 22 days post-onset shedding) the posteriors for the infectious period and camp-specific reproduction numbers gave more support to lower values than under baseline assumptions (Model 1b, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The effect of assuming prior immunity in the population was to slightly increase estimates of the proportion of infections which are reported (from 13% with no immunity to 18% if 30% of the population were initially immune) and to lead to higher estimates of basic reproduction numbers. These were inflated by about 50% if 30% of the population were assumed initially immune (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006807.s007">S1 Table</xref>). A shorter mean latent period (19 days (10, 34)) was inferred if alternative distributional assumptions were made about the latent period (Model 3, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The mean infectious period was estimated to be 36 days, 95% CrI (21, 64), in the baseline model, though this reduced to 27 days (21, 37) under different distributional assumptions (Model 4, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The estimated proportion of infections reported was 12.5% (11.4%, 13.6%) in the baseline model and similar in all sensitivity analyses. Under baseline assumptions the basic reproduction numbers were estimated to be similar in two of the three camps (Agoro 6.5 (4.5, 9.9); Paloga 8.5 (5.3, 11.4)), but smaller in Madi Opei (3.7 (2.8, 5.1)). Central estimates for these reproduction numbers were similar in most sensitivity analyses (
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), though higher in models that explicitly accounted for two modes of transmission (
