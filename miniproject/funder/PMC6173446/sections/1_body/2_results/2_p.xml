<p>Analysis of the data using models explicitly accounting for the water and sanitation intervention (Models 2a and 2b, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) did not provide evidence that these interventions were effective in reducing transmission. However, results were unable to rule out both substantial beneficial and harmful effects (WATSAN coefficients less than one and greater than one respectively), indicating that the data contained little information about the effects of the water and sanitation responses on transmission. This reflects the fact that in all three camps the interventions were not fully in place until the HEV epidemics were almost over (

Fitting the models accounting for a second mode of transmission corresponding to an unobserved environmental reservoir showed that the data were only consistent with the majority of transmission occurring via this route if mean persistence of viable virus in this environmental reservoir was two weeks or more (
