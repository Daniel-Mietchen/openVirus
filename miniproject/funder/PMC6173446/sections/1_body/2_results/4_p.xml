<p>The impact of excluding pregnant women from the population to vaccinate varied with scenario. In cases where vaccination had a high chance of achieving herd immunity (i.e. when vaccine was used pre-emptively without age restriction) excluding pregnant women had only a moderate negative impact on reductions in mortality. In contrast, when herd immunity was less likely to be obtained through vaccination (i.e. when the vaccine was used reactively or with age restrictions) excluding pregnant women led to substantially smaller reductions in total mortality (and much smaller reductions in mortality in pregnant women).</p>
