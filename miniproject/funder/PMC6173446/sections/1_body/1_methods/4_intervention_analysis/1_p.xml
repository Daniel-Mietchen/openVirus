<p>To evaluate the potential impact of vaccination we used estimates of vaccine effectiveness after two and three doses derived from data in Zhu et al [

The intervals between the first and second and the second and third doses were one and five months respectively. There was no evidence of any effect of a single dose of vaccine in the clinical trial, so this was excluded from the analysis. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assumed vaccine effectiveness did not vary by age. We assumed no loss of vaccine or infection derived immunity over the timescales considered, in accordance with findings of long-term follow-up studies which found consistent vaccine-induced protection over 4.5 years and a slow rate of decline of immunity derived from infections [
