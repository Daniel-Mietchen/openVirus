<p>Case fatality ratios amongst those pregnant and those not pregnant were derived from the meta-analysis of Rein et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We assumed a threshold of 50 or 100 reported cases as the starting point for reactive vaccination. Other assumptions are given in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Regardless of the threshold number of cases for initiating vaccination, a three dose vaccination strategy was considered incompatible with reactive vaccination because the third dose would have to be given close to the end of the epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006807.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We therefore only consider two dose reactive vaccination scenarios. A web application that uses the baseline model and allows for the simulation of the effects of different vaccination strategies (including three dose reactive vaccination) under user-specified assumptions is available at
