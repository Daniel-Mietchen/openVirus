<p>We fit a series of deterministic transmission models to the data. We assumed latent and infectious periods and the probability of infections being reported were common to all camps, as the demographics and provision of healthcare at the three camps was similar.We allowed transmissibility to vary by camp, as this might be expected to depend on local camp conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006807.g001">Fig 1</xref>). In our baseline model (Model 1) individuals were assumed to be in one of four possible states: susceptible to infection (S); latently-infected but not yet infectious (E); infectious (I); and recovered and immune (R). The rate at which susceptibles became infected was assumed to scale linearly with the number currently infectious. Information from previous studies was used to construct informative prior distributions (priors) for natural history parameters. These priors represent knowledge about disease progression parameters before fitting the model to the outbreak data. When combined with analysis of the data they give rise to posterior distributions, which represent what we know about the parameters after analysing the new data.
