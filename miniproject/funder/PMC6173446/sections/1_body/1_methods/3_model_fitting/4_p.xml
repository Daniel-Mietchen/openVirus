 </sub> and 
 <italic>π</italic>, the proportion of infections which are reported. In all cases parameters to be estimated included this proportion (

 <italic>β</italic>. Compared to the baseline model (Model 1), Models 2a and 2b estimated three additional parameter corresponding to the camp-specific estimates of the water and sanitation intervention effect on rates of transmission assuming stepwise effects associated with the intervention, and effects that scaled in proportion to the water sources per person respectively. This analysis was intended to evaluate the evidence that this intervention contributed to epidemic control.
