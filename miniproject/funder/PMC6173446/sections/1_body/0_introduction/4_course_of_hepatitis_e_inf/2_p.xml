<p>Transmission of HEV is widely thought to occur predominantly via the faecal-oral route, usually through contact with contaminated water; it might therefore be assumed that household person-to-person transmission is rare. However, a case-control study of 112 symptomatic cases and 145 controls in Paloga, Uganda found only two behavioural risks associated with symptomatic HEV infection (with adjusted odds ratios of 3 and 2 respectively): use of wide-mouthed water storage vessels and communal hand washing [

Based on these findings, and the presence of HEV RNA in hand-rinse samples (but not in any of the 15 drinking water samples collected), the authors concluded that water storage practices could have played an important role and that transmission was likely to have included household-level or person-to-person spread. A study during a large HEV outbreak in Madi Opei, Uganda reached a similar conclusion, and reported multiple lines of evidence to suggest that person-to-person household transmission of HEV contributed to the epidemic, and was unable to detect HEV in drinking water or zoonotic sources [
