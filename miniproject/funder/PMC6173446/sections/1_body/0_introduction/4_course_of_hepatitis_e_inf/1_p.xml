<p>Knowledge of the course of HEV infection is based mainly on two volunteer studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and three patient studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The two single volunteer studies (with known dates of exposure) gave incubation periods of 38 and 39 days respectively [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Clinical illness typically lasts 1–4 weeks [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Viral shedding in the stool begins about four to five weeks after infection and continues for up to four to five weeks [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The start of the infectious period appears to approximately coincide with the onset of the prodromal phase of disease (i.e. early non-specific symptoms) [
