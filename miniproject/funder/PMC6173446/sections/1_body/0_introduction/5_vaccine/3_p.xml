<p>To do this we fitted dynamic transmission models to data from three large HEV outbreaks in IDP camps. We used a Bayesian framework to combine data from previous studies with observed epidemic data to obtain an improved understanding of the natural history of HEV infection, quantify the transmission potential, and evaluate the potential for vaccination to reduce the number of clinical cases and associated mortality.</p>
