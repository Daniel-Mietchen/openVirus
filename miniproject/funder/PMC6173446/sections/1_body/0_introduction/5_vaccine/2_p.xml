<p>We aimed to quantify key epidemiological parameters for HEV in IDP camp settings and evaluate the potential benefits of vaccination. We consider both pre-emptive (prior to HEV cases occurring) and reactive vaccination (once HEV outbreaks are already underway), and evaluate the potential impact of selecting different target groups to receive the vaccine.</p>
