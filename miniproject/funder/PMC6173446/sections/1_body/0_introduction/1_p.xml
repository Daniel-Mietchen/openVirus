<p>Communicable diseases are responsible for large excess mortality and morbidity in complex emergencies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Epidemic Hepatitis E is a particular concern due to high mortality in pregnant women and lack of interventions of proven effectiveness in emergency settings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Hepatitis E is caused by a single-stranded RNA virus from the Hepeviridae family. There is one serotype but four genotypes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is enterically-transmitted and has caused large outbreaks in many regions including China, the Indian subcontinent, central Asia and East Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; globally, it is a leading cause of acute viral hepatitis and has been estimated to account for ~10,000 annual pregnancy-related deaths in southern Asia alone [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Genotypes 1 and 2 dominate in Africa and most of Asia and are found only in humans; they have been estimated to cause over 20 million infections annually in these regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recently, large outbreaks associated with high mortality have occurred in internally-displaced persons (IDP) camps in Sudan, Uganda and South Sudan [
