<p>Our work sheds light on other important aspects of HEV epidemiology: we found consistent evidence that the mean latent period is between about 20 and 40 days and that a little over 10% of individuals infected with HEV are identified as cases. The data were less informative about the mean infectious period, though were consistent with the range 20â€“70 days suggested by previous data.</p>
