<p>Our results indicate that in displaced population settings HEV can be highly transmissible. In one camp (Paloga) the estimated mean number of secondary cases per primary case at the start of the epidemic (the basic reproduction number, R
 <sub>0</sub>,) exceeded 6.5 under all model assumptions. This number has important implications for vaccination policies. To achieve herd immunity requires successful immunization of a percentage of individuals given by 100-100/ R
 <sub>0</sub> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, even taking the optimistic R
 <sub>0</sub> value of 6.5, we would require 85% of the population to be effectively immunized to achieve herd immunity. Herd immunity is desirable as it means a major epidemic will not be possible even though many in the population remain susceptible to infection. It is of particular relevance here because HEV-infected pregnant women face a greatly increased risk of mortality but the safety and efficacy of the vaccine in pregnant women remains to be established.
