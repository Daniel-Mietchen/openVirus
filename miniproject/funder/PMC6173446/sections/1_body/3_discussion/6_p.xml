<p>Strengths of our work include the use of high quality epidemic data, extensive sensitivity analysis, and an analysis that allows us to incorporate information from previous HEV investigations. This work also has important limitations. First, estimates of HEV vaccine effectiveness from a trial in China may not generalise to a typical emergency setting or to age/ethnic groups not included in the trial. Moreover, the model assumes that when an individual is vaccinated they have an all-or-nothing response: either full protection against disease and ability to transmit infection or no protection. In practice, components of vaccine protection may be more complex [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Second, our analysis neglects age, spatial and household structuring, behavioural, biological and temporal heterogeneities that might affect HEV transmission. These may all play important roles in HEV epidemiology in emergency settings but we lacked data of sufficient resolution to meaningfully incorporate them. Delineating such factors is an important area for future work. There is some evidence that disease severity is affected by age [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. By analogy with other viral infections, we might anticipate that transmissibility, infectious period and vaccine effectiveness also vary be age. Such differences could have an important influence on the relative effectiveness of different vaccination policies. Understanding such age effects, and incorporating them into models should be considered a priority. We assumed no prior immunity though lacked pre-epidemic sera to enable us to assess this assumption. If some people were immune prior to the epidemic, we are likely to have underestimated the basic reproduction numbers. Third, lacking any data on the efficacy of a single vaccine dose, we assumed it conferred no protective effect. This is a conservative assumption and may mean that we have underestimated the potential vaccine benefits. Given the logistical challenges of delivering three doses over a six month period, future research to better quantify the value of one and two doses of vaccine and perhaps a reduced interval between doses 2 and 3 would be valuable. Finally, it is not clear how relevant the modelling framework used here will be for community outbreaks where HEV is already endemic, such as the recent urban outbreak in Chad [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]; further work is needed to evaluate the potential impact of hepatitis E vaccination in different contexts.
