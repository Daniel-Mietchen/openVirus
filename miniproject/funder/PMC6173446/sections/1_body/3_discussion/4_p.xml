<p>Previous epidemiological investigations had suggested that household-level person-to-person spread may have been important in this epidemic [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Our results show that the epidemic curves in all three camps can be reproduced without positing the existence of a saturating environmental reservoir, and models with such a reservoir did not improve fits to data. In fact, models 1 and 4 had substantially lower DICs than more complex models (including those explicitly accounting for an environmental reservoir) suggesting that these simpler models should be preferred in the absence of strong evidence that a saturating environmental reservoir played a role in this epidemic. We found no evidence that the water and sanitation interventions reduced transmission, though these interventions were introduced late and the data provide little evidence for or against their effectiveness. Previous modelling has shown that such interventions have the potential to be highly effective if assumed to be capable of interrupting the dominant mode of transmission [

More recently, a matched case control study of HEV infection in a 2014 outbreak in a predominantly rural-nomadic population in Napak District, Uganda found that eating roadside food, drinking untreated water, and not always cleaning utensils were strongly associated with risk of HEV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These findings are consistent with fecal oral transmission being the dominant mode of spread, and suggest that both contaminated drinking water and household transmission might play important roles. While our analysis does not allow us to quantify the relative importance of different transmission routes, the results do suggest that if an environmental reservoir was important for transmission in this epidemic the current number of infectious people was a good proxy for the infection pressure from the environment.
