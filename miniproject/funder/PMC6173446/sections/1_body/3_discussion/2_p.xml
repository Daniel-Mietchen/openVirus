<p>Even when restricting vaccine use to non-pregnant 16â€“65 year olds (for which the vaccine is licenced in China), the benefits could be substantial, with reductions in mortality of over 40% likely under baseline assumptions given pre-emptive vaccination with three doses. A robust finding was that pre-emptive vaccination was much more effective at preventing HEV cases and deaths than reactive vaccination. Estimates of reductions in mortality were based on the case fatality estimates taken from the meta-analysis of HEV genotypes 1 and 2 outbreaks by Rein et al [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Evaluation of the potential benefits of HEV vaccination in an emergency setting should take into account the best estimates of local mortality rates.
