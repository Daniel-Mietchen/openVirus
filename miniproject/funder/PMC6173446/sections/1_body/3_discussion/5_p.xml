<p>Given the uncertainties about transmission routes and fundamental methodological challenges in making inferences about an unobserved environmental reservoir [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006807.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we performed extensive sensitivity analyses. While this did not make it possible to quantify the relative importance of different transmission routes it did shed light on the circumstances where a saturating reservoir would be consistent with the observed epidemic data. A key finding is that if the mean persistence of viable virus in the environment was seven days or fewer, the saturating environmental reservoir was estimated to play only a minor role in the epidemic. If mean persistence was two weeks or more, however, the data were compatible with such an environmental reservoir representing the dominant mode of transmission.
