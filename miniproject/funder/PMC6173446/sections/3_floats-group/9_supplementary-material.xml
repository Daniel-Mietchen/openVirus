  <title>Prior and posterior distributions for the percentage of transmission occurring by exposure to a saturating environmental compartment under model 6 (SEIRW).</title>
  <p>Priors p1 to p5 correspond to varying the initial percentage of transmission occurring via this environmental route between mean values of 5% and 95% when the population is fully susceptible. Priors w1 to w5 correspond to varying the persistence of viable virus in this environmental reservoir, with mean durations ranging from two days to eight weeks. Prior and posterior distributions shown correspond to the proportion of transmission that occurs via this environmental route in completed epidemics at Agoro (note that the priors shown differ from the priors of the initial percentage of transmission via the environmental, because saturation of the environmental reservoir will tend to decrease the relative importance of this route per case over time).</p>
