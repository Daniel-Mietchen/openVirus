  <title>Flow diagrams for the models considered in the analysis.</title>
  <p>Model compartments are indicated by boxed letters and transitions between compartments are shown by solid lines. Broken lines indicate how variables affect transition rates. In our baseline model (Model 1) individuals were assumed to be in one for four possible states: susceptible to infection (S); latently infected but not yet infectious (E); infectious (I); and recovered and immune (R). Extensions of this model are made to: i) allow for rates of patient-to-patient transmission to be affected by the water and sanitation intervention, specified by external data giving either the presence/absence of the intervention at each time point or water sources (taps) per person (Model 2, 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006807.s001">S1 Fig</xref>); ii) to allow for different implicit distributions for time periods in latent and infectious compartments (Models 3â€“5, where in model 5 we allow for different rates of transmission from patients in early and late infectious compartments, I
   <sub>1</sub> and I
   <sub>2</sub>); iii) to allow for the existence of a saturating environmental reservoir (Model 6). Extending these models to account for vaccination would correspond to adding a new solid arrow from the 
   <italic>S</italic> to the 
   <italic>R</italic> compartment in each of the models (vaccination is assumed to have no impact on those already infected).
