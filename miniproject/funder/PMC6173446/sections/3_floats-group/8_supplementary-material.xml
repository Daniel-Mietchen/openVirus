  <title>Water and sanitation data.</title>
  <p>The figure shows the number of water sources (taps) per person in each camp and the timing of the water and sanitation intervention relative to the epidemic curves. The top row shows the water sources per person from the three camps by week number (from January 2007). Absence of a black line segment indicates lack of data; the red dashed line corresponds to minimal Sphere recommendations of no more than 250 people per tap assuming a flow of 7.5 litres per minute (

The broken green line shows the start time of the water and sanitation intervention in the three camps. The bottom row shows the number of Hepatitis E cases reported in the three camps over the same period. For periods prior to the collection of data we assumed that the number of water sources per person was constant and equal to the first observed value in the same camp. Similarly, for periods after collection of water and sanitation data, we assumed that the number of water sources per person was equal to the most recent recorded value in each camp.
