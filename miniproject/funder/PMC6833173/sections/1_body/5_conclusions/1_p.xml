<p id="Par24">The incidence of occupational exposure of pediatric health care workers in Chinese hospitals is high and the risk factors are complex and diverse. Most pediatric health care workers suffer from physical and mental injuries resulting from the conditions in which they work and live. Their work nature, professional title, education level, satisfaction with the working environment, evaluation of doctor-patient relationship, and self-protection awareness are all risk factors for occupational exposure. The government, hospitals, medical colleges, and medical personnel must actively pay attention to this problem and take effective measures to reduce the incidence of occupational exposure for pediatric health care workers to protect their physical and mental health.</p>
