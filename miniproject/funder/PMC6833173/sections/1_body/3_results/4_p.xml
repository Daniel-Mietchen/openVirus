<p id="Par16">Through binary logistic regression analysis, we found that physicians (OR = 0.320, 95% CI = 0.241, 0.426) and medical technicians (OR = 0.331, 95% CI = 0.170, 0.645) were less likely than nurses to experience occupational exposure. Meanwhile, the risk of occupational exposure for pediatric health care workers with intermediate (OR = 1.726, 95% CI = 1.082, 2.753) and senior (OR = 2.139, 95% CI = 1.171, 3.905) professional titles was much higher than that of unrated pediatricians. The risk of occupational exposure for pediatric health care workers who were generally satisfied (OR = 1.885, 95% CI = 1.521, 2.336) or unsatisfied (OR = 1.766, 95% CI = 1.287, 2.423) with their occupational environment was 1.766 times higher than that of pediatric health care workers who were satisfied with their occupational environment.
