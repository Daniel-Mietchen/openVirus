<p id="Par8">Compared with developed countries, there are some gap between Chinese health care workers in terms of working conditions, environment and facilities, and compliance with protective guidelines. Liu Xiaona et al. conducted a survey of health care workers in Beijing and found that only 46.8% of respondents had a strong understanding of occupational exposure guidelines, with only 43.6% of respondents feeling as if they had received relevant training [

Similarly, Zhang Min et al. surveyed health care workers in a general hospital in China and found that less than half (47%) wore gloves while performing surgery on patients, and, moreover, that the respondents demonstrated a poor understanding of source disease transmission and general preventive measures [
