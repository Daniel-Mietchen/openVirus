 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; their health is seriously threatened, which is a topic that has been of global concern [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. According to the World Health Organization, 40% of hepatitis B and C viral infections and 2.5% of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections originate from occupational exposure, such that medical personnel are 2–19 times more likely to acquire infectious diseases due to occupational exposure than other social groups [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A survey conducted by Frijstein between 2003 and 2010 reports that 1601 people experienced occupational exposure during this period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. During the 2013–2016 Ebola virus outbreak, over 890 health care workers were infected with a fatality rate of 57% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Ayalu et al. found that health care workers in Ethiopia had a relatively high risk of needlestick injuries (30.5%) and sharp injuries (25.7%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Meanwhile, a survey at a university teaching hospital in mainland China uncovered that 64% of the hospital’s health care workers had experienced needle and sharp injuries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Occupational exposure negatively impacts the mental health of health care workers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and the fear, despair, and other disabling emotions it yields in them can worsen their quality of work, potentially cultivating more negative emotions among colleagues and patients. Furthermore, hospital infections caused by occupational exposure will result in unnecessary waste in terms of the economy and resources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which will further result in immeasurable health and social problems [
