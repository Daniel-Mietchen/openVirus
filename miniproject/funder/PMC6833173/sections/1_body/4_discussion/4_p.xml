<p id="Par20">One interesting finding was that workers with a professional title were more likely to experience occupational exposure than non-professional workers, and those with higher education were more likely to experience occupational exposure than those with less education. This is not consistent with the findings of Afia Zafar [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], but is consistent with those of Yoneo and Au [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Yoneo believes that health care workers with professional title is more likely to diagnose and treat relatively complex conditions and perform more operations, so they are more likely to have occupational exposure. As far as pediatric paramedics in public hospitals in China, most childhood diseases are urgent and change rapidly. As a result, these pediatric health care workers have more demands in terms of treatment and nursing. They have rich experience and more knowledge and highly educated health care workers are more likely to take on more tasks during the diagnosis and treatment process and to meet more patients. The accordingly intense workload and working hours these workers endure increase their risk of occupational exposure. The state should fundamentally resolve the shortage of pediatric health care workers in Chinese hospitals and optimize the training system of pediatric health care workers, gradually improve the technical level of pediatric health care workers, and build a sufficient number of skilled pediatric health care workers, so as to alleviate the personal work pressure of pediatric health care workers and reduce the risk of occupational exposure.
