<p id="Par21">The satisfaction of pediatric health care workers with their occupational environment in Chinese hospitals is also an important risk factor for occupational exposure. Pediatric health care workers who are satisfied with their occupational environment have a lower risk of occupational exposure than those who are not satisfied with their occupational environment. This is consistent with the results of Mohammad et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] The occupational environment of health care workers has a directly or indirectly influence on their physical and mental health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. and thereby affects their attitude and quality of work. Crowded and noisy diagnostic environments can cause bad moods and irritability, which leads to inadequate concentration of energy in daily diagnostic and therapeutic activities, work errors, and the risk of occupational exposure. In turn, occupational exposure will have a negative impact on the work, life, and physical and mental health of health care workers, increase their dissatisfaction with the occupational environment, and form a vicious circle. In response, hospitals and governments should increase their investments in manpower as well as material and financial resources to improve the occupational environment of health care workers in children’s hospitals and create a relaxed and harmonious working atmosphere, ultimately amplifying the satisfaction of pediatric health care workers with their occupational environments and reducing the occurrence of occupational exposure for pediatric health care workers.
