<p id="Par19">This study also found that physicians and medical technicians had a lower risk of occupational exposure than nursing staff, at 0.320 times and 0.331 times the risk of nursing staff. This is consistent with the results of previous studies [

As front-line clinical staff, compared with physicians and medical technicians, nurses have the most contact with patients and family members; more opportunities to come in contact with sharp instruments, bodily fluids, and blood; and more onerous tasks, and no time to handle it better [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Irregular lifestyles, heavy workload, severe psychological stress, and lack of understanding and respect from family members of children often make nurses anxious, tired, and unable to concentrate [

Pediatric health care workers should pay attention to strengthening personal protection, diagnosing and treating patients strictly in line with standard medical practices, implementing standard preventive measures, and continuously improving their own knowledge and awareness of how to best protect themselves. The hospital should rationally allocate existing human resources, reduce the work pressure of pediatric health care workers, and provide adequate protective equipment to medical personnel to reduce the risk of occupational exposure for pediatric health care workers. This study also found that years of work were not related to occupational exposure, which is consistent with the study by Ani et al. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and others. Most people believe that occupational exposure of health care workers is related to their work experience.
