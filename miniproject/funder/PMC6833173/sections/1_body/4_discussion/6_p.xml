<p id="Par22">This study also showed that pediatric health care workers with strong self-protection awareness had a lower risk of occupational exposure. This is consistent with the findings of Jankovic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Health care workers with strong self-protection awareness will pay more attention to their diagnosis and treatment operations in daily medical activities, strictly abide by the routine of diagnosis and treatment, and have higher vigilance for occupational exposure, so the risk of occupational exposure is lower. Research shows that occupational safety education for health care workers is an effective way to reduce occupational exposure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Accordingly, Hospitals should strengthen training in occupational protection for medical and health personnel [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and medical schools should optimize clinical occupational protection education [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] to ensure that health care workers gain systematic and comprehensive knowledge of occupational exposure to improve their sense of occupational protection, standardize their diagnosis and treatment operations, and reduce the occurrence of occupational exposure.
