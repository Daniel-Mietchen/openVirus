<p id="Par18">The results of this study showed that pediatric health care workers experienced accidental hazards, physical hazards, chemical hazards, biological hazards, and physical and mental hazards in the working environments at rates of 13.8, 31, 24.1, 30.3, and 62.6%, respectively. Among the five types of occupational exposure, pediatric health care workers suffered the most physical and mental injuries in the working environment. Analyzing the reasons, the nature of pediatric work is different from that of adult departments. Pediatric health care workers are mostly faced with children who cannot fully express their situation. Most patients are the only children in their families, their parents often care so deeply for them that, if the treatment is expected to be inconsistent with what they think, it may be violent to the health care workers [

This is also consistent with the risk factors of occupational exposure found in this study. The results of this study showed that the risk of occupational exposure is higher among pediatric health care workers in a tense doctor-patient relationship in China. Today, doctor-patient relationships in China are rather tense, and the incidence of medical disputes and hospital violence is higher than that in developed countries such as those in Europe and North America [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. According to incomplete statistics, the media reported a total of 7 incidents of serious violence in pediatric or children’s hospitals between January 2015 and July 2016; this total is second only to the number of incidents of violence in emergency medicine in general hospitals in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Tense doctor-patient relationships have a tremendously negative impact on the work of health care workers. Relevant research shows that to adapt to and deal with tense doctor-patient relationships, pediatric health care workers must concentrate on this matter,this continuous adaptation process will greatly increase their stress, and lead to low morale and job satisfaction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. When pediatric health care workers perform diagnosis and treatment in a state of high pressure and low satisfaction, their attention will inevitably be dispersed, making occupational exposure more likely. To reduce the risk of physical and mental harm to pediatric health care workers, the government should devote time, resources, and energy to eradicating tension and amplifying trust in the doctor-patient relationship, enhancing workers’ senses of security, and providing a good environment for pediatric health care workers. Moreover, individual pediatric health care workers should continue to improve their doctor-patient communication skills to prevent occupational exposure and consequent damage to their physical and mental health. The hospital should also pay active attention to changes in the psychological situation of medical personnel after exposure and provide timely psychological support and intervention to protect the physical and mental health of medical personnel.
