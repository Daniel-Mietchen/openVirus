<p id="Par17">The results make clear that pediatric health care workers in Chinese public hospitals experience a very high rate of occupational exposure (93.0%), especially when compared to the occupational exposure rates of health care workers in the Netherlands, Serbia, and other countries [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] as well as that of health care workers in Chinaâ€™s general hospitals (82.1, 64%) surveyed by previous studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], this shortage of human resources increases the personal workload of each and every pediatric health care worker, causing high-intensity diagnosis and treatment work, and has put tremendous work pressure on pediatric health care workers. Together, high-intensity workloads and tremendous work stress have created high levels of occupational exposure for these workers. In addition, this study assessed occupational environmental hazard of pediatric health care workers, which may help explain the high incidence of occupational exposure in this study compared to previous research.
