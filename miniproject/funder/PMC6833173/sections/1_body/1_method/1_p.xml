<p id="Par10">Between July 10 and October 10, 2018, a cross-sectional study was conducted among pediatric health care workers from 43 hospitals in eastern China (Beijing, Shandong, Zhejiang, and Guangdong), central China (Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, and Shanxi), and western China (Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, Chongqing, Guizhou, Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang) by convenience sampling. An anonymous survey was conducted through online questionnaires. We sent Web links to online questionnaires to participants via their mobile phones which respondents completed in their spare time. This type of survey method not only enabled us to monitor data collection in real time but also to effectively manage the data. In previous studies, researchers have used this survey method to complete relevant research [

This study obtained permission from relevant departments, hospital managers, and participants and the survey was completed with the help of Quality, Safety, Health, and Environmental Protection (QSHE) and the Management Specialty Committee Hospital Occupational Health Management Group of the China Research Hospital Association. Six tertiary hospitals and four county hospitals in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, were selected as pre-survey units. A total of 130 questionnaires were distributed and 112 valid questionnaires were collected (these data were excluded from the formal survey). A total of 2316 pediatric health care workers participated in the formal survey and 1932 returned valid questionnaires, yielding an effective response rate of 83.42% (incomplete questionnaires, those with obvious errors, and those with a completion time &lt; 5 min were marked invalid). The inclusion criteria of this study were as follows: (1) physician, nurses, and medical technicians working in the hospital; (2) more than 1 year of experience; and (3) voluntary participation. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) pediatric health care workers who were unwilling to participate in the investigation and (2) refresher pediatric health care workers and interns.
