<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g008">Fig. 8</xref> we show the biologically feasible case where RSV is competitively superior to influenza (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>01</sub> and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>02</sub> are the reproduction numbers for influenza and RSV respectively) and in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g009">Fig. 9</xref> the same competitive dominance is illustrated but assuming that secondary infections occur as if the hosts had never been infected before, that is, 
 <italic>σ</italic> = 1. The pattern in both figures is similar but that shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g009">Fig. 9</xref> is much more regular. A decrease in 
 <italic>σ</italic>, meaning a decrease in the contact rate for the secondary infection, provides a more irregular pattern both in the periodicity and the amplitude of the epidemic outbreaks in agreement with the recorded data. Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.t005" ref-type="table">5</xref> constitute the main support for RSV being the superior competitor. The magnitude of the estimated reproduction numbers have larger variability than those of influenza and the Tables show some evidence, however, week that years with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for RSV high are associated with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for influenza low. However, scarcity of data does not permit a conclusive statement. We will address this observation elsewhere.
