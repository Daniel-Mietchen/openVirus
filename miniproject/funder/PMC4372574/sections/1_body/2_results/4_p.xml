<p>Before closing this section we present a last result that illustrates the qualities of the methodology used here to estimate parameters. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g010">Fig. 10</xref> we compare the dynamics of the observed outbreaks and the one coming out from numerical simulations of our model. Since in simulations we follow proportions and start our epidemics at arbitrary initial times and initial populations, we have shifted and rescaled the output from our model so the comparison has a better visual set up. We are not attempting to predict epidemic outbreaks but to explain the observed patterns. Note that not only the frequency of outbreaks is reproduced but also some qualitative features. For example, influenza epidemics have less amplitude and show interepidemic periods with zero or very low case numbers whereas RSV epidemics are broader and show and endemic phase between outbreaks. In

On the contrary the model predictions are relatively insensitive to changes in the duration of the immunity for the first virus.
