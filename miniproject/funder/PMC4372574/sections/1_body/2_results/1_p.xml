 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] have pointed out, virulence and superinfection play an essential role on the evolution of pathogens. Host demography has a very significant role on the long-term interaction of hosts and pathogens and it is a key mechanism in the study of the evolution of virulence. In the present situation, climatic variability impacts host availability and demography towards colonization by either of influenza virus or RSV. Given the size of the reproduction numbers that we have (that of RSV being larger than that of influenza), a very plausible explanation for the coexistence of both viruses in the system of reference is that RSV superinfects influenza allowing it to survive. The other case, influenza superinfecting RSV would result in the extinction of the inferior competitor ending up with a system with RSV epidemics only.
