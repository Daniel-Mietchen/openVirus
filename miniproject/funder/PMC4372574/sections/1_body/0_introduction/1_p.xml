<p>Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are leading etiologic agents of acute respiratory infections (ARI). These viruses are associated to significant morbidity, mortality and school/work absenteeism during winter season [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Every year, influenza infects approximately 20% of children and 5% of adults [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], while RSV infects almost all the children during the first three years of life; re-infections by these viruses are very common during early childhood [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In addition, RSV is currently recognized as an important pathogen for all age groups, including the elderly [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In temperate climates influenza and RSV occur as annual epidemics during the winter season. Each year the magnitude and timing of ARI epidemics varies. In several regions of the world a biennial RSV circulation pattern has been reported, with alternating short and long inter-epidemic periods [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We have previously reported that RSV and influenza exhibit an alternating pattern in San Luis Potosí (SLP) [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Variations in these epidemiological patterns could be the result of the presence of more than one circulating respiratory virus or more than one circulating influenza strain at the same time [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; in addition, climatic variability is a driving force and host availability is a limiting resource, whose role must be explored as they affect the observed epidemic patterns for both influenza and RSV. Previous work has shown that viral interference may affect the spread of influenza. In Sweden, a rhinovirus epidemic that occurred after the end of the summer holidays may have interfered with the spread of pandemic influenza [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Also, epidemiological studies have suggested that interference between RSV and influenza may occur; several reports have described the interruption of RSV circulation by influenza epidemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nishimura et al. found that interference between RSV and influenza did not affect the clinical severity of the RSV epidemic [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In vitro studies have shown that previous influenza infection results in a reduction in RSV replication [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In a mouse model, influenza infection prior to RSV infection resulted in a reduction in recruitment of inflammatory cells and cytokine secretion, as well as protection against clinical symptoms associated to the infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The objective of this paper is to explain through an ecological hypothesis of competitive interaction between both viral populations and niche (host) availability, the alternating patterns of RSV and influenza observed in the data using a mathematical model as a methodological tool.
