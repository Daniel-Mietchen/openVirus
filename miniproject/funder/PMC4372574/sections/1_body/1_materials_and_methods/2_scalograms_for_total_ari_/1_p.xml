<p>There are several factors that influence the ARI dynamics like environmental and climate factors, host-pathogen interactions and immunological factors. Influenza and RSV data show nonstationarity, oscillations and seasonality, features that imply that wavelet analysis may be efficient to identify patterns driven by the annual weather cycle. Unlike Fourier analysis wavelet analysis is able to analyse signals with changing spectra allowing the estimation of the spectral characteristics as a function of time [
