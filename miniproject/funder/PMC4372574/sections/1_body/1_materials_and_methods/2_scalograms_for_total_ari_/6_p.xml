<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g003">Fig. 3C</xref> the ARIs annual 52 week period is easily observed which dominates all other frequencies. Looking at lower periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), another weaker periodic cycle between 16 and 32 weeks (average of 6 months) can be seen across all weeks. Apart from this two periodic epidemic events (yearly and roughly 6-month cycles), there are activity periods of lengths smaller that 8 weeks occurring not very regularly along the years. There are very noticeable epidemic outbreaks at the end of 2003, beginning of 2005, beginning of 2007 and a very strong signal in the first quarter of 2009. One should also notice the high power signal that appears from mid 2007 to mid 2008 in the periods between 16 and 32 weeks.
