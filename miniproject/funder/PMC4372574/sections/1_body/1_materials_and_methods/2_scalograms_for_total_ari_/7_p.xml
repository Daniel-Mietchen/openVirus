<p>The data base allows independent analysis of RSV and influenza epidemics. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g004">Fig. 4</xref> shows this comparison for the periods between 4 and 32 weeks. It is evident that influenza epidemic events are more sparse that RSV epidemics probably due to the lower incidence of influenza in children. From 2003–2009 only four influenza epidemic events show in the scalogram (end of 2003, end of 2005, end 2007 and most of 2009, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g004">Fig. 4C</xref>); however, RSV epidemics events occur roughly every 6 months with some years showing two epidemics (2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Moreover, the influenza epidemic events are relatively sharp and occur every two years (vertical fingers in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g004">Fig. 4C</xref>) as compared to the more variable event strength in RSV epidemics (multiple fuzzy, “broken” fingers in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g004">Fig. 4D</xref>) that occur every year.
