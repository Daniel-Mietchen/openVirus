<p>Also note (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g004">Fig. 4</xref>) that at weeks 150 and 250 there are two influenza epidemic outbreaks and that between them there is almost no influenza activity; however, RSV activity does occur between weeks 150 and 250. Thus at periods below 32 weeks, RSV and influenza epidemic events alternate.
