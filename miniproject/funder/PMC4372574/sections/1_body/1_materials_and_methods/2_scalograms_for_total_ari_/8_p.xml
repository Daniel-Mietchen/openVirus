<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g005">Fig. 5</xref> scalograms for higher scales are presented (8 to 64 weeks). Here an interesting observation can be made: RSV signal power occurs between high power peaks in influenza. Both signals show a strong annual periodic signal across all weeks being stronger for RSV than for influenza. A lower power cycle in the scale between 16 and 32 weeks also occurs (see the continuous orange band across all weeks). This implies that the high power signal shown in dark red in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g003">Fig. 3C</xref>) is mainly driven by RSV. Thus RSV could be thought of as an endemic, competitively dominant virus in the San Luis population; and influenza a competitively inferior one that survives at low frequencies with significant epidemic events occurring roughly every 2 years.
