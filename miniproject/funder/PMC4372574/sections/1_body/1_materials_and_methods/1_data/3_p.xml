<p>The Hospital Central “Dr. Ignacio Morones Prieto” operates as a pediatric sentinel detection center of influenza and RSV. Due to the patients age there might be a potential sampling bias (RSV detection will be higher than influenza detections), but despite that, detection records are very useful to determine the period of circulation of both viruses and can be extrapolated to all the population. First, since the Hospital Central “Dr. Ignacio Morones Prieto” is the most important hospital integrating reports in the State of San Luis Potosí, the respiratory viruses detected due to the pediatric surveillance viral respiratory program are representative of what happens (in terms of viral circulation) throughout the all state. Second, although the majority of the viruses are detected in children under the age of 5 (that includes hospitalized and ambulatory patients), the circulation patterns of the viruses correlates in time with the seasonal pattern of acute respiratory infections outbreaks that occurs throughout the state and for all groups of age (is noteworthy that the majority of the ARI registers happen in ambulatory patients). Previously we have observed that when RSV predominates the number influenza detections is low and vice versa; despite our sampling bias, when influenza circulates in the population it is detected among all age groups [

 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reported that the beginning of an RSV outbreak (that affect other group ages) start in children under 5 years of age. Those results are indicative that the presence of RSV in infants could be and is in fact an indicator of RSV circulation in other age groups. Regarding the alternating influenza/RSV outbreaks patterns in older populations, there is a notable lack of information in the literature. A few studies from Douglas M. Fleming in UK have shown the same alternating pattern of influenza/RSV or pneumonia/bronchitis (the first infection was attributable to Influenza and the second to RSV) in elderly population [
