<p>The objective of this section is compute two main parameters for our model: a) the reproduction number and b) the forcing function associated to climate variability. Once the estimate of each reproduction number is obtained, we get the average value for 
 <italic>Î²</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>k</italic>
 </sub> for each virus and this value is then plugged into the model to generate our simulations. As it is well known, the reproduction number, denoted by 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, is the expected number of secondary cases produced in a susceptible population by a typical infective individual during the time in which s/he is infectious. If 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1, then on average an infected individual produces less than one new infected individual over the course of its infectious period and the infection cannot grow. Conversely if 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1 then each infected individual produces, on average more than one new infection and the disease can invade the population. From its definition 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is determined from early stages of the epidemic. The information that is most commonly used to estimate 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> are reported cases and sero-prevalence data 
 <italic>i.e.</italic> data on hosts who have antibodies against the pathogen. On the other hand, the replacement number [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] is defined as the expected number of secondary infections that one infected person would produce through the entire duration of the infectious period where the population need not be fully susceptible,
