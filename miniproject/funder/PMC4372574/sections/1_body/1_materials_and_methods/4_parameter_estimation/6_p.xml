<p>To complement these calculations we use the exponential growth rate method (EG) of the Package

During the early phase of an outbreak the exponential growth rate is defined by the per capita change in number of new cases per unit of time, as incidence data are integer valued, the EG method uses a Poisson regression to estimate this parameter rather than linear regression of the logged incidence [
