<p>Superinfection is a long standing hypothesis that explains the coexistence of species in a given common environment [

 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the absence of superinfection, a measure of the competitive ability of the most virulent strain, competitive exclusion of the weaker strain is the generic outcome [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Levin and Pimentel [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] were the first to show that the inclusion of superinfection makes coexistence possible. Superinfection establishes a competitive hierarchy driven by the abilities of each species to use common resources. Moreover, it is known that heterogeneities in hosts characteristics, in this case driven by climate variability and temporal immunity, are important factors for the coexistence of species [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Below we present a simple model for the interaction of RSV and influenza viruses based upon superinfection as a mechanisms to explain the patterns described in the previous section.
