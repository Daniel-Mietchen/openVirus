<p>The model is a SEIRS epidemic model coupled through superinfection. RSV has reported a slightly higher

 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> = 1.6 and 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>r</italic>
 </sub> = 1.7 where 
 <italic>i</italic> stands for influenza and 
 <italic>r</italic> for RSV, [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] but this difference is rather small and the uncertainties in the estimation of both reproductive numbers may blur the difference. Therefore, we have approximated the estimates of the reproduction numbers using the data for SLP as described in the following section. The reason for the choice of a SEIRS model is that we are following seasonal influenza (and RSV) and therefore we need to account for some immunity left by any given epidemic episode in the population.
