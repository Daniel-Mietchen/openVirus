<p>Now, to have a qualitative appreciation that the model encloses a plausible ecological explanation for the patterns of interactions observed in Mexico for RSV and influenza, the scalograms for model simulations are shown in Figs. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g011">11</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g012">12</xref>. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g011">Fig. 11</xref> note that the power of the signal for influenza epidemics increases every two years whereas the power of RSV epidemics is weaker but essentially homogeneous each year. For both epidemics there is another cyclic behavior (besides the expected yearly one) at about 6 months (light band between 4 and 5 in the y-axis). Compare the scalogram for the real data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g005">Fig. 5</xref>.
