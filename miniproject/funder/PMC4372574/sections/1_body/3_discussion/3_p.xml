<p>Influenza comes in waves of discrete events since each new influenza epidemic is produced by a different viral strain. So there is a process of lineage or variant replacement which is a genetic process. This approach has been successfully investigated in [
 <xref rid="pone.0115674.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Our approach looks at a different angle of the problem. We are interested in the interaction (or interference) between two types of virus: RSV and the influenza virus. In this case the process by which influenza occurs each year is due to an ecological process where available niches occupied by RSV are taken over and colonized by the influenza virus.
