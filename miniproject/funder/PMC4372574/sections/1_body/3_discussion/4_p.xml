<p>Our model is able to capture the two main cyclic behaviour observed in data: the annual one driven by yearly climatic variability which is exploited by RSV (since the power of its signal is stronger that of influenza) and a second biannual one, exploited by influenza. These two cyclic behaviours are in the root of the superinfection (ecological) mechanism for coexistence of both populations. It is important to mention that the data have a substantial bias in patient age that affects the estimates of reproduction number, that limits the extrapolation to the entire population. So a possible explication of the characteristics of scalograms is that the influenza is uncommon in children while RSV infects almost all the children during the first three years of life and re-infections by these viruses are very common during early childhood.</p>
