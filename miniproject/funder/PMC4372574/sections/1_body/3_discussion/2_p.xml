<p>On the other hand, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g012">Fig. 12</xref> we show the scalogram but comprising a broader range of periods reaching up to 128 weeks. Note that influenza presents cyclic periodic behavior across all years between 64 and 128 weeks (on average every two years) whereas the signal for RSV is much more weaker for that same period. Compare with the scalograms for the real data shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0115674.g006">Fig. 6</xref>. In this case our model is a bit off since it generates periodicity slightly below that shown in the data (which is above 128 weeks). Nevertheless, one can see that, at least in terms of spectra, the similarities are remarkable.
