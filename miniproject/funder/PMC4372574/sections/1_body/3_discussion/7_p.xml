<p>We must stress that we are not attempting to estimate the next outbreak of RSV or influenza nor attempting to statistically fit our model to the data. Our aim is strategic: we want a model that is able to explain the interaction observed between influenza and RSV through the analysis of broad patterns hidden in the time series. In order to have a better approximation to this program we certainly need to incorporate at least the role of asymptomatic infections, the role of immigration and a better way of introducing climatic variability into the equations.</p>
