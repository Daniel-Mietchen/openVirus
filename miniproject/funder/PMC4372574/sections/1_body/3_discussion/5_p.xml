<p>We must point out that our results presented here are out comes of, first, generating a better (still improvable) model for climatic variability. We renounced to the usual cosine contact rate with yearly period and instead took the temperature data and fitted a trigonometric series which was then incorporated in our model as described in the text above. Secondly, we estimated the reproductive numbers from the actual data.

 <sub>0</sub> estimation with such scarce data is a non-trivial but essentially methodological problem. There are many techniques that can be applied including likelihood and Bayesian approaches. However the point in all of them including the one we used here, rely on exploiting the data in such a way that one can get replicates that can improve our estimates.
