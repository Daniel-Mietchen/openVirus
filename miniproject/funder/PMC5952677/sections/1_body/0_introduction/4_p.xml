<p id="p0025">Sero-epidemiologic and molecular virologic approaches along with coherent monitoring systems remain the cornerstone in early detection, prognostic, forecasting, prevention and effective management of patients with immune-depressive viral diseases (e.g.: Zika) or immunodeficiency syndrome (e.g.: HIV/AIDS) over time and space (

They are reliable in determining the spectrum of diseases and risk factors, reservoirs, potential route of viral transmission, assessing risk factors and/or determinant dynamics in order to guide operational models implementation in prevention and control (

Nonetheless, most public health laboratories in arbovirus endemic areas are poorly-equipped in delivering routine screening service to vulnerable populations. Thus, in absence of such infrastructures, routine or active laboratory viral detection and diagnostics or confirmation and reporting in Arbovirus incidence and prevalence are not performed (

The exception is on HIV/AIDS; almost free screening benefits from government subsidies and PEPFAR sponsored projects in some African countries. It is thus clear that most viral diseases are undetected and underestimated in most of these countries with sometimes a high level of sub-threshold viral burden (e.g.: seropositivity ) and potential misdiagnosis due to cross-reactivity owing to varied degree of acquired immunity either from same quiescent infections, concurrent co-infections or epidemics in the region (
