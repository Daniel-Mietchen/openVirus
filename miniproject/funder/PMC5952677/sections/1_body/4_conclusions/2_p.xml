<p id="p0125">There is a pressing need to develop more sensitive, low-cost point of care and field adaptable rapid diagnostics and confirmation kits for Zika epidemics and related arboviral infections in zoonose-prone settings or vulnerable countries for prompt response interventions. Among all molecular, immunological and biochemical markers assessed in relation to related techniques applied in various studies/findings and captured in the presented findings, real time polymerase chain reaction would be more pragmatic molecular approach in terms of precision, specificity and sensitivity. However, the unit cost of setting up the resource and availability of desired reagents, associated refill costs and skill capacity may require more cost benefit analysis and need assessment from health economics and biomedical perspective as well as exploring industrial and end user partnerships through either regional health blocks or governments to advocate for subsidies and related sustainability. The possible cost effectiveness burden was notable from the sturdiness of methodologies applied in papers reviewed and proportion of only few samples that would be analyzed as compared to scenarios in which other techniques were utilized. Moreover, strengthening effective and reliable local, national and regional quality integrated surveillance data and contextual knowledge in guiding evidence-based early warning is crucial in supporting long-term robust community-based programs, public health laboratory monitoring systems and scaling up informed integrated vector control platforms.</p>
