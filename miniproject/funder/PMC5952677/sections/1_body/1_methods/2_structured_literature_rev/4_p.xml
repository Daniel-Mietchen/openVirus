Few studies met the inclusion criteria due to heterogeneity in approach and tools, human or animal targets, local or national single or integrated vector control programs, molecular, sero-epidemiologic and immunologic methods, and management of arboviral diseases. A data extraction form was developed to capture all data on nature, extent, geographical location and potential impacts/consequences of various types of arthropod-borne diseases epidemics and type of interventions over time (results are herein tabulated). Also, documentation of public health burden of ZIKV complications or pathophysiologic symptoms was done in affected patients, incidence, prevalence and fatality rate in relation to molecular, sero-epidemiologic and immunologic profile of studied populations over time.
