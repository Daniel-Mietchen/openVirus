<p id="p0035">In order to better characterize the nature, type and extent of applicability of sero-epidemiologic and molecular monitoring and screening techniques on ZIKV and related arboviral co-infections globally, a structured literature review from the previous 16 years (Jan 2000–March 2016)using the terms “molecular or serology approaches in Zika virus and arbovirus co-infections” was conducted using Google Scholar in March 2016. Additional publications were identified from references of retrieved articles as well as PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and MEDLINE electronic database and relevant grey literature. The period approximately represents over a decade of high throughput translational research on arbovirus surveillance, improvement of diagnostics precision in terms of sensitivity, specificity and unit cost in addition to the enhanced search for chemotherapy including vaccines (

Articles directly pertaining to quantitative measurement or detection techniques for ZIKV, flavivirus and arbovirus co-infections using molecular and serological approaches, articles reporting the validity of the molecular and serology methodology, and articles that have used varied bioassay measurement methods to determine the prevalence of ZIKV and co-infections and/or validate case reports alongside associated risk factors were considered (
