<p id="p0095">This review paper showed that ZIKV infections share similar early signs and symptoms with other arbovirus with indications that physiopathological complications associated with ZIKV would be deleterious to fetal development as well as threat to motherhood. Health professionals in most developing countries including Africa lack appropriate knowledge and skills for, timely and practical Zika diagnosis and management, adequate preparedness and rapid emergency response relay to their communities (

All these coupled by wide flora, fauna, the good temperatures and climate in most African contexts where the pathogens originated and/or are known to exist in pockets, provides a befitting niche for endemicity and sporadic outbreak based on the inherent favorable ecological factors (

To date, epidemic episodes have not been the case in Africa but equally, in case of an outbreak there is limited guiding content on possible serological and other molecular markers arrays to enhance real time epidemiological vigilance (

Equally, knowledge of the immune-modulatory and molecular dynamics that would enhance indepth understanding of the virus pathogenesis and presence or absence of observed differential diagnosis is splintered among diverse sub disciplines (

The above context linked with insights from existing grey literature and published findings guided by previous studies have shown that in sylvatic transmission cycle, human host carrier or reservoir or non-human intermediate or incidental host may harbor varied degree of viraemia depending on the innate and acquired immunity over time. Moreover, the highly intertwined host-pathogen interaction via favorable abiotic and biotic process ascribed in the context of such infectious pathogens like Zika with far reaching incubation period clinical symptoms ranging from few days to 1 week or there about, would point to emerging complexity in public health control and management (

 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Kuno and Chang, 2005</xref>). Thus, inclusive consideration of the diverse findings would help elaborate the varying epidemic trends between Africa and the Americas in the context of prevailing abiotic and biotic factors. Nevertheless, comprehensive research is needed to study and establish any link between Zika microcephaly, hydrops fetalis, arthrogryposis and hydranencephaly to stillbirth vis-à-vis the pathogen underlying molecular principles and pathognomy (

Furthermore, to examine the role of immunomodulation associated molecular and immune-resilience markers that can either demonstrate to be relevant diagnostic parameters and/or enhance possible severity or tolerance against ZIKV and other arbovirus pathogens (

 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Charrel et al., 2016</xref>). It is in view of the fact that transmission dynamics and contextual determinants for epidemic are highly potent especially in Africa yet possible indicators or predictor markers still required further validation as valuable tools in surveillance and epidemic ensnare especially in Africa (
