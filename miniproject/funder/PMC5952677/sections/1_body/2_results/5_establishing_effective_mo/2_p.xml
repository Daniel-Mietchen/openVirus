<p id="p0080">Examining bodily fluids samples in early quantification and detection of antibodies and/or antigens, cellular systems, cytokines and other molecular aspects is critical in understanding the disease course and important functional mechanisms in protection and defense against arboviral diseases. However, the detection and diagnostics methods are absent or not evenly establishing in most laboratory daily routine performance in most resource-limited countries found in sub-Sahara Africa. Our finding showed that, in &gt;Â 50 Zika-prone and over 100 dengue-prone countries less than a quarter performed routine laboratory bodily fluids testing or screening, whereas another quarter were performing periodic annual sentinel checks such as the America, Australia, UK, China and Uganda.</p>
