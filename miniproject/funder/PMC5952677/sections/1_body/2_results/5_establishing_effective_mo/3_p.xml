<p id="p0085">The urgent need to establish a functioning sero-epidemiological and molecular surveillance and monitoring systems in laboratory or epidemiologic surveillance is advocated in arboviral and other emerging viral diseases epidemics settings. Several detection and diagnostics methods and tools were reported in sero-epidemiologic, virologic and molecular investigative techniques in blood or bodily fluids examinations including ELISA, polymerase chain reactions, neutralization test, complement fixation and hemagglutination-inhibition testing. Understanding immune response with age and unprotected/partially immune people, mainly pregnant women, fetal and placental tissue/fluid examination during the first trimeter and throughout gestation, could provide some further clues. Moreover, there is need to assess the impacts of co-infections or super-infections on Zika epidemics and other diseases pandemic such as HIV/AIDS or other immunodeficiency disorders. The precedence being much is still to be done in term of operational research and development towards innovative and more sensitive, real time and cost-effective diagnostics approaches and tools including existing diagnostics RT-PCR or ELISA/IFA assays. Addressing the most pressing knowledge, laboratory and clinical capacity and capability needs of Zika virus vulnerable countries requires investing in implementing rapid, sensitive, and specific Zika and other arboviral diseases tools for early detection and surveillance (serological and molecular validation), extensive operation and epidemiological research data consolidation and translation for evidence gaps response, with focus on neonatal, child-maternal health; deciphering climate change and globalized travel and trade, and annual mass gathering pilgrims on Zika genomic diversity and evolution pattern, virulence acquisition, emergence and geographical spread.</p>
