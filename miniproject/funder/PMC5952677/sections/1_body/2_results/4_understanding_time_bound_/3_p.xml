<p id="p0070">Still, similar findings showed that there are sparse data on the sero-epidemiology of dengue and Chikungunya on the level of immune and other molecular related modulators of clinical course relevance particularly in Africa. Most applications have been in the context of case reports and few in population-based serologic surveillance. The small-scale utility of the serology and molecular techniques would be the outstanding limitation for appraising possible capacity and cost benefit analysis in replicating the same on a larger scale. Equally, due to the close association of clinical symptoms between arboviral infections and the challenging application of serology alone owing to false positive antibodies and antigens cross-reactivity vis-a-vis high cost and time consuming RT-PCR assays, complex possible combination or preferential application of either of the two diagnostic approaches such as ultra-neurosonographic/Laser detection and diagnosis of microcephaly, fetal brain malformations and anomalies. Even so specific, rapid and sensitive molecular monitoring and surveillance kits (e.g. RT-PCR) for detection of ZIKV and other arboviral infections in the early stage of infection and the relay of results could be key to immediate clinical intervention decision unlike serological profiles assessment. Additionally, molecular approaches have the capacity to utilize less invasive samples like urine and Saliva, unlike some serology techniques that will be sample specific for instance wanting to utilize serum whose collection involves an invasive process (
