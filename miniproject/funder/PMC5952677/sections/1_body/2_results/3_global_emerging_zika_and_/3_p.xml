<p id="p0060">From the presented range of arbovirus epidemiologic dynamics, it is evident, ZIKV clinical signs and symptoms could easily be mistaken for dengue (DEN) or Chikungunya (CHIKV) fevers. It is also clear from result presented that, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are among the main vectors transmitting ZIKV, DEN or CHIKV as well as eliciting global public health importance as suggested by their global distribution pattern. Despite this global knowledge and inherent appreciation of epidemic threat that would emerge in the event of an outbreak especially in Africa where ecological determinants are ripe, our search results confirms that incidences and prevalence profiling in Africa remains patchy and sparse as compared to other regions known to be equally potential to outbreaks and epidemics. Similarly, despite the disproportionate prevalence profiling, it is apparent that local clinicians in Africa and most diagnostic laboratories are more conversant with DENV and CHIKV. In contrast, few physicians are clinically at ease, well versed or aware of ZIKV clinical cues especially when complicated with potential for CHIKV/DENV and few laboratories test for clinical infection. Consequently, most ZIKV infections are probably missed or misdiagnosed due to DENV, CHIKV and other infectious diseases cross-reactivity. However, there was little information from the literature review process on early detection and local laboratory monitoring gaps to inform ZIKV threat, prevalence and epidemics. Local and global funding commitment should be directed to strengthening Zika virus epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance capacity and capability of resource-limited countries, cost-effective, rapid and field-adaptable molecular and serological diagnostic kits tests validation, accessible and available to high risk populations mainly pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in primary healthcare, collaborative regional and global surveillance and control network and strategies against circulating 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> and Zika virus diversity, Zika epidemics preparedness and rapid response surge capacity in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> prone countries mainly Africa.
