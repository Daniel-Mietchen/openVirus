<p id="p0090">Elucidating the susceptibility and spread patterns of Zika epidemics and other arboviral diseases in developing countries is imperative in establishing the most effective solutions to deal with the vectors source and local competence. Even though this paper was not aimed at evaluating surveillance and “One Health” implementation barriers and issues, Zika epidemics, Chikungunya and dengue resurgence have showed the challenges and issues of existing within Arbonet and DengueNet platforms and framework. There is an increasing need to leverage on novel cost-effective and scalable technological approaches on mosquitoes-transmitted diseases “One Health” surveillance framework and action plans adoption. National/regional infectious diseases priorities alignment with integrated “One Health” surveillance and framework implementation holds great opportunities in understanding
