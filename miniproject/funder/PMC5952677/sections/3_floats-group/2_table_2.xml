    <td>Molecular testing-PCR based: Blood samples, urine and saliva for Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays viral load detection appears to last up to 20 days after clinical onset.
     <break/>To diminish the risk of missed opportunities, a combination of molecular approaches serum Amniotic fliud and saliva or urine is defined as ideal especially if veracity of time of clinical onset cannot be clearly established. Equally, the combination of urine and saliva is evidently more robust at any stage of clinical onset. The less invasive modes of urine and saliva are suitable for infants and newborns. In situations of high reliance on serologic approaches alone without incorporating molecular approaches through RT-PCR with flavivirus consensus primers there is high like hood of cross-reactivity with dengue virus antigens hence mis-diagnosis for dengue instead of ZIKV.
