In the case of the Athens metropolitan area, an invasive mosquito species&#x02014;the Asian tiger mosquito (<italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>)&#x02013;has spread widely in the last decade. This spread is favoured within urban environments and is also affected by changing climatic trends. The Asian tiger mosquito is accompanied by risks of mosquito-borne diseases, greater nuisance levels, and increased expenses incurring for its confrontation. The main aims of this paper are (i) to estimate the various costs associated with the control of this invasive species, as well as its health and nuisance impacts, (ii) to evaluate the level of citizens&#x02019; well-being from averting these impacts and (iii) to record citizens&#x02019; and experts&#x02019; perceptions regarding alternative control measures. Evidence shows that experts tend to place a high value on mosquito control when associated with serious health risks, while citizens are more sensitive and concerned about the environmental impacts of control methods. The synthesis of results produced by the current study could act as a preliminary guide for the estimation of societal welfare from the confrontation of similar problems in the context of a complex ecosystem.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>This paper is based on several years&#x02019; collaboration among researchers from various disciplines, key health policy makers and stakeholders in an attempt to evaluate the economic dimensions related to the presence of the Asian Tiger Mosquito (<italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>) and the challenges of tackling mosquito-borne disease outbreaks in Greece and Southern Europe. Similar studies have been conducted and continue to be published in Europe and the USA examining the socioeconomic benefit from the implementation of relevant control and prevention strategies. These studies conclude that there are significant benefits related both to the reduction of nuisance levels and the reduction of the health risks posed by various mosquito species. In our case, the application of an updated economic analysis on the effectiveness of relevant public control and prevention programs provides essential information for public health decision-making, bearing in mind the significant restructuring of the public sector and the fiscal crisis apparent in the European South.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>LIFE CONOPS</institution></funding-source><award-id>LIFE12ENV/GR/000466</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>Part of this research has been co-financed by the European Union (EU Environmental Funding Programme LIFE+ Environment Policy and Governance) and Greek national funds through the LIFE CONOPS project "Development &#x00026; demonstration of management plans against&#x02014;the climate change enhanced&#x02014;invasive mosquitoes in S.

The implications of rising temperatures for human health around the globe include changes in disease vector survival and pathogen development, and the emerging new sanitary and environmental risks are directly related to various socioeconomic impacts. Recent studies indicate that intense urbanization favours the spread of vector-borne diseases, which may also flourish due to the higher density of both people and animals (both domestic and peridomestic ones), as well as due to various environmental and socioeconomic modifications [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, the globalization of trade and travel has facilitated the spread and establishment of invasive alien species (IAS). Insects predominate among non-native terrestrial invertebrates in Europe: of 1,522 established species, 1,306 (86%) are insects [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The IAS inadvertently introduced into Europe include several invasive mosquito species (IMS), which have found environmental and climatic conditions favourable for the establishment of permanent populations. These IMS are recognised as responsible for the emergence or reappearance of mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue and West Nile virus (WNV).</p><p>One IMS of major public health concern in Southern Europe is <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>, the Asian tiger mosquito, which arrived in Europe in Albania in 1979 and then Italy in the early 1990s, through the trade in used tires. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> is already established in large areas of Greece and Southern Europe [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and studies indicate that its rate of expansion in Greece is quite rapid [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> has already been responsible for transmitting both dengue and chikungunya viruses in continental Europe, including over 200 laboratory-confirmed cases of the latter in Italy (Region of Emilia Romagna) in 2007 [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and local dengue transmission in Croatia and France [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The IMS problem may affect the economy and society in various ways, through impacts on human and animal health, as well as on various services and activities. These impacts generate certain economic costs related to control strategies, public health measures, treatment of illness, productivity losses, information and awareness campaigns, and losses in tourism and other sectors. Economic impacts can be direct or indirect. Direct economic impacts are usually expressed as the net increase in public health spending as a result of the appearance of IMS and include, among other things, control-and-surveillance programs, private expenditures and direct medical costs. Direct impacts are the most clearly defined impacts as they can be explicitly expressed in monetary values. On the other hand, indirect impacts include the costs associated with new research and management services (in both the public and private sectors of the economy), as well as the effects of IMS on tourism, etc [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the gradual establishment of higher IMS populations in Greece has been accompanied by greater risks of mosquito-borne diseases, increased costs of implementing prevention measures, higher nuisance levels and side-effects on tourism and other economic sectors. The aim of this paper is thus to present the main categories of costs related to the aforementioned problem, to evaluate the potential benefit of enhanced prevention measures and to examine citizens&#x02019; and experts&#x02019; opinions concerning the various socioeconomic aspects of the problem. In this framework, the present study offers a chance to consider the evaluation and selection of strategies for similar socio-ecological problems, by various interest groups, under the prism of different institutional approaches in an ecosystemic context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Prevention and control costs and data on health impacts were collected and analyzed in collaboration with the National Public Health Organization (formerly known as the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (HCDCP)), public health agencies and private companies specializing in mosquito control activities.

Citizens&#x02019; willingness to pay (WTP) for improved mosquito control programs was also based on an earlier study, which employed a contingent valuation method (CVM), specifically the discrete choice method [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Two new surveys were conducted for the present paper. These provide a deeper exploration of the socioeconomic impacts and benefits of implementing improved prevention and control strategies.

However, even though the costs for the WNV outbreak cannot be directly attributed to IMS, they represent an up-to-date indicator of regular public expenses incurred against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases in Greece. This indicator is directly comparable to other relevant estimates in South Europe [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], thus enabling better adjustment for country-level effects (variation) in the cost-of-illness assessment. In addition, it is also interesting to note that the annual regional surveillance program for arbovirsuses in the Emilia Romagna Region of Italy [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] is designed for the common surveillance of various vector borne diseases such as WNV, chikungunya and dengue, highlighting thus the importance of applying integrated approaches against all mosquito-borne diseases.</p><p>The estimation of health impact costs, (Tables <xref rid="pntd.0007467.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pntd.0007467.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>) comprising medical costs and productivity losses, were based on the cost-of-illness (COI) analysis [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in which the burden of a disease on society is estimated in financial terms using both direct and indirect measures. Direct costs consist mainly of medical care, both inpatient and outpatient, and are estimated using market prices. According to the National DRG (Diagnosis Related Groups) Indicators published in the 3054/18-11-2012 Official Government Gazette of the Hellenic Parliament, the average daily hospital care cost in Greek public hospitals is approximately 207&#x020ac;/day; this was multiplied by the total inpatient care days.</p><p>In addition, indirect costs represent the loss of productivity due to morbidity. These costs were estimated only for earnings lost during the reported days of sickness among people older than 18 years of age; the value of a lost working day was then multiplied by the total number of sick-days. The cost of a lost working day for people in the 18 to 65 years age range was calculated according to the per capita net income equivalent for the reference years (2011&#x02013;2013) [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], divided by 220 working days. For people aged 65 years and over, the cost of a lost working day was calculated from the country&#x02019;s median hourly earnings [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] for 2010, adjusted for inflation by the Consumer Price Index and then multiplied by 8 working hours. Due to lack of data on the age of patients, productivity losses for the imported cases of chikungunya, dengue and Zika virus, were calculated based from the median hourly earnings [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] for 2014, adjusted for inflation by the Consumer Price Index for each indicative year and then multiplied by 8 working hours.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Estimation of benefit levels from improved mosquito control programs</title><p>We attempted to elicit household preferences for controlling IMS through a choice experiment approach [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Specifically, this stated preference method was implemented in order to examine household preferences regarding various attributes of mosquito control programs in relation to mosquito impacts (i.e. in order to assess the influence of these attributes in choosing a program). The initial selection of attributes was based on feedback from experts and on previous relevant studies. These attributes and their levels were then reduced to only those that were found to have a clear relationship with mosquito control programs, and this relationship was articulated in operational terms easily comprehended by citizens.</p><p>It should be noted that the control of mosquitoes is mainly carried out through annual activities which include monitoring and surveillance of the mosquito larvae population, implementation of larvicidal, adulticidal and surface residual ground treatments, and application of larvicidal and small scale adulticidal treatments by aerial spraying. On the other hand, controlling the Asian tiger mosquito calls for a more complex management plan and coordinated actions which have only recently been designed by the LIFE CONOPS research initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.conops.gr/management-plan-for-aedes-albopictus-in-greece/?lang=en">http://www.conops.gr/management-plan-for-aedes-albopictus-in-greece/?lang=en</ext-link>). The actions in this plan include (among others): standardized quantitative monitoring by special ovitraps, recording of mosquito population density data, involvement of the local population in the control campaign in private areas, residual door-to-door control interventions and use of larvicides in the road drains of public areas throughout the whole breeding season. The control methods and management plans according to the type of mosquitoes were described to all respondents at the beginning of the interview [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>When selecting the attributes, two main categories of benefits that may be derived from improved mosquito control programs were identified: less nuisance and reduced risks to health. Another distinction was drawn between benefits from controlling native mosquitoes (principally of the <italic>Culex</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> genera) and benefits from controlling invasive mosquitoes (the Asian tiger mosquito). For this purpose, two health risk attributes were used: (a) one related to the health risks that are mainly associated with native mosquitoes, such as WNV, and (b) another one related to the health risks due only to the Asian tiger mosquito (such as chikungunya fever). The nuisance attributes were likewise separated into: (a) nuisance during the day-time, which is a problem caused mainly by the Asian tiger mosquito, an &#x0201c;aggressive day-time biting mosquito&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and (b) nuisance at night, mainly associated with the native mosquito species. A cost attribute was included in order to elicit welfare effects, as determined by individuals&#x02019; preferences between alternative mosquito control programs.</p><p>Interviews were conducted from mid-June 2015 to the end of October 2015 in several districts within the Athens Metropolitan Area selected in order to represent the socioeconomic diversity of the city and the different degrees of exposure to the mosquito problem (either the Asian tiger mosquito or the native species). The survey was administered in face-to-face interviews by three trained interviewers and the average duration of each interview was 15 minutes. Although it was not possible to draw a strictly random sample from a sampling frame, the sample achieved a high degree of representativeness concerning geographical location and it was stratified based on location, sex and age (according to the 2011 Census). A total of 495 completed interviews were collected.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Qualitative survey of experts on the effectiveness of mosquito control programs</title><p>The socioeconomic evaluation of the mosquito control strategies was enhanced by conducting a survey of experts on the issue of the overall mosquito problem. This survey was designed to evaluate the socioeconomic impacts of the mosquito control plans by interviewing key stakeholders, public policy makers, medical practitioners, public health experts and regional administrators. The questions were formulated in order to evaluate the results of the preceding studies (especially the choice experiment) and provide qualitative evaluation of specific policy-related decisions (ecosystem services, adequacy of control programs, etc.). The questionnaire was distributed to a pool of 100 experts all over the country, selected on the basis of their experience and involvement in the design and implementation of mosquito control strategies. The survey was conducted through telephone interviews from May 2016 to May 2017 in collaboration with a member staff of the Ministry of Health and a total of 59 responses were collected.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Web-based survey on the qualitative impacts of the Asian tiger mosquito in Greek households</title><p>Apart from the survey in Athens, another questionnaire was also designed for a nationwide web-based survey aimed at eliciting citizens&#x02019; opinions regarding certain socioeconomic aspects of the mosquito problem. Its particular focus was to examine and then to validate at the national level a set of parameters related to: a) private prevention costs for IMS, and b) individual preferences among various mosquito control programs. The questionnaire was distributed through a popular meteorological data website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.meteo.gr">www.meteo.gr</ext-link>) with a high daily number of visitors [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. For the purpose of our survey, a special banner appeared on the home page, from which visitors followed a link to the web survey. The banner appeared randomly to visitors, but a selection bias could arise due to (i) the non-representative nature of the internet population, and (ii) self-selection of participants (the `volunteer effect') which was possibly related to their interest in mosquito control. The first set of questions focused on the respondents&#x02019; knowledge of the Asian tiger mosquito. Subsequent questions concerned: (a) the current perceived level of nuisance during the day and separately at night, both rated using a 5-point Likert scale (nuisance impacts from the Asian tiger mosquito and from other species were estimated by attributing the nuisance during the morning and late afternoon hours to the former and the nuisance during the evening and night hours to native mosquito species), (b) the period (months/year) with significant mosquito nuisance, (c) the monthly household expenditure for private prevention measures, and (d) the main reasons for taking individual prevention measures (i.e. they had to choose between health risk reduction and nuisance reduction). The survey took place in September and October 2016 with a total of 1,220 responses from all over the country.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec008"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Public control and prevention costs</title><p>According to national data published online on the governmental Greek Transparency Program Initiative (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diavgeia.gov.gr">http://diavgeia.gov.gr</ext-link>), the average annual public mosquito control costs in the Athens Metropolitan area range from approximately 800,000 &#x020ac; to 1,330,000 &#x020ac; per year. This represents an average annual cost of about 0.6 &#x020ac; to 0.9 &#x020ac; per household. These programs consist mainly of adulticide and larvicide activities, mainly with the use of specific chemical larvicides currently available or undergoing the revision process in the EU [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], such as Diflubenzuron; these are designed for the control of <italic>Culex</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> species and therefore target the elimination of their associated diseases (such as WNV). In other words, the implementation of these programs is not specifically tailored to the control of the Asian tiger mosquito and the prevention of chikungunya and dengue fever, even though Diflubenzuron also has high efficacy rates for the <italic>Aedes</italic> species [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It should be noted that some surveillance activities for the <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> are currently implemented in most parts of Greece including the Athens metropolitan area [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], however, data are insufficient for calculating the cost of these as yet.</p><p>In contrast to Greece, some other European countries are implementing programs specifically aimed at the control of the Asian tiger mosquito, such as the <italic>"Italian Plan of the Emilia-Romagna Regional Health Authority for the fight against the Asian tiger mosquito and the prevention of Chikungunya and Dengue fever"</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The current Greek management plan differs from these chiefly in that because it is not focused on combating the Asian tiger mosquito, larvicide activities mainly take place in public spaces without considering specific urban (residential) areas with high breeding activity of <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. The lack of a regional or national plan aimed specifically at controlling the Asian tiger mosquito makes the measurement of the efficacy of larvicide activities against <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> difficult.</p><p>What is more, due to high domestic breeding patterns of the <italic>Aedes</italic> species, information and communication activities can have a very high impact on the control of mosquito populations. According to recent estimates [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the annual total expenditure for information activities in Emilia-Romagna during the years 2009&#x02013;2011 ranged from 150,000 &#x020ac;/year to 0.6 mil &#x020ac;, significantly lower rate than the costs for regular anti-larval treatments which ranged from 3.6 to 4.4 million &#x020ac;/year. As previously noted, the annual integrated surveillance plan for arboviral diseases in Emilia Romagna is designed for the common surveillance of various vector-borne diseases such as WNV, chikungunya and dengue, while recent studies also emphasize the effectiveness of community participation also concerning the elimination of <italic>Culex</italic> species [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The overall public control and prevention costs associated with the WNV epidemic have already been presented in <xref rid="pntd.0007467.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Higher costs in the first year of application of measures are justified as a contingent response to the expansion of the outbreak. However, it appears that costs fell significantly during the following years. This could be also interpreted as a result of the epidemic being partially controlled; however, there are inadequate data within this study to support this argument.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Medical costs and productivity losses for imported cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika virus cases</title><p>According to the results <xref rid="pntd.0007467.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the average health cost for an imported case of Dengue was estimated to be 1,170 &#x020ac; for chikungunya, 2,774 &#x020ac; for dengue and almost 3,500 &#x020ac; for Zika virus. Even though the overall socioeconomic costs in the case of epidemic outbreaks for these diseases cannot be estimated with high precision (due to the limited number of disease cases), it is possible that in the scenario of future epidemics, disease complications could outweigh the present costs of treating the diagnosed imported cases.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Medical costs and productivity losses for the recorded WNV cases</title><p>The total cost of illness (COI) in the first year of the WNV outbreak (2010) was estimated at about 900,000 &#x020ac; [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This includes the cost of hospitalization for 260 recorded WNV cases, 25 of whom needed further hospitalization in intensive care at an extra cost of about 160,000 &#x020ac;.

These results provide an order of magnitude estimate of the economic feasibility of improved mosquito control programs in the study area (Athens Metropolitan area). Specifically, the benefit-cost ratio of any program which is expected to achieve the selected target levels at a cost less than 13 times the cost of the current mosquito control program (800,000 &#x020ac;/year) will be greater than one (i.e. would be economically profitable).

It provides substantive indicators regarding the citizens&#x02019; perceived benefit derived from the implementation of improved mosquito control programs, as well as experts&#x02019; evaluation of the socioeconomic effectiveness of current and future programs for controlling the problem of invasive mosquitoes. In contrast to other studies [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] findings from both perspectives show a higher priority for the prevention and reduction of health risks as opposed to nuisance control.</p><p>Furthermore, based on the results of the survey conducted in Athens, citizens are willing to pay a considerable premium for effective protection against the spread of unfamiliar diseases, thus implying a risk-averting behavior against invasive mosquito threats. In other words, citizens are willing to pay today for improved control programs that will be able to eliminate potential future impacts and risks. The fact that climate change trends may worsen the mosquito problem and increase the risks of the transmission of new diseases (such as Zika virus) is likely to provide ever increasing potential individual and social benefits from implementing more efficient mosquito control management plans in the coming years [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The cost estimates extracted from the current study allow for a comparison with recent similar estimates in Southern Europe. According to our findings the costs of public mosquito control programs range from approximately 0.6 &#x020ac; to 0.9 &#x020ac; per household in Athens, while the public costs of informed arbovirus plans in the Region of Emilia Romagna in Italy reach almost 1.2 &#x020ac; per household [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Using the Purchasing Power Parity Index [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] this figure translates to an equivalent of 1.04 &#x020ac;/year per household in Athens, indicating that a small per capita increase in public costs could justify the design and implementation of more targeted programs in Greece, in terms of perceived citizens&#x02019; benefits levels as already presented in the current analysis.</p><p>What is more, a recent study estimated that the implementation of public intervention strategies against the spread of <italic>Aedes</italic> related arboviruses in Italy since 2007 may have saved up to 13.5 million &#x020ac; indicating the cost-effectiveness of these interventions both from an economic and a health perspective [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It should be noted that our analysis indicated an annual benefit of up to 11 million &#x020ac; from the implementation of optimal mosquito control programs in the Athens area intended to achieve public health targets similar to those of Italy.</p><p>With regard to health impact costs, the medical costs for an average cost of illness of an imported chikungunya virus case in Italy reaches approximately 3,500 &#x020ac; [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], while the average in Greece, based on our limited sample of imported disease cases estimated to be about 1,100 &#x020ac;. The average cost of illness for all three types of imported diseases in Greece (chikungunya, dengue, Zika virus) was found to be approximately 2,500 &#x020ac;. According to another recent study in La Reunion [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the mean cost of illness per inpatient case of chikungunya reached approximately 2,000 &#x020ac;. Estimates of the cost of illness of recent WNV epidemics indicate a cost of about 3,500 &#x020ac; per case in Greece, while in Italy cost data are only available for the mean cost of illness for a WNV case with neuroinvasive complications (WNND), which reaches approximately 15,000 &#x020ac; per case [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The above estimates offer an important range of socioeconomic figures relevant to mosquito-related diseases in Southern Europe which could act as significant indicators for evaluating the societal benefits of integrated public control programs against the spread of arbovirus diseases under turbulent climatic and societal conditions.</p><p>The establishment of invasive species is usually associated with increased economic costs. For example, a study in the USA [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] estimated environmental damages and losses of almost $120 billion per year. According to a European Commission Impact Assessment [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], Invasive Alien Species are estimated to have cost the EU at least &#x020ac;12 billion/year over the past 20 years and the damage costs continue to increase. It is predicted that, due to the trends in climate change, the invasive mosquito problem will intensify in the immediate future [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, the evaluation of the socioeconomic costs of invasive mosquitoes is a vital but highly challenging task made even more complex by changing climatic conditions, as well as by globalization and urbanization trends that may call for the adoption of multi-disciplinary and more holistic approaches in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the expenses incurred in improving public health and social welfare [<xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007467.s001"><label>S1 Survey Questionnaire</label><caption><title>Web-based survey questionnaire.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007467.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007467.s002"><label>S2 Survey Questionnaire</label><caption><title>Expert&#x02019;s survey questionnaire.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007467.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007467.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Choice experiment card.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007467.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Special thanks should be given to: Dr. Danae Pervanidou M.D. and the National Public Health Organization (formerly known Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) for the provision of medical data on West Nile Virus and imported cases of chikungunya, dengue and Zika virus in Greece; Dr. Antonios Michaelakis Scientific Coordinator of the LIFE CONOPS project for the provision of data for management plans against Aedes albopictus in Greece; Mrs Cleri Tsalikoglou MD (Hellenic Ministry of Health) for her support in conducting the telephone interviews with experts; and Dr. Kostas Lagouvardos for supporting us with the hosting of the web survey in the website of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.meteo.gr">www.meteo.gr</ext-link>.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0007467.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">IPCC, 2018: Summary for Policymakers.
