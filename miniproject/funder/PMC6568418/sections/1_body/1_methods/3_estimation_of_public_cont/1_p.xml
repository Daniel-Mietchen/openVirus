<p>The annual public control and prevention costs examined in this study consist mainly of: (a) annual mosquito vector control activities, (b) contingency costs incurred in response to the WNV epidemic by the responsible national agency, the National Public Health Organization (NPHO), and (c) costs of the additional screening of blood donations that is imposed because of the risk of transmission of WNV through blood transfusion. Market prices for vector control activities were provided directly by regional and municipal authorities and private companies. The annual costs incurred by the NPHO from 2010 to 2013 were extracted from official reports and databases. The cost of additional blood safety testing was provided by the Hellenic National Blood Centre.</p>
