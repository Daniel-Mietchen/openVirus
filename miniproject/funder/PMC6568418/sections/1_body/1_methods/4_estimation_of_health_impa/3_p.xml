<p>It might seem that costs associated with WNV (which is spread mainly by 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes) may be a rather poor approximation to health impacts of the Asian tiger mosquito. However, even though the costs for the WNV outbreak cannot be directly attributed to IMS, they represent an up-to-date indicator of regular public expenses incurred against the spread of mosquito-borne diseases in Greece. This indicator is directly comparable to other relevant estimates in South Europe [

In addition, it is also interesting to note that the annual regional surveillance program for arbovirsuses in the Emilia Romagna Region of Italy [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] is designed for the common surveillance of various vector borne diseases such as WNV, chikungunya and dengue, highlighting thus the importance of applying integrated approaches against all mosquito-borne diseases.
