 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in which the burden of a disease on society is estimated in financial terms using both direct and indirect measures. Direct costs consist mainly of medical care, both inpatient and outpatient, and are estimated using market prices. According to the National DRG (Diagnosis Related Groups) Indicators published in the 3054/18-11-2012 Official Government Gazette of the Hellenic Parliament, the average daily hospital care cost in Greek public hospitals is approximately 207â‚¬/day; this was multiplied by the total inpatient care days.
