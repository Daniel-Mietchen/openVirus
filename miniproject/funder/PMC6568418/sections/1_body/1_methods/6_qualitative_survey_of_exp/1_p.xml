<p>The socioeconomic evaluation of the mosquito control strategies was enhanced by conducting a survey of experts on the issue of the overall mosquito problem. This survey was designed to evaluate the socioeconomic impacts of the mosquito control plans by interviewing key stakeholders, public policy makers, medical practitioners, public health experts and regional administrators. The questions were formulated in order to evaluate the results of the preceding studies (especially the choice experiment) and provide qualitative evaluation of specific policy-related decisions (ecosystem services, adequacy of control programs, etc.). The questionnaire was distributed to a pool of 100 experts all over the country, selected on the basis of their experience and involvement in the design and implementation of mosquito control strategies. The survey was conducted through telephone interviews from May 2016 to May 2017 in collaboration with a member staff of the Ministry of Health and a total of 59 responses were collected.</p>
