<p>Two new surveys were conducted for the present paper. These provide a deeper exploration of the socioeconomic impacts and benefits of implementing improved prevention and control strategies. The first was a nationwide web-based survey aiming to record citizensâ€™ opinions and attitudes, and the second was a small-scale survey of experts involved in mosquito control activities in Greece. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007467.g001">Fig 1</xref> presents all the methods implemented and how they contribute to the overall estimation of the identified costs and benefits associated with the problem of IMS. It should be pointed out that costs and benefits are somehow interrelated, so that the elimination of the socioeconomic costs entails a positive consequence on the benefit side resulting from the control of IMS.
