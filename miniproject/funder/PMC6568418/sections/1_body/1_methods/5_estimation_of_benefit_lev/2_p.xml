<p>It should be noted that the control of mosquitoes is mainly carried out through annual activities which include monitoring and surveillance of the mosquito larvae population, implementation of larvicidal, adulticidal and surface residual ground treatments, and application of larvicidal and small scale adulticidal treatments by aerial spraying. On the other hand, controlling the Asian tiger mosquito calls for a more complex management plan and coordinated actions which have only recently been designed by the LIFE CONOPS research initiative (

The actions in this plan include (among others): standardized quantitative monitoring by special ovitraps, recording of mosquito population density data, involvement of the local population in the control campaign in private areas, residual door-to-door control interventions and use of larvicides in the road drains of public areas throughout the whole breeding season. The control methods and management plans according to the type of mosquitoes were described to all respondents at the beginning of the interview [
