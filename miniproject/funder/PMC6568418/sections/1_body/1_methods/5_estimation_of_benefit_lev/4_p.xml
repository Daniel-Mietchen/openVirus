<p>Interviews were conducted from mid-June 2015 to the end of October 2015 in several districts within the Athens Metropolitan Area selected in order to represent the socioeconomic diversity of the city and the different degrees of exposure to the mosquito problem (either the Asian tiger mosquito or the native species). The survey was administered in face-to-face interviews by three trained interviewers and the average duration of each interview was 15 minutes. Although it was not possible to draw a strictly random sample from a sampling frame, the sample achieved a high degree of representativeness concerning geographical location and it was stratified based on location, sex and age (according to the 2011 Census). A total of 495 completed interviews were collected.</p>
