<p>We attempted to elicit household preferences for controlling IMS through a choice experiment approach [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Specifically, this stated preference method was implemented in order to examine household preferences regarding various attributes of mosquito control programs in relation to mosquito impacts (i.e. in order to assess the influence of these attributes in choosing a program). The initial selection of attributes was based on feedback from experts and on previous relevant studies. These attributes and their levels were then reduced to only those that were found to have a clear relationship with mosquito control programs, and this relationship was articulated in operational terms easily comprehended by citizens.
