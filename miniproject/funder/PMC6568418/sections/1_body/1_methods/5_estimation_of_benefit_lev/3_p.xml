<p>When selecting the attributes, two main categories of benefits that may be derived from improved mosquito control programs were identified: less nuisance and reduced risks to health. Another distinction was drawn between benefits from controlling native mosquitoes (principally of the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> genera) and benefits from controlling invasive mosquitoes (the Asian tiger mosquito). For this purpose, two health risk attributes were used: (a) one related to the health risks that are mainly associated with native mosquitoes, such as WNV, and (b) another one related to the health risks due only to the Asian tiger mosquito (such as chikungunya fever). The nuisance attributes were likewise separated into: (a) nuisance during the day-time, which is a problem caused mainly by the Asian tiger mosquito, an “aggressive day-time biting mosquito” [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and (b) nuisance at night, mainly associated with the native mosquito species. A cost attribute was included in order to elicit welfare effects, as determined by individuals’ preferences between alternative mosquito control programs.
