<p>The overall public control and prevention costs associated with the WNV epidemic have already been presented in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Higher costs in the first year of application of measures are justified as a contingent response to the expansion of the outbreak. However, it appears that costs fell significantly during the following years. This could be also interpreted as a result of the epidemic being partially controlled; however, there are inadequate data within this study to support this argument.
