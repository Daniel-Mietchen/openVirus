<p>According to national data published online on the governmental Greek Transparency Program Initiative (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diavgeia.gov.gr" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://diavgeia.gov.gr</ext-link>), the average annual public mosquito control costs in the Athens Metropolitan area range from approximately 800,000 € to 1,330,000 € per year. This represents an average annual cost of about 0.6 € to 0.9 € per household. These programs consist mainly of adulticide and larvicide activities, mainly with the use of specific chemical larvicides currently available or undergoing the revision process in the EU [

 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> species and therefore target the elimination of their associated diseases (such as WNV). In other words, the implementation of these programs is not specifically tailored to the control of the Asian tiger mosquito and the prevention of chikungunya and dengue fever, even though Diflubenzuron also has high efficacy rates for the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It should be noted that some surveillance activities for the

 <italic>albopictus</italic> are currently implemented in most parts of Greece including the Athens metropolitan area [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], however, data are insufficient for calculating the cost of these as yet.
