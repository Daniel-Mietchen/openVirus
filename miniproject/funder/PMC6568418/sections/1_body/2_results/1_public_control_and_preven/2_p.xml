<p>In contrast to Greece, some other European countries are implementing programs specifically aimed at the control of the Asian tiger mosquito, such as the 
 <italic>"Italian Plan of the Emilia-Romagna Regional Health Authority for the fight against the Asian tiger mosquito and the prevention of Chikungunya and Dengue fever"</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The current Greek management plan differs from these chiefly in that because it is not focused on combating the Asian tiger mosquito, larvicide activities mainly take place in public spaces without considering specific urban (residential) areas with high breeding activity of 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. The lack of a regional or national plan aimed specifically at controlling the Asian tiger mosquito makes the measurement of the efficacy of larvicide activities against 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> difficult.
