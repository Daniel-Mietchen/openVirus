<p>According to the results 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the average health cost for an imported case of Dengue was estimated to be 1,170 € for chikungunya, 2,774 € for dengue and almost 3,500 € for Zika virus. Even though the overall socioeconomic costs in the case of epidemic outbreaks for these diseases cannot be estimated with high precision (due to the limited number of disease cases), it is possible that in the scenario of future epidemics, disease complications could outweigh the present costs of treating the diagnosed imported cases.
