<p>In the web survey of private citizens, 83% of respondents stated that the current prevention and control measures are insufficient or inadequate for dealing with the mosquito problems and therefore there is a need for further measures to be taken. The average private prevention costs of the sample were approximately 16€ per month in the period when mosquitoes are active, which amount to about 100 €/year. There was significant regional variation in these estimates, ranging from below 80 € (e.g. Region Thessaly and Region of North Aegean) to over 125 € (e.g. Region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace, and Region of Central Greece). This variation may be an indirect indicator of the magnitude of the mosquito problem, which is strongly associated with the nuisance conditions in each area. It should be also noted that this revealed behavior concerning prevention costs can be used as a lower-bound proxy of individuals’ potential benefits from improved control measures in each region.</p>
