<p>Under our most conservative scenario (i.e. a medium prevention scenario, effective only against the native mosquito species), the estimated aggregate benefits from improved control programs can reach up to 11.2 million €/year, thus corresponding to a net benefit of 7.40 €/household/year (see 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). These results provide an order of magnitude estimate of the economic feasibility of improved mosquito control programs in the study area (Athens Metropolitan area). Specifically, the benefit-cost ratio of any program which is expected to achieve the selected target levels at a cost less than 13 times the cost of the current mosquito control program (800,000 €/year) will be greater than one (i.e. would be economically profitable). This cost could further increase (up to 31.3 €/household/year) if a high prevention scenario, effective against all mosquito species, were implemented. On the other hand, the expected added value of taking measures not only against native but also against the Asian tiger mosquito was found to be substantial, representing on average an additional benefit of about 15€/household/year [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, this benefit can be attributed mainly to the high health risks posed by the introduction of new invasive species into the study area.
