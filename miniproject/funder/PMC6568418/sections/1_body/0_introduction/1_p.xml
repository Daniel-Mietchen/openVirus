<p>Recent reports highlight the impacts and risks to human and natural systems linked to global warming of 1.5°C compared to temperatures in the pre-industrial period [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The implications of rising temperatures for human health around the globe include changes in disease vector survival and pathogen development, and the emerging new sanitary and environmental risks are directly related to various socioeconomic impacts. Recent studies indicate that intense urbanization favours the spread of vector-borne diseases, which may also flourish due to the higher density of both people and animals (both domestic and peridomestic ones), as well as due to various environmental and socioeconomic modifications [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In addition, the globalization of trade and travel has facilitated the spread and establishment of invasive alien species (IAS). Insects predominate among non-native terrestrial invertebrates in Europe: of 1,522 established species, 1,306 (86%) are insects [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The IAS inadvertently introduced into Europe include several invasive mosquito species (IMS), which have found environmental and climatic conditions favourable for the establishment of permanent populations. These IMS are recognised as responsible for the emergence or reappearance of mosquito-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue and West Nile virus (WNV).
