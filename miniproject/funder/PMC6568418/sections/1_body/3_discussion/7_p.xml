<p>The establishment of invasive species is usually associated with increased economic costs. For example, a study in the USA [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] estimated environmental damages and losses of almost $120 billion per year. According to a European Commission Impact Assessment [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007467.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], Invasive Alien Species are estimated to have cost the EU at least â‚¬12 billion/year over the past 20 years and the damage costs continue to increase. It is predicted that, due to the trends in climate change, the invasive mosquito problem will intensify in the immediate future [

Therefore, the evaluation of the socioeconomic costs of invasive mosquitoes is a vital but highly challenging task made even more complex by changing climatic conditions, as well as by globalization and urbanization trends that may call for the adoption of multi-disciplinary and more holistic approaches in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the expenses incurred in improving public health and social welfare [
