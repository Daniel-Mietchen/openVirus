<p>The cost estimates extracted from the current study allow for a comparison with recent similar estimates in Southern Europe. According to our findings the costs of public mosquito control programs range from approximately 0.6 € to 0.9 € per household in Athens, while the public costs of informed arbovirus plans in the Region of Emilia Romagna in Italy reach almost 1.2 € per household [
