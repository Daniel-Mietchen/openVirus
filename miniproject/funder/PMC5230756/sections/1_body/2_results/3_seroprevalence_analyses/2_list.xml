  <p>The former identified a continuous prevalence increase in both islands with a final seroprevalence of 48·1% in Guadeloupe and 41·9% in Martinique (Jan-2015, pop#4). 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005254.g004">Fig 4</xref> presents the distribution of positives in age-classes in pop#4, showing 
   <italic>(i)</italic> in both islands the lowest values in the 31-40yo group, 
   <italic>(ii)</italic> a trend to increase in the older age-groups and 
   <italic>(iii)</italic> globally higher numbers in Guadeloupe than in Martinique.
  </p>
  <p>In the overall age range (18–70 yo) and after correction for the distribution of population in age-groups, seroprevalence estimates in the general population were calculated at 48·8% in Guadeloupe and 43·2% in Martinique. This presumably represents a valid proxy estimate for the global seroprevalence in the general population of both islands.</p>

  <p>The latter identified 2 Martiniquan donors with CHIKV-IgG collected in Oct-2013. One reported previous chikungunya fever during the 2005–2006 Indian Ocean outbreak; the other case could not be investigated. It could not be determined whether this was an autochthonous case, an imported case, or the serological signature of a previous local infection.</p>
