  <p>Detection of CHIKV-IgG was significantly more frequent in males than females in Martinique (p &lt;0Â·0001) but not in Guadeloupe.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>No direct significant relationship was identified between ABO groups and detection of CHIKV-IgG, with the exception of higher CHIKV-IgG rates in Guadeloupian donors with an AB phenotype. This observation should be considered with caution since it was obtained from low numbers and only in Guadeloupe.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item>
  <p>Significantly higher CHIKV-IgG rates were observed in Martiniquan donors with a KEL-1 phenotype. Detection of CHIKV-IgG was more frequent in both islands in donors with an RH+1 phenotype, but this was not statistically significant.</p>

  <p>When combination phenotypes were tested, CHIKV-IgG detection was significantly more frequent in Martiniquan (but not in Guadeloupian) donors with:
