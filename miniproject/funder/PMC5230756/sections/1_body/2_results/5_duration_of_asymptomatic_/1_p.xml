<p>For a final seroprevalence of 41·9%, in the pop#1 of Martiniquan blood donors our model predicted, 15, 31, 46, and 61 RNA positive detections (with a viral load above 450 genome copies/mL of plasma) associated with asymptomatic viraemia durations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 days respectively. Based on this model, the observed number of RNA positive detections (37) corresponded to a predicted asymptomatic viraemia of
