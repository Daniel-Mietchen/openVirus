<p>For a final seroprevalence of 48·1% in the pop#1 of Guadeloupian donors, 12, 24, 35, and 47 RNA positive detections (with a viral load above 450 genome copies/mL of plasma) were associated with asymptomatic viraemia durations of 1, 2, 3, and 4 days respectively. Thus, the observed number of RNA positive detections (26) corresponded to a predicted asymptomatic viraemia of
