<p>Amongst 16,386 donations tested by RT-PCR (pop#1), 37/10,197 (0·36%) and 26/6,189 (0·42%) were positive in Martinique and Guadeloupe respectively. Monthly detection of CHIKV RNA is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005254.g002">Fig 2</xref>, together with suspected clinical cases in the general population. None of the donors with a positive CHIKV RNA NAT screening result did repeat blood donation over the study period. The results clearly showed different epidemic kinetics in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The outbreak started earlier in Martinique (threshold of 1,000 weekly suspected clinical cases from early Mar-2014) than in Guadeloupe (same threshold from early Apr-2014) with a clear and very intense epidemic peak in Guadeloupe during May-Aug-2014 (up to 6,500 weekly cases,
