<p>The manual of the kit used in the current study indicated that the limit of detection (LOD) of the assay (Probit analysis based on serial dilutions of quantified synthetic control RNAs) was 1.268 copies/μL of eluate [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.610 copies/μl—4.053 copies/μl]. In our experimental conditions, this would correspond to a LOD of 
 <italic>ca</italic> 450 genome copies per mL of plasma. Using the same control RNAs, our results were in a similar range (300–400 synthetic RNA copies per mL of plasma). Further evaluation using titrated culture supernatants allowed for both the Asian and ECSA lineages of CHIKV the reproducible detection of viral RNA in dilutions corresponding to a titre ≥ 1 TCID/mL.
