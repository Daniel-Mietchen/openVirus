 <italic>e</italic>., via direct human-mosquito-human transmission by peridomestic 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and

 <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes). During the past decade the epidemic transmission cycle of CHIKV has caused large outbreaks throughout Asia, Africa and the islands in the Indian Ocean.

Severe forms of infection have been reported, notably encephalitic syndromes in newborns following late infection of the mother during pregnancy. In addition, debilitating persistent arthralgic sequelae are observed in a proportion of patients [
