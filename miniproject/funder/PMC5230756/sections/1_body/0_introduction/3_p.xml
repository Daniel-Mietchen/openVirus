<p>In the most populated French Caribbean islands (Guadeloupe and Martinique), the only potential vector of CHIKV is 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. This species is abundant and also responsible for dengue virus epidemics [

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> would transmit CHIKV locally. Indeed, in 2014, at least 81,200 presumed clinical cases of chikungunya fever were recorded in Guadeloupe, and 72,500 in Martinique [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005254.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Consequently, special attention was paid to minimizing the risk of virus transmission via blood transfusion. However, a temporary ban on local blood donation would have presented a major challenge for supplies of fresh blood products from France, due to local phenotypic distribution of blood groups. Accordingly, CHIKV-specific molecular screening was implemented by the French blood bank (Etablissement Fran√ßais du Sang, EFS) [
