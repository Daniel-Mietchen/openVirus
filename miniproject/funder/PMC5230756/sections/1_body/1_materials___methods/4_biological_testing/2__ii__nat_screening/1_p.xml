<p>Individual NAT screening was performed by the EFS Alpes-Méditerranée laboratory (Marseille, France). Nucleic acids were extracted from 140μL of plasma using the NucleoSpin-96 Virus Extraction Kit (Macherey-Nagel) and a semi-automated NX-workstation (Beckman-Coulter). Real-time RT-PCR amplification was realised with the RealStar Chikungunya RT-PCR Kit 1.1 (Altona Diagnostics) and a CFX96 thermocycler (Bio-Rad) [
