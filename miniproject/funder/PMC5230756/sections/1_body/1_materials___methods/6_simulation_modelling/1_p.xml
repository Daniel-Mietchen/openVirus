<p>The population of blood donors tested by NAT screening for CHIKV (blood donations = pop#1) in Martinique included 6,911 donors. The complete duration of the study in pop#1 was 338 days, including 224 days open for blood donation. Accordingly, during these 224 days, our model randomly attributed 1 or 2 days of possible donation to 4,147 donors who gave blood once and 2,764 who gave blood twice, respectively. It also randomly attributed 1, 2, 3 or 4 days of viraemia to each donor in a 338 day period and the number of days where viraemia and blood donation coincided were counted. The mean value obtained in 1,000 simulation replicates provided the expected number of detected incident cases in Martiniquan pop#1 donors, assuming a 1â€“4 day duration of detectable asymptomatic viraemia and a final seroprevalence of 100%. Results were then adjusted in proportion with the actual seroprevalence observed at the end of the study period. The same analysis was performed in pop#1 Guadeloupian blood donors (4,613 donors, including 2,768 who gave once and 1,845 who gave twice). This model was used to determine which estimated duration of detectable asymptomatic viraemia provided the best fit to positive viral RNA detection following NAT screening. This estimate was therefore dependent upon the specific LOD of the detection method used.</p>
