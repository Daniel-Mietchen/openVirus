<p>Our objective was to follow the rise of seroprevalence at the onset of the outbreak, to estimate the final seroprevalence, and to refine the picture of epidemic kinetics and help calibrating our model by obtaining an intermediate seroprevalence value. Accordingly, a sero-epidemiological survey was conducted using a selection of samples (n = 9,506) collected for NAT screening. This included donations collected in Guadeloupe and Martinique between Feb-24
 <sup>th</sup> and July-31
 <sup>st</sup> 2014 (n = 6,812; pop#2; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005254.g001">Fig 1</xref>), randomised samples in October 2014 (n = 940; pop#3; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005254.g001">Fig 1</xref>) and January 2015 (n = 1,754; pop#4; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005254.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Seroprevalence was analysed separately for Guadeloupe and Martinique.
