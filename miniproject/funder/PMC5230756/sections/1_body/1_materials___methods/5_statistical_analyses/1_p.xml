<p>Association of the presence of CHIKV-IgG with other epidemiological and biological factors was analysed using records from 8,653 donors tested during the epidemic period (Jan-1
 <sup>st</sup> 2014 to Jan-31
 <sup>st</sup> 2015), in both Guadeloupe (2,984, sex ratio = 0·94) and Martinique (5,669, sex ratio = 0·81) (pop#6;

To avoid possible bias, when a donor was associated with several blood donations during the period considered, he/she was counted only once (the day of the first donation if serology remained negative, otherwise the day of the first positive serology). Analyses were performed separately for Guadeloupe and Martinique. The main parameters considered were gender, age and blood grouping phenotypes. Statistical analysis relied on Chi

Multivariate analysis was performed using binary logistic regression with the IBM-SPSS Statistics v 23.0.0.0 software. Results were considered statistically significant when p-value was lower than 0·05.
