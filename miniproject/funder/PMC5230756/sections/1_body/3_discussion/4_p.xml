<p>The first important finding relates to the occurrence of cases in Martinique before the detection of cases by the public health services (Dec-18
 <sup>th</sup> 2013). Because the clinical symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever are similar (flu-like disease), the ongoing dengue outbreak may have hidden the emergence of CHIKV and delayed the detection of the first cases. Our retrospective seroprevalence analysis identified only two donors with antibodies to CHIKV between August and December 2013 (both being detected in Oct-2013): one associated with previous infection during the Indian Ocean outbreak and the other that could not be investigated. Overall, this suggests the absence of significant circulation of the virus during several decades before the outbreak, and also the rapid detection of the first outbreak cases.
