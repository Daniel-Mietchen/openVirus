<p>The current study was based on volunteer blood donors. Limitations to the interpretation of epidemiological data are therefore those of classical blood donor studies (individuals studied were 18â€“70 years old, and had no history of virus-like illness in the 28 days before donation). Important assets of the current study design were, the opportunity to compare results from similar populations in different locations, the high number of individuals enrolled, access to pre-epidemic samples, the possibility of performing individual nucleic acid tests and having access to asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic viraemiac individuals.</p>
