<p>Another interesting observation was the impact of different epidemic kinetics on our ability to identify risk factors associated with antibodies to CHIKV. In Guadeloupe, the epidemic eruption was intense but the very high transmission rate was not associated with identifiable risk factors. By contrast, the flatter epidemic curve in Martinique correlated with an overrepresentation of males and individuals with [RH+1 &amp; KEL-1], [A &amp; RH+1] and [A &amp; RH+1 &amp; KEL-1] phenotypes and CHIKV-IgG (using univariate analysis). Being a female or having a blood group different from these risk factors was apparently "protective". However, this protection was relatively minor taking into account the overall situation in Guadeloupe. In multivariate analysis, the only significant associations identified were gender (risk increased in males 
 <italic>vs</italic> females) and age (global increase of risk with age), both with low odd ratio values.
