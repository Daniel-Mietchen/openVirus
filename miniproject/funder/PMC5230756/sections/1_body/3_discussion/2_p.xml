<p>After the discovery of CHIKV clusters in Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthelemy islands (Dec-2013), the virus, transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, dispersed rapidly to Martinique and later to Guadeloupe. In La Martinique, according to French health authorities the disease reached epidemic proportions on Jan-3
 <sup>rd</sup> 2014, and the alert was cancelled on Jan-8
 <sup>th</sup> 2015. On Guadeloupe the epidemic alert started on Apr-10
 <sup>th</sup> 2014 and ended on Nov-27
 <sup>th</sup> 2014. The epidemic kinetics were different on the two islands, with a shorter and more intense outbreak in Guadeloupe. The peak of clinically suspected cases occurred during week-23 in both Guadeloupe (
 <italic>ca</italic>. 6,500 cases) and Martinique (
 <italic>ca</italic>. 3,250 cases) [

They may be related to ecological and environmental factors (e.g., climatic and geographical conditions, density and distribution of mosquito and human populations, land useâ€¦), but also to anthropogenic factors such as pressure of vector control.
