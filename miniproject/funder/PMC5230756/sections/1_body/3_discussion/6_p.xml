<p>The observed higher risk of CHIKV infection in males has been previously reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005254.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0005254.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, in other studies higher prevalence in females has been reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005254.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0005254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The reasons underlying these divergent observations remain elusive and are presumably linked with different habitats, economic factors and lifestyles. Regarding blood types and association with CHIKV infection, there is very limited information available. Kumar 
 <italic>et al</italic>. claimed that Rhesus-positive individuals had increased susceptibility to acquiring CHIKV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005254.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], but their results did not support this. In a genetic predisposition study in 100 Indian families, Lokireddy 
 <italic>et al</italic>. identified infection in all Rhesus-positive blood groups [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005254.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but none amongst Rhesus-negative individuals. However, the proportion of Rhesus-negative individuals was too low to draw robust conclusions. The association between erythrocyte phenotypes and susceptibility to viral infection remains difficult to interpret as long as the mechanisms and cellular receptors involved in CHIKV infection are not fully identified. The risk associated with specific blood groups may be explained by several non-mutually exclusive factors: individuals with these blood groups may be more prone to mosquito bite (for biological, epidemiological or sociological reasons); alternatively, they may have different susceptibilities to infection or capacities to eliminate the virus via specific innate immune responses.
