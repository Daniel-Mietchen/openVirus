<p>Finally, concerning the implications for blood transfusion, our study clearly shows that the risk of collecting blood from asymptomatic viraemiac patients is significant during a chikungunya fever outbreak. Modelling performed in Martiniquan and Guadeloupian blood donors suggested that the duration of asymptomatic viraemia was close to 2.5 days. This estimated period may be extended by the use of molecular assays with an improved limit of detection. However our results are consistent with the post-donation survey of 48 viraemiac blood donors, in which clinical symptoms were reported 1–5 days after donation (39·6% at day 1, 39·6% at day 2, 14·5% at day 3, 4·2% at day 4 and 2·1% at day 5; mean value = 1·9 days). The actual mean duration of asymptomatic viraemia corresponds to this observed mean delay before the symptoms, plus the duration of viraemia prior to donation,

This new information suggests that the optimal quarantine period for blood products during a chikungunya fever outbreak should be at least 5 days. The length of the asymptomatic viraemic period identified in the current study is higher than previous proposals (1·5 days according to Brouard

This divergence could reflect either different durations of asymptomatic viraemia in the case of infection by CHIKV ECSA when compared with the Asian genotype, or underestimation of the actual duration due to the limited number of cases previously analysed.
