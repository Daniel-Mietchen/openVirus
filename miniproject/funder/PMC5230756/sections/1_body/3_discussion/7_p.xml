<p>It is interesting to observe that on both islands the outbreak declined when a 40–50% herd immunity level was reached. This threshold is strikingly similar to that observed at the end of the outbreak on Reunion island (38·2%) and Mayotte (37·2%) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005254.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This is despite the fact that different virus genotypes were implicated in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean epidemics. In contrast the threshold for decline was much higher in Kenya (72%), Kerala (68%) and Thailand (62·1%) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005254.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005254.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This possibly reflects differing levels of social and economic development together with local efficacy of mosquito control measures. Based on the situation observed in the Indian Ocean countries, the level of immunity detected in the Martiniquan and Guadeloupian population should reduce the likelihood of a major recurrence of chikungunya fever in the French West Indies during the next few years.
