 <p>This article is dedicated to our Fogarty colleague, Dr. Ellis McKenzie, who was instrumental in launching, growing and shepherding the RAPIDD program from 2007 until his death in 2016. Ellis played a key role in promoting use of infectious disease models in government and mentored countless infectious disease modelers. The establishment and success of the program would have been impossible without Ellisâ€™s gentle and inspired guidance.</p>
 <p>The RAPIDD program is indebted to the leadership, vision, and guidance of two outstanding and incredibly generous scientists who shepherded this program since 2007, Bryan Grenfell and Ellis McKenzie.</p>
