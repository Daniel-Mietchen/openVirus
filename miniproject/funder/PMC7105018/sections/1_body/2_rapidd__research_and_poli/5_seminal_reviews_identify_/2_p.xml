<p id="par0315">Many of the most important emerging disease threats involve zoonotic pathogens originating from animal reservoirs. By conducting a seminal review of 442 published modeling studies of 85 zoonotic pathogens, RAPIDD researchers identified critical areas in need of further attention (
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">Lloyd-Smith, George et al. 2009</xref>). The review highlighted the marked predominance of studies of directly transmitted infections with simple life cycle (e.g., influenza, SARS), over infections involving multiple hosts with complex life cycles (vector-borne diseases, protozoans, food-borne infections). It identified a dearth of modeling research on looming threats including Ebola, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses, which was regrettably prescient in light of subsequent epidemics around the world (
 <xref rid="bib0640" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2017</xref>). Crucially, the review noted that very few studies linked dynamics across the animal-human interface, where the defining process of zoonotic spillover occurs, and few models incorporated evolutionary processes. To address these gaps, the zoonosis working group launched a series of methodological developments to link models across the animal-human interface, analyze the stuttering chains of transmission that foreshadow emergence events, and describe the evolutionary processes linked to pathogen emergence, with key applications in monkeypox, MERS-Coronavirus and influenza H5N1 and H7N9 viruses (

Similarly, the RAPIDD vector-borne disease working groupâ€™s review of 388 studies of mosquito-borne pathogen transmission determined that most models were still primarily derived from mid-20th century methods pioneered by Ross and Macdonald (

 <xref rid="bib0560" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). In response, the group developed more refined models to capture important features of mosquito-borne infections, including mosquito life history, heterogeneous biting and fine-scale spatio-temporal variation in transmission. Applying these methods to malaria and dengue highlighted the impact of incorporating realistic mosquito biology and biting heterogeneities on control efforts (
