<p id="par0310">During 2007â€“2015, RAPIDD functioned primarily via parallel working groups focused on four areas identified as having important research gaps: (i) methodological and data issues, (ii) zoonoses and pathogen emergence, (iii) vector-borne infections, and (iv) disease dynamics in small mammals. The working groups conducted primary research and led multi-disciplinary workshops on emerging research frontiers (

Since 2007, RAPIDD organized 118 workshops across a wide range of topics, with participation from thousands of scientists and government employees globally. Workshops produced large-scale reviews of the state-of-the-art of disease modeling in particular areas, and opinion pieces discussing new frontiers of model-data synthesis (

Working group members then pursued follow-up research to address the identified gaps by developing new modeling approaches or new applications of models to understudied but important diseases. The direct link between RAPIDD research and policy was ensured by periodic presentations to the US White House scientific offices. Overall, since 2007, RAPIDD has made substantive contributions across a remarkable range of public health challenges (
