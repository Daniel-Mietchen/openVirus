<p id="par0325">Influenza forecasting represents an area of rich synergy between the RAPIDD and MISMS programs. A major aim of ongoing influenza research is to predict the emergence and trajectory of new seasonal strains, and hence improve the imperfect semi-annual vaccine strain selection process. Forecasting work in this area was greatly enhanced by a 2016 workshop, organized in collaboration with WHO, that highlighted the need for better flow of genetic and antigenic information from public health agencies to the institutions and mathematical modelers to improve prediction accuracy and horizon (

This is a particularly fruitful area of overlap between RAPIDD and MISMS, as universal influenza vaccine candidates enter pre-clinical trials, and an ideal opportunity to integrate network membersâ€™ expertise on relevant evolutionary and immunological concepts with the global source-sink dynamics so unique to influenza (
