<p id="par0320">In recent years, a major focus of RAPIDD research has been infectious disease forecasting, responding to a rising need in the public health community, particularly for influenza and emerging infections (

In addition to RAPIDDâ€™s work on evaluating the impact of interventions in the midst of the West African Ebola epidemic, RAPIDD launched an after-the-fact forecasting challenge using synthetic epidemiological data sets to assess model performances in a controlled environment (

This unprecedented group effort revealed that the most accurate disease forecasts stemmed from ensemble predictions combining outputs from different models, since even the best models have weaknesses, and that prediction accuracy does not scale with model complexity. The forecasting challenge also strengthened communication and collaboration between modeling groups, laying the foundation for more effective response for the next public health crisis (
