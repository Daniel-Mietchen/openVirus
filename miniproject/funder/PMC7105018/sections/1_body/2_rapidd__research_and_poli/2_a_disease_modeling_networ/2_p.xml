<p id="par0300">Development of infectious disease models deeply rooted in empirical data can improve planning for, and response to, infectious disease threats; however, the link between modeling groups and policy makers remains tenuous in many countries (

 <sup>th</sup>, 2001 and before the anthrax-laced letters that began just one week later, DIEPS helped establish intergovernmental networks to model and address biological threats. These efforts contributed to launch an extramural modeling funding program on Models of Infectious Disease Agents (MIDAS) managed by the NIH National Institute of General Medical Studies and nascent funding to NIH Fogarty to study bioterror threats. In 2007, the RAPIDD program was established with funds from the Department of Homeland Security to build a hub-and-spokes network of infectious disease modelers working at the interface of policy and academic research, in close collaboration with government. The program’s mandate was to advance US capacity in infectious disease modeling by pioneering new methodologies, studying key emerging disease threats, and training the next generation of scientists (

RAPIDD departed from traditional grant-based programs in its flexibility and concentration on working group and workshop activities, and on developing research capacity. A key success of RAPIDD since 2007 has been to promote collaborative research and synergies between modeling groups beyond core participants of the program (
