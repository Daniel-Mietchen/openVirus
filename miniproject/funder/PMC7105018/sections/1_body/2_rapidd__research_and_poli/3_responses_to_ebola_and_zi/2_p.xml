<p id="par0305">RAPIDD research has been at the forefront of responding to the greatest infectious disease crises of recent years, particularly the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa and the Zika epidemic in the Americas. Modeling work helped to identify key routes of Ebola transmission and characterize effectiveness of intervention policies (

Modeling work further demonstrated the unintended consequences of the Ebola-associated healthcare disruption on childhood immunization, and stressed the need to promote supplemental vaccination campaigns, particularly for measles (

Taken together, careful literature surveys of prior modeling work, in addition to primary research done by RAPIDD, form a substantial body of "case law" for infectious disease modeling, which can be used as reference to understand and model outbreaks caused by new pathogens with similar properties. As an important demonstration of this principle, prior modeling work on dengue provided the groundwork for rapid development of regional and global models for the spread of Zika virus (
