<p id="par0335">Since 2007 RAPIDD has advanced the methods and applications of data-driven modeling of infectious diseases, with a clear focus on policy-relevant research, and has fostered a new generation of talented researchers in this field (
 <xref rid="tb0020" ref-type="boxed-text">Box 4</xref>). The programâ€™s remarkable success arises from strong collaborations developed among the many participants over the years, its flexibility and agility in convening workshops on emerging research frontiers, and from providing freedom and unparalleled networking opportunities for talented post-doctoral scientists. Looking forward, pending availability of funds, RAPIDD will continue its research emphases on emerging infections and vector-borne diseases, while growing new areas of focus on topical challenges such as on modeling the dynamics of anti-microbial resistance, and predicting the impact of next-generation vaccines such as for respiratory syncytial virus, malaria, typhoid, dengue, and the universal influenza vaccine.
