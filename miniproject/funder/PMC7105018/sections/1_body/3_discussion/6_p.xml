<p id="par0360">In conclusion, the MISMS and RAPIDD programs illustrate the power of scientific diplomacy and collaborative research networks, with demonstrable successes in improving research and control of infectious diseases. We see no shortage of policy-relevant research themes for these networks to explore, including the emergence of new threats at the animal-human interface, microbial interactions within and between hosts, integration of traditional and novel data streams into ever more sophisticated models, short- and long-term disease forecasts, projections of the impact of novel vaccines, and anti-microbial resistance. Fogarty-led disease modeling programs will continue to strengthen capacity in LMICs for outbreak analysis, and in turn help control emerging infectious disease threats domestically and internationally.</p>
