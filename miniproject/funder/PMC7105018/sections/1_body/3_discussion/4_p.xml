<p id="par0350">The MISMS and RAPIDD programs are also well connected with parallel efforts at NIH and CDC and in the broader scientific community. For instance, within NIH, there are strong synergies between RAPIDD and MIDAS, a funding program in infectious disease modeling managed by the National Institute for General Medical Sciences, and between MISMS and the Centers of Excellence in Influenza Research and Surveillance (CEIRS), funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. In parallel, there are strong ties between RAPIDD and MISMS and the CDCâ€™s influenza division, involving joint workshops, forecasting challenges (e.g., (

Further, there is a tight link between MISMS and RAPIDD and national and global public health agencies, with regular participation of collaborators in the White House pandemic preparedness working group, US government modeling coordination groups, and WHO modeling groups. Several of the MISMS workshops have been co-organized with, and in support of, foreign government agencies (
