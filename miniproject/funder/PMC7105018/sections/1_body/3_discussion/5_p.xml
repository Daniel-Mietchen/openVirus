<p id="par0355">Despite these successes, some challenges are worth noting. The most problematic is the lack of sustainable long-term funding for these programs more than 10 years after they were created, even though their combined annual costs are under 2M$, which is negligible relative to the costs of public health crises (see (

 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">World Bank and Ecohealth Alliance, 2018</xref>) for a discussion of the value of infectious disease preparedness and modeling). It is worth nothing however that the low cost of computational modeling does not include funding for generation of biomedical, epidemiological and surveillance data, which are essential to support modeling work. And with their extended duration and distributed network structure, the RAPIDD and MISMS programs fall outside standard funding streams, despite their extraordinary efficiency in propelling leading-edge science and addressing problems of national interest (

As the Ebola and Zika outbreaks clearly demonstrate, infectious disease threats are not in retreat Advances in multi-pathogen diagnostics and sequencing will facilitate real-time molecular epidemiology during future outbreaks, but will require people on the ground and international partners who can rapidly interpret large amounts of data. Development of new vaccines (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, universal influenza) and the growing challenge of anti-microbial resistance will require improved models to optimize public health policies and understand pathogen evolutionary responses.
