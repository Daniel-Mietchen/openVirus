<p id="par0345">Both programs rely on global multi-disciplinary networks to identify and address research questions at the forefront of infectious disease transmission and evolution. Both programs build off the “big data” revolution that provides increasingly detailed and abundant information on disease patterns and host behavior, leveraging a surge of pathogen genetic sequence data, exquisitely detailed epidemiological information derived from digital and social media, and human mobility and demographic proxies derived from mobile phones or remote sensing. New methodological approaches are needed to handle such a vast and diverse amount of information. Further, both programs have long histories of promoting data sharing and development of publicly available methodological tools, with key contributions to the Influenza Genome Sequencing Program and Database, the BEAST package for phylogenetic and associated analyses, and development of new transmission modeling packages (POMP, TSIR) and spatial analysis software (Epipoi) (
