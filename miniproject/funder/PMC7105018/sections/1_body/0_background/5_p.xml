<p id="par0265">Since its inception in 2001, the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies (DIEPS) has played a central role in promoting the growth of a vibrant and multi-disciplinary infectious disease modeling community through its MISMS and RAPIDD programs. Together, these programs have strengthened infectious disease modeling on a global scale by developing research and training networks, facilitating collaboration and data sharing, developing and disseminating new methodologies, and building a stronger collective voice for evidence-based policymaking. Most critically, these programs have been catalysts for other larger US agencies and governments worldwide to expand support for infectious disease modeling research and to incorporate models into policy decision-making.</p>
