<p id="par0260">The increasing availability of large, electronic datasets, or “big data,” presents new opportunities for scientists to understand drivers of disease. Electronic health records, social media, satellite imagery, and cell phone records provide highly granular information on human behavior, the environment, transmission patterns, and disease burden (

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing techniques have markedly increased the amount of pathogen genetic data available for study, providing almost real-time insights into how pathogens from different locations are genetically related and infer transmission patterns (
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Dudas, Carvalho et al. 2017</xref>). Increasingly, researchers are devising methods to collect data even in resource-limited settings. The highly portable MinION sequencer demonstrated how real-time whole-genome sequence data could be generated in remote locales during the Zika epidemic (
