<p id="par0250">In 2018 the Fogarty International Center celebrates its 50th year (1968â€“2018) as the only part of the US National Institutes of Health focused singularly on global health. The Fogarty International Center (FIC) uses high return-on-investment approaches to maximally impact global health, including (a) establishing strong international collaborative research networks, (b) building capacity for research in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) through training, and (c) liaising with a wide range of other US government agencies and private partners with a shared interest in advancing global health. Here, we describe two flagship FIC-led programs that identified critical gaps in infectious disease research and formed global networks of researchers to address the scientific questions most needed to inform policy and outbreak response.</p>
