<p id="par0255">The 2001 foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in the UK, the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic, and the 2013â€“2016 epidemic of Ebola in West Africa underscore the continual threat of emerging and re-emerging acute infections. Knowledge of the mode of spread of a pathogen and the subpopulations at highest risk of transmitting the pathogen and experiencing severe disease can inform key decisions about social distancing and prioritization of therapeutics and vaccines. Designing disease models rooted in empirical data, enhancing existing tools for data analysis, and teaching collaborators around the world how to apply these tools represent highly cost-effective ways to prepare for the next infectious disease outbreak. Past disease events have highlighted the capabilities of infectious disease modeling and molecular epidemiology to effectively guide outbreak responses, but also revealed persistent challenges in making predictions in data-scarce and rapidly changing field settings (
