<p id="par0295">Despite increased availability of influenza genetic and epidemiological data, there are still important gaps, particularly regarding surveillance in Africa and South America and at the animal-human interface (
 <xref rid="bib0595" ref-type="bibr">Viboud, Nelson et al. 2013</xref>), and poor integration of different data streams (e.g., epidemiological, antigenic and genetic information), representing target areas of future MISMS efforts. Because influenza is unique in combining long-term pandemic risk with a continued need for annual vaccine updates to reduce the burden of seasonal influenza, the field has traditionally enjoyed far better attention than other respiratory infections. As genomic and epidemiological data for other respiratory pathogens increases, a natural extension for MISMS would be to broaden its scope beyond that of influenza. Recognizing this potential, MISMS collaborators have embarked on modeling studies of pneumococcus and respiratory syncytial virus, and their interactions with influenza (

With additional resources, a more systematic broadening of the scope of the MISMS study to other important human respiratory pathogens would provide fresh opportunities to enhance understanding of multiple disease systems while drawing on an established global research network and a wealth of computational tools.
