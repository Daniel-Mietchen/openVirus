<p id="par0285">The global network of collaborators that grew out of the MISMS program is a unique resource to leverage in the event of the next pandemic influenza or another infectious disease threat. As a case in point, in 2009, the presence of MISMS-trained researchers in Mexico facilitated early reporting of severity and striking age-shifts in mortality patterns that are signatures of new pandemic viruses (

 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">Miller, Viboud et al. 2009</xref>). During the critical early stages of the pandemic, rapid reporting of these epidemiological patterns informed use of limited resources, including vaccine and therapeutics, as well as interventions such as school closures (

 <xref rid="bib0545" ref-type="bibr">Simonsen et al., 2011</xref>). Quantitative studies of past patterns can help predict the course of future pandemics and inform the range of plausible scenarios for preparedness, including elevated mortality occurring several years after the initial emergence of a pandemic virus (

MISMS also has worked actively to bridge human and veterinary research communities and understand the emergence of pandemic viruses at the animal-human interface. Two workshops held in Ames, Iowa, USA, in collaboration with US Department of Agriculture, focused on swine influenza, while another held in Padua, Italy, in collaboration with Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, focused on avian influenza, providing training opportunities in an active area of influenza research.
