<p id="par0275">None of the last three pandemics – influenza A/H2N2 in 1957, A/H3N2 in 1968, and A/H1N1 in 2009 – originated in a high-income country. Building capacity for influenza research in low- and middle-income countries is an essential but underfunded part of global pandemic preparedness and a key goal of the MISMS program. A central feature of MISMS workshops has been partnership with local organizations to help identify talented scientists in under-resourced settings. Workshops are held either in low- or middle-income countries, or the program provides funding for researchers from these countries to attend workshops in high-income countries (

In addition to periodic workshops that provide intense short-term training to 30–100 participants, MISMS staff also host junior and mid-career researchers from Central America, Europe, Africa, and Asia for further training at the NIH for periods ranging from a few months to several years. These scientists gain deep expertise in epidemiological and phylogenetic approaches and establish research programs to inform policy in their home countries.
