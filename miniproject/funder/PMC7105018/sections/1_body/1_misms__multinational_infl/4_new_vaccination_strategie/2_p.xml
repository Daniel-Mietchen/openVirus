<p id="par0280">Organizing workshops in under-studied tropical settings brought critical attention to the burden of influenza and the variability of seasonal patterns in less connected locales and warm, humid climates (

 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Bloom-Feshbach, Alonso et al. 2012</xref>). Increased recognition of the global burden of influenza in tropical and semi-tropical regions also has encouraged uptake of routine annual vaccination in many middle-income countries. However, several MISMS studies rooted in epidemiological and virological data have pointed out that the semi-annual schedule is designed for wealthier countries in the temperate regions in the Northern and Southern hemispheres, and are suboptimal for many tropical countries that experience influenza at different times of the year, or have multiple peaks (

MISMS research has informed whether a tropical country should opt for the Northern or Southern hemisphere vaccine formulation – or in some cases both. Large countries with heterogenous influenza patterns and climate, such as China, Mexico and Brazil, may require different vaccine recommendations for their northern and southern regions (

Active areas of MISMS research include a deeper understanding of influenza migration pathways at different spatial scales, climatic and demographic drivers of influenza seasonality, and the mapping between vaccine match and population-level protection, all of which can affect vaccine policy (

      <underline>Vaccination:</underline> MISMS studies in large and climatologically-diverse countries have identified geographic differences that affect annual influenza vaccination programs. Because of the timing of influenza epidemics and composition of circulating strains in Southern China and Southern Brazil, Southern provinces should use the Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine, while the Northern part of these countries should use the Northern Hemisphere vaccine (

      <underline>Pandemic control measures:</underline> Mexico implemented nationwide social distancing measures to control the 2009 influenza pandemic (combination of mandatory school closure, restaurant closure, and cancellation of large gatherings) during an 18-day period in late April and early May 2009. MISMS researchers were among the first to work with the ministry of health to assess the dynamics of the outbreak and the impact of interventions. By fitting transmission models to surveillance data, they found that social distancing reduced influenza transmission by one-third, lending support to these costly measures. Beyond the 2009 pandemic, this works suggests that social distancing interventions could be implemented to mitigate severe outbreaks and alleviate the pressure on healthcare, for limited periods of time and until other interventions (such as vaccination) can kick in (

      <underline>Addressing data gaps:</underline> On the RAPIDD front, modelers thought creatively to find ways to fill data gaps that were essential obstacles to resolving policy-relevant health problems. For example, a common problem in livestock diseases is the lack of information on farm locations and animal movements, especially in the US. These are key ingredients to design transmission models, evaluate interventions, and help prepare for potential outbreaks such as Foot-and-Mouth disease. The RAPIDD network designed a method to leverage veterinary records and mandatory licenses filed by farmers. Further, much simulation work was done based on the richer UK dataset informing farm locations, animal movements, and observed Foot-and-Mouth disease outbreaks, to strengthen US models and remedy data gaps.

      <underline>Gain-of-function studies and pandemic risk prediction:</underline> As the debate on gain-of-function studies intensified, RAPIDD organized a two-workshop series on “Assessing the outbreak potential of nonhuman influenza viruses using sequence-based risk approaches’” and “Modeling and Predicting Influenza Phenotypes” to explore modeling of pandemic potential. Gain-of-function studies indicated that an avian influenza virus undergies a series of genetic changes for human adaptation, which are required for efficient transmission among mammals. The workshops assembled global experts to synthesize current knowledge about the three key steps of the adaptation process: switch of the hemagglutinin surface protein to mammalian alpha-2,6 sialic acid binding, enhancement of pH- and temperature-dependent stability of the hemagglutinin, and adaptation of the viral polymerase to function in mammalian cells. These workshops spurred modeling work to infer pandemic potential based on ferret transmission experiments, and further work is underway to explore whether mapping of genotype-to-phenotype traits is possible, despite rampant epistatic interactions across the influenza genome (

      <underline>Vaccination decline in the aftermath of Ebola:</underline> Another example of the link between RAPIDD research and policy is a study on the precipitous decline in childhood immunization during the 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak (
      <xref rid="bib0575" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al., 2015</xref>). RAPIDD modelers estimated that around one million children in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea were vulnerable to measles following the suspension of vaccination campaigns during the Ebola outbreak. The study concluded on the urgent need to mount an aggressive vaccination campaign as soon as the Ebola outbreak subsided. This advice was heeded by public health authorities, as measles vaccination campaigns targeting several million children were launched in Sierra Leone and Guinea in October 2015 and in Liberia a few months earlier.
