<p>Insecticide susceptibility data from CDC bottle bioassays demonstrated that the local 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> population was fully susceptible to deltamethrin at baseline and remained fully susceptible when tested during May 2010 and July 2010. Resistance to deltamethrin was first detected during February 2011, when 24-hour mortality using the WHO bioassay dropped to 79.7% and was at a similar level (74.8%) during April 2011. Mortality fell further to 68.3% (using the CDC bottle bioassay) during August 2011.
