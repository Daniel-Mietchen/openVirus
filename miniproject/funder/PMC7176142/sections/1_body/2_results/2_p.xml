<p>Seroprevalence and seroconversion data from individuals that provided samples at baseline and follow-up are presented in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> (also see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008097.s003">S1 Summary</xref>). In both the intervention and control arms, approximately 90% of participants had antibodies to at least one DENV serotype at baseline and approximately 85% of all participants were seronegative to at least one DENV serotype. There was a significant difference in overall seroconversion rates (seroconversion to any individual serotype or multiple serotypes; p&lt;0.0001) between the intervention and control arms. The intervention arm had an average seroconversion rate of 50.6 per 100 person-years (PY) (CI: 29.9–71.9) and those in the control arm had an average seroconversion rate of 37.4 per 100 PY (CI: 15.2–51.7). This represents a statistically significant mean difference of 13.2 (CI: 12.0–14.4), with higher incidence in the intervention arm, or a difference equivalent to 35% of the average rate in the control arm.
