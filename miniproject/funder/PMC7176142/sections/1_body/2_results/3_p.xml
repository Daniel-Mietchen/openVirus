<p>For entomological endpoints, the adult female 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> index and the Breteau Index are shown in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008097.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008097.g004">4</xref>; other indices are presented in supplementary material (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008097.s003">S1 Summary</xref>). Overall, entomological indices were similar across treatment and control arms over the course of the study (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). There were no significant differences detected between the intervention and control arms for any of the adult or immature
