<p>Data were exported from a custom Microsoft Access database and analyzed using SAS statistical analysis software version 9.3 and R version 3.4.3. The effect of the intervention was estimated by calculating cluster-level summary measures and comparing them between arms by unpaired 
 <italic>t</italic> test. For seroconversion, a rate per person-year was calculated for each cluster. Those at risk were those with a baseline PRNT measurement indicating they were not already positive for all four DENV serotypes. The numerator for the rate was the number of people who seroconverted to one or more serotypes between the surveys. The denominator was the person-time between the first and second surveys of those at risk. For the entomological endpoints, the area under the curve was calculated for each cluster. The follow-up values of the entomological endpoints were summarized in terms of the area under the curve (AUC) of the index against time estimated by trapezium rule, taking each time point as the mean survey date for each cluster [
