<p>Routine monitoring of insecticidal efficacy using WHO cone bioassays [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] was implemented. At baseline, 12 new curtains were tested and showed 100% mortality using the local susceptible Bellavista-Nanay 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> strain. After the ITCs had been hanging for 6 months (May 2010), a representative sample of 18 curtains was collected from randomly selected houses, according to a matrix of characteristics (6 of each colour, exposed to either sun or shade and washed 0, 1 or &gt;1 times). Results were highly variable and ranged from 34%-100% mortality, with 8 of the curtains falling below the 80% mortality threshold, with no discernible pattern attributable to curtain color, sun exposure, or washing frequency. After hanging for 8 months (July 2010), a further 18 ITCs were selected for testing using the same methodology. Results showed further declines in bioefficacy, with 13 of the curtains falling below the 80% mortality threshold (range: 14%-100%). After hanging for 11 months (October 2010), the same process was repeated and all except for 1 curtain fell below the 80% mortality threshold (range: 32%-98%). Therefore, to ensure an effective intervention was present in the treated households for the remaining period of the study, curtains were re-treated with deltamethrin in the form of KO Tab 123 (Bayer) during November 2010, with a total of 3,886 curtains (91.9%) re-treated. Further cone bioassays to assess ITC efficacy were conducted 1 month following re-treatment (January 2011) and 9-months following re-treatment (August 2011) using the susceptible New Orleans
