<p>The sample size calculation was based on data from 2 previous studies [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] using DENV PRNT status at 9-month intervals in residents of Iquitos. Hayes &amp; Bennett’s [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] sample size calculation method for binary data was used with the following parameters, which were chosen to lie within the range of values found in the previous studies: average of 120 people at risk per clusters, between-cluster coefficient of variation of 0.30, significance level 5% (two-sided), and seroconversion rate in control and intervention clusters of 0.25 and 0.1375/year respectively (55% efficacy). Using these parameters, 10 clusters per arm were needed for 90% power. This was estimated to provide 4,000 blood samples at baseline (2,000 per arm; more than the 1350 required to detect a difference) and an estimated 2,000 at each subsequent sample period, assuming that &gt;50% of the population remained susceptible to ≥1 serotype. All individuals above the age of 3 years living in the study area who consented to provide baseline and follow-up blood samples were enrolled in a longitudinal cohort. Blood samples were collected from the study population at baseline and at 9-months after the ITCs were distributed. No clusters were lost to follow-up (
