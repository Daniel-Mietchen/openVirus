<p>After receiving informed consent, blood samples were collected by either finger stick or venipuncture, the former usually being more acceptable, at baseline and at 9-months post-ITC distribution. Samples were analyzed for DENV neutralizing antibodies using a plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) with a 70% reduction for the cut-off (PRNT
 <sub>70</sub>). PRNT
 <sub>70</sub> were performed as described by Morrison et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] for each DENV serotype (1â€“4) at the following serum dilutions: 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, and 1:640. Probit analysis was carried out to determine the estimated endpoint titers for each serotype. A serum sample was considered positive for DENV if a dilution neutralized 70% of the test virus at the following cut-off titers: 1:60 for DENV1 and DENV3, 1:80 for DENV2, and 1:40 for DENV4. A seroconversion was scored when the percent increase in reduction between a negative sample and a subsequent sample was greater than 2-fold. During the study period Iquitos experienced a DENV4 outbreak. Consequently, most new infections were presumed to be DENV4. The primary outcome of our trial was seroconversion over the course of the follow-up period.
