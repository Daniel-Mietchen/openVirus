<p>To examine the impact of the ITCs on adult and immature 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> abundance, longitudinal entomological surveillance was implemented at the beginning of the study, with a baseline entomological survey during October 2009. Larval and pupal surveys and adult mosquito collections using battery-operated aspirators [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] were conducted in all houses in treatment and control clusters. The first follow-up entomological survey occurred during January 2010 and subsequent follow-up surveys occurred during May 2010, February 2011 and May-June 2011. Either the CDC bottle bioassay [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] were conducted to determine susceptibility of local 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations to deltamethrin at baseline (Nov. 2009), May 2010, July 2010, February 2011, April 2011, and August 2011. Eggs were collected from clusters using ovitraps and were hatched and reared to adults (F0) for use in bioassays. Entomological data was a secondary outcome of the trial. The number of adult female

 <italic>aegypti</italic> per house had the greatest relevance to transmission risk [
