<p>Our parallel arm cluster-randomized controlled trial began during October 2009 in the district of San Juan in Iquitos, which is located in the Amazon region of north-eastern Peru (73.2°W longitude, 3.7°S latitude, 120 m above sea level). The primary outcome measure was reduction of DENV seroconversion, as measured by detection of dengue-specific plaque reduction neutralizing antibodies in human blood taken from householders within the study area (

In late September 2009, prior to commencement of field activities, treatment was randomized so that 10 clusters received ITCs and 10 clusters did not receive ITCs (control clusters). Clusters were allocated to the intervention or control arm by simple randomization using a lottery: each cluster was represented by a piece of paper which was drawn in turn from a bag by study personnel. ITCs were thus allocated at the start of the trial, which obviated the need for allocation concealment. Clusters were geographically contiguous in the same region of the city.
