<p>Bioassays detected an increase in resistance to deltamethrin in the local 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> population over the course of the study. Resistance was first detected in early 2011, after ITCs had been deployed for over a year, soon after they were re-treated with deltamethrin. This initial detection of resistance was worrying, because it could indicate that low concentrations of insecticide on ITCs that were not adequately loaded with deltamethrin (the reason why the re-treatment was carried out) had already begun to select for deltamethrin resistance in the local mosquito population.
