<p>Other complicating factors that should be considered for interpretation of our results are the close proximity of the study clusters, high mobility [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] of people in Iquitos, and study duration. Treated clusters were located across the street from untreated clusters. There were a few reports of family members in treated clusters loaning curtains to family members in an untreated cluster. The study population did not spend 100% of their time at their homes under protection of the ITCs. Theoretically, randomization would control for this, but a penalization for human movement patterns in and out of clusters was not included in our original sample size calculations or study design. After our CRT had been carried out, a series of publications offered recommendations for how to enhance the design CRTs to assess the epidemiological effects of interventions against

 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The geographic spacing of clusters and accounting for human movement will be critical for future CRT study designs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Of particular relevance to our study are insights that would minimize the complicating effects of movement and ways to gather movement data that will support quantifying a person’s time under coverage; e.g., see [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. We measured seroconversions for only a single 9-month period (i.e., a single transmission season) and discontinued the study because of higher transmission rates observed in the ITC treated areas, which was associated with a high force of infection for DENV4 and unusually high entomological indices. A minimum of 2 transmission seasons is needed to account for interannual variation in virus transmission and vector population dynamics.
