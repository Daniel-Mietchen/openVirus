<p>While the outcomes of our study were unanticipated, they highlight several key challenges related to the widespread community use of ITCs to reduce dengue transmission. First, key dynamics influencing the potential of this tool in Iquitos appeared to have been dependent on human behavior in ways other than those we had considered. For example, while the community readily adopted and used the ITCs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], they may have done so at the expense of other protective measures. Hence households using ITCs that were later confirmed to be faulty, were at greater risk of seroconverting to dengue. Future ITC-based interventions will need to take great care in emphasizing that ITCs should supplement, rather than replace, existing protective strategies. Second, the quality of the insecticide-treated material is fundamental to the success of the intervention. Failures in efficacy can lead to difficulty in interpreting results from a trial. The reduced insecticidal effect of the ITCs was associated with the initial detection of deltamethrin resistance in the local

 <italic>aegypti</italic> because arbovirus control programs are heavily reliant on a limited number of approved insecticides. All insecticide-based interventions should include rigorous quality control during mass production of the finished trial product, to minimize the possibility that sublethal doses of insecticide are deployed in target localities, which can lead to multiple negative consequences.
