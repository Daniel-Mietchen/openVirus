<p>The results indicate that participants living in the intervention arm were not better protected from DENV exposure than those in the control arm, despite the widespread use of ITCs. Although entomological indicators appeared to be lower in the intervention arm, most notably at the first follow-up survey, the differences were not statistically significant and were not sustained over the course of the study. These findings are in contrast with previous studies that have demonstrated clear entomological impacts of ITCs in cluster-randomized trials (CRT) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], no other CRT had been powered based on seroconversion data. This trial was unique, therefore, because it benefited from multiple years of data collection from previous studies of dengue epidemiology in Iquitos. That stated, participants in the intervention arm were more likely to report reduced use of other mosquito products due to the feeling of protection from the ITCs compared to those in the control arm [
