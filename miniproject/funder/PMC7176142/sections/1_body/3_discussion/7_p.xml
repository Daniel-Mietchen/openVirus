<p>Since this trial was completed a growing body of evidence indicates that the potential for ITCs as vector control tools for reducing DENV transmission likely depends more on how effectively they act as physical barriers to prevent mosquito ingress, than on how well they deliver and sustain insecticidal efficacy. ITCs tightly fitted as screens to windows (and doors) reduced indoor mosquito densities for long periods, even when they were untreated or after the insecticide treatment had been lost [
