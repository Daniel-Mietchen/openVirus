<p>Results related to analyses of behaviors associated with ITC use provided the first indication that the ITCs were not functioning as expected. During focus group discussions conducted 6 months after the ITCs were hung, a common theme that emerged was the perception that the ITCs were working initially, but that their insecticidal impact seemed to wane rapidly. These observations were corroborated with quantitative data collected during a knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) survey, which was conducted 9-months after ITCs were deployed. A third of the KAP survey respondents reported that they observed a temporary drop in the amount of mosquitoes in their homes. Overall, the surveyed population perceived that mosquito numbers were only lowered for an average of 3.3 months after the ITCs were hung [
