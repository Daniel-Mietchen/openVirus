<p>Insecticide-treated materials (ITMs) deployed as bednets are highly effective in preventing transmission of malaria [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and other nocturnally transmitted vector-borne diseases including Chagas disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], leishmaniasis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and lymphatic filariasis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Control of dengue diurnal vectors using ITMs has similarly been demonstrated, mainly as insecticide treated curtains (ITCs) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The residual formulations of insecticides used on ITCs allow for a potentially long-lasting effect, and ITCs are ‘user-friendly’, requiring little additional work or behavioral change by householders. They are also well accepted by communities [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], because their perceived efficacy is reinforced by the reduction in other biting insects, cockroaches, houseflies and other insect pests [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].
