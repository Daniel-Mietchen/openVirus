<p>Dengue is a major public health problem, with an estimated 390 million dengue virus (DENV) infections occurring annually worldwide [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Control of the peridomestic DENV mosquito vector, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (and to a lesser extent, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>), is currently the primary preventive measure. Existing vector control methods largely target immature mosquito stages, requiring continuous effort by communities [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and are often challenging to sustain [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Because adult mosquitoes are responsible for virus transmission, targeting adults, rather than the aquatic stages, should have the most direct impact on virus transmission. The most common interventions targeting adult

 <italic>aegypti</italic> employ ultra-low volume (ULV) insecticide spray applications. ULV spraying does not offer any residual insecticidal effect, and studies indicate that ULV spraying is ineffective unless repeated frequently at closely timed intervals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Hence, it is most practical when employed for outbreak response rather than for routine dengue control [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008097.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Novel interventions utilizing residual insecticides that target adult

 <italic>aegypti</italic> are needed to increase the options for effective dengue vector control programs.
