<p id="Par57">Findings from this trial are expected to provide information on a scalable strategy (a “change package”) to address shortcomings in the implementation of integrated TB-HIV treatment and services. If successful, the strategy could make a contribution to reducing TB-HIV-associated mortality and morbidity in South Africa and other regions of the world where co-infection with TB and HIV is a concern. In 2013, WHO performed a joint review of HIV, TB, and prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) programmes in South Africa, which recommended the need for context-specific mechanisms for the delivery of integrated TB-HIV services at PHC and community level, with particular focus on improving access to TB and HIV services for children, adolescents, and key populations. Some studies undertaken in the South African PHC clinic setting have shown that the QI strategy can be effective as an intervention for PMTCT care [

An important component of the QI model is the PDSA cycle, comprising learning cycles to test and revise theory-based predictions as recommended by Taylor et al. (2014) in their systematic review on the application of the PDSA method to improve quality in healthcare [

We anticipate that the findings from this trial will offer an affordable and sustainable strategy through use of the QI model to effectively improve the integration of TB-HIV programmes. The study results will be communicated to stakeholders through dissemination meetings, conferences, and publication in peer-reviewed journals. Recommendations would be made based on the study findings for appropriate actions to be considered and taken by the department of health and relevant authorities in areas with high burden of TB and HIV.
