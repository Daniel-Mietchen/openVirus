<p id="Par34">Models of TB-HIV integration have ranged from TB clinics referring patients to HIV clinics and vice versa to full integration where both services are available at a single facility, on the same day, by the same healthcare worker [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A group of South African researchers developed a model to illustrate the critical health system mechanisms that are essential to operationalize TB and HIV service integration [

 <italic>Functional integration</italic> which is the extent to which integration is supported at the policy and budget level; 
 <italic>Clinical integration</italic> which is the extent to which TB and HIV care, treatment, diagnostic testing, and health education activities are taking place concurrently; and 
 <italic>Organizational integration</italic> which is the extent to which facility level resources (e.g., staff, infrastructure, space, patient files, and data systems) and processes (e.g., patient flow) are integrated [

 <italic>how</italic> TB and HIV service integration should be integrated. Quality improvement as a method to improve organizational and clinical integration is on the cusp of widespread roll out in South African Department of Health facilities and there is enough support and political will for creating a culture of quality improvement (QI) in facilities [
