<p id="Par35">We propose a theoretical framework which is an adaptation of the Uyei et al. (2014) model that demonstrates the central role of QI as a catalyst to operationalizing integration. The SUTHI study intervention has targeted PHC supervisors and frontline clinic staff as the recipients of the QI intervention. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates that through continuous QI activities, we theorize that organizational and clinical integration can be improved and strengthened and lead to improved patient and organizational outcomes. Using the collaborative breakthrough series approach, developed by the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI) [

Our framework proposes that QI alone may not be sufficient to bring about improvements in integrated service delivery hence evaluating, measuring, and monitoring environmental and contextual factors (confounders) as well as delivering a good quality QI intervention is key to improving TB, HIV, and integrated TB-HIV services.
