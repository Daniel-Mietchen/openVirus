<p id="Par32">Initiation of cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) before or with ART, irrespective of CD4 count, in co-infected patients has been shown to reduce severe bacterial infections in an observational study [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The clinical benefits associated with the use of CPT was adopted by WHO for use as an adjunctive therapy for improved outcomes in the management of TB and HIV co-infected patients in the 2014 treatment guidelines [
