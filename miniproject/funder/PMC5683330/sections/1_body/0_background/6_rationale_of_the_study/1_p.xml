Cost-effective and sustainable strategies to strengthen integration of known effective TB-HIV interventions in primary health care (PHC) clinics, the main service delivery point for millions of patients, will abrogate the high mortality associated with TB-HIV co-infection [

A systematic review by Uyei and colleagues in 2011 of observational studies using secondary data on TB-HIV integration in sub-Saharan Africa found several benefits from integration and identified the need for additional research to identify barriers to integration as well as strategies to improve TB-HIV integration [
