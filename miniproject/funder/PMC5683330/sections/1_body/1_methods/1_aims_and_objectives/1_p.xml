<p id="Par36">This study aims to reduce mortality due to TB, HIV, and TB-HIV co-infection through a QI strategy for scaling up of TB and HIV treatment integration in rural PHC clinics in South Africa. The hypothesis is that survival rates will be lower in TB, HIV, and TB-HIV co-infected patients accessing health care at clinics implementing the study intervention to deliver integrated TB-HIV care, compared to survival in patients accessing health care at clinics that provide only the standard of care for people with TB and or HIV.</p>
