<p id="Par45">Randomization will occur at the level of the PHC supervisor. This is being done to avoid contamination of intervention effects into control clinics since each supervisor routinely supports multiple clinics. Each PHC clinic supervisor will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or control arm. The study investigators would provide a list of facilities and supervisors to be randomized using a computer-generated randomization list generated by study statistician. In South Africa, a PHC clinic supervisor fulfills a management role at PHC clinics [

Each PHC clinic supervisor may oversee between three and five PHC clinics within one district. Therefore, through randomization of 14–16 PHC clinic supervisors working in both the Ugu district and King Cetshwayo district, 40 clinics (20 in each arm) will be enrolled into this study as each supervisor oversees on average three to five medium-sized clinics. Not all clinics under the purview of the PHC clinic supervisors randomized will be enrolled into the study. Clinics will be excluded if ART services are not offered on site, services are run by a single nurse, and if they are mobile clinics or clinics located within hospitals. All eligible clinics enrolled in the control arm of this trial will receive the prevailing standard-of-care for TB-HIV integration (Fig.

While the study team will not interfere with any additional benefit that control clinics may receive (for example, support from other NGOs), changes to the background standard of care will be recorded systematically and accounted for in the final analysis.
