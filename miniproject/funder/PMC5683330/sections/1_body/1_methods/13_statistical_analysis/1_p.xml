<p id="Par56">The primary outcome of mortality and secondary outcomes will be analyzed using cluster-summary methods. The primary outcome will be analyzed among TB-HIV co-infected patients only while the secondary outcomes will be analyzed among TB-HIV co-infected, HIV-only, and TB-only patients. Mortality rate per arm will be calculated as geometric mean of cluster-level summaries and will be compared using unpaired 
 <italic>t</italic> test. The same technique will be applied to secondary outcomes. The 
 <italic>t</italic> test applied in cluster-level summaries is one of the robust methods of analyzing unmatched trials especially when there are small number of clusters per arm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Since we have 16 clusters and 40 sub-clusters, multi-level regression will be used as secondary analyses. Proportional hazard regression with random effects (frailty models) will be used for analyses of time-to-event outcomes. Generalized estimating equations and mixed effects linear models will be used for binary and quantitative outcomes, respectively. These models will take the clustering by PHC supervisor and clinic into account through the random effects. They will also allow us to adjust for baseline variables, especially those with imbalance between arms, as this is likely when clusters are fewer. The HCW interviews will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as means and frequencies. Adjusted baseline descriptive statistics will be calculated as the means of the cluster-level summaries and characteristics of the two arms will be compared using 
 <italic>t</italic> test or rank sum tests. Individual-level summaries at baseline will be compared using 
 <italic>t</italic> test or rank sum tests and Fisherâ€™s exact test. Data will be analyzed with SAS version 9.4 (or higher) (SAS Institute INC., Cary N.C, USA).
