<p id="Par54">We anticipate that about 6000 HIV-positive patients will be diagnosed with active TB in the study population during a 12-month period. This is based on the assumption that between 100 and 200 new TB-HIV co-infected patients are seen in each of the 40 clinics per year. This translates to an average of 350 patients per cluster (assume unequal cluster sizes). Assuming a case fatality rate of 15% in the control arm, coefficient of variation between 0.25 and 0.35, and a type I error rate of 5%, we will have 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in mortality. The chances of detecting other levels of effectiveness are shown in TableÂ
