<p id="Par47">Systematic testing of change ideas will be evaluated through a rapid sequence of steps called the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. The PDSA cycle is a sequential framework for examining problems, deriving solutions, measuring progress, and embedding changes leading to positive outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Selected HCWs from the study intervention clinics will be trained on QI methodology. This training will enable establishment of QI teams in intervention clinics to work test and implement change ideas to advance implementation of the TB-HIV integration interventions in rapid cycle (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and exchange successful ideas for change with other intervention sites through the learning collaborative. Furthermore, measures will be taken to prevent inadvertent cross-contamination of change ideas (e.g., by avoiding any convening of intervention and control clinics or personnel).
