<p id="Par46">Quality improvement is described as a set of continuous actions through coordinated effort of HCW teams aimed at accelerating improvements to patient care and health outcomes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This is done through iterative changes and peer-to-peer learning about successful changes and has been demonstrated to significantly improve HCW performance and lead to sustainable delivery of quality care with improved health outcomes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Breakthrough Series (BTS) is an example of quality improvement through learning collaborative, demonstrated to successfully impact health outcomes in developing-country settings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The learning collaborative brings together clinic teams at regular intervals to learn QI methods and exchange challenges and successes in efforts to implement the TB-HIV care pathway (learning sessions). Each clinic will form a QI team that will work with the PHC supervisor and QI mentors between these learning sessions to develop local ideas for implementing a specific area of care, regularly measure performance using agreed-upon indicators, and bring back those results and emerging best practices to other clinic teams through periodic learning sessions. We aim to use this structured implementation approach to improve reliable delivery of published evidence-based interventions known to decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with TB and HIV. The main measure of the collaborativeâ€™s success will be measurable improvement in the magnitude, maintenance, and speed of specific steps of TB-HIV integration, ascertained through time-series analyses. These analyses will be collected and acted upon in real-time and will include process and outcome indicators. The magnitude of TB-HIV integration implementation will be measured by the extent to which interventions provide measurable improvements in PHC process indicators from baseline (e.g., coverage of HCT and IPT services among eligible patients, improvements in quality of services, proportion of HIV-infected patients offered IPT following a negative TB screening). We will also track the speed at which each of the eight TB-HIV integration interventions are implemented (e.g., the number of months taken to reach 90% implementation of individual integration interventions) and factors affecting speed of intervention uptake in the clinics.
