<p id="Par50">Three collaborative learning sessions and additional QI support (mentoring and coaching) visits at specific time points during the study period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) will be pre-arranged. Collaborative learning session one will coach teams in the use of a range of QI methods and tools (process mapping, fishbone system analysis, PDSA cycles, use of line graphs, and other data for improvement). Areas requiring improvement will be identified and prioritized, and aim statements encompassing specific aims and targets will be developed. Brainstorming by the QI team and process mapping will be done to define a strategy to effect positive change (“a change idea”). The PDSA cycles tracking a set of predefined indicators will be reviewed bi-weekly by the QI team to test if the recently adopted change idea resulted in performance improvement, throughout the study period. This will enable the generation of new ideas for improvement, iterative testing of these ideas, and monitoring of progress attained through use of run charts and graphs. Learning session two, scheduled 6 months later will review learnings for all successful change ideas and challenges against overall clinic performance, with the goal of scaling back on frequency of QI support meetings for clinics that are undertaking reliable improvement work. Learning session three, scheduled at month 12, will be focused on review and scalability of the final successful change package. It is anticipated that after learning session three, the clinic’s QI teams would sustain successful change ideas. Lessons learned will also be shared and documented across the intervention teams. At the successful conclusion of the projects, the intention is to scale up a reliable “change package” of successful, tested changes across all clinics in the two districts, if not across the entire district.
