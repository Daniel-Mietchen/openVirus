<p>Because of stigma and social discrimination, Chinese MSM do not stay in their hometowns, where they are easily recognized by acquaintances [

HIV strains from epidemiologically linked individuals are more similar than HIV strains from epidemiologically unassociated individuals [

Thus, the genetic relatedness of HIV-1 can reflect the relationships between infected individuals, based on which the potential genetic transmission networks can be inferred [

Recently, with advances in molecular epidemiology, analyses of genetic transmission networks can help HIV researchers and public health professionals understand how HIV is spread within and between populations and further deliver efficient and effective interventions [
