<p>In the study performed during 2010–2012, five HIV-1 genotypes (CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC, URFs, subtype B and CRF08_BC) were found among MSM in Kunming [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, in addition to the above five genotypes, two CRFs (CRF55_01B and CRF59_01B) were newly identified, which suggested that HIV-1 genetic diversity among MSM had increased. The top three HIV-1 genotypes, namely, CRF01_AE, CRF07_BC and URFs, did not change. Compared with those of the data collected during 2010–2012, the proportions of CRF07_BC, URFs, Subtype B and CRF08_BC showed no significant differences; however, the proportion of CRF01_AE was significantly reduced (45.3% in 2013–2015 versus 64.9% in 2010–2012, χ
 <sup>2</sup> = 11.993, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Of the 22 URFs, 90.9% (20/22) were CRF01_AE-related URFs, and 54.5% (12/22) were CRF07_BC-related URFs, consistent with CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC being the two predominant HIV-1 strains in this population.
