<p>HIV-1 transmission networks based on genetic relations can be utilized to explore the characteristics of HIV-1 transmission among a given population [

 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our study, a genetic distance of 0.03 substitutions/site and 90% bootstrap support were used to define transmission clusters. Many factors can influence the choice of genetic distance and branch support thresholds, such as spatial and temporal scales of analysis, HIV subtype, the underlying mode of transmission, and the viral genomic region(s) being analyzed [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Clusters that are defined by a short distance will reflect recent transmissions and frequent samplings [

 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. When the goal is to detect distinct transmission events (i.e., two individuals) that may be separated by a long period of time during which the viral populations diverged, a higher genetic distance threshold should be used [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our study, 273 subjects had the CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocyte counts, of whom 44.3% (121/273) had CD4 &lt;350 cells/μl, which suggested that our dataset included some individuals with long-term HIV infection. In a similar study, a genetic distance threshold of 0.03 substitutions/site was used to define transmission clusters for long-standing infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In a recent study, Wertheim et al. suggested that a genetic distance threshold can be estimated as total viral genetic diversity between two transmission partners within the first 10 years of infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], which means the accumulated evolution time within two transmission partners since the transmission event is no more than 20 years. For our sequence sets, the mean estimated evolutionary rates of CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC were 2.54×10
 <sup>−3</sup> and 1.71×10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions site
 <sup>-1</sup> year
 <sup>-1</sup>. Based on the abovementioned assumption, the genetic distance threshold for CRF01_AE tends to be less than 0.0508 substitutions/site, and that for CRF07_BC tends to be less than 0.0342 substitutions/site. Thus, the genetic distance of 0.03 substitutions/site used in our study is in a rational range. With this distance, we could describe the longitudinal trend in the HIV transmission network among local MSM.
