<p>Among the MSM reported in Kunming during 2010–2015, 35.4% were involved in the genetic transmission networks. In theory, infectious diseases are transmitted in the form of a network, and thus, each “infector” should have at least one potential transmission partner and be involved in one cluster. However, two-thirds of the subjects not found to be linked to any other subject. The primary reason for this statistic may be the efficiency of sampling and the complexity of the epidemic, especially for some widely circulating genotypes, such as CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC. For these two CRFs, the proportion of subjects identified in the networks was lower than those for some newly introduced CRFs, such as CRF08_BC and CRF59_01B. However, as we found in this study, subjects with more partners were more likely to be identified in the genetic transmission networks.</p>
