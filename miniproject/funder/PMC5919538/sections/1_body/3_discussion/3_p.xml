<p>CRF55_01B and CRF59_01B are two 01B CRFs that were originally identified in the MSM population in China: CRF55_01B was identified among MSM in southern China [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], while CRF59_01B was identified among MSM in northeastern China [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Of the four individuals with CRF55_01B, two were from Guangdong and two were Kunming natives. These four individuals were not found in the genetic transmission networks, suggesting that these individuals were independently infected with CRF55_01B. By retrospective analysis, we found that CRF59_01B had already existed among MSM during 2010–2012. Furthermore, the five CRF59_01B 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences collected during 2010–2015 were all involved in one genetic transmission cluster, suggesting that they might have derived from one individual.
