<p>In summary, we consecutively tracked the dynamic changes in HIV-1 genetic characteristics among MSM in Kunming. In addition to the genotypes previously detected in this population, two new CRFs, CRF55_01B and CRF59_01B, were found for the first time in this study. The demographic history of the main HIV-1 strains suggested that the 2000s were a rapid-growth period for CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC. The genetic transmission network analysis suggested that MSM with more sexual partners were more easily detected in the networks and that early-diagnosed MSM with HIV were still active in HIV transmission. With the accumulation of genetic data, further genetic transmission network analyses should be performed, which could then help us target interventions to high-risk individuals.</p>
