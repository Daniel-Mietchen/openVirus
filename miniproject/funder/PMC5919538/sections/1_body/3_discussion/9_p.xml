<p>The prevalence of SDRMs among antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naïve MSM was 5.0% during 2013–2015, which was not significantly higher than that in 2010–2012 (4.6%, χ

 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In the present study, all the individuals carrying SDRMs came from Yunnan Province, and eight were single. This result suggested that the drug resistance transmission was localized. Strikingly, a strain harboring drug-resistant mutations to NRTIs, NNRTIs and PIs (T215S, Y188L and L90M) was confirmed to be transmitted in the genetic transmission networks. If ART is to be expanded among MSM, TDR surveillance will be necessary to prevent the spread of such strains.
