<p>CRF08_BC appears to be a distinctive strain in Yunnan MSM; this strain was rarely found among MSM outside Yunnan. However, CRF08_BC was also the predominant genotype among heterosexually transmitted individuals in Yunnan [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our previous work suggests that bisexual behavior might have mediated CRF08_BC transmission from heterosexually infected individuals into the MSM population [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Of the seven MSM infected with CRF08_BC, six were found in two genetic transmission clusters, suggesting that this strain was gradually disseminated into this population. However, a number of individuals infected with CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC among MSM have contributed to HIV transmission in this population. Bayesian skyline plots were used to examine EPS of CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC, which grew exponentially from 2001 to 2010 and 2005 to 2009, respectively. Notably, routine HIV/AIDS intervention for MSM was initiated in 2008 in Yunnan Province, which may have had certain effects in preventing further growth and diversity.
