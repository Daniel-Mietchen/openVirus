<p>We also found that more than 70% of genetic transmission clusters contained subjects reported in the different years. Among the earlier reported subjects (during 2010–2012), the proportion of subjects with ≥2 links was higher. Because of the issue of sampling density, the possibility cannot be completely excluded that the descendant viral strains indirectly links to their ancestor. However, an individual with multiple links could be more associated with HIV transmission than one with only one link. In other words, individuals with multiple links could have potentially higher transmission risk. Especially, we should pay attention to the earlier diagnosed HIV-infected subjects with multiple links, who might be still active in transmission networks and could be the potential intervention targets. Therefore, in addition to the routine interventions aimed at associated risk factors, interventions such as active care and early antiretroviral therapy targeting identified HIV-positive MSM should be promoted, as these methods could improve quality of life and decrease further HIV transmission by lowering community viral load [

The analysis of genetic transmission networks may be a useful method to find growing clusters and screen out the potentially high-risk individuals, allowing us to deliver the targeted interventions. Thus, we should continue to perform regular analyses of genetic transmission among MSM.
