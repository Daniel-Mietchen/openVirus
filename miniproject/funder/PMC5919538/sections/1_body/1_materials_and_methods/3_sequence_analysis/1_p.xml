<p>The assembly of the different sequences generated from the same gene region of each sample was performed using the DNA sequence analysis software Sequencher 5.0 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). ClustalW multiple alignments were performed using Bio-Edit 7.0 software. Reference sequences were obtained from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) database (

Phylogenetic tree analyses were performed using the neighbor-joining method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model with 1000 bootstrap replicates, using MEGA version 6.0 [
