<p>The evolutionary rates and effective population sizes (EPS) of CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC were inferred for the 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The dataset included 167 CRF01_AE and 105 CRF07_BC 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences identified in both the present and previous studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Based on the previous study, the general time reversible (GTR) model plus a gamma distribution (Γ4) among site rate heterogeneity (I) model (GTR+I+4) was chosen as the nucleotide substitution model [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Bayesian MCMC analyses were performed using a Bayesian uncorrelated exponential relaxed molecular clock method in combination with the ‘Bayesian skyline’ coalescent tree priors under the selected nucleotide substitution model in the BEAST v1.7.4 package [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Each MCMC analysis was run for 50 million generations and sampled every 5,000 generations. For each CRF, the log and tree files from two independent runs were combined with LogCombiner. The combined log files were viewed with Tracer v1.5, which showed that the effective sampling sizes (ESS) of the parameters were no less than 200, and the runs converged. Combining the parameter log files with the appropriated trees log files, Bayesian skyline plots were constructed with Tracer v1.5.
