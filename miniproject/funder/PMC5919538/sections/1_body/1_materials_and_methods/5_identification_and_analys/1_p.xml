 <italic>pol</italic> sequences hold sufficient variability for the reconstruction of transmission histories [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and have been routinely used for transmission network analyses in the previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this study, the detection of meaningful transmission clusters depends on high support value (bootstrap or posterior probability) and low intra-cluster genetic distance. The phylogenetic tree was constructed with 308 MSM 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences identified in Kunming during 2010–2015, by using the neighbor-joining method based on the Tamura-Nei 93 model (

 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Transmission clusters were defined as those with node support thresholds greater than 90% and intra-cluster maximum pairwise genetic distances of less than 3.0% nucleotide substitutions per site [

 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The pairwise genetic distances of all sequences within the available clusters were calculated based on which minimum genetic distances algorithm was used to define the linkages within a cluster [
 <xref rid="pone.0196548.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For visualizing and analyzing the networks, the data were processed using a custom R script utilizing the network package in R software [
