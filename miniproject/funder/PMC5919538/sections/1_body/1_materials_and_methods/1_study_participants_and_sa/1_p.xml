<p>A total of 190 newly confirmed HIV-1-positive MSM blood samples were continuously collected between January 2013 and December 2015 through fixed voluntary counseling and testing sites (VCTs) and non-government organizations (NGOs) in Kunming City, Yunnan Province. The corresponding demographic characteristics, including the total lifetime number of partners, were also collected by the staff working at these VCTs and NGOs. HIV-1 infection status was determined by an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA, Biomerieux, France) and confirmed by Western blot assay (HIV BLOT 2.2, MP Diagnostics, Singapore). All HIV tests were informed and voluntary. Written consent was obtained from all participants. The study was approved by the Biomedical Ethics Review Committee of Yunnan Province.</p>
