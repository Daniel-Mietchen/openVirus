<p>Among the 179 subjects with 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences obtained during 2013â€“2015, nine (5.0%) were identified harboring SDRMs (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196548.t004">Table 4</xref>). The proportions of sequences with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs) were 2.2% (4/179), 2.8% (5/179), and 2.2% (4/179), respectively. Except for one NRTI-related mutation (K219Q) and one NNRTI-related mutation (Y181C) detected in one subject, the drug resistance mutations (T215S, K103N, Y188L, M46I and L90M) occurred at least twice. Among the nine sequences harboring SDRMs, two (14KMM036 and 14KMM051) had the same three drug-resistant mutations (T215S, Y188L and L90M) and were linked together in the same cluster; three (13KMM037, 13KMM046 and 14KMM016) were segregated into three distinct clusters and had unique drug resistance mutations with respect to their own clusters; the remaining four (13KMM067, 14KMM011, 14KMM039 and 15KMM44) were not found in any clusters. Additionally, all individuals with SDRMs came from Yunnan Province, and eight were single.
