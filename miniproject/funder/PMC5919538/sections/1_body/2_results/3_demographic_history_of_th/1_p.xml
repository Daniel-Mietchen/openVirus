<p>To further investigate the demographic history of the predominant HIV-1 strains among MSM in Yunnan, we examined the changes in effective population size (the number of infected individuals contributing to HIV transmission) by Bayesian skyline plots with 167 CRF01_AE and 105 CRF07_BC 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from the current study and a previous study. For the CRF01_AE lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196548.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), the effective population size initially grew in the early 2000s, underwent exponential growth from approximately 2001 to 2010, and reached a stationary phase thereafter. For the CRF07_BC lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196548.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), the effective population size initially grew in the mid- 2000s, underwent an exponential increase from approximately 2005 to 2009, maintained a slight increase from approximately 2010 to 2012, and became stationary from 2013 onwards. MCMC analyses showed that the mean estimated evolutionary rates of CRF01_AE and CRF07_BC were 2.54×10
