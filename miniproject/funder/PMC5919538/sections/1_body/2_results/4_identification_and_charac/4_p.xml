<p>Of the 109 individuals in the transmission networks, 83 (76.1%) were found to have only one potential transmission partner (one link), and 26 (23.9%) were found to have ≥2 potential transmission partners (≥2 links) (

The 26 individuals with ≥2 links were associated with another 61 individuals in the transmission networks. Furthermore, the proportion of MSM with ≥2 links was higher among those diagnosed before 2013 (
