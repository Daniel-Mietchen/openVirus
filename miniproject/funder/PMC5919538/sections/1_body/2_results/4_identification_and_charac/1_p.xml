<p>A total of 308 MSM 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences identified in Kunming were used for genetic transmission network analysis. All sequences were amplified from the plasma samples obtained for HIV-1 diagnosis during 2010–2015. A total of 109 (35.4%) sequences were linked to at least one other sequence, and these segregated into 38 distinct clusters, with the number of sequences per cluster ranging from 2 to 9 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196548.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Among all clusters, 24 (63.2%) were made up of 2 individuals. The genetic distances between the pairwise sequences in each cluster ranged from 0.000 to 0.0239 substitutions/site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0196548.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Pairs with a genetic distances of ≤ 0.015 substitutions/site accounted for 82.2% of all sequence pairs (120/146).
