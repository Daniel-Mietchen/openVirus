<p>For each sample, the partial 
 <italic>gag</italic> gene (912 bp, encoding portions of p17 and p24), 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene (1197 bp, encoding protease and the first 299 nucleotide residues of reverse transcriptase), and 
 <italic>env</italic> gene (525 bp, encoding the V3-V4 region) were amplified and sequenced. In total, 177 
 <italic>gag</italic> sequences, 179 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences and 155 
 <italic>env</italic> sequences were obtained and used to construct neighbor-joining (NJ) trees for genotyping (

 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic>, a total of 190 samples generated interpretable sequence data, revealing five CRFs, one subtype, and four discrete unique recombinant forms (URFs). Among the study subjects, CRF01_AE was the most common genotype (45.3%, 86/190), followed by CRF07_BC (35.8%, 68 /190), URFs (11.6%, 22/190), CRF08_BC (3.2%, 6/190), CRF55_01B (2.1%, 4/190), subtype B (1.6%, 3/190) and CRF59_01B (0.5%, 1/190) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0196548.t001">Table 1</xref>). The URFs included 12 CRF01_AE/CRF07_BC, six CRF01_AE/C, two CRF01_AE/B, and two BC. The two new CRFs, CRF55_01B and CRF59_01B were found for the first time in this study and did not appear in the results from 2010–2012. The distribution of genotypes by sampling time and by the participants’ permanent residence, age, nationality, marital status, education and occupation revealed no significant differences (
