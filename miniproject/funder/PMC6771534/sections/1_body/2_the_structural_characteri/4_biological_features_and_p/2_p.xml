<p>Among the HSV structural components, tegument proteins are functional molecules that are located between the viral capsid enveloping the genome and the outer membrane.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0066" ref-type="ref">66</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0067" ref-type="ref">67</xref> To date, approximately 24 tegument proteins have been identified and found to play important roles in viral structure,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">68</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">69</xref> as they provide supportive functions for establishing an effective microenvironment for viral proliferation during infection.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">71</xref> Previous reports indicated that the genes encoding seven tegument proteins are conserved between HSV1 and HSV2 and possess high similarity in viruses in the alpha subfamily,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0072" ref-type="ref">72</xref> suggesting important roles for these proteins in viral evolution. Most tegument proteins form complex structures by interacting with each other and anchoring to capsids or membranes to stabilize the viral structure.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">74</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0075" ref-type="ref">75</xref> Topological data suggest that the interactions between tegument proteins and cellular structure may or may not depend upon the myristyl‐ and palmityl‐base anchors produced by posttranslational modifications on the surfaces of these proteins.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0076" ref-type="ref">76</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">77</xref> Interestingly, some tegument proteins play important roles through their interactions with cellular molecules, as they are involved in the viral structural network.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">68</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0073" ref-type="ref">73</xref> Typically, the tegument proteins Vp16 and Vhs, which are encoded by the ul48 and ul41 genes, respectively, can form a trimeric complex with another tegument protein encoded by ul49 (pUL49‐pUL48‐pUL41).
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">78</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">79</xref> Furthermore, VP16 is thought to reside closer to the viral envelope and be part of the outer tegument. VP16 also plays an important role in viral egress downstream of the initial envelopment step.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">80</xref> VP16 is also capable of participating in a supporting structure (pUL36‐pUL37‐pUL48) with two tegument proteins encoded by the ul36 and ul37 genes.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">81</xref> However, most investigations of VP16 and Vhs have focused on their biological functions in regulating the transcription of the viral genome and interfering with host RNA synthesis, respectively.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">82</xref> VP16 was found to interact with the cellular transcripts octamer‐binding transcription factor 1 (Oct‐1) and host cell factor 1 (HCF‐1) and to initiate transcription of the viral α‐gene via a three‐component complex, which controls viral proliferation in cells, probably including neurons.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0083" ref-type="ref">83</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0084" ref-type="ref">84</xref> Vhs plays roles in interfering with host RNA synthesis and providing a space for transcription during viral proliferation.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0085" ref-type="ref">85</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0086" ref-type="ref">86</xref> Studies have suggested the biological and pathological significance of tegument proteins in viral structure and infection. Importantly, the findings of these studies have also implied that if tegument proteins were recognized by the immune system during infection, the pathological effects of the virus could be limited to some extent; the deletion of some tegument proteins could also be a way to influence viral pathogenesis. A study of the tegument protein UL7 suggested similar results, as the UL7‐UL51 complex was found to colocalize with gE in the nuclear region of infected cells.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">87</xref> The deletion of the ul7 gene eliminates this colocalization but does not affect viral structural.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0088" ref-type="ref">88</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0089" ref-type="ref">89</xref> Interestingly, partial deletion of this gene could limit viral proliferation and lead to delayed growth kinetics of the virus in cultured cells or animals because UL7 regulates the transcription of the viral α‐gene,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0090" ref-type="ref">90</xref> and this partial deletion could provide an attenuated viral phenotype (Figure 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0091" ref-type="ref">91</xref> Other studies have also suggested that VP22, which is encoded by the ul49 gene, is capable of interacting with cellular cGAS and inhibiting its enzymatic activity, as VP22 functions in the viral structural network.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0070" ref-type="ref">70</xref> The tegument proteins encoded by ul16 and ul46 also show capacities to interact with cellular mitochondria and p85, growth factor receptor bound protein 2 (Grb2), and shc of the Src‐family kinases, respectively, as part of their roles in the viral structural network.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0092" ref-type="ref">92</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0093" ref-type="ref">93</xref> These data describe a specific context for HSV infection, in which the viral strategy is to present only surface glycoproteins to the immune system, as most of the pathogenic viral molecules work within infected cells and can avoid monitoring by the innate and adaptive immune systems through various forms of immune evasion.
