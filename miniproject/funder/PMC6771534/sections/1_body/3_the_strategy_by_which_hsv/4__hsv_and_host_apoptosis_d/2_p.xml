 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0123" ref-type="ref">123</xref> which means that apoptosis is involved in defending against viral infection, as it is triggered by stimuli during lytic viral infection.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0124" ref-type="ref">124</xref> Apoptosis is involved in the disruption of mitochondrial membrane integrity, which releases cytochrome c into the cytoplasm.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0125" ref-type="ref">125</xref> Importantly, Bcl‐family members, including Bcl‐2, Bcl‐w, Bcl‐x
 <sub>L</sub> Bax, Bak, Bad, Bid, Bim, Bik, Noxa, and PUMA, exert proapoptotic or antiapoptotic effects to regulate and integrate this physiological process.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0126" ref-type="ref">126</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0127" ref-type="ref">127</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0128" ref-type="ref">128</xref> In theory, apoptosis should limit HSV proliferation in the cell nucleus, as this process requires more than 18 hours at the primary infection site during the early stage of infection. However, this innate defense mechanism does not effectively repress viral spread from infected epithelial cells to neurons or other tissues, even if apoptotic cells are detectable.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0124" ref-type="ref">124</xref> Previous data have suggested that the immune evasion strategy used by HSV during infection depends to some extent on its antiapoptotic mechanism.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0129" ref-type="ref">129</xref> Studies have shown that soluble viral gD activates the NF‐κB, Akt, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in macrophages and prevents apoptosis triggered by staurosporine. gD is also capable of preventing apoptosis in U937 cells triggered by anti‐Fas antibodies.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0130" ref-type="ref">130</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0131" ref-type="ref">131</xref> Further investigation has shown that this antiapoptotic effect of gD is associated with the upregulation of the expression of the Bcl‐2 and Bcl‐xl genes, which both encode antiapoptosis proteins, and downregulation of the expression of the Bcl‐xs gene, which encodes a protein that promotes apoptosis.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0132" ref-type="ref">132</xref> The mechanism of this process might involve cellular cyclophilin, which is capable of triggering apoptosis, its receptor HS, and signaling pathways associated with the Akt and ERK1/2 complex. Interestingly, HS has been shown to be bound by viral gD. Many studies have focused on the main apoptosis regulator of HSV during infection, the viral serine/threonine protease Us3, and found that the virus is capable of modulating the apoptotic process on the basis of its requirement for cell proliferation during infection.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0133" ref-type="ref">133</xref> Us3 can mediate the posttranslational modification of the Bad protein, which negatively regulates apoptosis through its kinase activity, and block protease A to activate some apoptotic signals via the prephosphorylation of protease A.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0134" ref-type="ref">134</xref> The data also suggest that Us3 can interact with the apoptosis‐related protein programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) to block the initiation of apoptosis in infected cells.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0135" ref-type="ref">135</xref> Us3 enables the attenuation of JNK activity, which assists with the activation of apoptotic signals in a state of cellular stress.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0136" ref-type="ref">136</xref> This capacity was confirmed in a study with a Us3‐deficient strain.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0137" ref-type="ref">137</xref> On the other hand, the viral protein Us5, which is also named gJ, is encoded in a multigene open reading frame with Us3 and is capable of preventing apoptosis triggered by an anti‐Fas antibody.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0138" ref-type="ref">138</xref> Interestingly, the viral immediate protein ICP27 is able to promote or inhibit apoptosis depending upon the infectious background.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0139" ref-type="ref">139</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0140" ref-type="ref">140</xref> These data suggest that HSV possesses a set of mechanisms for regulating apoptosis to proliferate in primary infectious sites and spread to various tissues and cells, especially neurons; preventing or enhancing apoptosis could be part of this viral strategy. Importantly, host apoptosis works to control viral spread and initiate the phagocytosis of dead cells and viruses by the innate immune system,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0141" ref-type="ref">141</xref> which contributes to innate immunity and activates adaptive immunity. The HSV strategy for effectively regulating apoptosis might lead to abnormal progression from innate to adaptive immunity.
