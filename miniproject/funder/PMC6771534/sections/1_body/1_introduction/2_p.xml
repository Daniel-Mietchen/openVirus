<p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) belongs to the alpha subfamily of the human herpesvirus family and includes HSV1 and HSV2, which are responsible for pandemics of various herpes diseases.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref> Both pathogens have similar structural characteristics and are of concern worldwide, not only because the clinical outcome of oral or genital ulcerative lesions has long‐lasting impacts on patient quality of life but also because ocular herpes can lead to blindness, and neonatal herpes or encephalitis can result in higher death rates.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> In addition, the viruses show higher infection rates in various age groups.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Although observations of epidemics in various areas have described different pandemics, infection rates of at least 30% to 60% for HSV1 and 10% to 25% for HSV2 have been recognized by most researchers,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> and approximately 23 million new cases of HSV2 infection are reported annually.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> It is not surprising that a viral disease with such severe clinical outcomes and such a strong spreading trend has been targeted for prophylactic vaccine development. To date, more than 10 HSV prophylactic vaccines, mainly vaccines targeting HSV2, have been developed and evaluated in human clinical trials.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> These vaccines contain antigens that effectively stimulate immune responses and immune memory, as measured by the indicators of neutralizing antibody and specific cellular immune responses in animals or humans.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> These data suggest that the viral antigens selected and designed for vaccines are effective and that the host immune system is capable of recognizing HSV antigens. However, of the vaccines that have undergone evaluation in a clinical trial, none except a vaccine against HSV2 that showed only low efficacy for HSV1 infection but did not work against HSV2 infection has demonstrated sufficient efficacy for further development or commercialization (Table 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that the evaluations currently used in HSV vaccine development, in which antiserum from immunized individuals blocks virus infection in cells in classic neutralizing antibody assays and antigenic peptides from viral surface molecules specifically induce the proliferation of interferon γ (IFN‐γ) secreting T cells in enzyme‐linked immunospot (Elispot) assays, might not fully and accurately represent an immune response that enables the control of HSV infection. Both classic assays show that neutralizing antibodies block virus entry into a single type of cell, usually epithelial cells or fibroblasts,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">26</xref> and Elispot assays reveal only the capacity to develop a CD4 or CD8 T‐cell immune response to limited antigens mainly located on the viral surface.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Furthermore, it is reasonable to infer that the immunity induced naturally in most individuals infected by HSV might be incomplete or weakly effective on the basis of the observation that most infected individuals seem to be unable to clear the virus completely in their lifetime.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">28</xref> If this is the case, we must ask how the virus interacts with the immune system during its infectious process and leads to an abnormal immune response, which might produce specific antibodies against only viral surface proteins. The accumulated research data concerning the interactions of HSV and host cells and the associated pathogenic mechanisms can help us to answer this question. In these works, the HSV genome was revealed to possess a large amount of genetic information and a complicated transcription mechanism
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">29</xref> and to encode various functional molecules,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">30</xref> which enable interactions with the cellular microenvironment in a systematic and sequential manner to facilitate pathogenesis.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">32</xref> Although this process is basically similar to that of some RNA viruses with simple structures that expose their inner pathogen‐associated molecule patterns (PAMPs) to cellular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in infected cells and activate the NF‐κB transcription pathway of innate immunity,
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">33</xref> HSV possesses various encoded molecules that are not only recognized by PRRs but also used to block or regulate the PRR signal transduction pathways that activate NF‐κB.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">36</xref> This feature might be predicted to lead to a deviation in signal transduction during the innate immune response, which usually involves the activation of innate immune cells, including dendritic cells (DCs), innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells.
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv2054-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">39</xref> This activation can be understood as a broader response than the immune response elicited during HSV infection, which appears to produce specific humoral and cellular responses against only viral surface structures recognized by the innate immune system during the early stages of infection. Our previous understanding of HSV vaccination depended on the observation of clinical immunological data from viral infection or disease and might not support the development of a new generation of HSV vaccines. Further analysis of the mechanism by which HSV interacts with the host and the pathogenic effects of HSV on the immune system will be helpful for our efforts to develop HSV vaccines. In this review, we discuss the available data concerning the interplay of HSV and the host immune system and investigate a possible pathway for HSV vaccine development.
