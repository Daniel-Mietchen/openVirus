<p id="Par35">In conclusion, our study captured the seasonal characteristics over the past three years of influenza and five other common viruses that cause respiratory infections in Hong Kong and analyzed the potential interaction amongst the various viruses. As postulated by several short studies, the evidence in Hong Kong demonstrates that viral interference during the epidemics of influenza and other common respiratory viruses might affect the timing and duration of subsequent epidemics of a certain or several viruses. The recent patterns of viral interference are anticipated to be studied in different regions and contributed as advanced
