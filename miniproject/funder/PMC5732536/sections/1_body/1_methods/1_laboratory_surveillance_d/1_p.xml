<p id="Par13">The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection conducts routine outpatient and laboratory surveillance for the detection of pathogens from respiratory specimens [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. ILI was defined as a fever ≥38 °C and cough or sore throat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Weekly consultation rates of patients with influenza-like illnesses were reported by General Practitioners (GPs, 50 reporting clinics) and Out-patient Clinics (GOPCs, 64 reporting clinics) spread over Hong Kong, amongst which approximately 24% of total outpatient consultations are held by GOPC and 57% by GP [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Consequently, a bias for severe cases exists but the seasonality, particularly the peak and trough periods of the virus infection, remain almost unchanged due to this bias. Since February 2014, molecular testing for specimens has replaced viral culture in Hong Kong [

Although asymptomatic viral infections can be missed by the surveillance system, the laboratory surveillance reports the weekly numbers of specimens that were confirmed positive for various viruses (only specimens collected prior to antiviral therapy were counted) and is acknowledged to represent the local situation of respiratory virus activities in Hong Kong. We investigated the seasonal trend of viruses from laboratory surveillance reporting in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2017:
