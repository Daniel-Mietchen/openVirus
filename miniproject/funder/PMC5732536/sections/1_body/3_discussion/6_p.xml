<p id="Par33">After the rhinovirus epidemic in 2014, the least obvious summer peak of influenza was noticed from 2014 to 2017 in Hong Kong. The prevalence of rhinovirus may have affected the subsequent flu summer peaks and even inhibited the influenza epidemic. The recent multiple delays of influenza epidemics in European countries had also drawn the attention of researchers to the problem. In Switzerland and some European countries in 2009, swine influenza began to spread after the holidays. Four weeks later, the intensity suddenly declined despite no significant changes of climate and social behavior. The populationâ€™s immunity is likely to increase due to infection, but that is unlikely the entire reason, and there were extremely few cases of ILI during the period [
