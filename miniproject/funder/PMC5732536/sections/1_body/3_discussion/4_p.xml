<p id="Par31">Previous studies have discovered that viral interferences often occur during virus epidemics and last for a period of time. After the influenza epidemic of 2015, other viruses remained at a fairly low level of infection except for influenza A H3 subtype. When the summer peak of influenza was delayed in 2016, a rise of infections from the other five viruses was observed, indicating an interplay of respiratory virus epidemics. Although the reasons behind this delay were unclear, it can be explained by a potential general anti-influenza virus immunity in the population, triggered by the epidemic in February of 2015. Several immunology studies have confirmed the virus-virus interaction: infections with similar viruses can start producing interferon and other cytokines with similar structures in cells and induce resistance to possible infections by similar viruses [
