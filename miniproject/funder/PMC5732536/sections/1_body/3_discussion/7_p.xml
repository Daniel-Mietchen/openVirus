<p id="Par34">This study has several limitations. Our results are based on a relatively short time period of three years, which prevents the ability to capture multiyear periodicities of the virus. Our study suggests that virus interference most likely contributed to the changing of virus circulation, but a rigorous statistical analysis assessing the local virus interactions is necessary when evidence is accumulated over a long-term period. Although we cannot determine whether the viruses affect one another biologically or detect the seasonal drivers of risk from the current analysis, the thorough description of the recent surveillance data in Hong Kong still provides solid support on several suspected relationships between influenza and other respiratory viruses by analyzing the regional surveillance data.</p>
