<p id="Par29">Seasonal features of the influenza viruses, PIV, enterovirus and adenovirus have been supported by multiyear laboratory-confirmed surveillance data. The influenza viruses usually erupted in February and July, and the summer peaks in July were generally caused by the H3 subtype of influenza A alone. Between the spring and summer peaks of influenza, a rising trend of virus activity contributed by PIV, adenovirus and enterovirus can be observed. After the summer peak of influenza, a PIV epidemic often occurred in November. It is necessary to explore the seasonal epidemics together with

Because seasonality reflects oscillatory changes in infectiousness, which includes contact patterns, pathogen survival, or host susceptibility [
