<p id="Par28">Monitoring a greater variety of viruses with more sample sites will enhance our understanding of viral interaction, interference and geographical transmission. Current multi-regional surveillance data on non-influenza respiratory viruses remain limited, particularly in China and other developing countries. Laboratory surveillance data in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2017 reported that the main pathogenic viruses of acute respiratory infections in this area are influenza viruses. In addition, PIV, RSV, adenovirus and rhinovirus are important components that cause acute respiratory infections. Although enterovirus is often found in the respiratory secretions and stool of an infected person [

An enhanced epidemiological surveillance system considering a catch-all approach is more affordable than a single pathogen path, particularly by using residual samples from existing influenza surveillance [
