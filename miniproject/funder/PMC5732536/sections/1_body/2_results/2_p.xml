<p id="Par24">Winter-to-spring and summer influenza peaks were detected each year from 2014 to 2017, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. By contrast, the peaks of each influenza subtype were not regularly observed, and the peak of the H3 subtype viruses and the H1 subtype viruses of influenza A and subtypes viruses of influenza B were not synchronized (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). During the three-year period, the H3 subtype of influenza A was dominant over the other influenza viruses, particularly in two epidemics of 2015. Meanwhile, the other subtypes of influenza almost disappeared. In the following spring (influenza epidemic of 2016), other influenza virus subtypes became active when the H3 subtype of influenza A was inactive. In addition, the summer influenza epidemic was delayed in 2016 and other types of viruses, except for influenza, were more active compared to their performance during the same period of the previous two years. When the delayed summer peak of influenza arrived, other viruses quickly decreased to activity levels (Fig.
