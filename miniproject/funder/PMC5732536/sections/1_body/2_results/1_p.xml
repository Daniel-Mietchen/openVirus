<p id="Par23">This study begins with a summary of the weekly number of respiratory illness infections with viruses routinely tested in the laboratory, including influenza viruses, PIV, RSV, adenoviruses, enteroviruses and rhinoviruses between January 2014 and December 2016 (157 weeks) in Hong Kong. The most laboratory reports were available for influenza A and the least for enterovirus (41,787 and 2875 infections during the entire study period, respectively, Table

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. To facilitate the demonstration of low and high peaks of different viruses in the graph, high peaks of influenza were scaled down (the portion greater than 0.1 was shrunk to 1/3 of the original value, changing the height but not the shape of the epidemic during the period). The weekly total numbers of respiratory samples were cyclical within a year. From January through March, the total numbers of respiratory samples increased to the peak value. A decrease occurred until June, when a small rebound appeared that was lower than the spring peak.
