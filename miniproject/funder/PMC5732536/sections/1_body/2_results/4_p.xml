<p id="Par26">The other three respiratory viruses routinely tested in the laboratory were less active than influenza and PIV (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Adenovirus had experienced a high prevalence at the end of 2014, and after a year without obvious fluctuations, the seasonal trend in 2016 was similar to that of 2014 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The seasonal trends of RSV were similar from year to year, with a low infection rate in the winter that continued to increase until the summer. Rhinovirus had a higher rate of infection in 2014 than in 2015 and 2016, after which the infection rate remained steady. After the rhinovirus epidemic, the following summer influenza epidemics had the lowest impact during the three-year study period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Although a small number of enteroviruses were detected, the seasonal performance of enterovirus was stable, and an annual summer peak showed up consistently.
