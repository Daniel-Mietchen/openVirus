<p id="Par27">The peak timing estimates of influenza virus, PIV, adenovirus and enterovirus are accompanied by their corresponding 95% bootstrap confidence interval (CI) in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The major peak timing estimates of influenza and PIV were focused in February (95%CI: 1.904–3.105) and December (95%CI: 11.004–0.772), whereas the semi-annual peak timing estimates of influenza and PIV occurred in July (95%CI: 7.114–7.94) and late April to May (95%CI: 4.58–5.305). Estimates of the major peak timing of adenovirus and enterovirus were concentrated in the summer months of August (95%CI: 7.623–9.839) and June (95%CI: 5.496–7.057). The semi-annual peak timing estimate of enterovirus was close to the annual peak estimate, which illuminates the unimodal characteristics of enteroviruses. In addition, the CIs of the peak timing estimates of RSV and rhinovirus covered more than half a year, which indicated the implicit peak timings and the stable state of virus activities throughout the year. Notably, most of the viruses peaked in the period of May to early June, which was the inactive season for the influenza virus.
