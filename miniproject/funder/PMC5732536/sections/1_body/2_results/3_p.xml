<p id="Par25">The overall weekly detection rates of PIV were lower than those of influenza. However, three annual trends of PIV in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows that PIV gradually became active from October to December. The average weekly positive rate of the PIV subtype III was higher than the other subtypes during the study period, but it was not always the dominant PIV subtype (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). When influenza viruses were active, the positive rates of PIV were low; the peaks of PIV and influenza viruses were often staggered.
