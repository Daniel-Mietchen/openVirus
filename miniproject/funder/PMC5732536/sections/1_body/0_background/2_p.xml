<p id="Par12">The existence of interference amongst seasonal epidemics of different respiratory viral infections raises the issue of underlying interference mechanisms, and provides improved prediction of epidemics, easing the planning for control and prevention strategies [

To gain more insight into the interaction between different respiratory viruses and their subtypes, this study investigated the interference amongst seasonal epidemics of six major respiratory illnesses in Hong Kong from 2014 to 2017 based on laboratory surveillance data.
