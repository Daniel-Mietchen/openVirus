<p>The present study reanalyzed foodborne norovirus outbreaks in Japan from 2005â€“2006 that involved laboratory testing of all individuals including healthy people. To statistically infer asymptomatic ratio in joint with the risk of infection and the probability of virus shedding, a statistical model was developed to describe the data generating process. Assuming that all 55 outbreaks occurred due to repeated random samplings, the risk of infection (
 <italic>p</italic>) and the asymptomatic ratio (
 <italic>s</italic>) were estimated to be 25.4% and 32.1%, respectively. The probability of virus shedding (
 <italic>q</italic>) was estimated at 73.2%. Possible differences by genogroup were implicated by penalized likelihoods. The risk of infection was small for GII.4, while the asymptomatic ratio was estimated to be high for this common genotype.
