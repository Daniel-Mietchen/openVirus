<p>An important contribution of the present study to the literature of norovirus is that the asymptomatic ratio was estimated to be about 30%, which is consistent with existing literature based on volunteer challenge studies.

 </sup> Not based on human volunteer challenge, our study has successfully estimated the asymptomatic ratio from naturally occurred outbreaks, as has also been achieved for other infectious diseases.

 </sup> In particular, the asymptomatic ratio of common genotype GII.4 was estimated to be high, which is in line with the conventional understanding that the control of GII.4 is likely more difficult than that of other genotypes. In addition to original findings of similar virus shedding frequency of GII.4 between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases by Ozawa et al,

 </sup> our study underscores the important feature of GII.4 inducing asymptomatic infections among food handlers. Not only spreading the virus via food handlers, but the greater asymptomatic ratio allows infected individuals to be freely mobile and have more opportunities to pass the virus to others. When we assumed that the actual frequency of virus shedding from asymptomatic individuals is smaller than symptomatic cases, the asymptomatic ratio was estimated to be greater than the baseline. In other words, the estimated value around 30% might be even greater than our result.
