<p>Despite the abovementioned limitations, our study has successfully demonstrated that the asymptomatic ratio can be estimated from outbreak data in which all involved individuals undertook laboratory testing and also that the asymptomatic ratio was about 30% in natural outbreak settings. Practical difficulty in controlling GII.4 outbreaks was supported by its large estimate of the asymptomatic ratio. Collecting similar datasets from further outbreaks, we will be able to gain further insights into the natural history of norovirus infection, including genotype-specific differences. Understanding the natural history better, similar explicit estimates based on natural infection in future could help clarify better control strategies of norovirus outbreaks, even by genotype.</p>
