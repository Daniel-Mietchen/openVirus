<p>Two limitations must be discussed. First, the survey data contained epidemiologically limited information. That is, to define symptomatic cases, diarrhea or vomiting was employed, but they were qualitative definitions that did not explicitly involve the frequency, such as the number of defecations/vomiting per day. Such qualitative definition is favored for clearly defining what a symptomatic case is, and an important advantage of the present study is that an identical research group has conducted the entire survey and minimized the measurement of error that could potentially arise from researchers. Nevertheless, when it comes to additionally measuring the severity of illness, which is out of the scope of the present study, it might have been unavoidable to include human perception error. Such misclassification could have potentially affected the asymptomatic ratio (eg, due to broad definition of asymptomatic persons). Moreover, the exact timing of stool sampling was unavailable; however, it is likely that all sampling took place in a matter of 1 week from the onset of outbreaks, during which the virus shedding level of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases should be substantial.

 </sup> Second, the model involved a few simplifications. The simplified points include the ignorance of the dependent happening in the risk of infection. Since the majority of outbreaks were considered as purely foodborne, a single parameter 
 <italic>p</italic> was allocated, but if human-to-human transmission was involved, it might have been better to account for that information, which was not attainable in the present study using the same dataset. Another simplification was the use of binomial sampling process for each likelihood. As a consequence, the uncertainty bound of 
 <italic>p</italic> in the present study should be regarded as an underestimate. One of the drawbacks has been seen in significantly greater 
 <italic>p</italic> that we obtained when two big outbreaks were removed from analysis; in other words, the estimate might not have been significantly different if the uncertainty also reflected demographic stochasticity.
