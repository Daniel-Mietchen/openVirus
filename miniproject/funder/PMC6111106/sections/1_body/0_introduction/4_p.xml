<p>To decipher the most effective preventive measures against this virus, it is vital to quantitatively clarify the natural history characteristics, including asymptomatic ratio, the risk of infection per exposure, and the probability of virus shedding. Nevertheless, explicit estimates are very scarce, except for rigorous challenge studies that helped quantify the natural history

 </sup>; moreover, it is unclear if the natural history of experimentally infected individuals are similar to those based on natural infection. A small number of mathematical modelling studies estimated a part of the abovementioned values,

 </sup> but explicit model-based estimates of the asymptomatic ratio have yet to be offered. The present study aims to estimate the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection, reanalyzing foodborne outbreak data with laboratory testing in Japan, along with other parameters, including virus shedding frequency and the risk of infection. In addition to estimating the asymptomatic ratio for all noroviruses, the present study also compares the estimate across different genogroups and genotypes.
