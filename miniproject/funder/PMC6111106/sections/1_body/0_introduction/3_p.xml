<p>One of the notable virological features of noroviruses is genotype variation, which is divided into five genogroups and many genotypes in each genogroup.

 </sup> As of 2017, the most prevalent genotype in humans is GII.4,

 </sup> Some pieces of evidence indicate that this genotype evolves rapidly, escaping from selection pressure.

 </sup> In Japan, the majority of outbreaks are caused by genogroup II, and a large proportion is caused by GII.4.
 <sup>
  <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
 </sup> GII.4-associated epidemics in Japan were first observed in 2006, and the genotype has been continuously observed every year since then.
