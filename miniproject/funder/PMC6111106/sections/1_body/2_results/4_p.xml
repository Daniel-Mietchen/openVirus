<p>Of the total of 55 outbreaks, there were two outbreaks involving large number of subjects (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,328 for two outbreaks; 59.6% of the total), which could lead us to feel that the overall results may be highly influenced by those two outbreaks. Removing the two outbreaks and analyzing the remaining 53 altogether, parameters 
 <italic>p</italic>, 
 <italic>s</italic>, and 
 <italic>q</italic> were estimated at 44.0% (95% CI, 40.5–47.7%), 25.9% (95% CI, 21.0–31.1%) and 73.1% (95% CI, 67.9–78.0%), respectively. The risk of infection (
 <italic>p</italic>) was significantly greater than the estimate in which all 55 outbreaks were analyzed together, but two other parameters, including asymptomatic ratio (
 <italic>s</italic>) and the risk of virus shedding (
 <italic>q</italic>), were not significantly deviated.
