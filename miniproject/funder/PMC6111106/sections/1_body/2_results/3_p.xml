<p>Varying the value of α from 0.50 to 1.00, we examined the sensitivity of model parameters to differential virus shedding frequency between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). When α gets smaller, both the risk of infection (
 <italic>p</italic>) and the asymptomatic ratio (
 <italic>s</italic>) were estimated to be greater. The probability of virus shedding among symptomatic cases remained stable (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>C).
