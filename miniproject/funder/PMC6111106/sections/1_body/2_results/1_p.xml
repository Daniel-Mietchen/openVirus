<p>When all 55 outbreaks were used and regarded as random sampling results from a single set of parameters, model parameters 
 <italic>p</italic>, 
 <italic>s</italic>, and 
 <italic>q</italic> were estimated as 25.4% (95% CI, 23.4–27.4%), 32.1% (95% CI, 27.7–36.7%) and 73.2% (95% CI, 68.6–77.4%), respectively. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sm01">eFigure 1</xref> compares the maximum likelihood estimates of this scenario against others. Asymptomatic ratio 
 <italic>s</italic> estimated by genogroups and by genotypes did not reveal any significant difference from combined result, with estimated values ranging from 22.2–66.7% (Table 
 <xref rid="tbl01" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The risk of infection of GI might be slightly greater than that of GII, although the difference was not statistically significant. Among the GII genotypes, GII.4 yielded the highest estimate of asymptomatic ratio (40.7%; 95% CI, 32.8–49.0%) and the smallest probability of infection. The probabilities of virus shedding from infected individuals by genotypes ranged from 50.0–83.3%, and it was shown that the virus shedding frequency of GI and GII were about the same.
