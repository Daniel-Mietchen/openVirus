<p>Calculating the AIC for each interpretation scenario, the AIC of the genogroup-combined model (ie, a model with three parameters only) yielded the value of 1,227.9, while that of the genogroup-separated model (ie, a model with six parameters) was 1,177.4. The smaller value of AIC for a genogroup-separated model indicated that the model with genogroup information was better fitted to outbreak data, so there might potentially be a difference between GI and GII.
