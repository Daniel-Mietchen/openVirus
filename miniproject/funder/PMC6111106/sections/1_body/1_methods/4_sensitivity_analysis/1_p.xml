<p>To analyze the sensitivity of parameter estimates to differential frequency of virus shedding between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections, we used the following α, ie,

 <sub>1</sub> is the probability from a symptomatic case. We set the baseline value of α as 1.00, which indicates that asymptomatic and symptomatic cases have the same probability of virus shedding (due to a highly sensitive PCR testing method
