<p>Here, we describe a statistical model with which the asymptomatic ratio and other parameters were jointly estimated using the abovementioned foodborne outbreak data. First, the data generating process is schematically illustrated in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>. Three pieces of information are considered: the infection process, the illness onset, and virus shedding results. We assume that all situations and population were similar across outbreaks and shared identical parameters. Let 
 <italic>p</italic> be the risk (or the probability) of norovirus infection given an exposure at food handling center, and similarly, let 
 <italic>s</italic> be the asymptomatic ratio of norovirus infection, representing the probability that infected individuals escape from symptomatic illness.

 </sup> Moreover, let 
 <italic>q</italic> be the probability of virus detection from an infected individual. While these parameters are allocated, all these processes are not directly observed in the original survey. The epidemiological information we have an access includes (i) the total number of people involved (including healthy individuals) in each outbreak, (ii) the number of symptomatic cases, and (iii) the numbers of symptomatic virus shedding cases and asymptomatic virus shedding cases. From these pieces of information, we estimate 
 <italic>p</italic>, 
 <italic>q</italic> and 
 <italic>s</italic> jointly.
