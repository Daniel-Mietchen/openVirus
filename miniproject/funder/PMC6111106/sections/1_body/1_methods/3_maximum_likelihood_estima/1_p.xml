<p>A maximum likelihood method was employed to estimate parameter values, 
 <italic>p</italic>, 
 <italic>q</italic> and 
 <italic>s</italic>. These parameters were estimated assuming several different interpretation scenarios of empirical data. First, a single set of 
 <italic>p</italic>, 
 <italic>q</italic>, and 
 <italic>s</italic> was estimated, assuming that each outbreak was a random sampling result from the abovementioned mechanisms (1)â€“(3). Second, parameters were assumed to be different between genogroup 1 and 2, so there were six unknown parameters. Third, parameters were assumed to be different by genotype. When estimating parameters by genotype, it should be noted that the available number of outbreaks differed by genotype (eg, seven outbreaks for GII.3), and we excluded outbreaks in which multiple genotypes were identified. To identify any improved fit despite increased number of parameters, Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was computed for each scenario.
