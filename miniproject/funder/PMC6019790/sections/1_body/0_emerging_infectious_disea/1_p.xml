<p id="Par14">The development of vaccines for newly emerging infectious disease, especially for those caused by unknown pathogens, is an important area of public health due to the difficulties in responding rapidly to such diseases once an outbreak is established. Over 70% of emerging diseases are zoonotic and exist in animal reservoirs and/or are transmitted by insect vectors, making control nearly impossible without vaccination. Furthermore, difficulty anticipating the consequences of such an outbreak results not only in public health problems but also in financial, infrastructural, and governmental issues involved in response. The World Health Organization has developed an annually updated 
 <italic>Research and Development (R&amp;D) Blueprint for Action to Prevent Epidemics</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The 2018 list [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] included ‘disease X’ for the first time, which “represents the knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease, and so the R&amp;D Blueprint explicitly seeks to enable cross-cutting R&amp;D preparedness that is also relevant for an unknown ‘disease X’ as far as possible.”
