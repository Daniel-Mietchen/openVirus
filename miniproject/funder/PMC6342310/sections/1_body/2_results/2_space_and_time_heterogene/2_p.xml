<p>Across all countries the time term (RW2) accounts for an average of 58 percent of the total variability. This indicates that most countries have experienced important, consistent temporal trends—consistently down except for some areas in Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Lesotho, and Zimbabwe, see 
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. The variability captured by the structured space term (ICAR) is also consistently important accounting for an average of 30 percent of total variability. The distribution of values in the ICAR column suggests that countries fall into one of two groups: the majority where space plays an important role in explaining the U5MR, and a few where space appears to be insignificant, accounting for only a few percent of total variability—Liberia, Morocco, and Uganda.
