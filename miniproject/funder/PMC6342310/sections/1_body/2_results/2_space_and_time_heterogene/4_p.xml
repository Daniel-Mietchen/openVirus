<p>The time×space interaction (RW2×ICAR) explains on average 10⋅4 percent of overall variation, but there is substantial variability from a low of 0⋅6 percent to a high of 38⋅1 percent. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210645.g001">Fig 1B</xref> displays this and confirms that there is no clear regional patterning of the space time interaction. A number of countries have space time interaction values around 15–20 percent, and three countries have particularly high values around 30 percent: Angola, Lesotho, and Namibia. This suggests that specific regions within these countries had unusual values during specific time periods that required an additional effect beyond the main effects of space (applies to each region at all times) and time (applies to each time period at all regions). These unusual regions did not change like the other regions in their country, and it may be substantively interesting to further investigate these countries and determine exactly which regions were involved and what was happening to them.
