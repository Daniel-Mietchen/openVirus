The West Africa region has more spatial structure in general compared to the Central, East and Southern Africa regions, except for Kenya, Angola, and Zimbabwe. The unstructured effects contribute much less to total variation, with the unstructured spatial effects generally slightly more important compared to the unstructured time effects, on average 1⋅9 percent compared to 0⋅4 percent.
