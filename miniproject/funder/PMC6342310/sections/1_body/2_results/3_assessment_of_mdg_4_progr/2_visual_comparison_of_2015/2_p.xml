 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0210645.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> display reductions in the U5MR between 1990 and 2015 from the subnational and national models. The overall regional patterning persists with larger reductions in areas with lower U5MR in 2015—East, Southern and parts of North Africa. Within countries that achieved the MDG 4 target reductions at the national level, there is some heterogeneity across Admin-1 areas in the overall level of reduction—Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Morocco, Mozambique, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. For countries that did not achieve the target nationally and have mixed performance at the Admin-1 level, there is pronounced regional heterogeneity—Angola, Burundi, Congo, DRC, Gambia, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, and Zambia. The remaining countries did not achieve the target nationally and had no subregions that achieved the target, and for most of these there appears to be less variability in the rate of reduction, with all Admin-1 regions doing poorly together. The pictures in these figures visually confirm the story told in
