<p>The last two columns in 
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> summarize the proportional reductions achieved by the regions within each country, the median, and minimum to maximum range of those values. The countries that achieved the target as a whole generally had comfortable median regional reductions of 75 percent or more. For countries that did not achieve the goal, regional performance was mixed and highly variable, ranging from only one region (several countries) to a majority (Ethiopia) of regions achieving the target and median reductions of 9⋅8 to 75⋅5 percent. In countries where no subregions achieved the target, performance was generally poor with median regional reductions from 3⋅2 (Zimbabwe) to 59⋅9 (Burkina Faso) percent.
