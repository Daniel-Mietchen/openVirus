<p>We carried out extensive cross-validation model checks that are summarized in the supporting information file 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0210645.s001">S1 File</xref>. Specifically, we systematically held out data (the weighted estimates) from Admin-1 areas and time periods, and then predicted these data using the model fitted to the remaining data. A variety of checks were then performed for each country: coverage of 95% interval estimates; examination of bias against time to look for systematic model failure. The checks did not reveal any problems with the models overall. For example, the coverage was 95% on average, with all but 2 countries having coverages between 89 and 100 percent.
