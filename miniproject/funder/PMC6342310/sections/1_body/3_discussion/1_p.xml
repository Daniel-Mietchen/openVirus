<p>Our findings reveal a wide variety of subnational levels and trends in the U5MR in Africa. At the broadest level the U5MR has been falling consistently almost everywhere, but the rate of change and most recent levels vary considerably. In large regions, especially West and Central (

 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], subnational heterogeneity in Africa is larger in areas with higher U5MR where reductions have been modest. In East and Southern Africa where the overall U5MR is lower, spatial variability is also generally lower.
