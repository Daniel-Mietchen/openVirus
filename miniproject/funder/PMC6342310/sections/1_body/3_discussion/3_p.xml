<p>Our results do not produce a generalizable relationship between the level and rate of change of the U5MR and subnational variation. Based on this it will be important to consider each country by itself and use subnational estimates to motivate and guide better understanding of the local risk and protective factors affecting the risk of dying for young children, so that locally-relevant interventions can be targeted to specific regional populations. This will allow for the possibility that overall interventions strategies are more cost effective, feasible (operate in smaller geographic areas), and hopefully because of all of that, more effective.</p>
