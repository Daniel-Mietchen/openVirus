<p>Our overall modeling approach has several advantages: (i) in comparison to other work using similar data to produce subnational estimates of the U5MR [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], our approach is relatively straightforward so that it runs quickly on everyday computers, can be explained easily, and its results readily understood; (ii) it transparently acknowledges the sample design of each complex survey so that design-induced uncertainty is propagated through to our final estimates and the estimates are correctly adjusted to account for the complex sampling design of the DHS studies; (iii) it adjusts for the bias created by HIV epidemics in survey-based measures of mortality; (iv) it is based on well-understood space-time interaction [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) models [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] that have been used extensively in spatial epidemiology; and (v) the method has been validated in the statistics community [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] which provides users with confidence that the statistical methodology is sound. Finally, we provide a freely available, open source package for the 
 <monospace>R</monospace> statistical programming environment (SUMMER: Spatio-Temporal Under-Five Mortality Methods for Estimation in R) to implement the method so that anyone can replicate our work or conduct a similar analysis using household survey data [
