<p>This work also has limitations: (i) foremost, we only make use of data from DHS surveys which limits the number of countries, time periods, and geographic resolution of our work; (ii) we do not make direct use of summary birth history data which excludes census data sources and some surveys, and prevents us from accessing the much finer geographic scale that is possible with census data; (iii) we do not make estimates at geographic scales below the Admin-1 level, and this potentially prevents us from identifying and characterizing important spatial heterogeneity at sub-Admin-1 levels; (iv) we do not include spatial covariates that may allow the space-time models to be more accurate and reveal more spatial and temporal structure; (v) we only produce estimates for the U5MR rather than a variety of mortality indicators pertaining to other age groups, such as the NMR and various age-specific rates covering all ages; (vi) we do not consider the effects of within-country; (vii) we have not incorporated covariates; and (viii) we do not attempt to incorporate cause of death to produce estimates of cause-specific mortality rates, something suggested by the SDG 3.2 target that calls for elimination of all 
 <italic>preventable</italic> child deaths; ‘preventable’ in this sense presumably requiring categorization of deaths by cause. Our current work is addressing these limitations.
