<p>Two groups have produced comprehensive estimates of subnational child mortality for Africa that include spatially-defined covariates (we do not include a study of sub-Saharan Africa based on kernel density estimation [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] since this approach is exploratory rather than inferential.) Pezzulo et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] use DHS data to estimate the ‘child mortality rate’, the probability of dying before age five for those who survive to age one,

 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the study investigates risk and protective factors expected to affect child mortality that include a range of geospatial covariates. Corroborating the earlier work done in single countries, the authors find important spatial variation net of the other predictors and identify maternal literacy as a key correlate of child mortality across Africa.
