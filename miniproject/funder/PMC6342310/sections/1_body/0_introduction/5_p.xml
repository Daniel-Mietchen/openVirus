<p>Disaggregation in space is equivalent to producing estimates for subnational areas. These can coincide with political/administrative boundaries or be effectively ‘continuously’ varying surfaces at a fine-grained spatial scale, e.g. a 1×1 km grid. National-level estimates are primarily useful for comparing nations and aggregating across large world regions, and hence their natural audience is international policy makers and donors. In contrast, subnational estimates shift focus away from the international to the national and subnational levels giving national and local policy makers and funders a useful new description of what is happening at the geographic and administrative levels where consequential decisions are typically made. Subnational variation in levels and trends can be revealed and addressed, and specific places with poor, satisfactory, or excellent levels or trends can be identified and targeted for improvement or used as exemplars.</p>
