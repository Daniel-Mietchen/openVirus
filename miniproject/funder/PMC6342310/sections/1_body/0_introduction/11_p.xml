<p>Over the past few decades HIV has dramatically increased the mortality of reproductive-aged people in East and Southern Africa, and this leads to consequential bias in household sample survey estimates of both child and adult mortality. HIV spreads within families from spouse-to-spouse and mother-to-child which strongly correlates the risk of dying within families. The high-risk families are less likely to be included in household sample surveys because the mother is more likely to be dead and thus either missing from the sampling frame or unavailable to respond to the interview, and this leads to dramatic underestimates of mortality. Mortality measures derived from household sample surveys (e.g. DHS, UNICEF’s Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys—MICS) for populations affected by HIV must correct for this bias. Neither Pezzulo et al. nor IHME do this, with the likely consequence that their estimates are too low in countries affected by HIV.</p>
