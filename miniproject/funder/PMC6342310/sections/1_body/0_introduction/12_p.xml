<p>The IHME study is flawed in additional ways. When working with surveys with a complex design, such as the DHS, the model must acknowledge the design, and this is not straightforward for the continuous spatial model. As discussed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the continuous spatial model is conceptually appealing because it allows inference at any level of aggregation, but in practice it requires far more fine-tuning and is less robust than the discrete spatial alternative. The modeling approach used by IHME does not allow inference in the sense that uncertainty in the covariate fitting procedure is not acknowledged in their uncertainty surfaces. The mortality of children of different ages is estimated separately using four models. The final U5MR is estimated from the fits of the four age models as if these are independent, but this is incorrect since each model fit is based on the same children. Finally, the IHME work utilizes non-standard and statistically unjustified approaches to estimating mortality from summary birth histories and calculating the overall standard error on their estimates.
