We know very little about the timing or cause of those deaths—how many potential years of life are lost and what diseases or conditions are the primary killers—and that critically limits our ability to evaluate and monitor population health and target interventions in the settings where they are needed most. In many areas without fully functioning vital statistics systems there are data from household surveys and censuses over the past several decades that can be used to estimate measures of child mortality at reasonable geographic granularity, including large parts of Africa. The under-five mortality rate (U5MR),
