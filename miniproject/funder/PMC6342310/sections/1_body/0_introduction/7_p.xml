<p>Most studies of subnational levels and trends in either the NMR or the U5MR reveal important variation in both. A common finding is that spatial variation persists after controlling for other determinants, and that the spatial effects often cross administrative/political boundaries, such as national borders, confirming that local conditions are important components of the risk of dying for young children [

 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), these variables are not available at all locations and universally available covariates usually have less strong associations [

 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] find that 76 percent of the overall variation in the U5MR is accounted for by within-country variation. Working with data from Brazilian municipalities, Sousa and coworkers [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] find large differences in both the levels and rates of improvement of the NMR and the U5MR defined by geography and wealth, with the overall result that poorer, more rural communities are being ‘left behind’ and are progressively worse compared to wealthier urban areas. Likewise, Arku et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] find that cross-district inequality in the U5MR increased over time as the overall U5MR fell. Quantifying geographic inequality in either levels or rates of improvement has been an important feature of many studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] apply concentration curve approaches to the states of India and discover that the poorer states are more homogeneous, and Hosseinpoor and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] test a variety of inequality measures and conclude that the majority lead to the same conclusions—spatial inequality appears robust to the common metrics used to measure it.
