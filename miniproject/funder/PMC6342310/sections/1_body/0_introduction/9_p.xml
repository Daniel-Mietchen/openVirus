<p>The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) expand on this work to include a wide variety of additional data (235 survey and census data sets) and build a ‘continuous’ space model with 5×5 km resolution across 46 countries in Africa to estimate both the NMR and the U5MR [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This study reveals significant local and regional variation in both levels and rates of improvement in both indicators. The product of this work is a set of time-specific continuous surfaces of estimated NMR and U5MR with uncertainty. The authors conclude that many small localities and whole regions within Africa will have to sustain unrealistic rates of improvement in both the NMR and U5MR in order to reach the SDG 3.2 targets, and that their fine-grained spatial estimates provide valuable information to inform geographical targeting of interventions.
