<p>In this paper we present direct, discrete space-time estimates of the U5MR in subnational geographic areas using data from DHS surveys conducted in Africa. We employ the approach we developed earlier [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to fully account for survey design effects on the uncertainty in place-time-specific U5MR estimates. We combine place-time-specific, synthetic-cohort, direct estimates of the U5MR in a Bayesian space-time smoothing model with place, time, and place×time interactions to account for spatial and temporal correlation and identify separate place, time, and interaction effects. Using the space-time results, we identify spatial heterogeneity in levels and rates of decline and assess progress toward the MDG 4 targets for subnational and national areas annually from 1980–2019 and in five-year periods 1990–1994 to 2015–2019—we project U5MR to complete the series through 2019. Finally, we compare our national-level estimates to those produced by the UN-IGME [
