The DHS uses complex, multi-stage, cluster sample surveys that interview women aged 15–49 years. The details of the survey design vary across countries and DHS provides survey weights for each woman. Except for the early surveys, most identify the cluster where each woman was found, and some of the recent surveys have jittered GPS information. DHS surveys include a detailed birth history for each women that provides detailed information on the dates of birth and death for each of the women’s children. The birth history data were used to identify all completed or terminal child-months lived by every child reported by each adult female respondent. For each survey, data describing child-months were organized into a new dataset with one row per child month. Covariates defined for each child month included: an ID for the child; the date when the month started; the child’s age at the beginning of the month; a binary variable indicating if the child died during the month; the survey weight and sample information associated with the child; and geographic identifiers for the child’s household, if available.
