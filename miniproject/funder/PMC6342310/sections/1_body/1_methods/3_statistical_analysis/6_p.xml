<p>Temporal and spatial smoothing were conducted using two additional place (

 <italic>γ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>) specific terms. The space term was modeled using an intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) model [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], a generalization of the random walk of order 1 (RW1) model to space. Similarly, the time term was modeled using a random walk of order 2 (RW2) model at one-year intervals. In RW1 models each value depends on its nearest neighbors, and in RW2 models each value depends on both its nearest neighbors and those neighbors’ nearest neighbors. Since they are based on a greater number of neighbors, RW2 models generally encourage more smoothing. The interaction of time and place (
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>it</italic>
 </sub>) was modeled assuming that the temporal (RW2) and spatial (ICAR) structured effects interact [
 <xref rid="pone.0210645.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Consequently, the interactions have structure in time and space. In our setup each logit-transformed value depends on its nearest neighbors in space and its nearest two neighbors in both the past and future along the time axis. In what follows this model is referred to as the ‘subnational model’.
