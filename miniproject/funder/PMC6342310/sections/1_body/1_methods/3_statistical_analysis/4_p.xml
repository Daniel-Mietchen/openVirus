<p>Hence, the logit-transformed 
 <sub>5</sub>q
 <sub>0</sub> at each place and time are modeled as the sum of place and time-specific terms whose estimated distributions provide information about time trends (
 <italic>γ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>) and random (unstructured) terms in time (
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>), spatial trends (
 <italic>ϕ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>) and random (unstructured) terms in space (
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>), and space-time structured interaction (
 <italic>δ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>it</italic>
 </sub>). The constant term (
 <italic>μ</italic>) captures the overall level. Hence, for each of space and time there are two components, one smooth (structured) and one unstructured, with each reflecting different sources of variation—the former being unobserved risk factors that vary smoothly and the latter random ‘shocks’ that are specific to that place or time only. Independent, unstructured variation in place (
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>) and time (
 <italic>α</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>) was identified by two terms independently drawn from normal distributions with mean 0 and variances estimated through the Bayesian inference setup; hence the amount of smoothing is estimated directly from the data, and uniquely for each country.
