<p>Because trends in time are likely to vary across spatial areas, a space-time interaction is needed. As with the main effects of time and space, these terms are not imposed on the fit, but rather the data choose the level of interaction required (the results show this, with some countries exhibiting very little interaction). We expect some smoothness in time and space for the interaction terms, and this is encoded in the form we assume for the interaction. This is particularly useful for predictions because we obtain area-specific temporal trends, leaning on recent trends in the observed data in those areas.</p>
