<p>The results we present include summaries of the estimated distributions of U5MR by place and time for each country. Using those we calculate proportional rates of decline in U5MR at both national and subnational levels to identify geographic regions that reached the MDG 4 target of 67 percent reduction in U5MR. We also present the fraction of overall variance explained by each of the terms in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0210645.e006">Eq (1)</xref>. Those values indicate how important the space, time, interaction and independent effects are in producing the space-time variation in the U5MR.
