<p>The MDG time frame is the twenty-five years between 1990â€“2015. Our analysis is organized in one- and five-year periods from 1980 to whenever the most recent data are available, usually 2010-2016. In order to replicate the MDG period, we made a probabilistic projection of the U5MR through 2019 using the results from our fitted models. The temporal behavior of this projection at the national level is governed by the one-year time scale RW2 model. We calculated MDG metrics using the annual estimates for 1990 and projected values for 2015.</p>
