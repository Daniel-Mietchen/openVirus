<p>The age-related patterns of dengue incidence obtained from reported surveillance data can be attributed to the transmission setting and multiple other factors, including the complex immunological interactions of the four dengue virus serotypes, reporting practices, healthcare-seeking behaviour and surveillance capacities. A large proportion of dengue infections result in mild or no symptoms and infection with any one serotype is thought to provide long-term immunity to the same serotype and a short-lived period of cross-protection against infections with heterologous serotypes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Severe dengue disease is often, but not always, associated with secondary infections through an immunopathological phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), whereby pre-existing anti-DENV antibodies enhance disease severity in secondary heterologous infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Due to cross-reactivity of dengue antibodies in current serological assays, less is known about tertiary and quaternary infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] which are thought to cause less symptomatic disease than primary or secondary infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For this reason, most mathematical models of dengue transmission assume clinical protection upon secondary infection [
