<p>Here we apply catalytic models [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to provide the first detailed description of spatial and temporal variability in dengue transmission intensity in Jakarta, Indonesia. We estimated dengue transmission intensity and reporting probabilities from age-stratified case notification data in 42 subdistricts of Jakarta over a 10-year period between 2008 and 2017. These estimates can inform the implementation of future control and preventative programmes.
