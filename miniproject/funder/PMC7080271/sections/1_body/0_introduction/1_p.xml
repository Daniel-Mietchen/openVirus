<p>Dengue is the most rapidly expanding mosquito-borne viral disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Increased globalization and rapid urbanization continue to facilitate the geographic expansion of the mosquito vector and virus in tropical regions, where the frequency and magnitude of dengue epidemics has increased dramatically in the past 40 years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Approximately 70% of the global burden of dengue disease occurs on the Asian continent [
