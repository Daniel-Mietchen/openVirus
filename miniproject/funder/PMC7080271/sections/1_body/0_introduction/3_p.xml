<p>The characterization of spatial and temporal variability in dengue transmission intensity has become increasingly important in recent years to inform optimal implementation of novel vector control and prevention strategies, including the release of 
 <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>infected mosquitoes and vaccination. The most recent WHO guidelines for use of the world’s first dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV (or Dengvaxia), recommend a ‘test-before-vaccination’ approach with serological testing of individuals prior to vaccination [

While the implementation of individual-based screening and vaccination programmes may not be feasible at the national-level for many countries, geographically targeted interventions implemented at a sub-national level may present a more realistic and cost-effective option in specific settings. Dengue force of infection, which is defined as the per capita rate susceptible individuals acquire infection, is a key measure of transmission intensity and provides valuable insights into the age-related risk of infection and population immunity dynamics. In many dengue endemic countries, routinely collected case notifications are often the only available source of data with which to assess dengue transmission intensity. Though the reliability of dengue case notification data based on clinical diagnoses can vary due to non-specific clinical manifestations caused by dengue and other vector-borne infections, analysis of the relationship between age and disease incidence can provide valuable insights into the underlying nature and intensity of dengue transmission [
