<p>Overall, we find that the 
 <italic>S</italic> and 
 <italic>PS</italic> model variants produce largely similar estimates of average force of infection, except for years when substantial proportions of DHF cases are estimated to be caused by primary infections (Î³
 <sub>1</sub>). For these years, as expected, model variant 
 <italic>S</italic> estimates a higher force of infection than model variant 
 <italic>PS</italic>, due to the assumption that all DHF cases have experienced two infections. In both model variants 
 <italic>S</italic> and 
 <italic>PS</italic>, we assumed that post-secondary infections do not cause severe disease and are hence not detected. Though post-secondary infections are thought to be largely asymptomatic due to long-term heterotypic immunity, if a considerable proportion of severe dengue cases were being caused by tertiary or quaternary infections (perhaps in older individuals whose cross-protective immunity had waned) our models could potentially underestimate the force of infection. As shown in [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], a low age of seroconversion and a high age of DHF are easier to reconcile when relaxing the assumption of clinical protection after secondary infection, which is important to consider given the high occurrence of post-secondary infections observed in hyperendemic regions of Indonesia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] as well as the increasing average age of DHF cases that has been observed in the country [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].
