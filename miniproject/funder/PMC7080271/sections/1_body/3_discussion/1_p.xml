<p>We found that the force of infection estimate obtained with model 1 variant

 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We observed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in force of infection within Jakarta province, with long-term spatial clustering of both high and low transmission intensity subdistricts. Though ranking of subdistrict transmission intensity estimates varied by year, our analysis identified a long-term average hot-spot of dengue transmission in the southeast of Jakarta province and clustering of low transmission intensity in the region of Central Jakarta. Subdistrict population density was found to have a weak association with dengue transmission intensity, explaining approximately 5% of the variation in subdistrict force of infection estimates during 2008–2017, with higher average annual force of infection associated with greater population densities (for details see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref> sections 3.5 and S8 Fig). Though this association may suggest higher rates of human-vector contact in densely populated areas, numerous other environmental, socioeconomic and behavioural factors not included in this analysis are likely to influence local transmission intensity.
