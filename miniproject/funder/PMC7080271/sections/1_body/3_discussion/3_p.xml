 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] have demonstrated that vaccination campaigns with the CYD-TDV vaccine could potentially increase individual-level risks of disease in low-to-medium transmission intensity settings, highlighting the importance of tailoring control and preventative programmes to the local setting. While the World Health Organization (WHO) initially advised that countries with geographic settings reaching at least 70% seroprevalence by 9 years of age could consider CYD-TDV vaccination [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] produced a change in the vaccine recommendations, with CYD-TDV vaccination currently advised only among subjects ≥9 years of age with evidence of a previous dengue infection [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Though temporal variability in force of infection means that the proportion of seropositive individuals in any one age group will also vary by year, our estimates from data averaged across the 10-year period represent long-term averages in transmission intensity. Using long-term average transmission intensity estimates, we expect average seroprevalence levels of 59.1% (95%CrI: 58.7–59.4), 78.6% (95%CrI: 78.3–78.9) and 88.8% (95%CrI: 88.6–89.0), in the 5–9, 10–14 and 15–19 age groups, respectively, in Jakarta province. Additionally, we expect every subdistrict in Jakarta to have seroprevalence levels of at least 50% amongst 9-year olds, suggesting that across all subdistricts, at least one in every two 9-year olds that are serologically screened would be eligible for vaccination. The age-specific seroprevalence estimates presented in this study can inform potential future individual-based serological screening programmes to determine the proportion of screened individuals that would be eligible for vaccination.
