<p>Annual reporting probabilities varied by year, from 0.024 (95%CrI: 0.022–0.026) in 2017 to 0.179 (95%CrI: 0.176–0.182) in 2016, the year in which a significant outbreak took place. Similar estimates have been observed in a prospective cohort study of dengue infections in Thai children aged 4–16, where 12.5% of secondary infections resulted in hospitalized dengue cases [

Annual transmission intensity estimates for Jakarta province during 2008–2017 ranged from 0.012 (95%CrI: 0.011–0.013) in 2017 to 0.124 (95%CrI: 0.121–0.128) in 2016, with large heterogeneity at the subdistrict level. This temporal variability in annual dengue force of infection means that the expected proportion of dengue-naïve children in any one age group also varies by year which, coupled with complex immunological factors, such as antibody-dependent enhancement, will shape the risk of severe dengue in children in any given year. Results from recent analyses of a longitudinal study conducted in Thailand found a significant cohort effect on the proportion of 9-year olds who were dengue-naïve by study year, with up to a twofold difference in the probability of being dengue-naïve depending on year [

When assessing the level of dengue transmission from case notification data, it is therefore important to consider data from multiple years in order to obtain reliable long-term estimates of average transmission intensity which will hold relevance for public health policy decision-makers.
