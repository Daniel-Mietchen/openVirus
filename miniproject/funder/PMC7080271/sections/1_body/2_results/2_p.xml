<p>An average annual force of infection of 0.130 (95%CrI: 0.129–0.131) was estimated for Jakarta province between 2008 and 2017 using model 1 variant 
 <italic>PS</italic>. This same model produced estimates of the probability of a dengue infection resulting in a reported hospitalized DHF case (reporting rate for secondary infections, ρ) of 0.077 (95%CrI: 0.076–0.078), with primary infections being 0.002 (95%CrI: 0.001–0.009) times as likely to result as hospitalized DHF (reporting probability, γ
 <sub>1</sub> relative to ρ) (Table D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Using model 2, variant PS, the annual average force of infection in Jakarta province varied by year from 0.012 (95%CrI: 0.011–0.013) in 2017 to 0.124 (95%CrI: 0.121–0.128) in 2016 (blue points in
