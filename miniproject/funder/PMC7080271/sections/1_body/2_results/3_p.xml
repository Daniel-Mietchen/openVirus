 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008102.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the average annual subdistrict force of infection estimates obtained from the fit of model 1 variant 
 <italic>PS</italic> to data averaged over the 10-year period, 2008–2017. We find that Sawah Besar subdistrict had the lowest average annual transmission intensity, with an average force of infection of 0.090 (95%CrI: 0.077–0.103) per year, while Pasar Rebo experienced the highest average force of infection of 0.163 (95%CrI: 0.153–0.174) per year (see Table E in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref> for full results). Maps of yearly subdistrict force of infection are shown in S6 Fig in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Analysis of spatial autocorrelation of the average annual subdistrict force of infection estimates for the 10-year period using model 1 variant 
 <italic>PS</italic> showed significant spatial clustering of dengue transmission, with a Moran’s I-coefficient of 0.29 (p-value = 0.002). Significant clustering of high transmission intensity subdistricts was observed in central-southeast Jakarta, predominantly in the region of East Jakarta, while spatial clustering of low transmission intensity subdistricts was observed in the region of Central Jakarta (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref>). Using force of infection estimates from model 1 variant 
 <italic>PS</italic> fitted to the data averaged over the period 2008–2017, we observed a weak correlation between subdistrict force of infection and population density, with a 0.063 (95%CI: -0.009–0.136) average increase in force of infection per 100,000 unit increase in population density. Population density explained approximately 5% (adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.049) of the variability in annual average subdistrict force of infection estimates (S8 Fig in
