<p>Using the average annual force of infection estimates obtained with model 1 variant 
 <italic>PS</italic> from the 10-year period, we derived the expected proportion of seropositive population by age in Jakarta province and estimated the extent to which this proportion would vary between the highest and lowest transmission intensity subdistricts within Jakarta, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008102.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. All subdistrict estimates of the proportion of seropositive 9-year olds are given in Table E in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref>. At age 9, the expected proportion of seropositive individuals in Jakarta province is 68.9% (95%CrI: 68.6–69.3) ranging from 55.6% (95%CrI: 50.2–60.4) to 77.1% (95%CrI: 74.8–79.1) across subdistricts. By age 15, this proportion is expected to have risen to 85.8% (95%CrI: 85.5–86.0) for the entire province, ranging from 74.2% (95%CrI: 68.7–78.7) to 91.4% (95%CrI: 89.9–92.7) across subdistricts. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008102.g004">Fig 4B</xref> shows the expected proportion of subdistricts that reach 50%, 70% and 90% seroprevalence by age. We find that all subdistricts (42/42) in Jakarta are expected to have at least 50% seroprevalence amongst 9-year olds, and 38% (16/42) are expected to have seroprevalence levels above 70% at this age. At age 15, all subdistricts (42/42) are expected to have seroprevalence levels of at least 70%, with 12% (5/42) of subdistricts expected to have seroprevalence levels of 90% or more in this age group.
