<p>All parameter estimates and model fits for Jakarta province, obtained using both model variants 
 <italic>S</italic> (assuming all reported hospitalised DHF cases are due to secondary infections) and 
 <italic>PS</italic> (assuming reported hospitalised DHF cases are due to primary and secondary infections), are given in Table D and S1 Fig of the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Model variants 
 <italic>S</italic> and 
 <italic>PS</italic> produced largely similar estimates, particularly when estimates of the probability of primary infections being reported as DHF cases (γ
 <sub>1</sub>) are negligible. Model variant 
 <italic>PS</italic> was favoured by Deviance Information Criterion (DIC) and therefore for brevity, in the remainder of the manuscript, we focus on the results obtained with model variant 
 <italic>PS</italic>. Estimates from model variant 
 <italic>S</italic> are given in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref>. All force of infection estimates quoted in this manuscript refer to the total force of infection from all dengue serotypes (i.e. 4λ).
