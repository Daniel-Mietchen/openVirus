<p>In model 2 we extend model 1 to allow transmission intensity to vary from year to year. In order to estimate the population-level immunity profiles at the beginning of 2008, we assume transmission intensity to have been constant throughout the lifetimes of individuals observed in the first year of our data, i.e. a constant transmission intensity for 80 years prior to and including 2008. The incidence of primary and secondary infections in subsequent years can then be calculated based on the estimated population-level immunity profiles, i.e. the estimated proportion of the population susceptible, S, and the estimated proportion of the population exposed to a monotypic infection, M, by age, as shown in Eqs
