<p>We fitted the model to the case-notification data reported in each year of the study period (2008–2017) simultaneously, whereby the transmission intensity in each year is dependent on the transmission intensity of all other years. Model 2 was fitted independently to each geographic unit (i.e. at the province- and subdistrict-level, separately), assuming no spatial interactions. The susceptible and monotypic population proportions were estimated by single years of age to account for ageing. These estimates were then averaged across the age groups of our data and disease incidence was calculated as in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pntd.0008102.e002">Eq 2</xref>. Due to the presence of maternal immunity potentially increasing the risk of disease in &lt;1-year olds, the model was fitted to case data from 1 to 80 year olds only. Susceptible and monotypic proportions of 1-year olds were added to the population each year at a rate consistent with having been exposed to the previous year’s force of infection.
