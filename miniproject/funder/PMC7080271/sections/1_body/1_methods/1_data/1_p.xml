<p>In Jakarta province, cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are both notified as DHF to the Ministry of Health in Jakarta. These publicly available data are reported from public and private hospitals as well as 
 <italic>puskesmas</italic> (primary healthcare centres) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Laboratory confirmation of dengue is uncommon, with diagnoses predominantly based on clinical criteria and basic haematology results [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Age-stratified case notification data were collated for the 44 subdistricts (administrative level 3) of Jakarta for the years 2008–2017 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. DHF cases reported in children &lt;1 year old were excluded from our analyses due to the existence of maternal antibodies which could have potentially predisposed some infants to symptomatic or severe disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since the life expectancy in Indonesia is approximately 70 years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we assumed that cases reported in the age group ≥75 occurred in individuals aged 75–80. We used population age structure data from the Jakarta Open Data website [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and from the Ministry of National Development Planning [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The population age structure for Jakarta province was available for 2010 and 2014 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the population age structure at the subdistrict-level was available for the years 2014–2016 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. From the provincial-level population age structure for 2010 and 2014, we derived average annual age group-specific rates of population change, which were applied to the 2014 subdistrict-level age structures to obtain approximate subdistrict age structures for the years 2010–2013. In the absence of population data before 2010 and after 2016, we assumed the same population age structure observed in 2010 for the years 2008 and 2009 and the same age structure observed in 2016 for the year 2017 across all subdistricts. The yearly population age structures derived for each subdistrict from the available data are given in Supplementary file (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s002">S1 File</xref>). The yearly total case numbers and incidence rates of hospitalized DHF for Jakarta province used in this analysis are reported in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and data by subdistrict are available in Tables A and B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref>. Between 2008 and 2017, over 200,000 hospitalized cases of DHF were reported in Jakarta, which corresponds to an average incidence of 2.07 per 1,000 persons per year. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008102.g001">Fig 1</xref> shows the average age-specific incidence of hospitalized DHF averaged over the 10-year period, by region and subdistrict. The Thousand Islands/Kepulauan Seribu regency was omitted from subsequent analyses due to sparse case notification data from this regency, a chain of islands in the Java Sea that are predominantly privately owned.
