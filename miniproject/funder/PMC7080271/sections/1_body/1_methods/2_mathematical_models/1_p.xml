<p>In this analysis we apply two mathematical models. Model 1, which assumes time-constant transmission intensity, was fitted to age-stratified case data averaged over the entire 10-year period to infer long-term average estimates in transmission intensity. This was done at both province and subdistrict levels. Model 2 allows transmission intensity to vary in time and was fitted to yearly data at both province and subdistrict levels. Both models assume transmission of all four dengue virus serotypes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and that infection with any one serotype provides lifelong homotypic immunity. The models also assume that transmission intensity is age-constant and, due to lack of serotype-specific data, that the four dengue serotypes were transmitted with equal intensity.
