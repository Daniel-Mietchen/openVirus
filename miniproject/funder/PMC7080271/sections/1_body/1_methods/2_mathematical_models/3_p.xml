<p>We defined a multinomial log-likelihood (for details see section 3 of the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref>) and used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for parameter inference. We assumed uniform priors on all parameters (range 0–1). Age-specific seroprevalence estimates were obtained using force of infection estimates as detailed in section 3.3 of the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref>. The proportion of subdistricts reaching 50%, 70% and 90% seroprevalence at 9 years of age were calculated using average force of infection estimates obtained from the fit of model 1 to average annual age-stratified DHF incidence rates from the 10-year period (2008–2017) in Jakarta’s subdistricts.
