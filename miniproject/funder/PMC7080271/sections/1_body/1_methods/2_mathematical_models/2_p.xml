<p>For both Model 1 and Model 2 we explored two model sub-variants, which we denoted model variant S and PS. Under model variant S we assumed that the observed disease incidence (i.e. all hospitalized DHF cases) were caused by secondary infections (i.e. we set γ1 to zero). Under model variant PS we assumed that hospitalized DHF cases could be caused by primary or secondary infections, where primary infections were less likely to be symptomatic and reported than secondary infections (i.e. we assumed γ1&lt;ρ).</p>
