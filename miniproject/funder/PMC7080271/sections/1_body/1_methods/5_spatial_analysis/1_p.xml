<p>Spatial autocorrelation of dengue force of infection was assessed using the Moran’s I-coefficient and local indicator of spatial association (LISA) metrics. The significance of the Moran’s I-coefficient was assessed by a Monte-Carlo permutation test with 1,000 simulations, under the null-hypothesis that subdistrict estimates of dengue force of infection are randomly distributed within the province of Jakarta. Subdistrict population density estimates from the 2010 census, available online [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], were used to assess the relationship between subdistrict population density and the estimated dengue force of infection using a simple linear regression model (full details given in section 3.5 of
