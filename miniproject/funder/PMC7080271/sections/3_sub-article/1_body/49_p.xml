<p>Reviewer #2: I like that the authors list out the study limitations. However, I wonder how realistic and useful this work would be for the dengue control program under those assumptions. For example, the authors allow for post-secondary infection to contribute to transmission which do not cause severe conditions. This is quite a strong assumption and difficult to justify. Since the authors are working with policy makers, that would be more useful to the control program to have results under different assumptions rather than just one instance presented to the government.</p>
