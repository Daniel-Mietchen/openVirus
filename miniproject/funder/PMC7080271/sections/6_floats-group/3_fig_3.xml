  <title>Spatial variation in average annual total dengue force of infection (4λ) estimates in Jakarta obtained from the fit of model 1 variant PS (assuming reported hospitalised DHF cases are caused by primary or secondary infections) to average annual hospitalised DHF data reported in 2008–2017.</title>
  <p>(A) Map of median force of infection estimates per subdistrict; (B) median and 95% credible interval of the estimates reported in panel A. Blue dashed line and shading shows the median and 95% credible interval province-level average annual force of infection in 2008–2017. FOI: force of infection. Boundaries were obtained from Wikimedia Commons under a CC-BY 3.0 NL license and converted to shapefile format using QGIS (25,26).</p>
