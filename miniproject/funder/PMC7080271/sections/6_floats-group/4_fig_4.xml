  <title>Expected seroprevalence levels in Jakarta province.</title>
  <p>(A) Expected proportion (median and 95% credible interval) of the population seropositive to dengue by age using the total force of infection (4λ) estimate obtained from the fit of model 1 variant PS (assuming all hospitalised DHF cases are caused by primary or secondary infections) to average annual hospitalised DHF data reported in the period 2008–2017 in Jakarta province (blue dashed line); Sawah Besar, the subdistrict with the lowest force of infection estimate (green); and Pasar Rebo, the subdistrict with the highest force of infection estimate (purple). The corresponding average force of infection estimate is given at the end of each line. (B) The proportion of subdistricts (N = 42) in Jakarta province that reach at least 50%, 70% and 90% seroprevalence by age, obtained from subdistrict force of infection estimates using model 1 variant PS fitted to the average annual incidence of hospitalised DHF cases reported in the period 2008–2017.</p>
