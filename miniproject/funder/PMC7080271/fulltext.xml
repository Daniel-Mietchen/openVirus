Increased globalization and rapid urbanization continue to facilitate the geographic expansion of the mosquito vector and virus in tropical regions, where the frequency and magnitude of dengue epidemics has increased dramatically in the past 40 years [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Approximately 70% of the global burden of dengue disease occurs on the Asian continent [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], where many large urban centres provide optimal environments for sustained endemic transmission and periodic epidemic cycles.</p><p>Indonesia reports the highest number of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases in the WHO Southeast Asia Region [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], though experts acknowledge that case numbers are largely under-reported and that reporting practices vary substantially by region [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The 1997 World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions are used for dengue reporting in Indonesia, where only dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are notifiable. A cluster-design cross-sectional seroprevalence survey conducted in 2014 estimated an average annual force of infection of 0.140 (95%CI: 0.133&#x02013;0.147) in urban populations of Indonesia [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, is a densely populated megacity with endemic transmission of all 4 dengue serotypes and cyclical epidemics every 3&#x02013;5 years [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Current control strategies in Jakarta focus on the removal of mosquito breeding sites by the Mosquito Nest Eradication Program (Pemberantasan Sarang Nyamuk), as well as the periodic use of chemical insecticides for vector management [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The characterization of spatial and temporal variability in dengue transmission intensity has become increasingly important in recent years to inform optimal implementation of novel vector control and prevention strategies, including the release of <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>infected mosquitoes and vaccination. The most recent WHO guidelines for use of the world&#x02019;s first dengue vaccine, CYD-TDV (or Dengvaxia), recommend a &#x02018;test-before-vaccination&#x02019; approach with serological testing of individuals prior to vaccination [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], thus presenting significant financial and logistical challenges for the implementation of vaccination campaigns. While the implementation of individual-based screening and vaccination programmes may not be feasible at the national-level for many countries, geographically targeted interventions implemented at a sub-national level may present a more realistic and cost-effective option in specific settings. Dengue force of infection, which is defined as the per capita rate susceptible individuals acquire infection, is a key measure of transmission intensity and provides valuable insights into the age-related risk of infection and population immunity dynamics. In many dengue endemic countries, routinely collected case notifications are often the only available source of data with which to assess dengue transmission intensity. Though the reliability of dengue case notification data based on clinical diagnoses can vary due to non-specific clinical manifestations caused by dengue and other vector-borne infections, analysis of the relationship between age and disease incidence can provide valuable insights into the underlying nature and intensity of dengue transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The age-related patterns of dengue incidence obtained from reported surveillance data can be attributed to the transmission setting and multiple other factors, including the complex immunological interactions of the four dengue virus serotypes, reporting practices, healthcare-seeking behaviour and surveillance capacities. A large proportion of dengue infections result in mild or no symptoms and infection with any one serotype is thought to provide long-term immunity to the same serotype and a short-lived period of cross-protection against infections with heterologous serotypes [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Severe dengue disease is often, but not always, associated with secondary infections through an immunopathological phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), whereby pre-existing anti-DENV antibodies enhance disease severity in secondary heterologous infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Due to cross-reactivity of dengue antibodies in current serological assays, less is known about tertiary and quaternary infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] which are thought to cause less symptomatic disease than primary or secondary infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. For this reason, most mathematical models of dengue transmission assume clinical protection upon secondary infection [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Here we apply catalytic models [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to provide the first detailed description of spatial and temporal variability in dengue transmission intensity in Jakarta, Indonesia. We estimated dengue transmission intensity and reporting probabilities from age-stratified case notification data in 42 subdistricts of Jakarta over a 10-year period between 2008 and 2017. These estimates can inform the implementation of future control and preventative programmes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Data</title><p>In Jakarta province, cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) are both notified as DHF to the Ministry of Health in Jakarta. These publicly available data are reported from public and private hospitals as well as <italic>puskesmas</italic> (primary healthcare centres) [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Laboratory confirmation of dengue is uncommon, with diagnoses predominantly based on clinical criteria and basic haematology results [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Age-stratified case notification data were collated for the 44 subdistricts (administrative level 3) of Jakarta for the years 2008&#x02013;2017 [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. DHF cases reported in children &#x0003c;1 year old were excluded from our analyses due to the existence of maternal antibodies which could have potentially predisposed some infants to symptomatic or severe disease [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since the life expectancy in Indonesia is approximately 70 years [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we assumed that cases reported in the age group &#x02265;75 occurred in individuals aged 75&#x02013;80. We used population age structure data from the Jakarta Open Data website [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and from the Ministry of National Development Planning [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The population age structure for Jakarta province was available for 2010 and 2014 [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the population age structure at the subdistrict-level was available for the years 2014&#x02013;2016 [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. From the provincial-level population age structure for 2010 and 2014, we derived average annual age group-specific rates of population change, which were applied to the 2014 subdistrict-level age structures to obtain approximate subdistrict age structures for the years 2010&#x02013;2013. In the absence of population data before 2010 and after 2016, we assumed the same population age structure observed in 2010 for the years 2008 and 2009 and the same age structure observed in 2016 for the year 2017 across all subdistricts. The yearly population age structures derived for each subdistrict from the available data are given in Supplementary file (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s002">S1 File</xref>).

Model 1, which assumes time-constant transmission intensity, was fitted to age-stratified case data averaged over the entire 10-year period to infer long-term average estimates in transmission intensity. This was done at both province and subdistrict levels. Model 2 allows transmission intensity to vary in time and was fitted to yearly data at both province and subdistrict levels. Both models assume transmission of all four dengue virus serotypes [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and that infection with any one serotype provides lifelong homotypic immunity. The models also assume that transmission intensity is age-constant and, due to lack of serotype-specific data, that the four dengue serotypes were transmitted with equal intensity.</p><p>For both Model 1 and Model 2 we explored two model sub-variants, which we denoted model variant S and PS. Under model variant S we assumed that the observed disease incidence (i.e. all hospitalized DHF cases) were caused by secondary infections (i.e. we set &#x003b3;1 to zero). Under model variant PS we assumed that hospitalized DHF cases could be caused by primary or secondary infections, where primary infections were less likely to be symptomatic and reported than secondary infections (i.e. we assumed &#x003b3;1&#x0003c;&#x003c1;).</p><p>We defined a multinomial log-likelihood (for details see section 3 of the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref>) and used the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for parameter inference.

We observed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in force of infection within Jakarta province, with long-term spatial clustering of both high and low transmission intensity subdistricts. Though ranking of subdistrict transmission intensity estimates varied by year, our analysis identified a long-term average hot-spot of dengue transmission in the southeast of Jakarta province and clustering of low transmission intensity in the region of Central Jakarta. Subdistrict population density was found to have a weak association with dengue transmission intensity, explaining approximately 5% of the variation in subdistrict force of infection estimates during 2008&#x02013;2017, with higher average annual force of infection associated with greater population densities (for details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref> sections 3.5 and S8 Fig). Though this association may suggest higher rates of human-vector contact in densely populated areas, numerous other environmental, socioeconomic and behavioural factors not included in this analysis are likely to influence local transmission intensity.</p><p>Annual reporting probabilities varied by year, from 0.024 (95%CrI: 0.022&#x02013;0.026) in 2017 to 0.179 (95%CrI: 0.176&#x02013;0.182) in 2016, the year in which a significant outbreak took place. Similar estimates have been observed in a prospective cohort study of dengue infections in Thai children aged 4&#x02013;16, where 12.5% of secondary infections resulted in hospitalized dengue cases [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Annual transmission intensity estimates for Jakarta province during 2008&#x02013;2017 ranged from 0.012 (95%CrI: 0.011&#x02013;0.013) in 2017 to 0.124 (95%CrI: 0.121&#x02013;0.128) in 2016, with large heterogeneity at the subdistrict level. This temporal variability in annual dengue force of infection means that the expected proportion of dengue-na&#x000ef;ve children in any one age group also varies by year which, coupled with complex immunological factors, such as antibody-dependent enhancement, will shape the risk of severe dengue in children in any given year. Results from recent analyses of a longitudinal study conducted in Thailand found a significant cohort effect on the proportion of 9-year olds who were dengue-na&#x000ef;ve by study year, with up to a twofold difference in the probability of being dengue-na&#x000ef;ve depending on year [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. When assessing the level of dengue transmission from case notification data, it is therefore important to consider data from multiple years in order to obtain reliable long-term estimates of average transmission intensity which will hold relevance for public health policy decision-makers.</p><p>Recent studies [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] have demonstrated that vaccination campaigns with the CYD-TDV vaccine could potentially increase individual-level risks of disease in low-to-medium transmission intensity settings, highlighting the importance of tailoring control and preventative programmes to the local setting. While the World Health Organization (WHO) initially advised that countries with geographic settings reaching at least 70% seroprevalence by 9 years of age could consider CYD-TDV vaccination [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], new data from Sanofi Pasteur [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] produced a change in the vaccine recommendations, with CYD-TDV vaccination currently advised only among subjects &#x02265;9 years of age with evidence of a previous dengue infection [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Though temporal variability in force of infection means that the proportion of seropositive individuals in any one age group will also vary by year, our estimates from data averaged across the 10-year period represent long-term averages in transmission intensity. Using long-term average transmission intensity estimates, we expect average seroprevalence levels of 59.1% (95%CrI: 58.7&#x02013;59.4), 78.6% (95%CrI: 78.3&#x02013;78.9) and 88.8% (95%CrI: 88.6&#x02013;89.0), in the 5&#x02013;9, 10&#x02013;14 and 15&#x02013;19 age groups, respectively, in Jakarta province. Additionally, we expect every subdistrict in Jakarta to have seroprevalence levels of at least 50% amongst 9-year olds, suggesting that across all subdistricts, at least one in every two 9-year olds that are serologically screened would be eligible for vaccination. The age-specific seroprevalence estimates presented in this study can inform potential future individual-based serological screening programmes to determine the proportion of screened individuals that would be eligible for vaccination.</p><p>Overall, we find that the <italic>S</italic> and <italic>PS</italic> model variants produce largely similar estimates of average force of infection, except for years when substantial proportions of DHF cases are estimated to be caused by primary infections (&#x003b3;<sub>1</sub>). For these years, as expected, model variant <italic>S</italic> estimates a higher force of infection than model variant <italic>PS</italic>, due to the assumption that all DHF cases have experienced two infections. In both model variants <italic>S</italic> and <italic>PS</italic>, we assumed that post-secondary infections do not cause severe disease and are hence not detected. Though post-secondary infections are thought to be largely asymptomatic due to long-term heterotypic immunity, if a considerable proportion of severe dengue cases were being caused by tertiary or quaternary infections (perhaps in older individuals whose cross-protective immunity had waned) our models could potentially underestimate the force of infection. As shown in [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], a low age of seroconversion and a high age of DHF are easier to reconcile when relaxing the assumption of clinical protection after secondary infection, which is important to consider given the high occurrence of post-secondary infections observed in hyperendemic regions of Indonesia [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] as well as the increasing average age of DHF cases that has been observed in the country [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>There are potential limitations in the assumptions adopted in this analysis which are important to consider when interpreting the estimates obtained with our models. When estimating transmission intensity within administratively-defined boundaries, we inherently assumed that cases reported in any one administrative unit were also infected in that same administrative unit, which is less realistic at small administrative levels such as subdistricts. While we explicitly accounted for temporal trends, we assumed no spatial interactions among Jakarta subdistricts. Accounting for spatial structure would increase the complexity of the inferential problem and make parameter inference challenging. Furthermore, we assumed reporting probabilities to be constant in time and age, though fluctuations in reporting may occur over time due to situational awareness (e.g. during epidemics) or by age if any age-related reporting biases were occurring. Additionally, the parameter results shown in this analysis are estimated assuming no overdispersion in the distribution of dengue cases (i.e. we assume a Poisson distribution for the total number of cases and a multinomial distribution for the age distribution of cases), which may result in an underestimation of the uncertainty around the central parameter estimates. In exploratory analysis, we tested the use of over-dispersed case distributions (specifically assuming a negative binomial distribution for the total number of cases and a Dirichlet multinomial likelihood for the age-distribution of cases). However, the use of over-dispersed distributions hindered MCMC convergence. A significant dengue outbreak occurred in Jakarta in 2016, for which our model could not entirely reproduce the high rates of disease observed in the 10&#x02013;14 years age group (S2 Fig in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008102.s001">S1 Text</xref>). This is likely due to our assumption of equal transmissibility of all 4 serotypes, which does not account for varying levels of population immunity to different serotypes. It is probable that the epidemic in 2016 was the result of the emergence of a newly dominant serotype to which the population had low levels of prior immunity. Due to a lack of serotype-specific data, this is not accounted for in our model, potentially resulting in an underestimation of the force of infection in 2016. In addition, dengue transmission in Jakarta has a distinct seasonal pattern, with case numbers typically peaking in March through May, following the rainy season [<xref rid="pntd.0008102.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In this analysis we assumed that the force of infection is constant within each year, ignoring intra-annual variability and thus producing average annual transmission intensity estimates. Long-term estimates of transmission intensity, however, will hold relevance to decisions when considering the implementation of future control and prevention programmes.</p><p>In conclusion, using publicly available data on DHF cases reported in Jakarta in the 10-year period of 2008&#x02013;2017, we have presented the first detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal variation in dengue transmission intensity conducted to date in Jakarta province. This study highlights the importance of estimating dengue transmission intensity from the analysis of age-stratified dengue case notification data rather than inferring it from the absolute number of cases, which can often be misleading. The estimates presented in this study will provide invaluable insights into the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of future control and preventative programmes, including vaccination with current or future dengue vaccines, and the use of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> technology, in the province of Jakarta.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008102.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Supplementary information.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008102.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008102.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Subdistrict population age-structures by year.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008102.s002.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008102.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Annual subdistrict parameter estimates.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008102.s003.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0008102.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Global strategy for dengue prevention and control, 2012&#x02013;2020.

Azman</p><p>Deputy Editor</p><p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p><p>***********************</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p><bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold></p><p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p><p><bold>Methods</bold></p><p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p><p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p><p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p><p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: Although I think the article has merit as a showcase of the application to Indonesian dengue control program, methodological concerns need to be addressed to ensure validity of the analyses.</p><p>- I understand that there might be computing issues with complicated models. However, there are examples that changing model assumptions, i.e. over-dispersed distributions in this case, can alter results significantly. How would you justify your results if you cannot apply the over-dispersed models? </p><p>- On page 10, it&#x02019;s not clear from model 2 if the authors apply equations 3-6 independently for each subdistrict or as the whole province because the spatial index is not specified. It&#x02019;s also evident from spatial association metrics that spatial correlation is present in the data but does not seem to be captured in model 2. </p><p>- Line 254, the authors assumed uniform priors on all parameters. Please provide the range of the priors.</p><p>--------------------</p><p><bold>Results</bold></p><p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p><p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p><p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p><p>--------------------</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p><p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p><p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p><p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: I like that the authors list out the study limitations. However, I wonder how realistic and useful this work would be for the dengue control program under those assumptions. For example, the authors allow for post-secondary infection to contribute to transmission which do not cause severe conditions. This is quite a strong assumption and difficult to justify. Since the authors are working with policy makers, that would be more useful to the control program to have results under different assumptions rather than just one instance presented to the government.</p><p>--------------------</p><p><bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold></p><p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend &#x0201c;Minor Revision&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Accept&#x0201d;. </p><p>Reviewer #1: (No Response)</p><p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p><p>--------------------</p><p><bold>Summary and General Comments</bold></p><p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p><p>Reviewer #1: The authors present an approach for estimating the force of infection from age-stratified case reports. The manuscript is well written and the methods and results are clearly described. The findings are presented in light of dengue vaccination campaigns (among others), where estimates of the pre-exposed population at a certain age are important for the implementation of test-before-vaccination approaches. The manuscript is of good quality and I recommend it for publication. I only have a few minor questions and suggestions: </p><p>1. The authors estimate reporting and misreporting rates. It would be worthwhile to report and discuss these in the manuscript. How to the estimated reporting rates differ between primary and secondary infections? How do estimates compare with published estimates (for instance from JD Stanaway et al, 2016, Lancet)?</p><p>2. The authors report hotspots of infection, i.e., areas where transmission is consistently higher than elsewhere. One might expect that, after a big outbreak year, the force of infection in such hotspots is lower due to build up immunity. Understanding such mechanisms could be helpful for targeting control efforts. Do the authors see any such pattern? Is the ranking across sub-districts stable over the years?</p><p>3. I am not sure all state variables are described in the text. (M is equation 4, maybe others). Please check if all are included.</p><p>Reviewer #2: (No Response)</p><p>--------------------</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">what does this mean?</ext-link>).
