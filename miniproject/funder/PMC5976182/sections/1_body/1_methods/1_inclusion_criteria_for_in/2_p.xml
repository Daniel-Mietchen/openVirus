<p>We included all information products published in any language that were specifically developed or adapted by WHO for the four selected emergencies. We excluded testimonials, media releases, situation reports and meeting reports. Two independent reviewers assessed each document against study inclusion criteria. As per WHOâ€™s definition [
 <xref rid="pone.0198125.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], we classified an information product as a guideline based on the content of that document (i.e., whether it contained a specific recommendation for the end-user), rather than by the process for development. Guidelines included products that contained recommendations and did not reference an underlying, source guideline. These covered a wide range of topics including clinical care [

 <xref rid="pone.0198125.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and occupational health and safety [
 <xref rid="pone.0198125.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], among many other topics. All other information products were classified as non-guidelines, which included, for example, publications derived from existing guidelines [
 <xref rid="pone.0198125.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], assessments of preparedness in countries[
 <xref rid="pone.0198125.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and tools for assessment or response [
 <xref rid="pone.0198125.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Non-guidelines are not expected to contain detailed methods and other types of information that is expected in a high-quality guideline.
