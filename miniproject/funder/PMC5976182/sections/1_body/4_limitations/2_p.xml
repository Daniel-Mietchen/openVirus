<p>Although widely used to assess the quality of reporting and conduct of guidelines, the AGREE II instrument has limitations [
 <xref rid="pone.0198125.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and it was developed for clinical guidelines and not for public health or emergency guidelines. Thus, the domain scores that we report should be interpreted with caution. The AGREE II tool is also limited in its scope. For example, the domain of applicability examines the inclusion of tools for implementation and discussion of barriers, cost implications, and monitoring of the guidelineâ€™s recommendations, but it does not address actual implementation or impact on health. In addition, we had only two assessors for the AGREE II appraisals; although acceptable according to AGREE II guidance, four reviewers would have enhanced the reliability of these assessments [
