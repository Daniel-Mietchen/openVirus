<p>Open data and open science can confer benefits to researchers, including increases in citation, media attention, and potential collaborations [
 <xref rid="pbio.2002617.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. While open access to scientific publications has increasingly received attention in the research literature [
 <xref rid="pbio.2002617.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], information on open data, especially in terms of encouraging international collaborations that leverage this content to address key biomedical and public health issues, is not well addressed. In most biomedical fields, data sharing does not normally happen before the research is concluded, while open science refers to sharing the research process and its outcomes on an ongoing basis [
 <xref rid="pbio.2002617.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are some excellent examples of open data and open science projects that encourage crowdsourcing of solutions to scientific problems (e.g., in malaria research [
 <xref rid="pbio.2002617.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]), but overall adoption of open research practices has been limited, particularly in biomedical research. We argue that open science and international collaboration are needed to address global health issues, and we describe a funding mechanism that was successful in encouraging that.
