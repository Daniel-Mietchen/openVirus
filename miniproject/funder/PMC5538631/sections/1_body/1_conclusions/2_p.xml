<p>While market intelligence is typically a benefit of challenge competitions, the international aspects of this competition enriched each of the funding agencies’ understanding of new ideas emerging around the globe and of the mechanisms behind that. The 6 solutions that moved from Phase I to Phase II were exemplars of innovative and useful tools/platforms that leverage open data. Moreover, the other 90 entries provided insight into emerging areas of interest, such as community annotation and knowledge-extraction tools. The other way in which the competition was notable was in its ability to highlight the value of open health data to the broader scientific community. As evidenced by the submissions, press coverage, and Twitter (
