  <title>Sensitivity of the risk of AHS persistence to variations in population size and infectious period.</title>
  <p>(A) Effect of variations in the size of the plains zebra population on the risk of AHS persistence as measured by the median outbreak duration. (B) Effect of variations in the mean infectious period 1/
   <italic>γ</italic> for AHS in plains zebra on the risk of AHS persistence as measured by the maximum outbreak duration. In (B), changes in the risk of AHS persistence as a function of 1/
   <italic>γ</italic> was computed for various population sizes. Risk of AHS persistence was computed over 40 independent AHS introduction events that consistently occurred in April 2012. All considered zebra populations were set with a population density similar to the median density reported in the WCP. Here is shown the outcomes for incursions in a typical holding located in either climatic zone A or climatic zone B.
