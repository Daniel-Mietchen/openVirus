  <title>Distribution of the risk of AHS persistence among all individual holdings with plains zebra in the WCP.</title>
  <p>Cumulative probability distributions of (A) the median and IQR outbreak durations and (B) the probability that AHS outbreaks would persist for &gt;1year computed over 40 independent AHS introductions in all individual holdings. (C) Spatial distribution of the risk of AHS persistence as measured by the median outbreak duration (in days) among holdings with plains zebra in the WCP. Here AHS was consistently introduced in April 2012.</p>
