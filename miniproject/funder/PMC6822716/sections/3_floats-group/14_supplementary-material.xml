  <title>Distribution of the risk of AHS persistence for increasing potential size of a plains zebra population in the WCP.</title>
  <p>Risk of persistence was computed using either the median outbreak duration and the probabilities that AHS outbreaks would persist for &gt;1 year, &gt;2 years and &gt;3 years. Risk measures were computed over 40 independent AHS introductions in considered scenarios. AHS was consistently introduced in April 2012 and considering an initial population density consistent to the median density reported in the WCP. Here is shown the outcomes for incursions in a typical holding located in either climatic zone A or climatic zone B.</p>
