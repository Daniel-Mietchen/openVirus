  <title>Schematic representation of the vector-host model.</title>
  <p>Zebra are either in a susceptible (
   <italic>X</italic>), latently infected (
   <italic>L</italic>), infectious (
   <italic>Y</italic>) or recovered (
   <italic>R</italic>) state, with subscripts 
   <italic>Y</italic>, 
   <italic>Jf</italic>, 
   <italic>Jm</italic>, 
   <italic>F</italic> or 
   <italic>M</italic> indicating the age class of the animal, being foal, female juvenile, male juvenile, adult female and adult male, respectively. Vectors are either in a susceptible (
   <italic>S</italic>), latently infected (
   <italic>E</italic>) or infectious (
   <italic>I</italic>) state. The stacked squares denote that this compartment is divided into multiple stages. All rates between epidemic states and age classes are defined in Tables 
   <xref rid="pone.0222366.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> &amp; 
   <xref rid="pone.0222366.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>. However, some rates may depend on environmental conditions, denoted in brackets, with conditions being the daily mean temperature (
   <italic>T</italic>) recorded at sunset (i.e. between 18:00 and 21:00), the yearly carrying capacity (
   <italic>K</italic>) or the calendar month of the year (
   <italic>t</italic>). For clarity, rates were given only once per epidemic state or age class. Note also that the rate of mortality for each zebra age class would be constant for all epidemic states.
