  <title>Spatial distribution of the risk of AHS persistence among all holdings with plains zebra in the Western Cape Province.</title>
  <p>Risk of persistence was computed using either the median outbreak duration and the probabilities that AHS outbreaks would persist for &gt;1 year, &gt;2 years and &gt;3 years. Risk measures were computed over 40 independent AHS introductions in all individual holdings. Here AHS was consistently introduced in April 2012.</p>
