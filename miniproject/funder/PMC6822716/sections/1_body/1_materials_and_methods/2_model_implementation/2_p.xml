<p>Because records of population structure in each considered population are missing, we assumed that each population of plains zebra have a similar population structure at the start of the simulations as found in Georgiadis et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As such, at the start of each simulation, the population included 16% foals, 25% juveniles, 24% adult males and 35% adult females, with a general male-to-female ratio of 0.7.
