<p>In this study, we considered AHS reached an endemic state if the virus is still actively present in the population after 2000 days (i.e. 5.5 years). We also computed various statistics over the tested 40 independent incursions: namely, the median (and its interquartile range, IQR) and the maximum duration of the outbreak as well as the probability of outbreak lasting &gt;1 year, &gt;2 years and &gt;3 years.</p>
