Incursion events were assumed resulting from the introduction of a single infected (but not infectious) adult female into a given plains zebra population. Unless otherwise stated, the introduction event would occur on the first day of the study period (1st January 2012) and disease would be left to spread for six years (or 2192 days).</p>
