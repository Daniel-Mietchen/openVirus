<p>The compared study areas are in the Western Cape Province of South Africa within which is the AHS controlled area (greyed area as shown in the rectangle in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), and the KNP, which is located in the Limpopo and Mpumalanga Provinces in the north-eastern part of the country (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To our knowledge AHS has not been reported in zebra since at least 1993 in the Western Cape Province (DAFF disease database) and albeit limited, prevalence survey results have not detected sero-positive animals in this area either [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In contrast, prevalence surveys in various locations in the north-eastern parts of the country have shown a high sero-prevalence for AHS in zebra, with close to 100% of juvenile or adult zebra testing positive to at least one AHS serotype [

 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While it is considered that endemic circulation in the KNP takes place there is no comprehensive data, to our knowledge, available regarding the incidence rate of this circulation.
