<p>It is worth noting that, while the epidemiological processes of AHS in both zebra and vector populations are computed at a daily time-step, the population dynamics for zebra is modelled at a monthly time-step. As such, in each given month, the epidemiological process would be carried out daily over a constant population.</p>
