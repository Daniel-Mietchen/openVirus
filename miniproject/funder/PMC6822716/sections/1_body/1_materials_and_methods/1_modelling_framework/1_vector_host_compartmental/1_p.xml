<p>We developed a hybrid deterministic-stochastic vector-host compartmental model, where the spread of AHSV in the host (i.e. plains zebra) population is stochastically modelled whereas the spread of AHSV in vectors is assumed deterministic. Here, we considered that the transmission process of AHSV in plains zebra is only driven by
