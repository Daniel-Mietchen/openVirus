<p>In the model, we considered that adult female 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> were the only vector life stage involved in AHS transmission dynamics. We therefore discarded the fine population dynamics of vectors and the impact of environmental factors on eggs, larvae and nymphs, and assumed vectors would be subject to a constant hazard of dying. Vectors can either be susceptible (
 <italic>S</italic>), latently infected (
 <italic>E</italic>, i.e. in the extrinsic incubation period) or infectious (
 <italic>I</italic>); as such it considers that vectors will be infectious till their death. However, to keep the ratio between the number of vectors and the number of hosts 
 <italic>ψ</italic> constant over time [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], we considered the vector population would replenished by the birth of susceptible vectors and fixed the total size of the vector population 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>V</italic>
 </sub> such as 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>V</italic>
 </sub> = 
 <italic>ψN</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>H</italic>
 </sub> where 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>H</italic>
 </sub> is the total size of the host population. The latter assumes, however, that the maximum number of vectors feeding on a single zebra in each day is constant between hosts, irrespective of their age class.
