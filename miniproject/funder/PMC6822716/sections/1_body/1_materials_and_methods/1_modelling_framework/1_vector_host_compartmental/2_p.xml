<p>Our model shares common features with the AHS model of Backer &amp; Nodelijk [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and with the Schmallenberg and Bluetongue model of Bessell et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Græsbøll et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Particularly, a latent compartment for hosts has been included to account for the relatively long delay period between infection and infectiousness that is expected to occur in zebra as in horses. We also divided some compartments into five independent stages to better emulate transition processes and avoid exponential decays in both the incubation period of vectors and infectious period of hosts [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, our model differs by (1) considering infection events in plains zebra will result in little to no mortality and will generate a life-long immune protection against a single AHS type, and (2) restricting our model to a closed population of zebra in a given holding, with a defined population size and surface area. The latter assumption was taken based on the large distance separating holdings with zebra in the WCP (mean = 204 
 <italic>km</italic>, SD = 118, 95% range 23–447 
 <italic>km</italic>) and the little recorded movements of animals between holdings. In addition to these assumptions, our model further differs by integrating the long-term population dynamics of the host population, separating the host population into five age classes. For simplicity, hosts are first considered born as a foal (
 <italic>Y</italic>, &lt;1 year-old), irrespective of their gender, but then mature into either male (
 <italic>J</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>m</italic>
 </sub>) or female (
 <italic>J</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>f</italic>
 </sub>) juveniles when one year old. Male and female juveniles then mature into male (
 <italic>M</italic>) and female (
 <italic>F</italic>) adults (&gt;3.4 year-old), respectively.
