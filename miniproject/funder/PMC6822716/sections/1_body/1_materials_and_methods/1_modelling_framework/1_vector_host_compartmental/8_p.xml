 <sub>
  <italic>V</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>T</italic>) were considered depending on the temperature 
 <italic>T</italic> (in °C) as midges will bite more often and the virus will replicate faster in vectors, requiring less time to be transmissible, when temperatures increases. However, with increasing temperatures, vectors will also die sooner. These relations were all extracted from [
