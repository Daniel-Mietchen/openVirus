<p>Given that it was assumed that zebra would be infectious for a period following a Gamma distribution with five infectious stages (consistent with models of bluetongue virus spread [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]), we only had to account for the uncertainty in the mean infectious period (1/
 <italic>γ</italic>). To estimate the mean infectious period of plains zebra, infection outcomes from seven experimentally challenged plains zebra [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were used. These seven zebra were last viraemic at 20, 13, 17, 24, 24, 24, 40 dpi, which, after accounting for a conservative 3-day latent period, yields an infectious period of 10 to 37 days. Using these data, the mean infectious period in zebra was estimated at 20.14 days, which would lead to zebra being infectious for a median of 18.8 days and a 95% range interval of 6.5–41.3 days. We further account for the uncertainty in the mean infectious period by randomly sampling its estimate at the start of each simulation from a normal distribution with a mean of 20.14 days and a standard deviation of 2 days, i.e. a 2.5%–97.5% interval of 16.2–24.1 days.
