<p>The estimate of the latent period of infected hosts (1/
 <italic>ϵ</italic>) was drawn from a Gamma distribution with a mean of 3.7 days and a standard deviation of 0.9 days (corresponding to 16 latent stages). This is similar to what has been done by Backer &amp; Nodelijk [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and considering that the latent period in zebra would be similar to what was recorded experimentally from five unvaccinated challenged horses [

 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This is however consistent with infection outcomes from seven experimentally challenged plains zebra [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showing that virus isolation from blood yielded positive results on day four.
