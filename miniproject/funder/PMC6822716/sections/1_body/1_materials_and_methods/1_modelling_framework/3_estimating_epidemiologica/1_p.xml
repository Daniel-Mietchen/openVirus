<p>Parameters driving the population dynamics of zebra and those drawn experimentally were well defined in Georgiadis et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Backer &amp; Nodelijk [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], respectively. We therefore considered that natural variations for these processes would be accounted for by the stochasticity of the system. On the other hand, particular attention was required to estimate and account for the uncertainty on some epidemiological parameters given the low level of understanding of the epidemiology of AHS in zebra. In particular, three parameters were perceived uncertain or unknown and could significantly affect the outcomes of our analyses. These were the mean latent period in zebra (1/
 <italic>ϵ</italic>), the mean infectious period in zebra (1/
 <italic>γ</italic>) and the maximum vector to host ratio (
 <italic>ψ</italic>). While different strategies were used to account for the uncertainty in each parameter, they all consisted in randomly drawing parameter values from defined distributions at the start of each simulation.
