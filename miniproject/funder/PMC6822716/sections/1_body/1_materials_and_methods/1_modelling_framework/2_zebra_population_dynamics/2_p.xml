<p>While the original model was designed and fitted over annual records of abundance of plains zebra, we adapted this modelling framework to account for the temporal variations of births within each given year. As such, numbers within each age and sex class were calculated in successive monthly time-steps as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g001">Fig 1</xref>. While foal numbers for each given year were calculated as equal to the number of adult females surviving from the previous year and that did not give birth in the previous year, the number of foals born in each given month varies as a function of the monthly density of foals
