<p>All vital rates and parameters used to model the zebra population dynamics were fitted from empirical observations and related to changes in annual records of rainfall in Laikipia District [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. While we acknowledge that the ecological conditions in the Laikipia District and our study sites are markedly different, we considered that using site-specific rainfall data would control for such differences. As such, parameters controlling the zebra population dynamics were kept similar to those fitted in [
