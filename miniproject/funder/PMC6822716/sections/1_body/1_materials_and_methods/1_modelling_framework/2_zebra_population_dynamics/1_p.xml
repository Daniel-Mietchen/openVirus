<p>We based our model on the age- and sex-structured population dynamic model of a plains zebra population in Laikipia District, Kenya, developed by Georgiadis et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, the model adjusts vital rates and age at first reproduction through a rainfall-mediated density-dependent (RMDD) mechanism. This RMDD modulates vital rates by a factor that depends on the ratio of carrying capacity 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>y</italic>
 </sub> to population size 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>H</italic>
 </sub>. Here, the carrying capacity is defined as the maximum number of individuals that could be supported in a given year, at maximum reproductive output and was estimated as a function of the total rainfall (
