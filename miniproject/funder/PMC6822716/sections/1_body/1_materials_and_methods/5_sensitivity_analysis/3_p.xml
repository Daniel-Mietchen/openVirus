<p>To investigate the impact of the population size on the risk of AHS persistence, we considered AHS to be introduced in holdings of various population sizes, varying from 5 to 50,000 individuals. To investigate the impact of the mean duration of infectiousness of plains zebra on the risk of AHS persistence, we progressively increased the value of 1/
 <italic>γ</italic> from 20 days to 50 days. However, because the impact of increasing 1/
 <italic>γ</italic> may inherently depend on the size of the zebra population in which the virus is introduced, we further evaluated the sensitivity of the model to variations of 1/
 <italic>γ</italic> for four population size (10, 50, 100 and 150 individuals).
