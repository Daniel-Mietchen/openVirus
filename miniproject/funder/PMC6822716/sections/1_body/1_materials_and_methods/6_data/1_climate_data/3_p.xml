<p>For the purpose of this work, vital traits of plains zebras and 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> population in each considered location in the WCP were driven by the climate records (i.e. yearly rainfalls and sunset temperature) of the nearest location for which data were downloaded, respectively. In contrast, simulations for KNP were always driven by the same set of temperature and rainfall data. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g002">Fig 2C</xref> compares the daily variations of sunset temperature and the yearly precipitation for Eiland and Stellenbosch as exemplars of the climate variables in KNP and the WCP, respectively.
