 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The API allows searching for data using longitude and latitude for given spatial locations. Data were requested for 11 randomly spatially sampled locations in the greater WCP and 1 location representative to the climate and midge ecology in the KNP. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g003">Fig 3A</xref> shows the location of the 12 sites in which climate information were downloaded. Daily data from 01 January 2012 to 01 January 2018 were extracted, and included the maximum, minimum temperature (in °C) as well as the three-hourly average temperature (in °C) and the three-hourly total precipitation (in
