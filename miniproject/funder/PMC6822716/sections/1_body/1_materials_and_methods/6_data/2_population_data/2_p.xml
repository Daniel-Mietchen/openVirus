<p>Over the 212 holdings with at least 1 reported plains zebra, surface areas of 110 could not be retrieved. We therefore imputed the unknown surface areas (in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), and (2) converting the population density into a surface area as a function of the reported number of zebra. Plains zebra in the WCP are kept at a median density of 1.50 individuals per
