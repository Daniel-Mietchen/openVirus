<p>While it has long been known that zebra, if present in large enough populations, play a role in the epidemiology of AHS in South Africa, it has not, until now, been explicitly established to what degree they could play a role in maintaining infection should they be associated with a sporadic outbreak in the WCP. While there is still much to be established regarding the host, vector, environmental and viral components of the disease in wild equids, we show that, in the current population structure (both herd and region-level), it is unlikely that zebra are in populations large enough to maintain a persistent AHS infection in and around the South African AHS controlled area. We have shown there is a potential for within-region differences in risk of persistence of AHS and further study is required to confirm this potential.</p>
