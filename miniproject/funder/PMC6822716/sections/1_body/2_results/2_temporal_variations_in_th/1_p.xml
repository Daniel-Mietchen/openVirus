Two main outcomes can be established from this scenario: (1) introducing AHS in April-May would have the greatest impact on virus persistence and would represent a high-risk period in the WCP, with AHS likely to remain circulating for more than a year in 37.7% (30.6%–45.5%) and 34.4% (27.5%–42.0%) of the time (

Instead, introducing AHS in April will generate an outbreak which would last for a median of 193 days (IQR: 110.5–421 days). For comparison, outbreaks of AHS started between June and September would only last in plains zebra population for less than a month (
