 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222366.s005">S5 Fig</xref> show the effect of increasing the size of the zebra population in which AHS is introduced on the outbreak duration and the likelihood of AHS persistence in the WCP. Clearly, conditions in climatic zone B are more likely to allow long term circulation of AHS in plains zebra than those in climatic zone A. In particular, incursion of AHS in zone A would seldom last until the end of our simulation period (i.e. for &gt;5.5 years or &gt;2000 days), whereas incursion in zone B would become endemic in a wide range of scenarios. For climatic zone A, only 3 simulations lasted for &gt;2000 days, and required a population of plains zebra of at least 50,000 individuals. In contrast, AHS became endemic in at least one simulation for a population of at least 500 individuals in climatic zone B. Of interest, 1 in 4 incursions in climatic zone B would become endemic in a zebra population of 1500 individuals, whereas AHS would always persistently circulate if the population included 5000 individuals. All simulations would last at least 1 year for populations of at least 500 individuals and at least 250 individuals in holdings located in climatic zones A and B, respectively. Finally, a population of at least 500 and 1500 individuals would be required for holdings in climatic zone B to suffer outbreaks lasting &gt;2 years and &gt;3 years respectively for every incursion of AHS (
