<p>The effect of increasing the infectious period 1/
 <italic>γ</italic> for zebra on the risk of AHS persistence in the WCP is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g007">Fig 7B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222366.s006">S6 Fig</xref>. Again, conditions in climatic zone A and B are markedly distinct. When incursion occurs in climatic zone A, outbreaks would never persist and would seldom last for &gt;1 year, irrespective to the duration of 1/
 <italic>γ</italic>. In contrast, incursion occurring in climatic zone B may circulate for &gt;3 years in a large enough zebra population (i.e. ≥50 individuals). In particular, outbreaks can become endemic in climatic zone B for population of at least 100 individuals. However, for this to happen, zebra would need to be infectious for an extended mean duration of infectiousness. For example, an introduction event of AHS in a plains zebra population of 150 individuals leads to an endemic circulation of AHS in at least one simulation in climatic zone B when 1/
 <italic>γ</italic> ≥41 days, which, at population-level, would lead zebras being infectious for a median of 38.3 days and a 95% range interval of 13.3–84.0 days. It is however worth noting that, with such population level infectious period, the odds to observe the infectious period similar to those obtained from the experimental infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] is 1 over 30 trillion (
 <italic>P</italic> = 3.41 × 10
 <sup>−14</sup>). If the introduction were to occur in a population of 100 zebra, outbreaks would only become endemic if 1/
 <italic>γ</italic> = 50 days, which, at population-level, would lead zebras being infectious for a median of 46.7 days and a 95% range interval of 16.2–102.4 days.
