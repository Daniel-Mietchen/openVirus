<p>To explore what conditions would allow long-lasting circulation of AHS in the WCP, we plotted the distribution of the median outbreak duration as a function of the size of the zebra population at the start of the simulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Two distinct groups of holdings may be observed with holdings denoted “A” showing orders of magnitude shorter median outbreak duration than those denoted “B”. These two groups are spatially defined (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), with group A involving holdings along the coast of the WCP, whereas group B includes holdings located inland, on the plateau. Given the limited number of factors affecting the model, it is clear that differences in the dynamics of the temperature used to drive AHS epidemiology for each holding may affect the risk of AHS persisting in the WCP. 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222366.s004">S4 Fig</xref> shows the dynamics of the sunset temperature for all sites we used to extract climatic data that were driving holdings in group A and group B. Clearly, sunset temperatures in group B are warmer in summer (more often between 25°C and 30°C) and colder temperatures in winter (more often between 5°C and 10°C). While our model indicates that these temperatures enable 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> to survive and allow AHS to persist in the environment for 2 to 3 seasons after the initial outbreak period, this needs to be validated with entomological and epidemiological data. For the remaining of this study, we will therefore imply that these two groups of holdings are representative to two climatic zones and will denote them “climatic zone A” and “climatic zone B”.
