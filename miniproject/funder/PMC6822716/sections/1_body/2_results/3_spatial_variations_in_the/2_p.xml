<p>Over all scenarios tested with regards to the incursion site, AHS outbreaks would last for a median of 135 days (IQR 123â€”161), with AHS circulating for less than 300 days in 94% of simulations (

Although AHS was never found persisting for more than 4 years in the WCP, 78, 5 and 1 holdings were able to generate outbreaks lasting &gt;1 year, &gt;2 years and &gt;3 years, respectively. Among the 78 holdings that were able to keep AHS circulating for &gt;1 year (denoted as high risk in
