 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g004">Fig 4</xref> provides a comparison on how the abundance of the plains zebra populations in KNP and in the WCP may vary during the study period. It is clear that these two populations behave differently. To facilitate comparison, we provide a projection of the population size considering a 10% annual population growth (the solid red line in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g004">Fig 4A &amp; 4C</xref>). The population in KNP showed little stochastic variations in abundance, with an initial increase in population with an annual rate of population growth of 4.2% (95% CI 4.1%–12.5%), reaching a maximum of 36,672 individuals. From January 2015, however, the population of KNP declined progressively due to poor availability of forage from successive years of low precipitations. In contrast, the population in the WCP showed high variability in predicted abundance, with high chances for significant reduction due to unsustainable population densities. Such a marked variability is partly due to the fact that the surface area of this population was unknown and therefore imputed from known population densities in the WCP. However, in simulations with population density of &lt;3.77 individuals per
