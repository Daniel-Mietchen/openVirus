<p>In KNP, introducing an infected AHS adult female in the zebra population at the start of the study period resulted in AHS becoming endemic in 100% of the 40 simulations tested (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0222366.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) but at a low level of prevalence. One year post introduction, i.e. when an endemic equilibrium is reached, 0.99% (95% CI 0.62%–1.36%) of zebras would be infected either at the exposed (
 <italic>L</italic>) or infectious (
 <italic>Y</italic>) stages, whereas 98.9% (95% CI 98.6%–99.4%) of zebra would be immune to AHS (i.e. in 
 <italic>R</italic> state). 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222366.s001">S1 Fig</xref> shows the daily variations in the prevalence of infectious hosts stratified by age class. It is clear that the persistence of AHS in the plains zebra population in KNP is driven by foals, with a clear seasonality driven by their birth. In January and February, the mean monthly proportion of infectious foals is 4.2% to 4.5%, whereas &lt;0.3% of the foals will be infectious from July to September. Over all simulations implemented in KNP, nearly all foals (&gt;99%) will be immune to infection when reaching juvenile age.
