<p>The presence of AHS in South Africa has resulted in a non-tariff barrier to directly trade live domestic equids with the European Union [

 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In order to establish the trade of live equids from the country, an AHS controlled area was established within the Western Cape Province (WCP) in 1997. This controlled area, located at the very south-western tip of South Africa, consists of an inner AHS free zone, a surveillance zone and a protection zone which differ in their risk profile and the nature of the equine population in each zone [

The AHS controlled area was established in the WCP principally on the basis that the distance to the Kruger National Park (KNP), located in the north-eastern extremity of the country, would be large enough to effectively isolate local horses from the large zebra population present in KNP and in which AHSV circulates persistently [

Furthermore, widespread vaccination of domestic horse populations outside the AHS controlled area is regularly implemented to further mitigate the risk of disease introduction in the AHS controlled area (Animal Diseases Act 1984).
