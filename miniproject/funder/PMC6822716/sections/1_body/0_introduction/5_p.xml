<p>In this study, we used a well described zebra population data-set within the WCP and including the AHS controlled area, along with published parameters relating to the populations and dynamics of AHS transmission, to inform an age- and sex-structured host-vector model and evaluate the likelihood that introduction events in the WCP would result in persistent AHSV circulation within a zebra population, similar to what is observed in KNP. As such, we focused our analyses to plains zebra (
 <italic>Equus quagga</italic>, formerly 
 <italic>E. burchellii</italic>), the most abundant wild equid in South Africa and in which AHS is endemic in KNP [

This work not only provides robust risk-based evidence for improving AHS preparedness and surveillance, but also represents an opportunity to answer questions that were asked over 20 years ago regarding the required size of a zebra population to maintain AHS infection in South Africa [
