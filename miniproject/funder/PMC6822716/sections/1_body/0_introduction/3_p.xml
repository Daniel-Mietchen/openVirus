<p>Even though vaccinating domestic horses has markedly decreased the annual incidence in South Africa compared to pre-vaccination levels [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], AHS still remains endemic in most of the country, with approximately 500 cases reported annually in domestic equids [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast, only sporadic outbreaks have occurred within the AHS controlled area, mostly linked to the re-assortment and/or reversion to virulence of the live attenuated AHS vaccine in use in the country [
