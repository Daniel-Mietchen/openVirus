<p>AHS has not been reported in zebra since at least 1993 in the WCP (DAFF disease database) and albeit limited, prevalence survey results have not detected sero-positive animals in this area [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, the risk of AHSV persisting in the WCP in the event that it is introduced in the local zebra population is a source of concern for the horse industry. Besides the increased cost in regaining free status if wild equids were infected, the geographic expansion of several midge-borne diseases and the emergence of arboviruses in Europe, causing large scale epidemics in livestock, have resulted in a sensitisation of European countries to the reality that the (re-)emergence of these viruses is a possibility, particularly for regions that have resident populations of

 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Such a sensitisation has highlighted the need to investigate zebra as a potential wildlife reservoir in the WCP to facilitate the re-establishment of trade in live equids from South Africa to Europe. Such a concern is further exacerbated by the fact that the most recent documented incursion of AHS into Europe (in 1987) was thought to have originated from southern Africa (Namibia)

 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. An evaluation of the potential for zebra populations to act as a reservoir for the disease in the AHS control zones also ensures that established surveillance strategies, movement and other AHS controls remain relevant to the current control activities.
