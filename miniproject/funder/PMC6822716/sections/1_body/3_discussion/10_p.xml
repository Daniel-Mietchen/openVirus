<p>Finally, we assumed that 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> will act as the only vector of AHS in zebra. Given that 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> is recognized as the most important vector of AHS in South Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and that the understanding in the feeding behaviour of other 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> and their relation with zebra remain limited, this assumption was believed reasonable. In South Africa, however, at least 13 other 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species, including 
 <italic>C. magnus</italic>, 
 <italic>C. nevilli</italic>, 
 <italic>C. zuluensis</italic>, 
 <italic>C. bolitinos</italic>, and 
 <italic>C. enderleini</italic>, are known to be orally susceptible to infection with AHSV [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Particularly, 
 <italic>C. bolitinos</italic> is a proven vector of AHSV [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and represents the most likely driver of AHS transmission in cooler mountainuous areas of South Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In WCP and KNP, 
 <italic>C. bolitinos</italic> is however 10 to 100 times less abundant than 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Nevertheless, increasing the number of vectors species, particularly if their ecology and niche significantly differ, could increase the complexity of the transmission dynamics of AHSV [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and increase the likelihood that disease would spread and reach endemic state [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Again, whether this endemic state could occur in zebra populations of the WCP despite relatively low population abundance should be considered in future research.
