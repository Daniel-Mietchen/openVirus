<p>Given the predicted higher risk for plains zebra to maintain AHS in climatic zone B, there is a marked need for the quantitative characterization of the impact of ecological factors other than temperature (such as soil quality, humidity and rainfalls) on the survival, biting and breeding activities of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> in South Africa. Unfortunately, entomological studies allowing reliable measurements suitable for use in epidemiological models are still scarce. In this context, the work in [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] should be commended and represents an exemplar toward better understanding environmental drivers in midges abundance and activities. A previous study in South Africa has shown that the minimum records in monthly values of both land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), an indicator of abundance of live green vegetation (hence, humidity), were the best predictors of the mean daily blacklight trap capture of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As such, coupling our model with predicted abundances from remote sensing information, similar to those in [

 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], could represent a feasible alternative to improve the accuracy of our assessment in the future.
