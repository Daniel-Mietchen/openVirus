<p>Despite being widely distributed, there is still a dearth of research and reliable data on the population dynamics of plains zebra in southern Africa. The population dynamics of plains zebra has however been previously characterised from &gt;20 years of abundance records in Laikipia District, Kenya [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and upon which a simulation model has been developed and validated [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Not only does it represent a key tool to better manage plains zebra populations in Laikipia, such a model highlighted the role of annual rainfalls as a key limiting factor in the population growth of plains zebra. In this study, we capitalised on such a relationship and assumed that using annual rainfall information recorded in either the WCP or KNP would be sufficient to characterise the population dynamics of plains zebra in our study areas. Although our model behaves according to our beliefs and the anecdotal records of population growth in the area, it cannot be validated. Similarly, little is known on the level of AHS prevalence in plains zebra in South Africa apart from a single longitudinal prevalence study carried out in 1991/1992 [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] showing that almost 100% of the free-living zebra foals born in the KNP were sero-positive for at least one serotype of AHSV once reaching adulthood. In addition, a continuous transmission cycle of virus has been shown between 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> midges and zebras in the KNP [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While these are again consistent with our results, they only emphasise the critical need of systematic longitudinal population abundance and surveillance records in plains zebra to not only validate our assumptions and model structure, but also better clarify the role of zebra in sustaining AHSV in South Africa.
