<p>Beyond the benefit of improved knowledge regarding the epidemiology of AHS in zebra in the WCP, our findings provide a basis to review and justify the current regulations from both South African Veterinary Services and international trade stakeholders to prevent introduction of AHSV in the wild and domestic equine populations of the WCP and, should an introduction occur, ensure the disease-free status is regained quickly. In our study, we found that the highest risk of prolonged circulation of AHS in zebra populations is likely to occur if AHSV is introduced in April, when sunset temperatures range from 13°C to 27°C (

In contrast, lowest risk period was between June and September, where introduction events would rarely generate outbreaks lasting for more than a month. These findings consolidate animal movement regulations currently enforced for the AHS controlled area which only allow the import of zebra between June and August. In addition, they further support the recent amendment in the vaccination protocols [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] that strictly restricts the use of vaccination to the period between June and October to avoid AHSV outbreaks due to re-assortment and/or reversions to virulence of live attenuated vaccines [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Both of these measures are likely to mitigate the risk of introducing AHSV in zebra populations and ensure the virus would not remain circulating for extended periods within the controlled area.
