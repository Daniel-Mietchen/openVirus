<p>This work was facilitated by accessing the register of holdings keeping zebra in which the location and the abundance of all zebra subspecies (plains zebra and others) were recorded. In South Africa, it is mandatory to register properties that keep zebra in the AHS controlled area (South African Animal Diseases Act, Act 35 of 1984). As such, we are confident that all populations of zebra currently present in the WCP are included in our study. However, we only have the records of holdings having zebra in 2018 and the total number of animals last counted. We therefore considered that abundance of zebra at the start of our simulation (January 2012) were at similar size as in recorded in the register and that population structure would be similar to [

We acknowledge that this creates some uncertainties regarding the number of zebra populations present as well as their abundance throughout the study period. While we believe that these assumptions make our results more conservative, they also highlight the need to keep regularly updated information on zebra populations. Regularly updated censuses would help to not only verify the veracity of our assumptions but also will allow ongoing validation and justification of the control measures in place for zebra in relation to AHS.
