<p>The WCP is divided into two climatic zones which produced vastly different epidemiology of AHS and risk of AHSV persistence in zebra. In our model, only sunset temperature was assumed modulating the transmission of AHS between zebra and vectors, thereby ignoring the impact of other factors on population dynamics and activity pattern. Particularly, we considered neither the suitability of the environment for breeding (soil type, water and species specific dung which may be important as a breeding substrate), nor the impact of freezing temperatures and daily humidity [

 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. While we believe these may not have significant impact for incursions in climatic zone A, discarding their effects have likely inflated vector winter survival estimates and ability for incursions to spread [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and therefore resulted in overestimating the risk of AHS persistence for incursions in climatic zone B. Indeed, climatic zone B is mostly located in areas of plateau and inland where their arid climate is unsuitable for

 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Despite this, low records of abundance of 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic>, as well as low prevalence level of AHSV in midges and equines, have been reported in Namaqualand [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and in southern Namibia [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], both areas sharing similar climatic characteristics as climatic zone B. While we acknowledge that local irrigation practices may help maintaining suitable microclimate for 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> vectors in arid areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], whether such a low circulation of AHSV is solely due to the few 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> present or together with other competent subspecies remain to be clarified. However, it seems unlikely that these may be sufficient to allow maintaining AHSV in plains zebra.
