<p>When developing our model, several assumptions were made to simplify the epidemiology of AHS in plains zebra and overcome the lack of information and recent data. Firstly, for simplicity, we assumed that all age classes are affected by AHS similarly. By doing so, however, we did not account for the potential role of maternal immunity of foals, previously reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and included in early models of AHS in zebra [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although our results are consistent to field observations [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], the maintained circulation of AHS in KNP is driven by the seasonal dynamics in foal abundance (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0222366.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). As such, not including the lapse of time during which foals are protected from infection could impact the timing of the peaks of AHS incidence. While it is unknown if this would markedly affect the potential for AHS incursions to become endemic in plains zebra, such an impact remains to be verified in the future.
