<p>We further considered that populations of plains zebra were isolated not only from other populations of wild or domestic equids, but also from other non-susceptible hosts such as cattle and small ruminants. We also assumed that 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> would behave similarly across all age- and sex-classes when choosing which host to feed upon. Both of these assumptions may affect the attractiveness and the availability of hosts to vectors. The availability of other host species, and the impact it may have on biting behaviour of vectors, has been shown critical in the spread of midge-borne diseases such as bluetongue and AHS [

 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Particularly, increases in abundance of host with limited susceptibility to AHS would dilute the potential for disease transmission as they represent additional opportunities for 
 <italic>Culocoides</italic> midges to feed. This would depend on the attractiveness of a given host as well as its abundance and availability [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is not yet clear how zebra would attract 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> if presented to multiple host species to feed on. However, given the long infectious period for AHVS in zebra, even a low attractiveness may represent a risk for disease transmission into domestic equid populations in WCP. Although it remains unclear if the presence of multiple host species would affect the potential of plains zebra to maintain AHS in WCP, they may also act as potential sentinels for AHSV circulation in zebra populations. In the context of post-outbreak surveillance, this can represent an alternative to actively sampling zebras which is logistically difficult and is associated with high cost.
