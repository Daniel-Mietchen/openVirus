<p>The results of our analyses on the transmission and circulation of AHS in zebras in South Africa provided an improved understanding of how AHSV spreads in this wildlife population. To do so, we combined and adapted two previously published modelling frameworks to account for the impact of the foaling season of plains zebra on the circulation of AHS between vectors and hosts. Using this model, we clarified conditions in which incursions would persist and become endemic in wild population of equids. Particularly, we showed that populations of plains zebra present in the WCP are not sufficiently large for AHS introduction events to become endemic and that coastal populations need to be &gt;2500 individuals for AHS to persist &gt;2 years, even if zebras are infectious for more than 50 days. Should AHSV be introduced in the coastal population of the WCP, AHS cannot become endemic unless the population involves at least 50,000 individuals. In contrast, inland populations of zebra in the WCP may represent a risk for AHS to persist if populations grow beyond 500 individuals.</p>
