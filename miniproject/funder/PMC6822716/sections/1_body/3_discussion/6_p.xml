<p>In this study, we focused on plains zebra as it is the zebra subspecies with the largest population in both the WCP and South Africa, and in which AHSV is endemic in KNP [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, other subspecies are present in the WCP, notably the Cape Mountain zebra (
 <italic>Equus zebra zebra</italic>) and the Hartmannâ€™s Mountain zebra (
 <italic>Equus zebra hartmannae</italic>). While the latter is present in very low numbers in the WCP (67 individuals in 4 herds), the population of Cape Mountain zebra is now (after many years of conservation efforts) at a similar size as that of plains zebra [
 <xref rid="pone.0222366.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Furthermore, over the 1714 individuals present in the entire WCP (as recorded in the CapeNature database), nearly half of the Cape Mountain zebra population (
 <italic>n</italic> = 842 individuals) is concentrated in a single nature reserve, the Karoo National Park. This conservation land is in the north eastern region of the WCP, approximately 250 
 <italic>km</italic> from the border of the AHS controlled area and in the heart of the climatic zone B. Knowledge on the ecology and the epidemiology of AHS in Cape Mountain zebra is limited, but if they are similar to those in plains zebra, and in the unlikely event that climatic zone B unaccounted climatic characteristics are not detrimental, such a large population would maintain ongoing circulation of AHSV and increase the risk that AHS would be endemic in the WCP. Although our model could be modified to account for their ecology, this would require longitudinal data recording abundance and structure of their populations over long period of time. Until these are available, it will be difficult to evaluate if these zebra subspecies may represent greater risk of AHS persistence than plains zebra in the AHS controlled area of South Africa.
