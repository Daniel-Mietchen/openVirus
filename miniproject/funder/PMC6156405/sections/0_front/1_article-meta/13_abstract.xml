 <p id="Par1">Co-infection with 
  <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) has been reported in humans, but the impact of co-infection on pathogenesis remains unclear. Here, we show that prior exposure to 
  <italic>Plasmodium</italic> suppresses CHIKV-associated pathologies in mice. Mechanistically, 
  <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection induces IFNγ, which reduces viraemia of a subsequent CHIKV infection and suppresses tissue viral load and joint inflammation. Conversely, concomitant infection with both pathogens limits the peak of joint inflammation with no effect on CHIKV viraemia. Reduced peak joint inflammation is regulated by elevated apoptosis of CD4
  <sup>+</sup> T-cells in the lymph nodes and disrupted CXCR3-mediated CD4
  <sup>+</sup> T-cell migration that abolishes their infiltration into the joints. Virus clearance from tissues is delayed in both infection scenarios, and is associated with a disruption of B cell affinity-maturation in the spleen that reduces CHIKV-neutralizing antibody production.
