<p id="Par13">Histopathological assessment was next performed on the joint tissues from CHIKV + PbA (concomitant infection) and Py17x (−4 dpi) + CHIKV infected mice at 6 dpi, when peak joint swelling was suppressed in both models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining of the joint-footpad revealed that both scenarios of co-infection reduced subcutaneous oedema and severe muscle necrosis, and prevented inflammatory cell infiltration into the muscles, synovial membrane and subcutaneous region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h–j</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). This phenomenon was also observed by the drastic reduction (4–5 fold) of CD45 + leukocyte infiltrates in the joints of co-infected mice when quantified by flow cytometry (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>).
