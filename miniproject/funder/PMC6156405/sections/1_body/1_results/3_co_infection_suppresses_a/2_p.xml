<p id="Par14">Joint pathology was then assessed at a late time-point to observe for increased virus persistence in the joint as a result of co-infection. Joints from pre-Py17x (−4 dpi) + CHIKV co-infected mice were harvested for histopathological assessment at 45 dpi, when tissue viral load has been resolved in the co-infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). At 45 dpi, the acute CHIKV-induced joint phenotypes (extensive subcutaneous oedema, cellular infiltration and muscle necrosis) were resolved (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3a</xref>). Both CHIKV-only and pre-Py17x (−4 dpi) + CHIKV mice displayed equivalent levels of muscle fiber regeneration and synovial hyperplasia at the joint and tendon synovial lining suggesting similar states of joint regeneration despite the longer persistence of a higher viral load in the tissues of co-infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>).
