 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and CHIKV co-infection inhibited migration of donor CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells towards the joints of co-infected recipients by ~6-fold (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref>). Furthermore, the increase of joint swelling induced by donor’s CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in single CHIKV-infected recipients were absence in co-infected recipients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>). Immune mediators quantified from joint-footpad lysates at 6 dpi demonstrated a reduction of CCR5 ligands (MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES) and CXCR3 ligand (CXCL10) in the joints (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>).
