<p id="Par27">To assess whether reduced CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers in the joints of co-infected mice could also be mediated by altered migration kinetics from the pLN in addition to increased levels of apoptosis, an in vivo migration assay was performed (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>). This assay allows for the detection of any differences in cellular migration independent of the effects of increased
