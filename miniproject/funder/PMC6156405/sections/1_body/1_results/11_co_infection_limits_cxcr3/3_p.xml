 <sup>-/-</sup> mice and in WT mice with CXCR3 blockade was then performed to define the role of these two T-cell chemokine receptors. Joint swelling was suppressed at 2 dpi in CHIKV-infected CCR5
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, but no effect was observed during peak swelling (mediated by CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells) from 5–8 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10a</xref>). No effect on viraemia was observed in CHIKV-infected CCR5
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10b</xref>). Conversely, CXCR3 blockade suppressed CHIKV-induced peak joint swelling from 5 to 7 dpi and reduced joint vascular leakage at 6 dpi with no effect on viraemia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10c, d</xref>). Importantly, CXCR3 blockade was associated with the inhibition of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration into the joints (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">10e</xref>). However, CXCR3 blockade in concurrent 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and CHIKV co-infected mice did not significantly reduce joint swelling or vascular leakage at 6 dpi as compared to co-infected mice with no blockade (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e, g</xref>). CXCR3 blockade has minimal effect on viraemia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>). Together, these results show that CXCR3 and not CCR5, is functionally important for CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell migration during CHIKV infection, and co-infection sufficiently abrogates CXCR3-mediated joint swelling.
