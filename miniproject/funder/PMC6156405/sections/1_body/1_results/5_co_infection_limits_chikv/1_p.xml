 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> co-infections aggravate tissue viral load only in the later stages of CHIKV infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), IgM and IgG antibody titers were quantified. At 6 dpi of concurrent PbA + CHIKV co-infection, higher CHIKV-specific IgM titers were observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), while IgG titers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) and neutralizing capacities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>) were similar to mice infected with CHIKV alone. However, lower CHIKV-specific total IgG titers was detected coupled with a reduction in CHIKV neutralization in co-infected mice at 15 dpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b, c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6a</xref>). In the pre-Py17x (−4 dpi) + CHIKV co-infection scenario, mice showed lower levels of CHIKV-specific IgM and IgG and reduced CHIKV neutralization compared to mice infected with CHIKV alone at both 6 and 15 dpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d–f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6b</xref>).
