<p id="Par24">The popliteal lymph node (pLN) is the nearest lymph node to the site of CHIKV infection in the footpad. As immune regulation leading to suppressed joint swelling is dependent on the lymph node (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>), expansion kinetics of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the pLN during concurrent co-infection was profiled. At 4 dpi, when pathogenic CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell expansion is observed, CHIKV-specific CD4 + T cells numbers were similar between the pLN of CHIKV-infected and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> + CHIKV co-infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>). These data imply similar levels of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell expansion in the early stages of infection (4 dpi).
