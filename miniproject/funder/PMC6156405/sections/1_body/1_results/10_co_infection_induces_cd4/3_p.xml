<p id="Par26">The reduction of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from 5 dpi in the pLN on joint inflammation would depend on the timing of migration of pathogenic CD4 + T cells to the infected tissue. Therefore, CHIKV-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell migration kinetics was assessed in the joints by flow cytometry and IFNγ ELISPOT assay. The majority of CHIKV specific CD4 + T cells infiltrated the joint between 5 and 6 dpi (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>), thus occurring after 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-induced CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell apoptosis. Together, the reduction of peak joint swelling in co-infected mice is associated with the elevation apoptotic of pathogenic CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lymph nodes prior to their migration into the joints.
