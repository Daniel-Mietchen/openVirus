 </sup> were assessed. Within the context of concurrent co-infection, the spleen was not of primary focus as co-infection in splenectomised mice still reduced peak joint swelling when compared to CHIKV infected splenectomised mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). First, absence of lymph nodes delayed CHIKV-induced peak joint swelling from 6 dpi to 7–8 dpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). LTα
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice with concurrent CHIKV + PbA co-infection showed equivalent joint swelling as CHIKV-infected only LTα
 <sup>-/-</sup>animals with no effect on viraemia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>). Lack of lymph nodes also increased tissue viral load and caused extensive CHIKV dissemination from 6 dpi onwards in CHIKV-infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c, d</xref> and Supplementary Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Concurrent co-infected LTα
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice still displayed an increased viral load and viral dissemination in the tissues from 10–18 dpi as compared to CHIKV-infected only LTα
 <sup>-/-</sup>animals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c, d</xref> and Supplementary Movie
