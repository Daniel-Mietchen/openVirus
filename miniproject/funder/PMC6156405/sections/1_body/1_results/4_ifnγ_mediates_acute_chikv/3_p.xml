<p id="Par17">To verify these effects observed in pre-Py17x co-infected IFNγ
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, we performed pre-Py17x co-infection of WT mice with IFNγ neutralization during the early acute phase (−4 dpi to 4 dpi) of the disease. Similarly, IFNγ neutralization restored early acute (1–4 dpi) CHIKV phenotypes (i.e joint swelling, viraemia, whole body and joint viral load) in the pre-Py17x co-infected mice (Supplementary Fig.
