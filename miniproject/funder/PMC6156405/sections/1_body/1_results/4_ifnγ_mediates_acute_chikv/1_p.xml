<p id="Par15">We next focused on identifying the mechanisms induced by 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> that modulate CHIKV disease during 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> co-infection. IFNγ is a dominant cytokine typically induced during acute 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection

 </sup>, and previous studies have shown that absence of IFNγ aggravates CHIKV viraemia in mice, suggesting a possible anti-viral role

 </sup>. Therefore, the effects of concurrent CHIKV + PbA co-infection and pre-Py17x (−4 dpi) + CHIKV infection were investigated in IFNγ
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice. In both WT and IFNγ
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice, concurrent co-infection presented similar pathologies with reduced joint swelling (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>), suggesting that IFNγ is not a mediator of pathological changes to CHIKV disease during concurrent PbA and CHIKV co-infection.
