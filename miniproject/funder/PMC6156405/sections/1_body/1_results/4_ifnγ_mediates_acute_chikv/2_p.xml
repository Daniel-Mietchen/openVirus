<p id="Par16">In contrast, pre-Py17x (−4 dpi) + CHIKV co-infection in IFNγ
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice induced joint swelling similar to WT CHIKV-infected mice at early acute infection of 1–4 dpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Prolonged viraemia was also observed during the entire disease of 1–12 dpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Co-infection did not alter parasitaemia when compared to single Py17x-infected mice in WT or IFNγ
 <sup>-/-</sup> background (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). However, IFNγ-deficiency elevated parasitaemia on 3–6 and 16–23 days post Py17x infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Although tissue viral load of pre-Py17x co-infected mice was similar to that in CHIKV-infected IFNγ
 <sup>-/-</sup> mice on 1–4 dpi, levels were higher at the later phase (6–20 dpi) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d–f</xref>). The absence of IFNγ only partially increased joint swelling in pre-Py17x co-infected mice at later stages of disease (5–10 dpi) to a similar degree as concurrently co-infected WT mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).
