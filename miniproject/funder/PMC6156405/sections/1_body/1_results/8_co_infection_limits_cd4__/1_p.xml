<p id="Par22">To understand how co-infection alters the joint infiltrating immune subsets, immune cells were profiled by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and flow cytometry at 6 dpi during the peak of joint swelling. Both concurrent CHIKV + PbA and pre-Py17x (−4 dpi) + CHIKV co-infections reduced CD3
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell infiltration into the subcutaneous region of the inflamed joints compared to CHIKV-infection alone (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>). Flow cytometric profiling and ELISPOT assays of isolated CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells also showed that 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> co-infection abrogates infiltration of activated (LFA-1
 <sup>+</sup>) and IFNγ-secreting CHIKV-specific CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells into the joints (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c–e</xref>). Finally, co-infection also suppressed infiltration of other immune subsets, including neutrophils, NK cells and CD11b
 <sup>+</sup>Ly6C
 <sup>+</sup> monocytes/macrophages into the joints (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f–h</xref>).
