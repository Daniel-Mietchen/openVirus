 </sup>. To determine if disruption in the spleen is the primary reason for the suppression of CHIKV-specific antibodies in 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and CHIKV co-infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–f</xref>), concurrent PbA + CHIKV co-infection was performed in splenectomised mice. Pre-Py17x co-infection was excluded due to the impact of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> induced IFNγ at the point of CHIKV infection that suppressed early acute CHIKV viral load (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
