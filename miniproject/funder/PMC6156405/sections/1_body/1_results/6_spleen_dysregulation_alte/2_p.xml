<p id="Par20">Interestingly, peak joint swelling at 6–7 dpi was increased by splenectomy in CHIKV-infected mice with no effect on viraemia and tissue viral load (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g–j</xref>). Concurrent co-infection reduced peak joint swelling in splenectomised mice as in non-splenectomised controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>; right panel), with no effect on viraemia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>). However, splenectomy restored the ability of co-infected mice to resolve tissue viral load in 8–18 dpi to comparable levels as non-splenectomised CHIKV-infected mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i, j</xref>). CHIKV-specific IgM, total IgG titers and CHIKV neutralizing antibodies were also similar in both splenectomised CHIKV-infected and co-infected mice (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7a-c</xref>). Nonetheles, splenectomy also reduced parasitaemia in co-infected mice during the later phase (10–18 dpi) of the disease (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7d</xref>). The possible indirect impact of reduced parasitaemia on the tissue viral load in the co-infected splenectomised mice remains to be determined.
