 </sup>, 80% of the co-infected PbA (−4 dpi) + CHIKV mice succumbed to ECM 6–8 days after parasite infection. As such, data from the PbA (−4 dpi) + CHIKV co-infection scenario were not statistically significant from 4 dpi onwards (i.e. 8 days after parasite infection) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Concurrent CHIKV with PbA or Py17x co-infection suppressed peak joint swelling (~ 50%) with no effect observed for joint swelling or viraemia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). No effects on joint swelling or viraemia were observed in mice infected with PbA or Py17x 4 days after CHIKV infection (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a, b</xref>) or when mice were infected with CHIKV after recovery from prior Py17x infection (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>).
