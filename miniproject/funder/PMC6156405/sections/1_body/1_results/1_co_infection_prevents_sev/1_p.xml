<p id="Par7">In this study, we used the well-defined CHIKV joint-footpad mouse model where CHIKV infection alone induces measurable joint swelling that peaks at ~6 days post infection (dpi) and lasts ~ 14 dpi, with a viraemic profile of 10–12 dpi

 </sup>. We also used two different species of rodent 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, PbA which causes fatal ECM, and Py17x which induces uncomplicated, non-lethal malaria. To understand the impact of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection on CHIKV-induced pathology, four different CHIKV co-infection scenarios were designed to reflect situations where co-infection of CHIKV and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> occur concurrently or sequentially

 </sup>. In the first scenario, mice were pre-infected with PbA or Py17x, 4 days before CHIKV infection when mice mount acute 
 <italic>Plasmodium-</italic>induced responses at the time of co-infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). In the second scenario, mice were concurrently co-infected with PbA or Py17x and CHIKV (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). In the third scenario, animals were infected with PbA or Py17x 4 days after CHIKV infection when mice mount acute CHIKV-induced responses at the time of co-infection (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a, b</xref>). Lastly, in the fourth scenario, animals were infected with CHIKV 26 days after Py17x infection, when mice had recovered from Py17x-induced malaria (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1c</xref>).
