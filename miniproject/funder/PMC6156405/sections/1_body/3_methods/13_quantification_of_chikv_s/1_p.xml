<p id="Par53">IFNγ ELISPOT assays (MABTECH; Cat no. 3321-2 A) were conducted using isolated CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from 100,000 pLN or footpad cells were stimulated with 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> virions and 200,000 naïve splenocytes following manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were stimulated with the virus in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 30 U/mL IL2 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 18 h. The number of spots was quantified using an ImmunoSpot 5.0 Analyzer Professional DC (Cellular Technology Ltd), and the data were back calculated as the number of virus-specific CD4 + T cells per organ.
