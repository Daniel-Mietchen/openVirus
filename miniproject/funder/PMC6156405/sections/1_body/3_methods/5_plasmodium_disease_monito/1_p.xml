 </sup>. Briefly, 1 μl of blood was collected in 100 μl of PBS and stained in 1 μL of Hoechst (800 µM; Sigma), 0.5 μl of dihydroethidium (1 μg/ml; Sigma), 0.5 μl of PBS and 2 μl of monoclonal antibody CD45 coupled to Allophycocyanine (Miltenyi Biotech; Cat no. 130-102-544). The blood preparation was incubated for 20 min before addition of 400 μl PBS. Stained samples were acquired on a LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using BD FACSDiva software and analyzed using Flowjo software.
