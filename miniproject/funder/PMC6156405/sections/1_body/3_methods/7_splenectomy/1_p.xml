<p id="Par46">Mice aged 4-weeks old were anesthetised with 80 μl ketamine:xylaxine (150 mg/kg:10 mg/kg). Incisions were made on the left flank, and the primary artery connecting the spleen to the other organs located within the fat was sealed. Post-surgery, enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg) and PBS (1 ml) was given and mice were monitored for recovery. A control, sham operation included similar incisions to the skin, without spleen removal and similar antibiotic treatment post-surgery. ~ 5 weeks were given for mice to completely recover from surgery prior to further experiments, hence infection in these mice were delayed to 9 weeks old.</p>
