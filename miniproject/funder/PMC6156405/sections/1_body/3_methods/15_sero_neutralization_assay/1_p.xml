 </sup>. Briefly, Zs-Green tagged CHIKV was incubated with various dilutions of heat-inactivated mouse sera at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 8 for 2 h at 37 °C with gentle agitation. Virus–antibody (Ab) mixtures were then added to HEK293T cells and incubated for a further 1.5 h at 37 °C. Virus–Ab overlays were subsequently removed and the cells were re-incubated in fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 15 h at 37 °C before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, DAPI (0.5 μg/mL) staining and quantification using the Cellomics ArrayScan V (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) or MACSQuant analyser 10 (Miltenyi Biotec). The percentage of infectivity was calculated as follows: % Infectivity = 100 × (%responder from sero-neutralization group/% responder from virus infection group).
