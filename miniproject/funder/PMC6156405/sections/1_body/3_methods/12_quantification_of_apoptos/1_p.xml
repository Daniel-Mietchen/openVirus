<p id="Par52">Apoptosis of isolated pLN cells was determined by Annexin V assay (eBioscience; Cat no. 88-8005-72) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 10
 <sup>6</sup> pLN cells underwent surface staining of for 20 min followed by staining with fixable viability dye (1:500 dilution; FVD; eBioscience; Cat no. 65-0866-14) for 30 min on ice. Cells were then stained with FITC-conjugated Annexin V for 15 min followed by acquisition using a LSR II flow cytometer. Late apoptotic cells were defined by FVD + /Annexin V + staining. Representative gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig.
