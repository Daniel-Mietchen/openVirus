 </sup>. CHIKV-coated (10
 <sup>6</sup> virions/ well in 50 mL PBS) polystyrene 96-well MaxiSorp plates (Nunc) were blocked with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% w/v nonfat milk for 1.5 h at 37 °C. Sera from test groups were heat-inactivated and diluted in antibody diluent (0.05% PBST + 2.5% w/v nonfat milk) at 1:200 and 1:2000 for IgM and total IgG quantification respectively. 100 μl of diluted sera per well was added and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, test sera were washed off and 100 μl of secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:20,000 dilution; Santa Cruz; Cat no. SC-2031) or IgM (1:10,000 dilution; Santa Cruz; Cat no. SC-2064) were added and allowed to incubate for 30 min. ELISA assays were developed using Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate and terminated with Stop reagent (Sigma-Aldrich). Absorbance was measured at 450 nm. IgM and Total IgG were quantified at 1:200 and 1:2000 dilutions, respectively.
