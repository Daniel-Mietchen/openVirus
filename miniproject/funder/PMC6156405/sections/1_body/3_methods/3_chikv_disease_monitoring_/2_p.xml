 </sup>. Measurements were done for both height (thickness) and breadth of the foot and were quantified as [height x breadth]. Degree of inflammation was expressed as relative increase in footpad size as compared to pre-infection (day 0) with the following formula: [(xâˆ’day 0)/day 0], where x is the quantified footpad measurement for each respective day.
