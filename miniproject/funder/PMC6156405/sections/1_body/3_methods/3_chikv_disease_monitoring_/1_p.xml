<p id="Par40">Viraemia was monitored daily from 1 day post-infection (dpi) until 8 dpi, and subsequently on every alternate day until 14 dpi. Briefly, 10 μL of blood collected from the tail vein was diluted in 120 μL PBS and 10 μL citrate-phosphate-dextrose solution (Sigma-Aldrich). Viral RNA was extracted with QIAmp Viral RNA kit (Qiagen) in accordance to manufacturer’s protocol. To measure the levels of replicating virus the extracted samples, RNA copies of negative sense

 <italic>nsP1</italic> of the strain of CHIKV used in this study. The sequences of 
 <italic>nsP1</italic> forward and reverse primers are 5′GGCAGTATCGTGAATTCGATGCGACACGGAGACGCCAACATT3′ and 5′AATAAATCATAAGTCTGCTCTCTGTCTACATGA3′. The sequence of probe used is 5′TGCTTACACACAGACGT3′. Both primers and probe targeting this region of the negative sense

 </sup>. To note, both free viruses and viruses present inside peripheral leukocytes were determined. Comparison of viral load using paired whole blood and serum samples shows that a significant portion of viral RNA would have been missed if measurement was only done using plasma or serum (Supplementary Fig.
