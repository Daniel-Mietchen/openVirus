 </sup>. Luciferase substrate, D-luciferin potassium salt (Caliper Life sciences), was dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Mice were shaved and anesthetized in an oxygen-rich induction chamber with 2% isoflurane. Measurements were performed 2 min after subcutaneous injection of 100 μl of luciferin solution. Whole body imaging was performed with the animal in a ventral position. Foot imaging was performed with the animal in a dorsal position. Bioluminescence imaging was acquired with a field of view (FOV) of 21.7 cm and 13.1 cm for whole body (FOV-D) and foot (FOV-C) respectively. Exposure condition was an initial 60 s, followed by a 4 min delay before another exposure at 60 s. In the event that luminescence readings were above the detection limit of machine, the exposure time was reduced and kept consistent across groups. Bioluminescence signals taken pre-infection (0 dpi) were used for background subtraction. For bioluminescence quantifications, regions of interest were drawn using the software Living Image 3.0, and average radiance (p/s/cm
 <sup>2</sup>/sr) was determined.
