 </sup>. Stained sections were scanned using a Leica SCN400 slide scanner (Leica Microsystem GmbH, Germany) at a 20x magnification and exported to the SlidePath Digital Image system (Leica microsystem GmbH, Germany). CD3 expression was analyzed using cytoplasmic/membranous algorithms within the Leica SlidePath Tissue Image Analysis (tissue IA) software. The results among the different groups were computed and analyzed for statistical significance.
