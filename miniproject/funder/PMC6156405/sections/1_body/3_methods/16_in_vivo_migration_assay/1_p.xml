<p id="Par56">At 6 dpi, pLN from singly CHIKV-infected donors were harvested. Total CD4 + T cells were isolated from these donors through negative selection using a CD4 + T-cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells were subsequently labeled with 5 μM CFSE solution (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min, washed with PBS. A solution of 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells in 200 μl PBS was injected (i.v.) into a CHIKV only or co-infected recipient at 5 dpi. A portion of these donor cells were stained with α-CD45, α-CD3, α-CD4, α-CD8, and α-LFA-1 antibodies according to dilutions specified above and analyzed by flow cytometry to profile the numbers of total and LFA-1 + CD4 + T cells in 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> donor cells. The footpads were extracted from recipient mice 22 h after transfer, and processed to obtain a homogenous cell suspension. Extracted cells were stained with Live/Dead determination dye (Invitrogen) for 20 min, followed by α-CD45, α-CD3, α-CD4, α-CD8, and α-LFA-1 antibodies. The donor cells were identified by FITC expression using flow cytometry. The migratory capacity of the donor cells towards the joint-footpad was determined by the ratio of donor cells obtained from the recipient footpad divided by initial number of donor cells transferred.
