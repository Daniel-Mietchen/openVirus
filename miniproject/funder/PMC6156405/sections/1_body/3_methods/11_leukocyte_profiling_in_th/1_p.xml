<p id="Par50">Joints, pLN and spleen were surgically extracted and processed to obtain a homogenous cell suspension. For spleens, tissue was dissociated in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS (complete RPMI) and passed through a 40 μm cell strainer (Fisherbrand), followed by RBC lysis with RBC lysis buffer (R&amp;D system). For pLN, extracted tissue was incubated in 1 mL of digestion medium [dispase (2 U/mL; Invitrogen), collagenase IV (20 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), and DNase I mix (50 mg/mL; Roche Applied Science) in complete RPMI medium] for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were passed through 70 μm nylon mesh cloth (Sefar) followed by RBC lysis with RBC lysis buffer. For footpad, tissue were removed,de-skinned in 4 ml of digestion medium and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Digested tissues were passed through a 40 μm cell strainer, followed by RBC lysis. Cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of complete RPMI and overlay on 35% v/v Percoll (Sigma-Aldrich)/RPMI medium, centrifuged at 1024 g for 20 min.</p>
