<p id="Par51">Isolated cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Aqua (Life Technologies), then blocked in 100 µl blocking buffer consisting of a mix of 1% rat and mouse serum (Sigma-Aldrich) in FACS buffer [1% BSA, 2 μm EDTA in PBS]. Next, cells were stained with conjugated antibodies for 20 min and fixed in IC fixation buffer (ebioscience) for 5 min before acquisition using a LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Conjugated antibodies used were: α-CD45 (1:400 dilution; clone 30-F11, BD Biosciences; Cat no. 557659), α-CD3 (1:200 dilution; clone 17A2, BD Biosciences; Cat no. 560591), α-CD4 (1:400 dilution clone GK1.5, Biolegend; Cat no. 12-0041-83), α-CD8 (1:400 dilution; clone 53–6.7, BD Biosciences; Cat no. 100743), α-LFA-1 (1: 200 dilution; clone H155-78; Biolegend; Cat no. 141008), α-NK1.1 (1:400 dilution; clone PK136, ebioscience; Cat no. 17-5941-82), α-CD11b (1:400 dilution clone M1/70, Biolegend; Cat no. 101239), α-CD11c (1:400 dilution; clone N418, Biolegend; Cat no. 117333), α-Ly6C (1:400 dilution; clone AL-21, BD Biosciences; Cat no. 560596), α-Ly6G (1:400 dilution; clone 1A8, Biolegend; Cat no. 127612), α-B220 (1:400 dilution; clone RA3-6B2; Biolegend; Cat no. 103230), α-GL7 (1:400 dilution; clone GL7; Biolegend; Cat no. 144607), α-CD95 (1:200 dilution; clone 3F1; BD Biosciences; Cat no. 743255), α-CD38 (1:200 dilution; clone 90; Biolegend; Cat no. 102717), α-CD73 (1:200 dilution; clone TY/11.8; Thermofisher Scientific; Cat no. 46-0731-82), α-CD138 (1:200 dilution; clone 281-2; BD Biosciences; Cat no. 563147), α-IgD (1:200 dilution; clone 11–26 c.2a; BD Biosciences; Cat no. 565348) and α-CD80 (1:400 dilution; clone 16-10A1, Biolegend; Cat no. 104703). Representative gating strategy is shown in Supplementary Fig.
