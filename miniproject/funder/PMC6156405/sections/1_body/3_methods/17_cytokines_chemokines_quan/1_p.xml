<p id="Par57">Footpads were extracted and homogenized in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4; 1% NP-40; 0.25% Sodium deoxycholate; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA) with 1x protease inhibitors (Roche) in a gentleMACS M tube using a gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi). Cell lysates were then sonicated at 70% intensity for 15 s (Branson Ultrasonics Sonifier
 <sup>TM</sup> S-450), and the supernatants were collected for cytokine/chemokine quantification using a 36 plex mouse ProcartaPlex
 <sup>TM</sup> luminex assay (Cat no. EPX360-26092-901), according to manufacturer’s protocol. Data are expressed as pg/mL in the footpad lysate.
