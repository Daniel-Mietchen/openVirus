<p id="Par43">Mice were anesthetised with ketamine-xylazine (150 mg/kg of ketamine; 10 mg/kg of xylazine), perfused intracardially with PBS and organs were harvested and preserved in 1 mL TRIZOL (Invitrogen) at –80 °C. Tissue samples were transferred to gentleMACS M Tubes (Miltenyi Biotec) and homogenized using a rotor-stator homogenizer (Xiril Dispomix)

 </sup>. Homogenized tissues were transferred to clean Eppendorf tubes and mixed thoroughly with 230 μL of chloroform, and allowed to stand for 2 min in room temperature. Tissue mixtures were centrifuged at 12 000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The aqueous phase was collected into a clean Eppendorf tube, and an equal volume of 70% ethanol was added in and mixed. Total RNA was subsequently extracted with RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s protocol. RNA copies of negative sense
