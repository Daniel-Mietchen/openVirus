 </sup> that could “prime” cells to suppress initial viral replication in CHIKV-target cells such as fibroblasts. This effect would lead to the observed early reduction in viral load locally in the joints. Conversely, viral suppression in the monocytes/macrophages could also limit early viral dissemination to other tissues.
