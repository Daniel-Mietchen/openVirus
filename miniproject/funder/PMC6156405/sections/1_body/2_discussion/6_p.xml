<p id="Par35">These findings of chikungunya protection during co-infection with 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> have important implications when considering malaria intervention programmes. Effective malaria control programmes have declined the global incidence of malaria over the past decade

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup> and this is associated with the increasing trend of chikungunya incidence over a similar period of time

 </sup>. Interestingly, abrogation of systemic viral load during co-infection would lower vector competence, as lower blood viral titres would reduce the proportion of vectors being successfully infected

 </sup>. On the other hand, in the context of uncontrolled 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection, the reduction of severe joint pathology by malaria co-infection would likely lower or mask CHIKV-related healthcare burden and prevalence. As the World Health Organisation scales up malaria intervention programmes to aggressively decline the incidence of malaria
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>, the severity and numbers of CHIKV clinical cases, and vector competence, could indirectly increase. Therefore, alphavirus management should be integrated as part of the ongoing malaria intervention programme.
