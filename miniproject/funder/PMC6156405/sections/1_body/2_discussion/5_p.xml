<p id="Par34">Prior to this study, the chemokines that regulate CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell migration during CHIKV infection were unknown. We show here that CXCR3, but not CCR5, is a critical mediator of CD4 + T-cell migration into infected joints. CXCR3 blockade in co-infected mice did not reduce joint swelling further, suggesting that the CXCR3-mediated pathway is already suppressed in co-infected mice. Suppresion of joint swelling was more pronounced in co-infected mice with or without CXCR3 blockade as compared to CHIKV-infected mice with CXCR3 blockade. This finding suggests that suppression of CHIKV-induced joint swelling in co-infected mice is only partially dependent on CXCR3.
