 </sup>. In fact, co-infection suppresses peak joint pathology of CHIKV infection by limiting the infiltration of pathogenic virus-specific IFNγ (Th1)-producing CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the joints. Here, suppression is mediated in two stages. 
 <italic>Plasmodium-</italic> infection induces apoptosis of a fraction of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the lymph node early after priming, and abrogates migration of the remaining live CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells by suppressing chemotactic factors in the joints.
