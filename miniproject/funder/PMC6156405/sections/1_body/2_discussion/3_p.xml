 </sup>. Here, we found that changes to the splenic B-cell phenotype is associated with inefficient CHIKV-neutralizing antibody generation, delayed virus resolution in the joints and elevated virus dissemination during chronic stages of CHIKV infection. These changes in viral load in the joints of co-infected mice did not aggravate joint pathology at the earliest time-point of viral resolution in co-infected mice (45 dpi). Nonetheless, such disruption to the B-cell humoral response during co-infection may negatively impact the recall response against secondary CHIKV infection.
