<p id="Par6">In this present study, we explored the effects of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> co-infection on the severity of CHIKV infection and virus-induced arthralgia. We found that co-infection suppresses CD4 + T-cell responses to protect against severe CHIKV-induced joint pathology, while disrupted B-cell affinity maturation in the spleen delays viral resolution in the joints. This is the first study to describe 
 <italic>Plasmodium-</italic>induced host immune regulation that directly alters virus clearance and CHIKV-induced joint pathology during co-infection. These findings could be applied to improve management of chikungunya disease in regions with 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> co-endemicity.
