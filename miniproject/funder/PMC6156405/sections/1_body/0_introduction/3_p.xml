<p id="Par5">The impact of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and arbovirus co-infection on host susceptibility and pathological severity is largely unknown. Our previous work reported the impact of CHIKV co-infection on malaria pathogenesis in-vivo using a mouse model infected with 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic>-ANKA (PbA)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. We found that concurrent co-infection with CHIKV led to protection against parasite-induced neuropathology, specifically preventing experimental cerebral malaria (ECM)-induced mortality by disrupting the CXCR3 chemokineâ€“chemokine receptor network
