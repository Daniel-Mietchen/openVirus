<p id="Par4">The expansion of CHIKV into areas with endemic malarial 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites in circulation increases the likelihood of co-infection between CHIKV and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. High-risk areas of co-infection include Africa, India, Southeast Asia and Latin America

 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> in affected patients from seroprevalence studies

 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>, the global frequency of CHIKV and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> co-infection is likely under-estimated as arbovirus screening is not systematic but performed only when patients are negative for malaria infection
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, while 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitos are the principal vector for CHIKV, typical malaria vectors such as 
 <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> and 
 <italic>A. coustani</italic>, collected in the field were recently shown to be infected with CHIKV
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. This increases the likelihood of concurrent co-infection of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and CHIKV via competent vectors infected with both pathogens.
