  <title>Daily serum virus titers in log
   <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL were plotted over 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) for WNV/SLEV naïve and WNV/SLEV immune house sparrows (HOSP).
  </title>
  <p>Figures A-E depict HOSPs that were initially inoculated (scatter plots) with SLEV/IMP 115 (A), SLEV.IC (B), SLEV-prME/WNV.IC (C), WNV-prME/SLEV.IC (D) or WNV.IC (E) and then challenged with antigenically heterologous viruses, WNV.IC (A), WNV-prME/SLEV.IC (B, C) or SLEV-prME/WNV.IC (E, F) at 21 dpi. The data points on the scatter plots were off-set by a value of 0.01 for graphing purposes. For comparison purposes, line graphs representing daily mean virus titers (± 95% confidence intervals) of WNV.IC, WNV-prME/SLEV.IC or SLEV-prME/WNV.IC in naïve HOSPs were included. Titers from challenged HOSPs that fell outside of the 95% confidence limits of naïve HOSP titers were considered significantly different (p&lt;0.05). (F) Peak mean virus titers for both naïve and previously inoculated HOSPs from Fig 4A–4E. The blue bars represent peak mean titers in naïve HOSPs inoculated with WNV.IC, WNV-prME/SLEV.IC or SLEV-prME/WNV.IC viruses. The red bars represent peak mean titers in immunized HOSPS challenged with WNV.IC, WNV-prME/SLEV.IC or SLEV-prME/WNV.IC viruses. The detection limit (LOD) for serum virus titers was 1.7 log
   <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL.
