<p>Similar to previous studies in HOFIs [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], prior immunity to SLEV did not preclude viremia generation following WNV infection in HOSPs. These observations coupled with the additional findings that WNV mediated elevated avian viremias due to NS genetic elements provided an elemental foundation to explain the capacity of WNV to emerge in North America in geographic regions where avian SLEV immunity pre-existed. The experimental model demonstrated here in which a virus has been artificially generated with the antigenic properties of SLEV and the avian viremia potential of WNV (SLEV-prME/WNV) demonstrated that unlike previous experiments in which HOFIs with pre-existing immunity to WNV failed to develop viremias following subsequent SLEV inoculation, an SLEV antigenic virus capable of replicating to higher titers in birds overcame cross neutralization and produced titers potentially infectious to mosquitoes. The 2015 SLEV outbreak in Arizona could have resulted from the emergence of a novel SLEV genotype with increased avian viremia potential or a variant that could have utilized cross-reactive WNV immunoglobulin to enhance infectivity of PBMCs or from an SLEV strain that had incorporated genetic changes reducing cross-neutralizing determinants. Unlike the lineage V SLEV strain utilized in these studies, the Arizona SLEV outbreak resulted from the introduction of a novel genotype III SLEV strain [

This recent evidence of WNV and SLEV co-circulation in Arizona and California indicate that the competitive exclusion of SLEV by WNV is not complete and will require a re-evaluation with additional strains of both viruses and their subsequent cross neutralization potential within avian hosts.
