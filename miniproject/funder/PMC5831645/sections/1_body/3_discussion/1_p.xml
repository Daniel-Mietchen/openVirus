<p>Virulence differences between WNV and SLEV in avian hosts have been well documented [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Compared to SLEV, WNV elicits significantly higher viremias in a wide range of avian hosts [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Data from the present study further support these avian host competence associations, where WNV elicited significantly higher viremias than SLEV in HOSPs, HOFIs and AMCRs. Inoculations of AMCRs further demonstrated that certain avian hosts are extremely competent for WNV replication, but fail to generate a detectable SLEV viremia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although corvids likely amplify WNV to levels leading to outbreaks of human disease [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], they conversely may suppress SLEV activity by serving as dead end hosts for this virus.
