<p>Host competence incorporates a combination of three factors: susceptibility to infection, mean daily infectiousness (estimated number of vectors that could become infected per day) and duration of viremia [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Based on the host competence index calculation, for which a uniform vector competence phenotype for both viruses would be modeled, WNV was predicted to have increased infectiousness for mosquitoes compared to SLEV. However, SLEV has been shown to exhibit a significantly lower mosquito oral infection threshold compared to WNV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. This suggests that SLEV could compensate for relatively low host competence in birds with high oral infectivity for 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquito vectors. Under this scenario, SLEV would have adapted to specific North American mosquito vectors such that transmission could occur in the absence of elevated avian viremias that lead to high host mortality. This assertion is supported by SLEV having experienced a considerably longer period of adaptation to New World vectors than WNV, with adaptive radiation of SLEV predicted from phylogenetic reconstructions to have occurred &gt;300 years ago [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The potential for WNV to undergo similar adaptation to North American vectors could be limited by fitness trade-offs in avian hosts that could be exacerbated by the fact that both vector and host competency for WNV and SLEV are mediated by NS genetic elements [
