<p>With the Colorado HOSP challenge study, a similar trend was observed with WNV-immune HOSPs that were challenged with SLEV-prME/WNV.IC. In this group, only one HOSP developed a viremia with SLEV-prME/WNV.IC that was similar to that observed in naive HOSPs. No viremia was detected in any other HOSP. Higher SLEV-prME/WNV.IC titers were observed at 25–26 dpi in the WNV-immune HOSP in comparison with naïve HOSPs; however, statistical significance was not achieved due to the variable SLEV-prME/WNV.IC viremia levels in these wild-caught naïve HOSPs. With WNV-prME/SLEV.IC-immune HOSPs challenged with antigenically heterologous SLEV-prME/WNV.IC, one WNV-prME/SLEV.IC-immune HOSP consistently produced significantly higher SLEV-prME/WNV.IC titers than daily mean SLEV-prME/WNV.IC titers in naïve HOSPs from 23–26 dpi. A second WNV-prME/SLEV.IC-immune HOSP also generated higher SLEV-prME/WNV.IC titers than naïve HOSPs on 26 dpi. Several SLEV-immune HOSPs produced significantly higher WNV titers than titers observed in naïve HOSPs but this was only observed at 23 dpi. These data demonstrated the potential generation of SLEV and WNV viremias in the presence of heterologous immunity and statistically higher titers in some previously infected birds than in naïve birds. Taken together this suggests that pre-existing WNV/SLEV immunity in passerines does not preclude replication of antigenically heterologous viruses. It also suggests that WNV/SLEV could replicate to titers high enough in previously infected passerines to meet the oral infection thresholds of
