<p>In this study, a WNV field-immune CA HOFI was inadvertently inoculated with SLEV-prME/WNV.IC. The SLEV-prME/WNV.IC titers in the WNV-immunized HOFI were significantly lower than titers in naïve HOFIs at 2–3 dpi and reached a peak titer at 4dpi. In contrast peak SLEV-prME/WNV.IC titer in naïve HOFIs was reached by 2 dpi. The delay in reaching a peak titer and the lower titers at the earlier timepoints for the WNV-immunized HOFI suggests that WNV cross-neutralizing antibodies that form after two weeks of infection were not able to completely ablate subsequent infection by an immunologically heterologous chimeric flavivirus such SLEV-prME/WNV.IC. In contrast, Fang et al. demonstrated that when WNV-immune HOFIs were challenged with SLEV at 6 weeks post initial infection, the WNV-immunized HOFIs were completely protected from SLEV infection [
