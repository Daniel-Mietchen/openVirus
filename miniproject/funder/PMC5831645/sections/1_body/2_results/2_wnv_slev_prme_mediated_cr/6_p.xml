<p>Only one WNV.IC-immune HOSP developed a detectable viremia after challenge with SLEV-prME/WNV.IC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006302.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) with peak titer of 6.8 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL by 25 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006302.g004">Fig 4F</xref>); these titers were not statistically significant different from daily mean SLEV-prME/WNV.IC titers in naïve HOSPs. Viremia was undetectable in all other HOSPs. In comparison, primary infection with SLEV-prME/WNV.IC in naïve HOSPs elicited a mean peak titer of 6.0 ± 1.5 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL, which was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) than the mean peak titer of 3.37 ± 1.7 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL in the challenged HOSPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006302.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). There was 33% mortality rate by 25 dpi.
