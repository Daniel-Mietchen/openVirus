<p>Naïve HOSPs inoculated with the SLEV-prME group of viruses, i.e. SLEV/IMP115 (

Protective cross-neutralizing WNV-prME antibodies were not detected with these HOSPs. Naïve HOSPs inoculated with either WNV-prME/SLEV.IC (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006302.s002">S2D Fig</xref>) or WNV.IC (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006302.s002">S2E Fig</xref>) produced a variable range of both SLEV-prME and WNV-prME neutralizing antibody titers that were between 16 to 128-fold higher than the neutralizing antibody titers from SLEV-prME inoculated HOSPs.
