<p>One CA HOFI that seroconverted to WNV after antibody screening was inoculated with SLEV-prME/WNV.IC (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006302.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Virus titers in this bird were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) at 2–3 dpi in comparison with naïve birds inoculated with SLEV-prME/WNV.IC (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006302.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). At 4 dpi, SLEV-prME/WNV.IC titer in the WNV-seropositive HOFI reached 7.0 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL which was higher than the daily mean virus titer of 5.1 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL in naïve HOFIs but was not outside the 95% confidence interval of ± 2.1 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL. At dpi 5, the SLEV-prME/WNV.IC titer of the WNV-seropositive HOFI was significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) than daily mean titer of SLEV-prME/WNV.IC in naïve HOFIs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006302.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The WNV-immune HOFI was euthanized on 6 dpi. No other significant differences were detected at any other time point.
