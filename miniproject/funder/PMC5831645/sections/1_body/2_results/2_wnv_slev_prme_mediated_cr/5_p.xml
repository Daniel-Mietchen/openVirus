<p>WNV-prME/SLEV.IC- immune HOSPs challenged with the reciprocal chimeric virus, SLEV-prME/WNV.IC produced daily mean titers that were not significantly different (p&gt;0.05) from daily mean titers in naive HOSPs inoculated with SLEV-prME/WNV.IC (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006302.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). However, one HOSP (red scatter plot) developed SLEV-prME/WNV.IC titers that were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) than naïve HOSPs at 23, 24 and 26 dpi. Another WNV-prME/SLEV.IC- immune HOSP (orange scatter plot) also produced statistically higher SLEV-prME/WNV.IC titers at 26 dpi (p&lt;0.05).
