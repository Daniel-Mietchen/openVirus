<p>Daily individual viral titers of WNV-prME/SLEV.IC in SLEV.IC-immune HOSPs were either undetectable or lower than daily mean titers from WNV-prME/SLEV.IC inoculated naïve HOSPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006302.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). WNV-prME/SLEV.IC viremias were detectable in only 2 of the 8 SLEV.IC-immune HOSPs at 23 dpi, with a peak mean titer of 2.2 ± 0.1 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006302.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). No mortality was observed in the challenged HOSPs. There was no detectable viremia in any SLEV-prME/WNV.IC-immune HOSP challenged with the WNV-prME/SLEV.IC virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006302.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). In comparison, naïve HOSPs inoculated with WNV-prME/SLEV.IC demonstrated a significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) peak mean titer of 3.0 ± 1.8 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL (
