<p>By 21 dpi post-challenge, only 38% of the HOSPs survived in the WNV-prME immune groups that were challenged with antigenically heterologous SLEV-prME/WNV.IC. Neutralizing and cross-neutralizing antibody titers against both WNV-prME and SLEV-prME antigens in these remaining HOSPs were either 20 or below detection (
