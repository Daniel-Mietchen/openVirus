<p>House sparrows that were SLEV-prME immune and then challenged with heterologous WNV-prME viruses; WNV-prME/SLEV.IC or WNV.IC respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006302.s002">S2A–S2C Fig</xref>) produced 16 to 64-fold higher SLEV-prME neutralizing antibodies when compared with naïve HOSPs. WNV-prME neutralizing antibody titers also increased 20 to 2,560-fold in the SLEV-prME immune HOSPs in comparison with naïve HOSPs. The 2 groups of SLEV-prME immune HOSPs that were subsequently challenged with WNV-prME/SLEV.IC produced at least 16- fold higher WNV-prME neutralizing antibody titers after challenge (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006302.s002">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>) than SLEV-prME immune HOSPs challenged with just WNV.IC (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0006302.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Interestingly, there was no detectable WNV-prME/SLEV.IC viremia production after challenge, with the exception of 2 HOSPs (barely above the detection limit of 1.7 log
 <sub>10</sub>PFU/mL) in these two groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006302.g004">Fig 4C and 4D</xref>). Whereas in SLEV-prME immune HOSPs, WNV.IC was able to replicate to similar titers as that observed in naïve HOSPs (
