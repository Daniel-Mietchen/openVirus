<p>In SLEV/ IMP115-immune HOSPs, daily individual titers from secondary WNV.IC inoculations were lower than the 95% CIs of WNV.IC titers in na誰ve HOSPs at 24 and 25 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006302.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). At 21 dpi, 2 HOSPs had significantly higher titers than WNV.IC titers in na誰ve HOSPs. Notably, at 23 dpi, all SLEV/ IMP115-immune HOSPs had WNV.IC titers that fell outside the upper 95% CI of the daily mean WNV.IC titer in na誰ve HOSPs. There were no significant differences (p&gt;0.05) in peak mean titers for WNV.IC between na誰ve and challenged HOSPs (
