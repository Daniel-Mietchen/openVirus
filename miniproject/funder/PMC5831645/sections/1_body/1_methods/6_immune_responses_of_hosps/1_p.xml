<p>To assess the relative magnitude of the homologous and heterologous flaviviral immune response induced in avian hosts following inoculation with the parental or chimeric viruses, PRNT
 <sub>90</sub> titers against WNV.IC and the SLEV-prME/WNV.IC were determined for serum samples taken from birds 21 dpi following primary inoculation (

 <sub>90</sub> was performed using WNV.IC and SLEV-prME/WNV.IC to assess the presence and magnitude of homologous and heterologous neutralizing antibodies. The SLEV-prME/WNV.IC virus was used in place of SLEV as plaques could be visualized at 3 dpi while maintaining antigenic specificity for SLEV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. All HOSPs demonstrated a low level of non-specific neutralization at 1:10 serum dilutions, although this generally did not meet the 90% threshold used for the neutralization tests. Nevertheless, given this factor and the limited serum obtained from the birds, only 1:20 serum dilutions were used for screening for prior exposure to either WNV or SLEV as well as for PRNT
 <sub>90</sub> determinations following initial and secondary inoculations.
