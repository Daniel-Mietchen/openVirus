<p>At 21 dpi, surviving house sparrows from the infection study in which the birds were initially inoculated with SLEV/IMP 115, SLEV.IC, SLEV-prME/WNV.IC, WNV-prME/SLEV.IC or WNV.IC were challenged by needle inoculation with antigenically heterologous viruses, WNV.IC, WNV-prME/SLEV.IC or SLEV-prME/WNV.IC (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006302.t002">Table 2</xref>). Blood was collected daily and titrated for infectious units by plaque assay as before. Scatter plots of daily virus titers for each individual challenged HOSP were plotted against days post-inoculation. The scatter plots were then compared with the daily mean viremia profiles of the same virus (with 95% confidence limits) generated in na√Øve HOSPs from the infection study (line graphs). Individual titers from the challenge infections that fell outside of the upper 95% confidence interval were considered significant.
