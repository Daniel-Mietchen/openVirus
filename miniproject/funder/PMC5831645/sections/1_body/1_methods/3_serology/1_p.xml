<p>Serum samples were taken from all birds used for experimentation and were tested for WNV and/or SLEV reactive and neutralizing antibodies by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) as described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and plaque reduction neutralization tests, respectively, at the time of capture. From Californian HOSP and HOFIs, 0.1mL samples of whole blood were drawn and diluted in 0.9mL of PBS, clarified by centrifugation, frozen at -80°C, heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes and then assessed for antibodies against WNV or SLEV using an immunoassay described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A 0.1mL sample of blood was drawn from HOSPs from Colorado and 0.2mL was drawn from AMCRs collected in Oklahoma by jugular venipuncture and used in a standard plaque reduction-neutralization assay (PRNT
 <sub>90</sub>) as previously described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Briefly, blood drawn from each bird was placed in serum separator tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and sera separated through centrifugation at 5,000 x g and subsequently stored at -20°C. Serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 minutes, diluted 1:10 and serially diluted 2-fold in 96-well plates. The reciprocal of the serum dilution yielding a ≥90% reduction in the number of plaques (PRNT
 <sub>90</sub>) compared to a serum negative control was used as the threshold for assessing a neutralization response.
