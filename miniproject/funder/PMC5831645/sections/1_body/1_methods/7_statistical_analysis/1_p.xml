<p>A repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare daily serum viremias over time among viruses, with mean viremias grouped by

In the challenge study, statistical significance was established by calculating 95% confidence limits (CIs) for daily mean titers for naïve HOSPs and comparing these with daily individual titers of secondarily challenged HOSPs (
