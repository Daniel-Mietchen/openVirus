WNV.IC and SLEV-prME/WNV.IC viruses were harvested at 3 days post-infection (dpi) and SLEV/IMP115, SLEV.IC and WNV-prME/SLEV.IC were harvested at 7 dpi. The complete genomes of the rescued viruses were sequenced to confirm the genetic identity of all parental and chimeric viruses utilized for subsequent experiments as described previously [
