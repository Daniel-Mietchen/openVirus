<p>West Nile (WNV) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV) viruses are serologically related flaviviruses (
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>; 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) that enzootically circulate between 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes and avian amplification hosts in North America with the potential to give rise to epidemics of human encephalitis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. West Nile virus is capable of eliciting extended, high-magnitude viremias and mortality in a wide range of avian species including house sparrows (HOSPs, 
 <italic>Passer domesticus</italic>), house finches (HOFIs, 
 <italic>Haemorhous mexicanus</italic>) and American crows (AMCRs, 
 <italic>Corvus brachyrhynchos</italic>) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Additionally, HOSPs and HOFIs are both competent host species for SLEV in North America [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; however, WNV and SLEV exhibit differential virulence and mortality phenotypes in these species [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. American crows are highly susceptible to WNV infection and can generate serum viremias in excess of 11 log
 <sub>10</sub> PFU/mL sera [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Consequently, they have been utilized as a sentinel species to track the spread of the virus in North America [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In contrast, SLEV presents low-level viremias in a more restricted range of birds and has not been associated with mortality in adult birds [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since its first identification in North America in 1999, WNV has expanded its geographic range and established enzootic transmission foci throughout the continent [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Concurrent with this introduction and subsequent geographic radiation of WNV, SLEV enzootic activity has waned despite the increased levels of arboviral surveillance precipitated by the WNV invasion [
