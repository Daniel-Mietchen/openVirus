<p>To assess whether the high avian 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> replication phenotype of WNV associated with non-structural genetic determinants could be recapitulated 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, host competence studies were conducted in HOSP, HOFI and AMCRs. Furthermore, to identify specific viral genetic determinants of cross-protective immunity in passerine hosts, previously infected HOSPs were challenged with antigenically heterologous WNV or SLEV viruses to characterize immune responses and viremia profiles following secondary challenge.
