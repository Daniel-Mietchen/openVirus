<p>Several studies have assessed the neutralizing cross-protective effect of immune responses to heterologous flaviviruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Given these previous findings and the overlapping distributions of WNV and SLEV in the New World, it is apparent that improved understanding of the cross-protective immune responses in avian hosts between sequential WNV and SLEV infections will be imperative to gain a complete understanding of flaviviral transmission dynamics in North America [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Reports have shown that prior infection of HOFIs with WNV completely ablated SLEV viremias following secondary challenge, whereas primary infection with SLEV retarded WNV viral titers by 1,000-fold, leading to a reduction in the length of acute viremia and the prevention of mortality [
