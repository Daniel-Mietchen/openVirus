<p>A wide variety of factors dictate the efficiency of flavivirus transmission including: the relative susceptibility of mosquito vectors to oral infection and avian host competence related to herd immune status, viral genetic elements that dictate oral vector susceptibility and avian viremias, and environmental conditions. Mapping of viral genetic determinants of flavivirus host virulence through utilization of chimeric viral constructs has been described extensively for other flaviviruses such as tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) and yellow fever (YFV) viruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Various studies have provided conclusive evidence of specific genetic elements that influence WNV host virulence phenotypes such as plaque morphology, murine neuroinvasiveness, temperature sensitivity and avian viremia profiles in AMCRs [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Prior studies have demonstrated that WNV non-structural genetic elements can dictate AMCR virulence phenotypes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006302.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, genetic differences between these viruses have not been previously studied to elucidate the viral determinant(s) dictating the avian host phenotype differences exhibited by WNV and SLEV. Structural chimeric viruses of WNV and SLEV, WNV-prME/SLEV.IC and SLEV-prME/WNV.IC, were previously used to demonstrate that non-structural genetic elements of WNV dictated increased
