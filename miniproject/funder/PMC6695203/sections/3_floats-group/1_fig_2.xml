  <title>A Box-plot demonstrating the differences in incidence in Makassar and the neighboring cities of Maros and Gowa, pre (2003–2006) and post (2007–2014) intervention.</title>
  <p>There was a significant reduction in incidence in Makassar pre and post intervention (Mann Whitney U test, p = 0.007), a decrease in Maros (p = 0.042), and a non-significant decrease in Gowa (p = 0.497). Population level data (and hence incidence calculations) were only present from 2003 onwards.</p>
