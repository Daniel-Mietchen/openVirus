<p>Larval surveys–characterized by searching the entire premise for water containers harboring immature mosquitoes–both inside and outside houses, with a focus on man-made containers less than 2m in diameter, were performed between September and October (the peak of the dry season), and pre-emptive mass fogging was usually implemented from late September to late October for 2–4 weeks. At the end of each transmission season the HI data were compared with reported dengue and rainfall data to evaluate the impact of spraying. Adult entomological indices were not compiled. Routine MoH vector control interventions—including larval source management (LSM), larvaciding, and regular MoH reactive fogging (fogging in a 100m diameter radius around houses of reported dengue cases), were not interrupted. The frequency and density of MoH reactive fogging (also called focal fogging) was based on the number of cases reported. The pre-emptive, pre-season fogging was conducted, monitored and evaluated from 2006 to 2012; monitoring for associated reductions in cases was stopped in 2014.</p>
