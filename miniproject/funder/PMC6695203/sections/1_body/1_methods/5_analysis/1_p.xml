<p>Since this data is likely Poisson-distributed, a non-parametric test (Mann Whitney U test) was performed to compare the annual incidence of reported dengue recorded by the MOH Makassar before (2003–2006) and after (2007–2014) the pre-emptive fogging approach was implemented. A comparison of reported dengue incidence reduction in Makassar City relative to the overall cases reported in South Sulawesi, the cases from cities flanking Makassar City (Gowa and Maros), and the other main cities in South Sulawesi (with the Makassar cluster excluded) was performed. This presentation of these observations may be considered an ‘interrupted time series’ [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007606.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]—though comparisons were made to unmatched non-intervention cities as well as neighboring cities.
