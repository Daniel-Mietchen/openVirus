<p>Dengue was first recorded in Makassar, on the southwestern coast of the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia, in 1976. Dengue incidence increased with urban population growth, with about 1,000 cases reported annually to the Ministry of Health (MoH) by 2003. Reported cases tended to represent more serious illness and likely were a fraction of true incidence [

In response to the increase in dengue cases, Makassar initiated an integrated vector campaign consisting of three initiatives starting in the 1980s. First, a household-conducted larval habitat elimination campaign called 3M (Menutup–to cover; Menguras–to empty; and Mengubur–to bury) was initiated. Second, both local community members and MoH staff conducted larvaciding using Abate (temephos). Abate was made available at local clinics for the community to use in water containers with larvae. Community training was routinely conducted on the identification of immature habitats,

There is no enforcement or evaluation conducted on these strategies and community participation is implicit in their success. And finally, the MoH conducted reactive outdoor insecticide fogging in the vicinity of reported cases. Reactive fogging was designed to treat areas 100m around houses with a clinically diagnosed dengue case, approximately 1 week post-diagnosis.
