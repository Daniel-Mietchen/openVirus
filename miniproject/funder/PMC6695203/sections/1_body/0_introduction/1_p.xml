<p>Dengue is the most common vector-borne viral disease in the world, infecting as many as 400 million people per year [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007606.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The disease is caused by four serotypes [dengue-1, -2, -3 and -4] transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes [

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> differ in both their morphology and behaviors–
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> is commonly found indoors, as a container breeder, and in the center of Makassar city; while 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> is found more outdoors, and is prevalent at the edge of the city. A tetravalent vaccine against the four dengue viruses has been licensed commercially but is not yet widely used; while other vaccines are undergoing clinical trials [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007606.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Safety concerns about the dengue vaccine have also impacted its use. A study found that after being infected with dengue, the vaccine increased the risk of hospitalization by about 50 percent for children not previously exposed to the virus [
