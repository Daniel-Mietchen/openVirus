<p>While comprehensive, rigorous vector control can reduce transmission, in practice inadequate coverage, improper application, insecticide resistance, high labor costs, and community indifference hinder its implementation and sustainability. Evaluations of vector control tools regularly measure entomological outcomes, rather than disease incidence. The relation between vector density, especially of the mosquito immature stages, and pathogen transmission is complex and difficult to predict [
