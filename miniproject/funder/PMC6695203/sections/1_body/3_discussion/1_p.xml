<p>This retrospective analysis of operational data demonstrates that a single annual application of adulticide, timed for the end of the dry season, was accompanied by a profound reduction in both larval indices as well as reported symptomatic dengue cases—when added to the existing regimen of reactive fogging around the houses diagnosed cases. The rationale for initiating this procedure in 2006 was the hypothesis that by waiting to begin Aedes interventions until the first cases were reported, the first wave of transmission initiated by the beginning of the rains, was already underway. Because many asymptomatic dengue infections are capable of infecting mosquitoes [
