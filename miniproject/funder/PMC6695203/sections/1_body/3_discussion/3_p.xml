<p>The data we analyzed were generated from a change in operational control procedure, which was not designed as a research study, but may be considered a programmatic evaluation using an interrupted time series approach. Consequently, our conclusions are tempered by several limitations. The most important is that there were no matched experimental control areas where all procedures were known to be identical except for pre-seasonal fogging. During the eight years examined dengue cases increased in all metropolitan areas of South Sulawesi, with two exceptions, while dramatically decreasing in the augmented vector suppression area of Makassar. The two exceptions, Gowa and Maros, are both contiguous with the augmented suppression area. We cannot exclude the possibility that some unrecognized factor or factors independent of pre-season fogging and exclusive to only Makassar, Gowa, and Maros was responsible for much or all the decrease in reported dengue cases in all three. Because case reporting throughout South Sulawesi is under the supervision of the provincial health department, it is unlikely that there was a prolonged lapse in clinical surveillance, which would have reduced reporting in only Gowa and Maros. We observed that the very limited routine vector surveillance was maintained, or increased as part of this implementation, in Makassar during the observational period, while standard MoH epidemiological surveillance and reporting remained the same. It is important to note that the boundaries between the three contiguous cities (Makassar, Gowa and Maros) are administrative, and not geographical barriers. The observed reduction in vectors in Makassar in combination with the reduction in the virus reservoir would have extended into the areas spatially closest (Maros and Gowa) to Makassar—fits with the “source and sink” mechanism [
