<p>About one fourth of all Guatemalan HIV-1 subtype B sequences included in our study branched within six country-specific clades of large size (B
 <sub>GU-I</sub>, B
 <sub>GU-II</sub>, B
 <sub>GU-III,</sub> B
 <sub>GU-V</sub>, B
 <sub>GU-VI</sub>, and B
 <sub>GU-VIII</sub>). The analysis of clinical and demographic characteristics, however, reveals no major difference between B
 <sub>CAM</sub> and B
 <sub>GU</sub> clades, with the exception of clade B
 <sub>GU-II</sub> that differed from all other clades mostly comprising mainly young, recently infected MSM with higher education and employment rates. In the last 10 years, HIV prevalence among MSM has remained higher than 8% in Guatemala, with most of the cases (75%) related to MSM younger than 36 years with higher education [

 <sub>CAM</sub> and B
 <sub>GU</sub> clades, with regards to the estimated origin of the different lineages: B
 <sub>GU</sub> clades displayed a much more recent median T
 <sub>MRCA</sub> (between the 1990s and 2000s) than the B
 <sub>CAM</sub> clades (between the 1970s and 1980s), which may have had a great impact in the geographical expansion of each lineage.
