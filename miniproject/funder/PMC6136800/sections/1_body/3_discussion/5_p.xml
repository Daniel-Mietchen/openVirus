<p>The spatiotemporal dissemination analysis of B
 <sub>GU</sub> and B
 <sub>CAM</sub> clades evidenced complex migration patterns characterizing the HIV-1 epidemic in the region, involving Guatemalan departments and the neighboring countries Honduras, El Salvador, Belize and Mexico. Guatemalan internal and external migration has been attributed mostly to economic factors, with population mobility from poor rural areas to agriculture or industrial developing areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and the country’s civil war that lasted 32 years, from 1960 to 1996 [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The department of Guatemala and, to a lesser extent, Escuintla, Izabal and Petén have been the main destinations for internal-migration from the eastern and western departments of the country, with dynamic bidirectional population mobility [

 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Regarding external migration, 50% of immigrants to Guatemala correspond to people of other Central American countries, mostly from El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], yet the Guatemalan net migration rate is negative [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] with emigration flows mostly to the United States of America, and the neighboring countries of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Belize [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our phylogeographic reconstructions revealed that the department of Guatemala was the dissemination epicenter of the B
 <sub>GU</sub>, B
 <sub>CAM-II</sub> and B
 <sub>CAM-IV</sub> clades to the rest of Guatemalan departments and to the Guatemalan neighboring countries. Additionally, the departments of Guatemala and Escuintla served as secondary hubs of dissemination of the B
 <sub>CAM-I</sub> and B
 <sub>CAM-III</sub> clades, which emerged in Honduras, to other Guatemalan departments and to the four bordering countries in the case of B
 <sub>CAM-I</sub>. The estimated T
 <sub>MRCA</sub> of B
 <sub>GU</sub> clades, ranging between the early 1990s and the middle 2000s, also coincides with an increased repatriation and deportation rate of Guatemalans from Mexico and the United States of America, respectively [

 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], although we found no significant evolutionary links between B
 <sub>GU</sub> clades and the Mexican subtype B epidemic.
