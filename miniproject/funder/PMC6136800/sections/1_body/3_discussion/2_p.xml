<p>Our phylogeographic analysis identified both country- and region-specific HIV-1 subtype B clades involved in the Guatemalan HIV epidemic, contrasting with the Panamanian epidemic characterized mostly by the dissemination of country-specific clades [

Our study further reveals the existence of at least four major regional-specific clades in Central America (BCAM-I—B
 <sub>CAM-IV</sub>), contrasting with the previous observation of a single HIV subtype B linage (B
 <sub>CAM</sub> clade) accounting for most of the HIV epidemic burden in Central America [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The fact that the Central American clades BCAM-I—B
 <sub>CAM-IV</sub> differ in root location (B
 <sub>CAM-I</sub> and B
 <sub>CAM-III</sub> traced to Honduras, and B
 <sub>CAM-II</sub> and B
 <sub>CAM-IV</sub> traced to Guatemala), also refute the Murillo 
 <italic>et al</italic> assertion that a single viral introduction event was responsible for most of the HIV-1 subtype B infections in Central America. This change in the previously described HIV-1 epidemiological history of subtype B in Central America is expected, considering the fact that the highest number of individuals estimated to be living with HIV in Central America are from Guatemala [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and this country was not included in previous analyses.
