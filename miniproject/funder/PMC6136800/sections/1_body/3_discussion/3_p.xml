<p>Nearly half of all Guatemalan HIV-1 subtype B sequences included in our study branched within Central American B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> clades (67%), indicating an unrestricted viral flow between main transmission networks from Guatemala and the neighboring Central American countries of Honduras and El Salvador. This result is consistent with a previous study that suggested an HIV-1 subtype B epidemiological link between the Guatemalan neighboring countries Belize, Honduras and El Salvador [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A much more restricted viral flow, by contrast, was observed between Guatemala and Mexico (despite their close geographic proximity) and between Guatemala and Panama. Viral flux between Guatemala and Belize, Nicaragua and Costa Rica was not possible to estimate because of the paucity of HIV-1
