<p>It is important to acknowledge some limitations of our study design. Even when the study sample size is large, sequences were obtained from a single HIV clinic. Additionally, the time frame for collecting HIV sequences was limited (2010–2013). Nevertheless, the Roosevelt Hospital is the largest of a total of 18 HIV clinics in the country, providing antiretroviral treatment for 30% of all registered HIV-infected persons in Guatemala [

Our study group is highly representative of the Roosevelt Hospital cohort, as more than 80% of all adults diagnosed at this clinic during the enrolment period were included in the study (expecting approximately 450 total new cases per year [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Given these characteristics of the Roosevelt Hospital’s cohort, we would not expect our main observations to vary significantly if additional participants enrolled in clinics from around the country were to be included.
