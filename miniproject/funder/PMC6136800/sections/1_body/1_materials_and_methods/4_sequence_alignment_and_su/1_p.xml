<p>Sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program implemented in Mega 6.0 software [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The subtype assignment of all sequences included was confirmed using REGA HIV subtyping tool v.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and by performing Neighbor-Joining (NJ) phylogenetic analyses with HIV-1 group M reference sequences downloaded from Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database. The NJ phylogenies were constructed under the Tamura-Nei evolutionary model and the reliability of tree topologies was assessed by bootstrap analysis with 500 replicates using the MEGA 6.0 software package [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Bootstrap values above 75% were considered significant. All sites associated with major antiretroviral drug resistance mutations in PR (30, 32, 46, 47, 48, 50, 54, 76, 82, 84, 88 and 90) or RT (41, 65, 67, 69, 70, 74, 100, 101, 103, 106, 115, 138, 151, 181, 184, 188, 190, 210, 215, 219 and 230) detected in at least two sequences, were excluded from each dataset.
