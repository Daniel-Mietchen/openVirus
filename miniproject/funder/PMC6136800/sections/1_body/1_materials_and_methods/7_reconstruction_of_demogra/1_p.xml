<p>The mode and rate (

 <sup>-1</sup>) of population growth of major HIV-1 clades circulating in Guatemala was also estimated using BEAST v1.8 software. Analyses were also performed using the GTR+I+Γ
 <sub>4</sub> nucleotide substitution model and the temporal scale of evolutionary process were estimated using a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock model. Changes in effective population size through time were initially estimated using a Bayesian Skyline coalescent tree prior [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and estimates of the population growth rate were subsequently obtained using the parametric model (logistic, exponential or expansion) that provided the best fit to the demographic signal contained in datasets. Comparison between demographic models was performed using the log marginal likelihood (ML) estimation based on path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) methods [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. MCMC chains were run for 50–500 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> generations. Convergence and uncertainty of parameter estimates were assessed as explained above.
