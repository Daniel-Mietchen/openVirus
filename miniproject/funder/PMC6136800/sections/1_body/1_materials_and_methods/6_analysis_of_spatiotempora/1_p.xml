<p>The evolutionary rate (nucleotide substitutions per site per year, subst./site/year), the age of the most recent common ancestor (

 <sub>mrca,</sub> years) and the spatial diffusion of HIV-1 Guatemalan clades were jointly estimated using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach as implemented in BEAST v1.8 [

 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] with BEAGLE [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Analyses were performed using the GTR+I+Î“
 <sub>4</sub> nucleotide substitution model and the temporal scale of evolutionary process was directly estimated from the sampling dates of the sequences using a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock model [

 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Adequate chain mixing and uncertainty in parameter estimates were assessed by calculating the effective sample size (ESS) and the 95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD) values respectively using the TRACER v1.5 program [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees were summarized with TreeAnnotator v1.8.1 and visualized with FigTree v1.4.0. Migratory events were summarized using the SPREAD application [
