<p>Blood samples from 1,083 HIV-1-infected Guatemalan individuals were collected at the Infectious Diseases Clinic of the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala City from October 2010 to December 2013 as part of an HIV pre-treatment drug resistance study [
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Briefly, antiretroviral treatment-naïve individuals were enrolled in a cross-sectional study according to new clinical diagnoses at spontaneous demand to the clinic, also including individuals on follow-up visits, previous to starting antiretroviral treatment. Every eligible person attending the clinic was invited to participate in the study. No exclusion criteria were applied except for previous exposure to antiretroviral drugs. After giving written informed consent, participants donated a single blood sample. The complete protease (PR) and the first part of the reverse transcriptase (RT) of the pol gene (nucleotides 2253 to 3275 of reference strain HXB2) were amplified and sequenced using an in-house developed methodology as previously described [
