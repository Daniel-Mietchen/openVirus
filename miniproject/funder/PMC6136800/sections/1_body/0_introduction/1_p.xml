<p>It is commonly accepted that the HIV-1 subtype B epidemic likely moved out of Africa via a single introduction to Haiti in the mid 1960s [

 <sub>CAR</sub>) throughout the Caribbean islands [

 <sub>CAR</sub> lineages accounting for more than 40% of infections in the region [

 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub>), encompassing most subtype B infections around the world, subsequently emerged in the late 1960s [
