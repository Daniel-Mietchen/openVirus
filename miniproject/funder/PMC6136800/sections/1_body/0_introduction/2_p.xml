<p>The precise routes of introduction of HIV-1 subtype B to Central America remain to be clarified. One study suggests that a single early introduction of a B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> strain possibly to Honduras during the 1960s originated a Central American lineage (B
 <sub>CAM</sub>) that accounts for approximately 60% of current subtype B cases in the region [

 <xref rid="pone.0203916.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A more detailed study in Panama, however, showed that the subtype B epidemic in this country is mostly driven by the expansion of multiple founder B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> and B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains, that have remained mostly restricted to this country [
