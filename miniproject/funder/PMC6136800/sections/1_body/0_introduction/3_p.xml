<p>Guatemala is the country comprising the highest number of individuals estimated to be living with HIV (49,000) in Central America, with prevalence in the general population of 0.5% [

Geographic distribution of the Guatemalan HIV epidemic reflects economic development with the involvement of departments with higher commercial activity and with marked migratory routes, including Guatemala, Escuintla, San Marcos, Retalhuleu, Quetzaltenango, Izabal, Petén and Suchitepéquez, which concentrate 76% of notified cases [

A higher proportion of cases is found in Ladino (Mestizo) populations (77%) compared to Maya (indigenous) populations (20%), and 60% of infected individuals are male (approximately 60% of the general population is considered Ladino and 40% indigenous) [

For rapidly evolving pathogens such as HIV, phylogenetic methods can contribute to understand the complex dynamics of viral spread at the population level. Moreover, molecular epidemiology studies have the potential to better inform targeted public health interventions to contain the HIV epidemic at the local, national, or regional context, by identifying key clinical, demographic and geographical correlates of transmission. This information can help to focus limited resources to more effective HIV prevention efforts, including for example, the active search for new infection cases to link them to care and the roll out of pre-exposure prophylaxis [
