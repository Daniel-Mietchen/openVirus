<p>HIV-1 subtype B sequences from the largest Guatemalan clades here identified were next aligned with subtype B sequences from Mexico, Panama and other Central American countries (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203916.s002">S1 Table</xref>). ML analysis revealed that all sequences from Panama and Costa Rica and most sequences from Mexico (98%) branched outside the major Guatemalan clades (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203916.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203916.g003">3</xref>). By contrast, a large proportion of sequences from Honduras (92%), El Salvador (54%), and Belize (22%) branched within the previously defined Guatemalan clades B
 <sub>GU-IV</sub>, B
 <sub>GU-VII</sub>, B
 <sub>GU-IX</sub> and B
 <sub>GU-X</sub> that were thus reclassified as Central American clades B
 <sub>CAM-IV</sub>, B
 <sub>CAM-II</sub>, B
 <sub>CAM-III</sub> and B
 <sub>CAM-I</sub>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203916.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The prevalence of each major Central American clade greatly varied among countries (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203916.s003">S2 Table</xref>). In Guatemala, the predominant clade was B
 <sub>CAM-I</sub> (19%), followed by clades B
 <sub>CAM-II</sub> (12%), B
 <sub>CAM-IV</sub> (10%) and B
 <sub>CAM-III</sub> (8%). In Honduras, the most prevalent clade was B
 <sub>CAM-I</sub> (73%), followed by clades B
 <sub>CAM-III</sub> (12%) and B
 <sub>CAM-II</sub> (7%). In El Salvador, the predominant clade was B
 <sub>CAM-II</sub> (34%), followed by clades B
 <sub>CAM-IV</sub> (12%) and B
 <sub>CAM-I</sub> (8%). In Belize, B
 <sub>CAM-I</sub> and B
 <sub>CAM-II</sub> clades seemed to circulate with similar prevalence (11%). Guatemalan clades (B
 <sub>GU-I</sub>, B
 <sub>GU-II</sub>, B
 <sub>GU-III,</sub> B
 <sub>GU-V</sub>, B
 <sub>GU-VI</sub> and B
 <sub>GU-VIII</sub>) were mostly (&gt;99%) composed by sequences from that country and were thus classified as country-specific clades. Among subtype B sequences from Guatemala included in the study (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,047), 49.3% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 516) belonged to Central America-specific clades and 23.8% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 249) belonged to Guatemala-specific clades.
