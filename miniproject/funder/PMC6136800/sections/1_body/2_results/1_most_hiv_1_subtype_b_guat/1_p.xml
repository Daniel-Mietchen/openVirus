<p>Of the 1,083 HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> Guatemalan sequences here analyzed, we selected 1,047 subtype B sequences geographically distributed among the 22 departments of Guatemala. The remaining 36 sequences were excluded because of possible quality issues (unusual indel mutations/rare polymorphisms) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21) or non-B subtype classification (
 <italic>n</italic> = 15). In order to better understand the origin of the Guatemalan HIV-1 subtype B epidemic, Guatemalan sequences were combined with representative sequences of the B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> and B
 <sub>CAR</sub> lineages (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203916.s002">S1 Table</xref>) to perform a phylogenetic analysis. The ML analysis revealed that, as expected, the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences occupied the deepest branches within the subtype B phylogeny; whereas the B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> sequences branched as a well-supported (
 <italic>aLRT</italic> = 0.88) monophyletic subgroup nested within the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> clades (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203916.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Of the 1,047 sequences analyzed from Guatemala, 1,036 (98.9%) branched within the B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> clade and only 11 sequences (1.1%) branched among the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203916.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This analysis also revealed that 787 (75.2%) of the Guatemalan sequences branched in 10 country-specific monophyletic clades of large size (29 ≤ 
 <italic>n</italic> ≤ 209; B
 <sub>GU-I</sub> to B
 <sub>GU-X</sub>), 226 (21.6%) branched in 43 country-specific clusters of small size (2 ≤ 
 <italic>n</italic> ≤ 17), and the remaining 34 (3.2%) represented non-clustered sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203916.g001">Fig 1</xref>).
