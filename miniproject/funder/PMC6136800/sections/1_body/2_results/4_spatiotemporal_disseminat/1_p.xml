<p>The median estimated evolutionary rates at HIV-1 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene for major Guatemalan and Central American HIV-1 clades ranged from 2.1 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup> subst./site/year to 2.9 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup> subst./site/year with a great overlap of 95% HPD intervals, whereas the coefficient of variation ranged from 0.33 (0.14–0.50) to 0.55 (0.34–0.76), thus supporting the use of a relaxed molecular clock model (

 <sub>GU-III</sub>, B
 <sub>GU-V</sub>, B
 <sub>GU-VI</sub> and B
 <sub>GU-VIII</sub> arose between the early and the middle 1990s, followed by clades B
 <sub>GU-I</sub> and B
 <sub>GU-II</sub> between the early and the middle 2000s (
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The phylogeographic analysis showed that the department of Guatemala was the most probable epicenter of dissemination of all those Guatemalan clades (
 <italic>PSP</italic>≥0.86). B
 <sub>GU-I</sub> was the most widely disseminated lineage, being detected in 15 out of the 22 Guatemalan departments, followed by clade B
 <sub>GU-V</sub> detected in 11 departments and El Salvador; clade B
 <sub>GU-VIII</sub> detected in 11 departments, clade B
 <sub>GU-VI</sub> in 10 departments; clade B
 <sub>GU-II</sub> in seven departments, and clade B
 <sub>GU-III</sub> in six departments and Mexico (

 <sub>GU-II</sub>/B
 <sub>GU-VIII</sub>, B
