<p>The root location of Central American clades B
 <sub>CAM-I</sub> and B
 <sub>CAM-III</sub> was most probably traced to Honduras (Posterior State Probability, 
 <italic>PSP</italic> ≥0.99) around the middle 1980s (
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The most widely disseminated viral clade, B
 <sub>CAM-I,</sub> migrated from Honduras to the department of Guatemala, El Salvador and Mexico during the early 1990s and later moved to other Guatemalan departments around 2010 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203916.g005">Fig 5</xref>). From the department of Guatemala, clade B
 <sub>CAM-I</sub> was disseminated to other 16 Guatemalan departments and also to Mexico, Belize, and back to Honduras. El Salvador and the Guatemalan department of Escuintla were also secondary hubs of dissemination of clade B
 <sub>CAM-I</sub>. Clade B
 <sub>CAM-III</sub> moved from Honduras to several Guatemalan departments (Guatemala, Zacapa, Sacatepéquez, Izabal and Chiquimula) and to Mexico since 1997 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203916.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The department of Guatemala acted as a secondary hub of dissemination of B
 <sub>CAM-III</sub> sending viruses to other Guatemalan departments from 2001 onwards.
