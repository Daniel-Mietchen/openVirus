<p>The root location for clades B
 <sub>CAM-II</sub> and B
 <sub>CAM-IV</sub> was most probably traced to the department of Guatemala (
 <italic>PSP</italic> = 0.47 and 0.99, respectively) between the late 1970s and the early 1990s (
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Clade B
 <sub>CAM-II</sub> moved from the department of Guatemala to Honduras and El Salvador around the late 1970s, to the Guatemalan departments of Solola and Chiquimula during the 1990s, and to other 11 Guatemalan departments, Belize and Mexico since the early 2000 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203916.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Secondary hubs of dissemination of clade B
 <sub>CAM-II</sub> were El Salvador from where the virus has spread to Honduras, back to the department of Guatemala, and to other seven Guatemalan departments since the early 1990s, and Honduras from where the virus has spread back to the department of Guatemala and Mexico since the early 1980s. The department of Guatemala was the major epicenter of clade B
 <sub>CAM-IV</sub> moving from the capital to other 15 Guatemalan departments, as well as to El Salvador and Mexico since the middle 1980s. From El Salvador, clade B
 <sub>CAM-IV</sub> moved back to the department of Guatemala.
