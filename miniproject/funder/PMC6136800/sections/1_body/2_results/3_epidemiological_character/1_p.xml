<p>We then analyzed the demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals included in the different Guatemalan and Central American clades (
 <xref rid="pone.0203916.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Significant differences in all the variables analyzed were observed between the B
 <sub>GU-II</sub> clade and the other B
 <sub>CAM</sub> and B
 <sub>GU</sub> lineages. The B
 <sub>GU-II</sub> clade was mostly transmitted among young (median age 27 years), recently infected (59%), MSM (46%), with higher education level (71% with bachelor degree and 16% with high-school degree) and employment (64%) rates. In sharp contrast, all other B
 <sub>CAM</sub> and B
 <sub>GU</sub> clades were mostly composed of older (median age &gt;31 years), heterosexual (&gt;79%) individuals, with long-standing infection (&gt;78%), and lower education (degree &lt;21%) and employment (&lt;53%) rates than those observed in individuals infected by the B
 <sub>GU-II</sub> clade. Guatemala City was the residence for most (&gt;48%) individuals of major B
 <sub>CAM</sub> and B
 <sub>GU</sub> clades, with exception of B
 <sub>GU-V</sub> (24%) and B
 <sub>CAM-III</sub> (34%). The B
 <sub>GU-V</sub> clade stands out due to a lower mean CD4 T cell count. This clade was composed by persons from outside the Department of Guatemala (77%), with a significantly lower level of education (35% with none and 53% with elementary degree) and heterosexual risk of transmission. Late arrival to clinical care in populations with lower education and socio-economic status is a common feature of many Latin American countries [
