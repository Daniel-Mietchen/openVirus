<p>In summary, our observations suggest that the Guatemalan HIV-1 subtype B epidemic is being driven by dissemination of multiple B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> founder viral strains, some of them mostly restricted to Guatemala and others widely disseminated in the Central American region. Moreover, our results identify Guatemala and Honduras as hubs that have played a central role in dissemination of B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> viral strains within Central America and further suggest the existence of different sub-epidemics with distinct evolutionary and demographic dynamics within Guatemala and for which different targeted prevention efforts might be needed.
