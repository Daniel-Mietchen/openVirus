  <title>Best fit demographic model for the major HIV-1 Guatemalan clades.</title>
  <p>Log marginal likelihood (ML) estimates for the logistic (Log), exponential (Expo) and expansion (Expa) growth demographic models obtained using the path sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) methods. The Log Bayes factor (BF) is the difference of the Log ML between of alternative (H1) and null (H0) models (H1/H0). Log BFs &gt; 3 indicates that model H1 is more strongly supported by the data than model H0.</p>
