  <title>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 subtype B 
   <italic>pol</italic> (~1000 bp) sequences belonging to the major Guatemalan clades (B
   <sub>GU-I</sub> to B
   <sub>GU-X,</sub> n = 787), and reference sequences from Mexico (
   <italic>n</italic> = 824) and the Caribbean (
   <italic>n</italic> = 238).
  </title>
  <p>Branches are colored according to the geographic origin of each sequence, as indicated in the legend (top left). Branches from clades B
   <sub>GU-I</sub> to B
   <sub>GU-X</sub> are colored according to clade as indicated in the legend (bottom). The tree was rooted using HIV-1 subtype D reference sequences. Branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions per site.
