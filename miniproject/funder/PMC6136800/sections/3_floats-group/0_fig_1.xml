 <caption>
  <title>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 subtype B 
   <italic>pol</italic> (~1000 pb) sequences circulating in Guatemala (
   <italic>n</italic> = 1047), and representative sequences of the B
   <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> (US = 465, France = 344) and the B
   <sub>CAR</sub> (Caribbean = 238) clades.
  </title>
  <p>Branches are colored according to the geographic origin of each sequence, as indicated in the legend (top left). Colored boxes highlight the position of the ten major Guatemalan HIV-1 subtype B clades (B
   <sub>GU-I</sub> to B
   <sub>GU-X</sub>). The number of sequences and the 
   <italic>a</italic>LRT support values for each clade are indicated at the bottom. The tree was rooted using HIV-1 subtype D reference sequences. Branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions per site.
