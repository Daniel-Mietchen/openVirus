<p>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), the causative agent of JE, is a mosquito-borne member of the genus Flavivirus, family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes are the main vector for JEV, while wild water birds represent the reservoirs of the virus [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Swine are highly susceptible to JEV infection, although the clinical signs generally remain subclinical, and this species serves as amplifying hosts during human epidemics [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Neurotropic disease occurs relatively rarely in the virusâ€™ natural hosts, although abortion has been noted in pregnant sows [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In contrast, humans and horses are considered dead-end hosts, as they may develop fatal disease but do not develop a viremia capable of transmitting the virus.
