<p>In 2016, the vector-free transmission and viral persistence of JEV was experimentally confirmed in pigs. Pigs were not only susceptible to oronasal infection, but the virus was shown to persist in the tonsils for 25 days despite the detection of high titers of neutralizing antibodies. JEV RNA was detected in oral fluids for up to 14 days following infection in swine, and it seems to be the route of viral exit and entry for pigs [
