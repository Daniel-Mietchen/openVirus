<p>To evaluate the possibility of contact transmission in the mice, two groups of 9 mice were i.n. inoculated with 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL of either the SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 virus, respectively. Then, 1 group of 9 mice was housed separately and i.n. inoculated with PBS as the controls. After 24 h post-infection, 9 sentinel mice were placed in each cage. On 3, 5, and 7 dpi, 3 infected and 3 sentinel mice were humanely euthanized from each group, and lung samples were collected for molecular analyses and virus isolation. The serum samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies by PRNT. The lung samples were homogenized for qRT-PCR or serially diluted in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) for viral titration.
