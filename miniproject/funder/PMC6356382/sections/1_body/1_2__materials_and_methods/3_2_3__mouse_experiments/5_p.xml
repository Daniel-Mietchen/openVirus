<p>To determine the potential for aerosol transmission in mice, 2 groups of 9 animals were i.n. inoculated with 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 Î¼L of either the SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 virus, respectively. Then, 9 mice were i.n. inoculated with PBS and housed separately as the controls. The animals were housed on one side of a cage with a double-walled wired partition that allowed airflow but prevented bedding, feces, and urine contamination, as well as contact with the other side. After 24 h post-inoculation, 9 sentinel animals were added to the empty side of the cage. On 3, 5, and 7 dpi, 3 animals from the infected groups and 3 animals from the sentinel groups were humanely euthanized, and lung samples were collected for further analyses. The serum samples were tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies by PRNT.
