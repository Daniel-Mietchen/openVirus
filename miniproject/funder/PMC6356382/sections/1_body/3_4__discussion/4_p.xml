<p>The replication of JEV in mouse lungs in this study suggests that the tissue tropism of JEV extends to the lungs during intranasal infections. These ideas have not been thoroughly assessed for JEV in particular, as the virus was thought to be transmitted mainly by mosquito vectors. Most interestingly, up to 10
 <sup>7.0</sup> RNA copies/g in the lungs were detected in the mice. This efficient replication in the lungs could be explained by local replication at the inoculation site, as we could detect viral RNA in oronasal swabs of the infected mice. A former study showed that the aerosol inoculation of JEV in mice via aerosol-producing machinery fails to detect viral replication in the lungs after 9 dpi [

One previous study found that mice are susceptible to oral challenge, although no molecular data were provided nor was replication in the lungs determined [

Not only was shedding detected in the oronasal swabs of the sentinel mice, but infectious viruses were isolated in the lungs of the same animals. Our data demonstrate the transmission of JEV to contact animals from i.n. inoculated animals, which is consistent with previous findings in swine, the natural host [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The contact pigs showed viral RNA as high as 10
 <sup>4.0</sup> quantities/mL in the sera at 6 and 8 dpi. We showed similar viral RNA loads in the lungs of the contact mice. Contact transmission has also been demonstrated with the Zika virus in guinea pigs in which 100% of the contact animals developed viremia as soon as 1 day post-challenge of greater than 10
 <sup>5.0</sup> RNA copies/mL [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Normally, humans infected with JEV, similar to mice, do not display apparent viremia or a high viral load in the peripheral organs, except in encephalitic cases where a high viral load is detected in the brain [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In contrast, pigs show high viremia following JEV infection [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Together, these facts suggest that JEV infection in the peripheral organs is quite different among pigs, mice, and human cases. So far, species differences in viral shedding or transmission remain unclear. Nevertheless, contact transmission could contribute to the spread of JEV during outbreaks within highly concentrated populations in the absence of mosquito vectors, based on our results and former pig studies [
