<p>JEV has been thought to transmit solely through mosquito vectors. The 
 <italic>Culex</italic> species has been implicated as the main contributors to the spread of the disease. The concept that mosquitoes are the sole contributors to JEV outbreaks and disease has been questioned recently because epidemiological and virologic data on outbreaks in non-tropical regions suggests that other factors also play a role in the spread of the disease. In 2016, Ricklin et al. proved the contact transmission of JEV in experimentally infected pigs; the results of the study suggest contact transmission plays a more important role in viral dissemination in large, dense populations of animals [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this study, we not only confirm that contact transmission is possible but also demonstrate that aerosol transmission may occur in the mouse model. The results of these studies add to our understanding of JEV transmission within populations of susceptible species without the presence of mosquito vectors.
