<p>The viral titers detected in the aerosol-infected group do not reach the level necessary to transmit to mosquitoes. There are potentially two reasons for this. First, mice are not the natural host of JEV, which may limit the viral replication. Second, the low infecting dose may potentially prevent vector-borne transmission from these animals. It is likely that JEV outbreaks are multifactorial, where many forms of disease transmission contribute to the spread and persistence of the disease. In the case of outbreaks with an unknown source, it is speculated that aerosol transmission and persistence may play a role in viral appearance and dissemination. With this in mind, the results of our study provide novel insights into the understanding of JEV epidemiology and might be used to aid in the prediction of future outbreaks. </p>
