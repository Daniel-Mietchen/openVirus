<p>The pathology of the infected groups is consistent with the previous findings for JEV and other encephalitic flaviviruses [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In mice i.n. infected with different doses of the virus, lung and brain lesions were observed in the mice infected with both viruses. Alveolar hemorrhage in the lungs and neuronal necrosis in the brain were also observed in mice infected intracerebrally with JEV [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Interestingly, no obvious difference in the brain lesions was observed between the virulent and attenuated vaccine strains of JEVs used, which is most likely due to the intranasal infection route used in this study, because no mortality was found in the mice infected with a high dose of the virulent virus. Overall, the pathology observed in mice in our study was caused by JEV infection.
