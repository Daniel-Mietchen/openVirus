<p>Aerosol transmission was previously assessed with respect to the West Nile virus (WNV), duck tembusu, and St. Louis Encephalitis virus (SLEV), all closely related flaviviruses. WNV has been well documented for its potential for aerosol infections in laboratory-acquired infections and in mice [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition to laboratory infections of WNV, the virus can transmit via oronasal infections in a variety of species including mice, alligators, and hamsters [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Considering the similarities between JEV and WNV, we cannot eliminate the potential for alternative routes of transmission for JEV. In 2015, duck tembusu virus was shown to infect ducks via airborne transmission as soon as 4 dpi [

 <sup>4.0</sup> RNA copies/mL, while the peak titers for the aerosol-exposed group were 10
 <sup>5.0</sup> RNA copies/mL at 6 dpi [

 <sup>2.6</sup> to 10
 <sup>7.6</sup> pfu/mL of SLEV, causing 20â€“100% mortality, respectively [
