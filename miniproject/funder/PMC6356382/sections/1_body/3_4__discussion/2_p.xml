<p>Confirming previous findings, our results indicate that mice are highly susceptible to certain strains of JEV. Even a low viral dose of 10
 <sup>2.0</sup> pfu/50 Î¼L caused a sustained infection in mice when i.n. inoculated with either the SA14-14-2 or SCYA201201 JEV strain. The vaccine strain SA14-14-2 was generated by attenuating the parent strain SA14 in suckling mice and has been shown to replicate efficiently in mice infected with as low as 1.5 pfu/mouse [

Interestingly, the low dose of both JEV strains resulted in similar RNA loads in the lungs through 15 dpi; however, both high dose groups showed significant differences in the viral RNA load at the later timepoints of 11 and 15 dpi. It is unclear whether the replication observed in the lungs is local replication due to the infection method or a possible site of JEV persistence. In contrast to our former mouse studies, in which 7-day-old suckling mice were subcutaneously inoculated with the SCYA201201 virus, no virus was detected in the lungs of the infected mice that displayed neurological signs and died between 5 and 7 dpi [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the present study, no mice showed clinical signs or mortality after intranasal inoculation with the virulent SCYA201201 virus, although a high viral load was detected in both the lungs and brains. The differing results could be explained by a difference in the infection routes, where intranasal inoculation causes brain infection via the olfactory nerve and subcutaneous inoculation does not. JEV has been found to persist in the tonsils after oronasal infection in pigs, although the infection dynamics and clinical presentation in dead-end hosts, such as humans and mice, differ from that of amplifying hosts, such as pigs [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-11-00087" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The virus replication in the lungs were not examined in the study; however, the persistence of JEV may explain the epidemiology of past outbreaks. Future studies are necessary to determine the viral replication and persistence in different routes of infection, as well as the disease course and prognosis.
