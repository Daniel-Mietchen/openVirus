<p>As both JEVs replicated efficiently in mouse lungs after i.n. inoculation with a high dose (10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu) of JEV, we further examined the viral replication in the lungs and viral shedding using different doses of the viruses. A total of six groups of 15 mice were i.n. inoculated with 10
 <sup>6</sup>, 10
 <sup>4</sup>, or 10
 <sup>2</sup> pfu/50 μL of either the SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 virus. No obvious clinical signs, including weight loss or neurological signs, were observed in any of the experimental mice throughout the length of the study. In the 10
 <sup>2</sup> pfu/50 μL-infected mice, the viral RNA was not significantly different between the groups at all the tested dates except for 7 dpi, at which point a significantly higher amount of viral RNA was found in the SCYA201201-infected mice. In contrast, the 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 10
 <sup>6</sup> pfu/50 μL SCYA201201 groups displayed significantly higher levels of viral RNA at 11 and 15 dpi when compared with the SA14-14-2-infected animals (

 <sup>6</sup> pfu/50 μL of both viruses at 3, 5, and 7 dpi. The results showed no statistical differences between the two viruses, although a higher viral RNA load was found in the SCYA201201-infected mice at both 5 and 7 dpi (
