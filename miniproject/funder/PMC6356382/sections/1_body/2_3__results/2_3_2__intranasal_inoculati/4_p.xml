 <sup>4.0</sup>, or 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL JEV were harvested at 7 dpi. Compared with the lungs of the control mice, pathologic lesions were seen in the lungs of the mice infected with both viruses by hematoxylin and eosin (H+E) staining. In both groups, the macrophages were present in the alveoli, and the alveolar wall appeared thickened. In addition, severe alveolar hemorrhage was present in the mice infected with 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL of the SCYA201201. No microscopic lesions were seen in the alveoli of the control mice (

The brain lesions were characterized by apyogenous encephalitis, including increased glial cells, neuronophagia, neuronal degeneration and necrosis, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration. There were no microscopic lesions in the brain of the control mice (
