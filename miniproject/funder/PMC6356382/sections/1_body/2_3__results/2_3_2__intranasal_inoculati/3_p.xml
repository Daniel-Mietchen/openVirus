<p>The appearance of neutralizing antibodies was assessed by PRNT in serum samples collected in the second mouse study at 3, 5, 7, 11, and 15 dpi. A neutralization antibody titer was only detected in a single mouse on 7 dpi in the 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL SCYA201201 inoculation group. The mice in the remaining groups displayed a neutralization antibody titer (≥1:10) at 11 or 15 dpi (

 <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL of SCYA201201 at 15 dpi. In contrast, the mice infected with the same dose of the SA14-14-2 virus displayed 1:10 or 1:20 antibody titers on the same day (
