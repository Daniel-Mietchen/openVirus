<p>A total of two groups of 15 mice were i.n. inoculated with either SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 and sequentially sacrificed on 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 dpi to evaluate the viral tissue tropism. No obvious clinical signs such as weight loss, neurological signs, or depression were observed in any of the infected or control mice during the experiment. Viral RNA was detected in all the tested tissues, including the lungs, tracheas, brains, thymuses, livers, hearts, spleens, and kidneys of the infected mice with either virus (

As expected, SCYA201201 replicated more efficiently than SA14-14-2, especially at the later time points from 5â€“7 dpi in all the tissues except in the liver. Although both viruses replicated efficiently in the lungs, the level of viral RNA detected in the SCYA201201-infected mice was significantly higher than that found in the SA14-14-2-infected animals at 3, 5, 6, and 7 dpi (

The results of this study indicate that both JEV strains cause systemic infection in mice inoculated by the intranasal route and replicate to a greater extent in the lung.
