  <p>Aerosol transmission of JEV in mice. The mice were infected i.n. with 10
   <sup>6.0</sup> pfu/50 μL of the SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 virus, respectively, and were housed in a cage with a double-walled wire partition that permitted airflow but prevented direct contact. The sentinel animals were added at 24 h post-infection. The mice were sacrificed, and their lungs were harvested at 3, 5, and 7 dpi. The SCYA201201 was marked with hollow symbols (infected with 
   <styled-content style="color:blue">○</styled-content> and sentinel with 
   <styled-content style="color:blue">◇</styled-content>) and the SA14-14-2 was marked with solid symbols (infected with 
   <styled-content style="color:red">●</styled-content> and sentinel with 
   <styled-content style="color:red">◆</styled-content>). (
   <bold>A</bold>) The viral RNA load in the lungs was measured using real-time RT-PCR assay. The horizontal dotted lines indicate the limit of detection (**** 
   <italic>P</italic> ˂ 0.0001). (
   <bold>B</bold>) The virus titer in the lung samples were determined by the plaque assay.
