  <p>Hematoxylin and eosin (H+E) analysis of mouse lung and brain sections. Four-week-old mice were i.n. inoculated with different doses (10
   <sup>2</sup>, 10
   <sup>4</sup>, or 10
   <sup>6</sup> pfu/50 μL) of the SCYA201201 or SA14-14-2 virus. (
   <bold>A</bold>) H+E staining of mouse lung sections revealed pathologic changes consistent with JEV infection. The scale indicates 50 μm. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The H+E staining of mouse brain sections revealed brain lesions consistent with JEV infection. The brain lesions are indicated by arrows. There are no microscopic lesions in the lung and brain of the control mice. The scale indicates 50 μm.
