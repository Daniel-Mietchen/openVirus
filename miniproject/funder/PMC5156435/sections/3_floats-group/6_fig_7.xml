  <title>Correlation between the proposed index and the positive incidence of influenza B.</title>
  <p>The number of positive cases of influenza B was obtained from the FluNet database [
   <xref rid="pone.0168127.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and was divided by the total population [
   <xref rid="pone.0168127.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] to eliminate the influence of the population increase. The proposed index was estimated by using the data of the number of passengers in international airlines [
   <xref rid="pone.0168127.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and the total population. A strong positive correlation between the proposed index and the incidence of influenza B implies that the increased human mobility is responsible for the growing number of the incidence.
