<p>On the other hand, metapopulation models describe the epidemic dynamics of subpopulations in spatially separated patches connected via migration pathways and deal with human mobility patterns at a macroscopic level [

 <xref rid="pone.0168127.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The statistical properties of various human traveling patterns via transportation networks, such as airlines, railways, and commuting roads, have been well incorporated into the metapopulation models [

 <xref rid="pone.0168127.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in metapopulation models with heterogeneous patch connectivity. However, the stochastic nature of the movement of individual hosts is not explicitly considered in the metapopulation models because they only describe the mobility dynamics of subpopulations.
