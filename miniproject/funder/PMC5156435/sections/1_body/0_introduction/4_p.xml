<p>In various types of epidemic models, it has been the central issue how the final epidemic size is determined by the individual system parameters or the composite of them. The important measures which determine the epidemic threshold and predict the final epidemic size have been derived for several model types, e.g. the basic reproduction number for the standard compartment models [

 <xref rid="pone.0168127.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and the global invasion threshold for the metapopulation models [
