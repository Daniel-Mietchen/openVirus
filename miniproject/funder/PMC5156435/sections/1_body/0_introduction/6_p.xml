<p>We separate the infected individuals into the exposed ones and infectious ones. The exposed individuals are not able to transmit a disease to other susceptible individuals, whereas the infectious individuals are able to do. We assume that the mobility of infectious individuals can be lower than that of the other classes of individuals due to severe symptoms and/or travel restrictions [

Under the individual’s mobility depending on its internal state, we first perform individual-based simulations of the SEIR model in a square lattice and clarify the interplay between the latent period and the mobility for the final epidemic size. We find that the distance that each infected individual moves during the latent and infectious periods plays a decisive role for the final epidemic size. Then, based on the theory of diffusion processes, we present an index giving an epidemic threshold that is almost invariant under parameter scaling. Finally, we demonstrate a strong correlation between the proposed index incorporating the real data of human airline travels and the incidence of influenza B. Our result implies an important role of human mobility on the final epidemic size.
