<p>Pandemics are recognized as a serious threat and concern all over the world. To cope with this issue, considerable efforts have been made for investigating the mechanism of the spread of infectious diseases and finding possible control measures for preventing epidemic outbreaks. In particular, recent epidemics are more likely to spread in a broad area than before, because of the effect of worldwide human mobility through a variety of transportation networks [

Mathematical models have been a powerful tool to reveal the effect of human behaviour on epidemic spreading and examine the effectiveness of countermeasures against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. To study spatial spreading of epidemics which cannot be treated by deterministic compartmental models assuming a well-mixed population [

 <xref rid="pone.0168127.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], many mathematical models have incorporated both spatial structures and host mobility. The two major classes of such computational models are the individual-based (agent-based) models and the metapopulation models [
