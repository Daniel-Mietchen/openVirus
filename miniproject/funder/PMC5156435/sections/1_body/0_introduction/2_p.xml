<p>The individual-based models have been widely used to simulate the spreading of epidemics at a microscopic level (i.e. a level of individual hosts), assuming stochastic processes for infection, recovery, birth, death, and movement events [

Many recent models have incorporated directly or indirectly the real data of population distributions, human mobility patterns, and human proximity, for investigating the spatiotemporal dynamics of epidemic spreading and assessing the effects of preventive measures [

 <xref rid="pone.0168127.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The advantage of individual-based models is that they can enhance the reality of simulations by appropriately setting many parameters estimated from available data sources. However, the outcome of the simulation can be largely variable from trial to trial due to the repeated stochastic calculations and highly dependent on the parameter conditions as well as initial conditions. Therefore, it is tough to gain an insight into essential factors that mainly contribute to the spatial spreading of epidemics in individual-based models without a large number of simulations.
