<p>In this study, we aim to perceive the key factors that govern the final epidemic size in spatial epidemic models with heterogeneous mobility of individuals and clarify how each key factor contributes to the final epidemic size. For this purpose, we employ a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model with mobile individuals in a square lattice. Since multiple individuals can be located at a single lattice site, our model is similar to a spatial metapopulation model where each site of the lattice corresponds to the patch containing a subpopulation [

 <xref rid="pone.0168127.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, in our model, the subpopulation dynamics is given not by deterministic differential equations but by individual-based stochastic processes. Spatial metapopulation models have been frequently used for data-driven simulations to investigate geographical propagation of measles [

The purpose of our study is to clarify how the final epidemic size is determined by the interplay between disease characteristics and spatial mobility of individuals. Note that the time-varying contact patterns in our model cannot be represented by the lattice-based cellular automata models where contact relationships are static [
