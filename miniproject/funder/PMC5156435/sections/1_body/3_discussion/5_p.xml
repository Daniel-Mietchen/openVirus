<p>Our spatial epidemic model explicitly considers the spatial movement of individuals, and therefore, belongs to the class of individual-based models. Instead of conducting a realistic simulation with the individual-based model as in many previous studies, we have explored a universal property with regard to the final epidemic size by assuming the simple hopping rule from site to site. In this study, the key index 
 <italic>Ï•</italic> has been introduced based on the numerical observations. One of the future issues is to derive a similar index based on analytical calculations and compare the index with those for other models.
