<p>The proposed model can be regarded as a generalization of some existing models, because it is reduced to a well-mixed population model if the number of sites is set at one and also equivalent to a spatial metapopulation model if each site contains a sufficiently large subpopulation. So far spatial metapopulation models have been mainly employed for realistic simulations with mobility data, but theoretical analyses of them have received less attention. Our approach in this study, which has led to parameter scaling for the final epidemic size resulting from an interaction between epidemiological and mobility parameters, could be a first step to develop a more general and theoretical understanding of epidemic spreading in spatial metapopulation models with heterogeneous human mobility [

A possible direction is to construct a spatial epidemic model to which the mathematical theory of spatial diffusion processes is applicable, in order to analyse the effect of heterogeneous mobility which largely influences the final epidemic size.
