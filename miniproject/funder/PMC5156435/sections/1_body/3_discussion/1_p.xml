<p>We have investigated the spatial SEIR model with stochastic mobility of individuals on the square lattice to reveal how heterogeneous spatial mobility influences the final epidemic size. Our model is characterized by six parameters: the initial density of susceptible individuals, the length of latent period, the length of infectious period, the transmission probability, the hopping rate, and the mobility reduction rate. The main contribution of this study is the proposal of the index 
 <italic>Ï•</italic> as an explicit function of these six parameters, which is largely associated with the final epidemic size. Through this index, it is obvious how parameter scaling changes the final epidemic size. This index can be regarded as a control parameter governing the final epidemic size in the presence of spatial mobility of individuals.
