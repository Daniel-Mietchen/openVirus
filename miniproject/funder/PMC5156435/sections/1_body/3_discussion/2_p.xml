<p>It has been commonly recognized that the factors promoting the spreading of epidemics include the transmission rate and the population density [

In this study, we have illustrated that the mobility parameter interacts with the latent period and therefore the mobility reduction of infectious individuals is effective only in the case with a short latent period. This result implies the limitation of social distancing measures including travel restrictions and quarantine. For infectious diseases with a long latent period, a countermeasure to reduce the mobility of both exposed and infectious individuals would be beneficial.
