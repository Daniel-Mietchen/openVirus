<p>The proposed index is based on the idea that the final size is largely governed by the effective transport distance that the pathogens can reach during the latent and infectious periods. The transport distance is well correlated with the characteristic length of the human mobility, which is theoretically derived using the analysis of diffusion equations. Therefore, the proposed index is represented using the characteristic length and the other system parameters. In the proposed index, the interplay between the mobility parameter and the other epidemiological parameters is clear.</p>
