<p>Second, we describe the mobility of individuals. Each individual is positioned at one lattice site, and then, in one unit of time, will hop from site to site in a probabilistic manner. Multiple individuals can be positioned at a single site. It is possible that a site contains no individuals. With a single hop, an individual can move to one of its eight neighbouring sites as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168127.g001">Fig 1</xref>. The probability that susceptible, exposed, and recovered individuals hop to each one of the destination sites is given by the normal hopping rate

 <italic>α</italic> represents the mobility reduction rate of infectious individuals. Both the normal and lower hopping rates are independent of the situation of the destination site. In the case of
