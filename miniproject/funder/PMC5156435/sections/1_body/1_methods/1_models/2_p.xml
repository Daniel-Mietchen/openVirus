<p>First, we explain the state transition of individuals. Each individual is in a susceptible state (S), an exposed state (E), an infectious state (I), or a recovered state (R). Note that both exposed and infectious individuals are infected but only infectious ones are capable of transmitting the disease to susceptible ones. The individuals sharing the same lattice site are regarded to be in contact with each other. Susceptible individuals can be infected only when they share a lattice site with one or more infectious individuals. We assume that a susceptible individual becomes an exposed one with probability 
 <italic>p</italic> for a contact with each infectious individual in one unit of time. If a susceptible individual shares a site with 
 <italic>ν</italic> infectious individuals, then the susceptible individual becomes an exposed one with probability 1 − (1 − 
 <italic>p</italic>)
 <sup>
  <italic>ν</italic>
 </sup> in one unit of time. This probability is independent of the numbers of susceptible, exposed, and recovered individuals positioned at the site. An exposed individual becomes an infectious individual after a latent period of fixed length 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>E</sub>. Then, after an infectious period of fixed length 
 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>I</sub>, an infectious individual becomes a recovered individual who never again becomes susceptible.
