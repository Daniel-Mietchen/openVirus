<p>Here we analyse a correlation between the index 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> and the incidence of infectious diseases using real data. We focus on influenza B as one of the infectious diseases which cause outbreaks all over the world and are not responsible for recent pandemics. We suppose that an outbreak in the spatial SEIR model as found in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168127.g002">Fig 2(E)</xref> is repeated every year for influenza B in the real world. For estimating 
 <italic>ϕ</italic> from real data, we employ human mobility data through international airline networks.
