<p>So far we have assumed that the destination of the mobility is restricted to the neighbouring sites. However, in reality, there could be a more distant movement in a unit time. Thus, we have examined how our index in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0168127.e007">Eq 2</xref> changes when the hopping to a more extended area is allowed. The results show that the index is qualitatively the same as 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0168127.e007">Eq 2</xref> but with different coefficients (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168127.s001">S1 File</xref> for the details).
