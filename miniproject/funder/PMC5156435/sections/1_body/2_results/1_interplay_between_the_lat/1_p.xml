 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168127.g002">Fig 2</xref> demonstrates the spatial spreading of an epidemic in our model with lattice size 
 <italic>L =</italic> 100. The snap shots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168127.g002">Fig 2(A)–2(D)</xref> represent the time evolution of the spatial distributions of the infectious individuals. We see that an infectious individual initially located close to the centre causes the diffusion of the infection towards the lattice boundary. This spatial pattern is pretty irregular due to the stochastic mobility of the individuals compared with the ring-shaped propagation generated by other lattice-based models [
 <xref rid="pone.0168127.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0168127.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The number of the infectious individuals, 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>I</sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>) varies with time as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168127.g002">Fig 2(E)</xref>. Initially 
 <italic>n</italic>
 <sub>I</sub>(
 <italic>t</italic>) grows rapidly until the highest peak is achieved, and then, almost monotonically decays to zero. We can evaluate the final size 
 <italic>r</italic>
 <sub>∞</sub> of this outbreak by the value of 
 <italic>r</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) at the end of the outbreak. Whether the initial infectious individual brings about a global spread of infection or not depends on the parameter conditions as well as initial conditions.
