 <italic>τ</italic>
 <sub>E</sub> = 1) and the mobility reduction is full (α = 0). The short latent period limits the area where the exposed individuals move around, and as a result, the region where they turn to infectious individuals becomes small. On the other hand, the large mobility reduction prevents the infectious individuals from moving around in a wide region. If either one of the two conditions is not satisfied, the infectious individuals contact with many susceptible individuals, causing a large-scale outbreak. This result suggests that the social distancing of infectious individuals, such as travel restrictions and quarantine, is not so much effective for infectious diseases with a long latent period. We infer that the mobility of exposed individuals is also required to be reduced for diminishing the risk of an outbreak if the latent period is long.
