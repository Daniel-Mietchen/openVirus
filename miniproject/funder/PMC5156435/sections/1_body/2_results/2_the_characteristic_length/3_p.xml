<p>Next, the relationship between the corrected characteristic length and the infection process is examined. We introduce a distance 
 <italic>d</italic> that represents the maximum distance between the initial position of the initial infectious individual and the position at which an individual who was infected by a contact with the initial infectious individual changes to an infectious individual. In other words, this distance measures the strength of the spatial diffusion of the pathogens carried by individuals that are infected initially. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168127.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows that 
 <italic>d</italic> is positively correlated with the corrected characteristic length 
 <italic>l*</italic>. The line fitting indicates approximately a linear correlation between 
 <italic>l*</italic> and 
 <italic>d</italic>. Therefore, it is validated that the characteristic length 
 <italic>l*</italic> in 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0168127.e007">Eq 2</xref> plays an important role in the diffusion processes of the infection events, and thus, in the final size.
