  <title>Phylogenetic tree of the RSV-B nucleotide sequences based on the second hypervariable region (HVR2) of the G gene.</title>
  <p>The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm in MEGA 6.0 software. Bootstrap values &gt;70% are displayed at the branch nodes. Years of virus isolation are color-coded for 2012 (blue triangle), 2013 (pink diamond), 2014 (green circle), and 2015 (red square). Other genotypes consist of GB1 to GB4, SAB1 to SAB4, URU1, URU2, THB, BA1 to BA3, BA5 and BA6. The scale bar represents the number of nucleotide substitutions per site between close relatives. The number of strains are in parentheses.</p>
