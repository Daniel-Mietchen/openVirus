 <caption>
  <title>Alignment of the deduced amino acid residues encoding the second hypervariable region (HVR2) of the G protein RSV-A strains identified in this study compared to the reference A2 strain.</title>
  <p>The strain genotypes (NA1, ON1, and NA3) are indicated on the right (brackets). The number of additional strains with identical sequence as shown is indicated in parentheses to the right of the strain name. The presence of potential N-linked glycosylation sites are shaded. Asterisks indicate the positions of stop codons. Dots indicate identical residues. Tildes indicate missing residues.</p>
