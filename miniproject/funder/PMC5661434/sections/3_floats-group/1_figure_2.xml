  <title>Phylogenetic tree of RSV-A based on the partial nucleotide sequences of the second hypervariable region (HVR2) of the G gene.</title>
  <p>The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm in MEGA 6.0 software. Only bootstrap values &gt;70% are displayed at the branch nodes. Years of virus isolation are color-coded for 2012 (blue triangle), 2013 (pink diamond), 2014 (green circle), and 2015 (red square). Other genotypes consist of GA1 to GA7, SAA1, NA2 and NA4. The scale bar represents the number of nucleotide substitutions per site between close relatives. The number of strains are in parentheses.</p>
