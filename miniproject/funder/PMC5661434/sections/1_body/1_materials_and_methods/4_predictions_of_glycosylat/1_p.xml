<p>Deduced amino acid sequences for the partial G gene HVR2 were analyzed for potential N-linked glycosylation sites using the online tool NetNGlyc version 4.0 (

Tests for positive selection were conducted using single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed-effects likelihood (FEL), internal fixed-effects likelihood (IFEL), and random-effects likelihood (REL) models on the Datamonkey server (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.datamonkey.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.datamonkey.org/</ext-link>), with the ratio of divergence at nonsynonymous and synonymous sites (dN/dS) calculated using the SLAC model. To avoid an excessive false-positive rate, sites with SLAC, FEL and IFEL 
 <italic>p</italic>-values of &lt;0.1 were accepted as under positive selection. Sites with REL Bayesian factors of &gt;50 were also accepted as positively selected sites.
