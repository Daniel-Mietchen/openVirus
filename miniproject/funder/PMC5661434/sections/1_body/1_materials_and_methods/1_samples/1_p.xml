<p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University (IRB 609/59). The need for consent was waived by the IRB since this study involved the use of anonymous residual specimens. In all, 3,306 archived and convenient specimens from January 2012 to December 2015 previously subjected to routine respiratory viral screening in our laboratory were tested for the presence of RSV. These samples comprised nasopharyngeal aspirates, nasal swabs, and throat swabs from individuals ≤5 years of age (mean age 2.4 years, male-to-female ratio of 1 to 0.8). Patients presented influenza-like illness (defined as the presence of body temperature &gt;38 °C and respiratory tract symptoms such as runny nose, cough, sore throat, and difficulty breathing) or were diagnosed with probable RSV infection by the physicians. Samples were from Bangkok (
