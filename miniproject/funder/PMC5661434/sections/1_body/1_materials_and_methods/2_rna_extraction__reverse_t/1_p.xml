<p>RNA was extracted using the Viral Nucleic Acid Extraction Kit (RBC Bio-science) and cDNA synthesized using an ImProm-II Reverse Transcription System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, RNA and random hexamer primers were incubated at 70 °C for 5 min, followed by extension for 2 h at 42 °C and inactivation at 70 °C for 15 min. The amplification of the partial G (inclusive of the HVR2) and F genes was performed using semi-nested PCR as previously described (
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Auksornkitti et al., 2014</xref>). First-round amplification involved initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 20 s, annealing at 55 °C for 20 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 90 s; and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Identical amplification parameters were carried out in the second-round PCR for 30 cycles. The PCR amplicons (approximately 840 bp for RSV-A and 720 bp for RSV-B) were visualized by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and purified PCR products were sequenced.
