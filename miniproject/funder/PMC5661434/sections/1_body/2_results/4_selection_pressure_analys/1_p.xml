<p>The high substitute rate typically seen in the genes encoding viral surface glycoproteins led us to analyze possible selective pressure on the G gene. Using the SLAC model, we found that the overall dN/dS ratios for NA1, ON1, and BA9 were 1.13, 1.11, and 0.65, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-2">Table 2</xref>). Four residues (233, 274, 298, and 314) of ON1 were under selection. Among these, the strongly site-specific P274L and L298P substitutions were identified in at least three selection models. Amino acid position 237 of NA1 and position 244 of BA9 were also likely under positive selection pressure, but these sites were identified only by single selection models.
