<p>The predicted amino acid sequences of RSV-A strains obtained in this study corresponded to residue position 212â€“298 (based on A2 reference strain numbering). As expected, amino acid alignment revealed that all ON1 possessed 24-residue insertion, of which 23 residues are duplication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4">Fig. 4</xref>). Potential N-linked glycosylation site appeared most conserved at N237 among all ON1 (100%, 68/68) and less so for N318 (94.1%, 64/68), but was absent at N251 and N273. Although most (87.5%, 42/48) NA1 strains lost the N237 site due to N237D/Y/G substitution, the majority (62.5%, 30/48) also gained an additional potential glycosylation site at N318. It is noteworthy that NA1 in general possessed either the glycosylation site at N237 or N273, but not both. The lone NA3 identified in this study possessed glycosylation sites at positions N237, N251, and N273.
