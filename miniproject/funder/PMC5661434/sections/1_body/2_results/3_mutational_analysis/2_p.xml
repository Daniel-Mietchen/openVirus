<p>Alignment of RSV-B amino acid sequence with the reference strain B1 revealed an insertion of 20 residues characteristic for the BA genotypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5</xref>). Two potential N-linked glycosylation sites, N296 and N310 (based on B1 numbering), were well-conserved in BA9 and BA10, but not BA-C due to T312Y/N substitution. A gain of glycosylation site at N253 was seen in some BA9 strains (TH_CU/B12563/2015 and TH_CU/C5157/2014).
