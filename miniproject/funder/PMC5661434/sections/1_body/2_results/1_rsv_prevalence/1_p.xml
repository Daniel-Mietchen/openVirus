<p>In this study, RSV was identified in 8.4% (277/3,306) of all samples tested, of which 57.4% (159/277) were RSV-A and 42.6% (118/277) were RSV-B (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1">Table 1</xref>). Cyclical pattern was reflected by the predominance of RSV-A in 2012, RSV-B in 2013 and 2014, and the subsequent return of RSV-A predominance in 2015. Co-infection with RSV-A and RSV-B was extremely rare (0.4%, 1/277). RSV infection appeared to peak in the rainy months of July to November with the highest incidence (32%, 24/75) in October 2014 (
