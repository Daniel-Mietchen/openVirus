<p>For RSV-A, we found an equally high degree of intra-genotype diversity between NA1 and ON1 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2">Table S1</xref>). The 
 <italic>p</italic>-distances within the NA1 and ON1 genotypes ranged from 0.003 to 0.06 (mean = 0.03). In contrast, the inter-genotype 
 <italic>p</italic>-distance between the ON1 and NA1 was lower (0.050), consistent with their close genetic relatedness. For RSV-B, the 
 <italic>p</italic>-distance among the BA10 strains was 0.010. However, diversity among the BA9 strains was higher (
 <italic>p</italic>-distances ranged from 0 to 0.067). BA9 and BA10 were more closely related to one another (
 <italic>p</italic>-distance of 0.062) than to BA-C (
 <italic>p</italic>-distances of 0.090 and 0.080, respectively).
