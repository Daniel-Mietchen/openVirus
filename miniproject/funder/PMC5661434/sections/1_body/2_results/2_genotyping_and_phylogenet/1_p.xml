<p>Analysis of the partial G gene sequence showed that 41% (48/117) of RSV-A were genotype NA1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2">Fig. 2</xref>). This genotype was predominant in 2012, but was relatively absent thereafter. An additional 58.1% (68/117) of RSV-A were ON1, which co-circulated with NA1 in 2012 and remained the only RSV-A genotype detected from 2013 onward. Only one sample was NA3, which appeared in 2012. For RSV-B, most were BA9 (92.6%, 87/94) (
