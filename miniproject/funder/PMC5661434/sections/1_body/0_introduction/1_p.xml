<p>Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe respiratory infections in infants and young children (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Nair et al., 2010</xref>). Although RSV infections in healthy adults are generally limited to the upper respiratory tract, symptoms in infants and children include wheezing, cough, bronchiolitis and pneumonia (

 <italic>Orthopneumovirus</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Afonso et al., 2016</xref>). It has a single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome of approximately 15.2 kb, which encodes 11 viral proteins (
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Collins, Fearns &amp; Graham, 2013</xref>). The viral envelope glycoproteins G and F are important for the receptor attachment and viral fusion with the target cell, respectively. Both surface glycoproteins can induce the host immune response (
