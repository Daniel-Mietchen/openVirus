<p>Within the past decade, a new genotype of RSV-A identified in Ontario, Canada (ON1) has emerged (
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Eshaghi et al., 2012</xref>). This genotype is characterized by a 72-nucleotide duplication in the HVR2. ON1 has since been detected in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas (

 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Valley-Omar et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Pierangeli et al., 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, an RSV-B genotype identified in Buenos Aires, Argentina (BA) similarly contained a 60-nucleotide duplication in the HVR2 (
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Trento et al., 2003</xref>). BA has subsequently became so prevalent globally that it largely replaced other RSV-B genotypes (
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Trento et al., 2010</xref>). Gene insertion seen in both RSV-A and RSV-B HVR2 may have affected the antigenicity of the G protein and enabled viral escape from the host immunity, thus mediating their predominance in recent years.
