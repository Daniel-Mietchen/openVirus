<p>Due to the lack of antivirals or approved vaccines for RSV (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Graham &amp; Anderson, 2013</xref>), epidemiological surveillance studies are crucial in understanding RSV transmission and spread. Our previous study described the molecular epidemiology of RSV strains in circulation in Thailand between 2010 and 2011 (
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Auksornkitti et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we characterize recent incidence of RSV infection in Thailand from 2012 to 2015 and examined how the G gene of the circulating strains of RSV are changing, which may explain the persistence of RSV circulation in this region.
