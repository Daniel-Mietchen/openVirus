<p>In our study, RSV-A (57.4%) occurred more frequently than RSV-B and this observation is consistent with previous reports from other countries (

 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Pretorius et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Esposito et al., 2015</xref>). Several studies including ours have reported alternating epidemics of RSV-A and RSV-B over time (

 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Ohno et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Gilca et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Zlateva et al., 2007</xref>). This is not surprising since multiple genotypes of RSV-A and RSV-B are known to co-circulate in a single season and emerging genotypes may replace previously predominant ones in subsequent years (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Pretorius et al., 2013</xref>). It is hypothesized that the periodic shifts in the predominant RSV subgroup are driven by the dynamics of population immunity and subgroup-specific herd immunity (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Botosso et al., 2009</xref>), whichis analogous to periodic lineage shifts of the influenza B virus over time (
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Tewawong et al., 2017</xref>). Although co-infections by both RSV-A and RSV-B have previously been described in multiple regions (
 <xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Esposito et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Parveen et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Kouni et al., 2013</xref>), it was relatively rare in our study.
