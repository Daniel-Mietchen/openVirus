<p>The muti-year study to investigate the prevalence and genetic diversity of RSV circulating in Thailand was undertaken because of the relative lack of recent prevalence data on RSV infection in this region. The overall frequency of RSV (8.4%) found in respiratory samples in this study was similar to the rates from previous studies in Thailand of 8.1% to 8.9% (

 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Ohno et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Malasao et al., 2015</xref>), Vietnam (23%) (

 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Simões et al., 2011</xref>), and Malaysia (18.4%) (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2002</xref>). A recent single hospital study in Laos identified RSV in as many as 41% of infected children (

Unfortunately, objective comparison of the true regional prevalence of RSV is often hindered by the differences in the RSV detection rates largely due to sample size and the period of surveillance among these studies. Nevertheless, it is clear that RSV infection contributes to a significant portion of respiratory tract infection among young children.
