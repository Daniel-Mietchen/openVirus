<p>We also perform phylogenetic inference with MrBayes 3.2.6 [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] using default parameters, under the assumption that nucleotide evolution follows the GTR + I + Γ(4) model. MrBayes uses the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm [

 <italic>Metropolis-coupled MCMC</italic>, or (MC)
 <sup>3</sup>[
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], algorithm, to generate estimates for the posterior distribution of phylogenetic parameters. The MCMC algorithm lets us obtain samples from the posterior distributions of interest. It starts off by setting all parameters at an arbitrary value. Then, in each iteration, updates to parameter values are proposed, conditional on their current values. Each proposal is randomly accepted with probability equal to the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) ratio, producing a move in the parameter space; else, no move is recorded. After a large number of iterations, parameter values generated throughout the chain are used to empirically estimate the posteriors. We run three million iterations, burning in the first 50% and sampling one iteration out of 500. We derive the majority rule consensus tree from the remaining 3,000 trees, and produce chain estimates by identifying clades with posterior probability support of 1.0. We picked this requirement because it is, by far, the most commonly encountered in the HIV clustering literature, e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Studies that use posterior probability requirements under 1.0 are fairly rare [

 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Since the majority rule consensus tree does not have branch lengths, we use the ClusterPicker algorithm to obtain chain estimates, under all distance requirements stated earlier. We therefore produce five additional partitions.
