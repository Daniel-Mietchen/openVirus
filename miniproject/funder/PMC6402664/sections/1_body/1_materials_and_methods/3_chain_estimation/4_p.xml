<p>The Gap Procedure is a pure distance-based partitioning algorithm that avoids reliance on ad hoc cutpoints by separating sets of sequences into distinctive components without requiring phylogenetic estimation [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. When the true chains are compact and separable enough, the Gap Procedure can propose partitions that largely agree with conventional phylogenetic estimates, but in a fraction of the time normally required for such analyses, thus making the method ideal for handling large datasets. For example, in an analysis presented in [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], partitioning a dataset comprising 627 sequences of length 810 took 126 hours with MrBayes and less than a second with the Gap Procedure. The method takes as sole input a matrix of
