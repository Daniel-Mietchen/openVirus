<p>DM-PhyClus is a Bayesian phylogenetic algorithm that estimates transmission chains by identifying disjoint sets of sequences supported by subtrees with distinctive branch length distributions. It therefore avoids patristic distance and clade support requirements [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Conditional on an input phylogeny—the maximum likelihood estimate in this study—it uses MCMC to produce an estimate of the posterior distribution of chain membership indices. As a result, it also provides a straightforward measure of uncertainty for chain membership indices, in the form of co-clustering frequencies across the MCMC run. It requires specification of a number of other priors and evolutionary parameters, which we list in Supplementary Material S4. We perform 220,000 iterations, discarding the first 20,000 as a burn-in and applying a thinning ratio of 1 over 200, leaving us with a sample of size 1,000. We identify the partition that maximises the joint posterior probability score, which we refer to as the Maximum Posterior probability (MAP) estimate. We also derived the so-called 
 <italic>linkage estimate</italic> from the MCMC run results [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To obtain the linkage estimate, we first derive an 
 <italic>adjacency matrix</italic> from each partition visited in the mcmc run. The adjacency matrix is a square matrix with entry (
 <italic>i</italic>, 
 <italic>j</italic>) taking value 1 if sequences 
 <italic>i</italic> and 
 <italic>j</italic> are in the same transmission chain, and 0 otherwise. We then compute a mean of all the obtained matrices, and round up to 1 all elements above a pre-specified threshold, e.g. 0.7, and down to 0 all the others. We consider the resulting matrix a representation of an undirected unweighted network. The distinct components, called 
 <italic>modules</italic>, it contains form the linkage estimate. We present a more detailed description in Supplementary Material S5.
