<p>We present a brief review of phylogenetic concepts in Supplementary Material S1. We obtain the maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic estimate [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with RAxML 8.2.10 [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], under the assumption that nucleotide evolution follows the GTR + I + Γ(5) model. We produce 1,000 bootstrap trees, and use them to evaluate confidence in the clades found in the estimated ML phylogeny. To obtain estimates of transmission chains, we separately consider 15 combinations of bootstrap support and genetic distance requirements. More specifically, we first apply a bootstrap support requirement of either 70%, 90%, or 95%. We then consider a distance requirement of either 1.5%, 3.0%, 4.5%, or one corresponding to the 15th or 30th percentile of the maximum likelihood tree’s patristic distance distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We apply the genetic distance criterion in one of three ways: we use, in turns, the maximum within-chain 
 <italic>p</italic>-distance requirement of ClusterPicker [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the maximum median within-chain patristic distance requirement of PhyloPart [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the maximum within-chain patristic distance requirement found in [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For the PhyloPart analysis, we consider a combination of the bootstrap requirements listed before, but, per guidelines in [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], only the two distance cutpoints based on percentiles of patristic distances.
