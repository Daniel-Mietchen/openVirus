<p>The Quebec HIV genotyping program database, operational since 2002, includes HIV pol sequences from all genotyped persons at the Jewish General Hospital (site supervisor: Bluma Brenner) and HÃ´pital Notre-Dame (site supervisor: Michel Roger) genotyping sites. All blood samples, sequences, and medical records at the two testing sites were fully anonymized and encrypted before analysis. A unique phylogenetic identifier number was assigned for each person. It was created based on putative cluster group association, using a birthdate cross-linker to rule out repeat patient sampling. First genotypes were used in those analyses. The database can still include multiple sequences for certain patients, in which case letters are appended to the identifier to indicate collection order, e.g. C001-001a, C001-001b. The putative clusters were subjected to BLAST, to ensure that transmissions were local.</p>
