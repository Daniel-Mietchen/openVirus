<p>We wish to retain only one chain estimate per method used, and must therefore select a “best” partition among those proposed. Prior to the analyses, clinicians involved in the Quebec HIV genotyping program had performed a preliminary partitioning of the dataset. The partition they proposed results from successive updates, performed at different points in time, of an initial set of transmission chains. They inferred the initial set by imposing very stringent bootstrap support (≥ 98%) and maximum within-chain patristic distance requirements (&lt; 0.015 nt/bp) [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Such conservative thresholds are meant to ensure that any two sequences found to co-cluster indeed belong to the same transmission chain. In the following updates, once a sequence is attributed to a chain, it cannot be re-attributed to another chain. They identified from the results seven noteworthy chains comprising 372 sequences in total, which we use as a reference [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One of those chains, for instance, has 68 sequences, among which more than half harbour the Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTI) mutation K103N. We compare all partitions we obtain with that reference using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), a measure of similarity between two partitions, with the aim of maximising overlap. Greater ARI values are better, and the measure is bounded above by 1, indicating perfect correspondence. We describe the comparison scheme in more details in Supplementary Material S2.
