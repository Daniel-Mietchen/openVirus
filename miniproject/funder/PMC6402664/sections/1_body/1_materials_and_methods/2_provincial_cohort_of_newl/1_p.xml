<p>Among the entries in the Quebec HIV genotyping program database [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we first retain 3,916 subtype B sequences, each obtained from a different individual classified as MSM. Sequences include 918 sites located in the 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene: positions 10-297 of the protease region (PR), and 112-741 of the reverse transcriptase (RT) region. All sequences were collected between May 3rd, 1996 and February 1st, 2016. When multiple sequences were available for a single individual, we selected the one with the earliest sampling date. Sequences come with a time stamp, indicating when the blood sample was collected, and an indicator of infection status, either chronic treated, chronic untreated, or Primary HIV Infection (PHI). A case is considered a PHI if the sequence was obtained less than six months after seroconversion [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A physician was responsible for the assessment of PHI status, based on serologic testing algorithms for recent HIV infection [
