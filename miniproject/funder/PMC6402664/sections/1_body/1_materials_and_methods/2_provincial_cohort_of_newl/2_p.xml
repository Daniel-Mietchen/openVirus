<p>Genotypic drug resistance testing is standard of care for all persons diagnosed with HIV, and test requisition forms identify all newly-diagnosed or treatment-na√Øve persons. All newly-diagnosed persons are genotyped prior to treatment onset and so, do not have acquired resistance. The database included 212 sequences from chronic treated persons or persons with missing infection status, which we exclude to prevent artefacts in clustering due to selective pressure induced by treatment. Transmitted resistance on the other hand is limited to only a few single point mutations, K103N and G190A for example. Past analyses of a previous version of the database [

 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have revealed that chain membership estimation was not affected by their inclusion. We are left with 3,704 sequences, of which 1,401 were sampled from individuals in the PHI stage. Finally, for rooting purposes, we add to those 3,704 sequences three subtype A outgroup sequences from Zambia [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (NCBI accession numbers AB254141, AB254142, AB254143), and it follows that the dataset we consider includes 3,707 sequences in total. Subtype A sequences are sufficiently different from subtype B sequences to make appropriate outgroups. As well as allowing root placement, they serve as a crude check of inference quality. Indeed, any phylogeny in which subtype A sequences are placed inside subtype B transmission chains would be discarded outright.
