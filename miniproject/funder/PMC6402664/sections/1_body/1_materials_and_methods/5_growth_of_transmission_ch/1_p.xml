<p>To evaluate the growth of transmission chains, ideally, we would need to know seroconversion dates for all cases whose sequences were sampled. Indeed, it is not enough to infer that a sequence belongs to a known chain: it might be that the infection event happened a long time ago, but was only diagnosed recently. In that situation, the chain did not actually expand: we are merely observing the effects of an increase in the sampling rate. This is a common problem in transmission chain inference [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The dataset contains an infection stage indicator, equivalent to a censored estimate of infection time, i.e. smaller (greater or equal) than six months prior to the sampling date for PHIs (chronic cases). Since HIV genetic diversity is low in newly-infected individuals [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we can more accurately associate PHIs to the different chains. Most HIV-positive individuals are diagnosed while already in the chronic stage, at which point seroconversion date estimates are very imprecise [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As a result, we decide to use PHIs only to obtain a lower bound estimate for the growth of inferred chains, since infection dates for PHIs can be placed reliably within a short time window prior to sampling. We focus on a period ranging from January 1, 2012 to February 1, 2016. For example, one of the methods may propose a chain of size 20, with eight of its sequences having been obtained from cases diagnosed while in the PHI stage at some point in 2014. We can therefore be certain that those cases were infected after January 1, 2012 and so, we conclude that the chain has accrued at least eight new cases in the selected period.
