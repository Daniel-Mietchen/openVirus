<p>We represent the 30 longest chains, according to the 
 <italic>ML + PhyloPart</italic> estimate, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213366.g002">Fig 2</xref>. The labels on the 
 <italic>y</italic> axis are based on transmission chains described in [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. When we found a chain with members from more than one such chain, we created a new label by concatenating the numbers of the two largest chains, under the condition that the second largest was not a singleton. Those 30 chains include 126 recent PHIs, split between 22 chains. Among the ten longest chains, nine include at least one recent PHI. The longest chain includes 12 recent PHIs, while the second and third include 26 and two, respectively. Chain C185 is noteworthy: despite its smaller length prior to 2012, it has grown quickly, with the addition of 22 recent PHI. Chain C067, on the other hand, is still short, but had not been recorded before 2012. Each of those two chains has a PHI recorded as late as the second half of 2015, indicating that they may still be expanding. The partition produced by DM-PhyClus + MAP is different, but leads to similar conclusions, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213366.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Of the 30 longest chains, 20 include at least one recent PHI. We note that the longest chain includes sequences from transmission chain C163; other methods found instead that the longest chain comprised sequences from chain C050, which DM-PhyClus split up. Other conventional estimates, the Gap Procedure, and DM-PhyClus + Linkage lead to similar conclusions, as can be seen in Supplementary Material S6. The split of C099 in the DM-PhyClus estimate is also meaningful, as it reflects successive waves of infections. All sequences in C099(01) are from a wild-type virus. In C099(2), 36 out of 43 sequences harbour transmitted drug-resistance mutation K103N, four out of 43 harbour mutation V106I, and finally, only three out of 43 are from a wild-type virus.
