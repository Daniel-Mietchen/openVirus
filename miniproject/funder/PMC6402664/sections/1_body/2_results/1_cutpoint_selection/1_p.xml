<p>The 15th and 30th percentiles of the maximum likelihood treeâ€™s patristic distance distribution are equal to 6.8% and 7.7%, respectively. In all maximum likelihood analyses, the bootstrap support requirement of 70% resulted in greater overlap with the reference. Under the maximum patristic distance scheme of [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we found that a distance requirement of 7.7% maximised the correspondence (ARI = 0.91). With ClusterPicker, requirements of either 6.8% or 7.7% were preferable (ARI = 0.91). In PhyloPart, a median within-chain patristic distance requirement of 0.03 resulted in the largest overlap with the reference (ARI = 0.98). Finally, in the Bayesian analysis, in addition to a posterior probability requirement of 1, we determined that a 6.8% or 7.7% requirement for maximum within-chain 
 <italic>p</italic>-distances were equivalent (ARI = 0.91). In cases where several distance requirements were equivalent, we picked the smallest one.
