<p>The second largest block, marked “2” in the figure, comprises 88 sequences, 87 of which co-clustered in the reference set. Its sequences were sampled between May 11st, 2004 (chronic untreated) and December 14, 2015 (PHI), which highlights its durability. Of its 3,828 pairs of sequences, 2,932 were found to be in the same chain by all methods, and 395, by five of the seven methods. The block marked “3” also stands out. Among its 71 sequences, 68 were found in the same reference chain. Its first sequence (PHI) was collected on August 13th, 2002 and its last (chronic untreated), on March 28th, 2015. Of its 2,415 unique pairs of sequences, 1,066 were found to co-cluster by all methods, and 1,280, by five of the seven methods.</p>
