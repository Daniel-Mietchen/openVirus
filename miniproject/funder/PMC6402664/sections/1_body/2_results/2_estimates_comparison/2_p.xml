<p>We depict in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213366.g001">Fig 1</xref> the correspondence between the seven partitions we computed. Each square in the heat map is made up of a large number of pixels, each pixel indicating the number of methods that produced partitions attributing to the same chain the sequences labelled by the 
 <italic>x</italic> and 
 <italic>y</italic> axes. In other words, for any two distinct sequences, we counted how many of the seven estimates had them in the same chain: this is what the graph represents. We only show the 2,938 sequences found to co-cluster with at least one other sequence by at least one of the methods. The graph reveals several moderately-sized chains. The largest rectangle, marked “1” in the figure, includes 126 sequences, 124 of which belonged to the same reference chain. The earliest sequence in the block, a PHI, was collected on August 13th, 2002, and the latest, also a PHI, on December 23rd, 2015, which suggests the chain might still be expanding. The MAP and linkage estimates of DM-PhyClus, on the other hand, split this block into 14 components, including three chains of size 37, 36, and 14, respectively, and 7 singletons.
