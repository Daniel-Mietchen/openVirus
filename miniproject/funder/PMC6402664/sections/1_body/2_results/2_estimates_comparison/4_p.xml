 <xref rid="pone.0213366.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> provides summary statistics for the inferred chains. The four conventional methods produced chain length distributions with similar characteristics. We found that ML + PhyloPart and DM-PhyClus + Linkage had the highest proportions of singletons, with approximately 36% of sequences not co-clustering with any other sequence. Further, DM-PhyClus did not identify the size 126 transmission chain found by the other methods, as we had noted when we commented on block 1 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213366.g001">Fig 1</xref>. On the other hand, the Gap Procedure and the conventional Bayesian estimate had the fewest singletons. The Gap Procedure estimate, however, contained many more transmission pairs.
