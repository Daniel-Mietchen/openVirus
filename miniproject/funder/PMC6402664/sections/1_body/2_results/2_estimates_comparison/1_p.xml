<p>We first compare optimal partitions from all methods with the ARI, cf. 
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. As expected, the DM-PhyClus linkage and MAP estimates are very similar (ARI = 0.99). Besides those, we observed the largest overlap between the partitions resulting from the 
 <italic>ML + ClusterPicker</italic> and 
 <italic>MrBayes + ClusterPicker</italic> methods (ARI = 0.94). DM-PhyClus produced the most distinctive partition, producing overlap with other methods ranging from 0.64 and 0.72. The larger correspondence with the Gap Procedure estimate is not surprising, since both methods look for chains that are well separated.
