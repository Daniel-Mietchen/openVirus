<p>The existence of long transmission chains is not only a feature of transmission of HIV-1 among MSMs in Montreal: it has been observed across Europe and other regions of North America as well [

The increasing size of sequence databases represents a considerable computational challenge, especially in the Bayesian framework, and so, scalability should be an essential feature of future partitioning algorithms. We contend that methods that avoid cutpoint selection altogether are promising, and would benefit from further improvements. In addition to lightening their computational burden, adapting them to use time-stamp and covariate data, for example, would be a welcome extension. Further, methods designed to provide a clear measure of uncertainty for estimated partitions, like DM-PhyClus, would warrant more attention. Indeed, the strength of co-clustering between sequences within an inferred chain may vary sizeably, and the separation between some chains may not be very clear-cut. Such variability may be hard to measure rigorously under conventional phylogenetic partitioning approaches.
