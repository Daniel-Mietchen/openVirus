<p>Determining which partition among the six proposed provides the most accurate representation of transmission chains in the sample is difficult. The choice depends ultimately on our confidence in the assumptions of each approach, and on substantive knowledge. The agreement between estimates from the conventional approaches, although explained in great part by shared assumptions, is still a good sign. The moderately different partitions proposed by the Gap Procedure and DM-PhyClus are not erroneous: they result from the way the two methods define a partition of interest. The two approaches also have additional aims and benefits. [
