<p>Because of the non-random sampling of cases, we cannot readily deduce from our estimates the population-level chain length distribution. In the absence of covariate information, we cannot model the sampling process. If, for example, the probability for a case to be sampled correlates positively with chain length, we might end up underestimating the length of shorter chains and the number of singletons, and consequently, overestimating the contribution of the chains we found to the epidemic. Nevertheless, the results we presented provide good evidence of chain growth, and that phenomenon alone warrants attention.</p>
