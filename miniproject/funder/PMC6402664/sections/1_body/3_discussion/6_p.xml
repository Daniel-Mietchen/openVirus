<p>Reliable infection date estimates for cases diagnosed while in the chronic stage are unavailable and so, we could only obtain a lower bound for chain growth between January 1st, 2012 and February 1st, 2016. Time between seroconversion and diagnosis can go from months to years, depending on an individual’s testing habits, with a mean that could be above two years [

 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and it follows that several chronic cases diagnosed after June 30th, 2012 might have been infected during the selected period. Estimating infection time from the fraction of ambiguous nucleotides in each sequence would have been possible [
