<p>The study has several limitations. Cutpoint selection remains inherently subjective. In the current work, the observed similarities in the proposed choices of cutpoints were not surprising. Chain estimation based on the consensus tree obtained after running the MCMC algorithm relied on ClusterPicker, just like one of the ML-bootstrap approaches. Often, chains found through a Bayesian analysis agree substantially with those obtained through a sensibly-tuned ML-bootstrap approach [
