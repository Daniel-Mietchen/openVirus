<p>DM-PhyClus, being a Bayesian method, rests on a number of prior assumptions, which are all more or less informative, and it follows that prior calibration is key. Although estimates are reasonably robust to some prior assumptions [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], it remains possible that a combination of very poorly chosen priors may result in misleading chain estimates. Further, DM-PhyClus looks for branch length patterns hinting at the existence of transmission cascades. This study focused instead on transmission chains, which do not necessarily involve such patterns. Therefore, the assumptions underlying DM-PhyClus might not be entirely appropriate.
