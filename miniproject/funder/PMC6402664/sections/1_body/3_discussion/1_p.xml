<p>Phylogenetic analyses can help in the prioritization of public health interventions by highlighting high-risk transmission groups. Previous findings had suggested that long chains play a substantial role in sustaining HIV epidemics in the era of Treatment-as-Prevention [

 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It remains important to identify and target growing transmission chains in near real-time [
