<p>This study compared several phylogenetic approaches applied to a subset of a large HIV sequence database, representative of the molecular diversity in the HIV epidemic among MSMs in Quebec. More specifically, we looked at HIV-1 transmission chains among 3,704 HIV-1 cases belonging to the MSM risk category. We compared estimates from seven methods, four conventional approaches relying on a variety of cutpoints applied to phylogenetic estimates, and three additional recent approaches seeking to reduce reliance on cutpoints, the Gap Procedure and two variations on DM-PhyClus. We found that estimates obtained from conventional methods were overall fairly similar. The estimates from DM-PhyClus involved a noticeably different chain length distribution. All estimates however produced a similar assessment of chain growth in the period ranging from January 1st, 2012 to February 1st, 2016: nine of the ten longest chains had grown in the selected period, three of those having accrued at least ten new cases. Further, we observed emerging chains, as well as an increase in the proportion of recent PHIs belonging to chains of size 5 or more.</p>
