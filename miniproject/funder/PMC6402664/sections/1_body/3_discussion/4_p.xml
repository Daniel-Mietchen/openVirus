<p>Choosing cutpoints as to maximise overlap with a reference set does not guarantee that other chains will be estimated well. Moreover, identifying a suitable reference set can be difficult. In our study, researchers involved in the Quebec HIV genotyping program proposed the set. A different reference set might have led to different cutpoints. Several of the approaches we used did manage to recover the reference set very closely though, which suggests that it is not unrealistic.</p>
