<p>Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has been successful in substantially suppressing viremia within the diagnosed population, making late transmission of the virus a lot less common, and consequently, early transmission has been increasingly driving the epidemic [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recently-infected individuals are much more likely to transmit because of high viral load, viral homogeneity, and immature immune response, potentially leading to 
 <italic>transmission cascades</italic>, consecutive transmission events happening in a short time span [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Those cascades result in the expansion of existing chains and may point to a higher proportion of early transmissions. However, their contribution to incidence is hard to measure accurately due to their estimation being very sensitive to the sampling time of infected individuals [
