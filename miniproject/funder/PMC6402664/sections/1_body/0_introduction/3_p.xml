<p>Montreal has become a UNAIDS Fast Track City in May 2017, and the only way to reach the 90-90-90 targets [
 <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] is to drastically reduce incidence produced by long transmission chains. In other words, the aim is for 90% of all people living with HIV to be diagnosed, 90% of diagnosed individuals to receive antiretroviral therapy, and 90% of treated individuals to have viral suppression. Also, quantifying the role of early transmission in the epidemic is important from a public health standpoint, as it can help assess the extent to which programs are able to reach infected individuals early enough. This is the motivation behind the current study, in which we analyse a large sample of HIV sequences collected via the Quebec HIV genotyping program with a variety of methods, comparing estimates of growth in transmission chains to shed light on their sensitivity to modelling assumptions, thus better framing the recent transmission dynamics of the epidemic.
