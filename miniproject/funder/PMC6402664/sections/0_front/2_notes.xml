 <title>Data Availability</title>
 <p>The Qu√©bec HIV genotyping program sequences cannot be made publicly available for confidentiality reasons. An anonymised dataset of the 233 sequences from PHI cohort participants belonging to the 30 largest transmission chains is available on the Los Alamos HIV database website (GenBank accession numbers MK326905-MK327137). A representative portion of the tree had been previously published (GenBank accession numbers JF957375-JF957589). The authors state that the data available via GenBank are sufficient for verifying all of the conclusions of this study. Please consult the data-sharing statement, included with the submission, for more details.</p>
