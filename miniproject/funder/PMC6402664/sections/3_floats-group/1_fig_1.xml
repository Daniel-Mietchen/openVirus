  <title>Heat map indicating overlap between estimates produced by the seven methods considered.</title>
  <p>We excluded all sequences that were found to be singletons by the seven methods we used, leaving us with 2,938 sequences. We gave each remaining sequence a numerical label between 1 and 2,938. The colour of each pixel indicates the number of methods for which the two sequences identified by the 
   <italic>x</italic> and 
   <italic>y</italic> axes co-clustered.
