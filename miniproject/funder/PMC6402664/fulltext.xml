Assessment of chain expansion may depend on the partitioning scheme used, and so, we produce estimates from several methods: the conventional Bayesian and maximum likelihood-bootstrap methods, in combination with a variety of schemes for applying a maximum distance criterion, and two other algorithms, DM-PhyClus, a Bayesian algorithm that produces a measure of uncertainty for proposed partitions, and the Gap Procedure, a fast non-phylogenetic approach.

In Montreal, Qu&#x000e9;bec, for instance, HIV prevalence in that risk group could be as high as 13% [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Analyses of HIV genetic sequences provided by MSMs who participated in the Quebec HIV genotyping program have revealed the existence of many separate transmission chains, and suggested an association between chain length and incidence: 42% of MSMs infected between 2012 and 2015 belonged to a transmission chain comprising 20 or more known cases, compared to 13% [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] between 2004 and 2007.</p><p>Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) has been successful in substantially suppressing viremia within the diagnosed population, making late transmission of the virus a lot less common, and consequently, early transmission has been increasingly driving the epidemic [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recently-infected individuals are much more likely to transmit because of high viral load, viral homogeneity, and immature immune response, potentially leading to <italic>transmission cascades</italic>, consecutive transmission events happening in a short time span [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Those cascades result in the expansion of existing chains and may point to a higher proportion of early transmissions. However, their contribution to incidence is hard to measure accurately due to their estimation being very sensitive to the sampling time of infected individuals [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Montreal has become a UNAIDS Fast Track City in May 2017, and the only way to reach the 90-90-90 targets [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] is to drastically reduce incidence produced by long transmission chains. In other words, the aim is for 90% of all people living with HIV to be diagnosed, 90% of diagnosed individuals to receive antiretroviral therapy, and 90% of treated individuals to have viral suppression. Also, quantifying the role of early transmission in the epidemic is important from a public health standpoint, as it can help assess the extent to which programs are able to reach infected individuals early enough. This is the motivation behind the current study, in which we analyse a large sample of HIV sequences collected via the Quebec HIV genotyping program with a variety of methods, comparing estimates of growth in transmission chains to shed light on their sensitivity to modelling assumptions, thus better framing the recent transmission dynamics of the epidemic.</p><p>There is a lack of consensus as to how to best partition HIV-1 sequence data into distinct transmission chains, and different methods may produce equally valid, but conflicting results [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This paper therefore compares several up-to-date estimates of transmission chains in the HIV epidemic among MSMs in Quebec and looks into their temporal expansion, improving as a result previous assessments of the contribution of early transmission to the epidemic. More specifically, we consider the following methods:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstruction coupled with several combinations of bootstrap support and genetic distance requirements for clades, termed the <italic>ML-bootstrap</italic> approach,</p></list-item><list-item><p>Bayesian phylogenetic inference, coupled with several combinations of posterior probability support and genetic distance requirement for clades,</p></list-item><list-item><p>DM-PhyClus [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a Bayesian method that defines chains as sets of sequences supported by subtrees with distinctive branch length distributions,</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Gap Procedure [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], a non-phylogenetic distance-based approach that requires chains to be reasonably distinctive from one another.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Sequence database</title><p>The Quebec HIV genotyping program database, operational since 2002, includes HIV pol sequences from all genotyped persons at the Jewish General Hospital (site supervisor: Bluma Brenner) and H&#x000f4;pital Notre-Dame (site supervisor: Michel Roger) genotyping sites. All blood samples, sequences, and medical records at the two testing sites were fully anonymized and encrypted before analysis. A unique phylogenetic identifier number was assigned for each person. It was created based on putative cluster group association, using a birthdate cross-linker to rule out repeat patient sampling. First genotypes were used in those analyses. The database can still include multiple sequences for certain patients, in which case letters are appended to the identifier to indicate collection order, e.g. C001-001a, C001-001b. The putative clusters were subjected to BLAST, to ensure that transmissions were local.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Provincial cohort of newly-infected MSMs (2002-2016)</title><p>Among the entries in the Quebec HIV genotyping program database [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we first retain 3,916 subtype B sequences, each obtained from a different individual classified as MSM. Sequences include 918 sites located in the <italic>pol</italic> gene: positions 10-297 of the protease region (PR), and 112-741 of the reverse transcriptase (RT) region. All sequences were collected between May 3rd, 1996 and February 1st, 2016. When multiple sequences were available for a single individual, we selected the one with the earliest sampling date. Sequences come with a time stamp, indicating when the blood sample was collected, and an indicator of infection status, either chronic treated, chronic untreated, or Primary HIV Infection (PHI). A case is considered a PHI if the sequence was obtained less than six months after seroconversion [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A physician was responsible for the assessment of PHI status, based on serologic testing algorithms for recent HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Genotypic drug resistance testing is standard of care for all persons diagnosed with HIV, and test requisition forms identify all newly-diagnosed or treatment-na&#x000ef;ve persons. All newly-diagnosed persons are genotyped prior to treatment onset and so, do not have acquired resistance. The database included 212 sequences from chronic treated persons or persons with missing infection status, which we exclude to prevent artefacts in clustering due to selective pressure induced by treatment. Transmitted resistance on the other hand is limited to only a few single point mutations, K103N and G190A for example. Past analyses of a previous version of the database [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have revealed that chain membership estimation was not affected by their inclusion. We are left with 3,704 sequences, of which 1,401 were sampled from individuals in the PHI stage. Finally, for rooting purposes, we add to those 3,704 sequences three subtype A outgroup sequences from Zambia [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (NCBI accession numbers AB254141, AB254142, AB254143), and it follows that the dataset we consider includes 3,707 sequences in total. Subtype A sequences are sufficiently different from subtype B sequences to make appropriate outgroups. As well as allowing root placement, they serve as a crude check of inference quality. Indeed, any phylogeny in which subtype A sequences are placed inside subtype B transmission chains would be discarded outright.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Chain estimation</title><p>We present a brief review of phylogenetic concepts in Supplementary Material S1. We obtain the maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic estimate [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] with RAxML 8.2.10 [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], under the assumption that nucleotide evolution follows the GTR + I + &#x00393;(5) model. We produce 1,000 bootstrap trees, and use them to evaluate confidence in the clades found in the estimated ML phylogeny. To obtain estimates of transmission chains, we separately consider 15 combinations of bootstrap support and genetic distance requirements. More specifically, we first apply a bootstrap support requirement of either 70%, 90%, or 95%. We then consider a distance requirement of either 1.5%, 3.0%, 4.5%, or one corresponding to the 15th or 30th percentile of the maximum likelihood tree&#x02019;s patristic distance distribution [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We apply the genetic distance criterion in one of three ways: we use, in turns, the maximum within-chain <italic>p</italic>-distance requirement of ClusterPicker [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], the maximum median within-chain patristic distance requirement of PhyloPart [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and the maximum within-chain patristic distance requirement found in [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For the PhyloPart analysis, we consider a combination of the bootstrap requirements listed before, but, per guidelines in [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], only the two distance cutpoints based on percentiles of patristic distances.</p><p>We also perform phylogenetic inference with MrBayes 3.2.6 [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] using default parameters, under the assumption that nucleotide evolution follows the GTR + I + &#x00393;(4) model. MrBayes uses the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], more specifically the so-called <italic>Metropolis-coupled MCMC</italic>, or (MC)<sup>3</sup>[<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], algorithm, to generate estimates for the posterior distribution of phylogenetic parameters. The MCMC algorithm lets us obtain samples from the posterior distributions of interest. It starts off by setting all parameters at an arbitrary value. Then, in each iteration, updates to parameter values are proposed, conditional on their current values. Each proposal is randomly accepted with probability equal to the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) ratio, producing a move in the parameter space; else, no move is recorded. After a large number of iterations, parameter values generated throughout the chain are used to empirically estimate the posteriors. We run three million iterations, burning in the first 50% and sampling one iteration out of 500. We derive the majority rule consensus tree from the remaining 3,000 trees, and produce chain estimates by identifying clades with posterior probability support of 1.0. We picked this requirement because it is, by far, the most commonly encountered in the HIV clustering literature, e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Studies that use posterior probability requirements under 1.0 are fairly rare [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Since the majority rule consensus tree does not have branch lengths, we use the ClusterPicker algorithm to obtain chain estimates, under all distance requirements stated earlier. We therefore produce five additional partitions.</p><p>DM-PhyClus is a Bayesian phylogenetic algorithm that estimates transmission chains by identifying disjoint sets of sequences supported by subtrees with distinctive branch length distributions. It therefore avoids patristic distance and clade support requirements [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Conditional on an input phylogeny&#x02014;the maximum likelihood estimate in this study&#x02014;it uses MCMC to produce an estimate of the posterior distribution of chain membership indices. As a result, it also provides a straightforward measure of uncertainty for chain membership indices, in the form of co-clustering frequencies across the MCMC run. It requires specification of a number of other priors and evolutionary parameters, which we list in Supplementary Material S4. We perform 220,000 iterations, discarding the first 20,000 as a burn-in and applying a thinning ratio of 1 over 200, leaving us with a sample of size 1,000. We identify the partition that maximises the joint posterior probability score, which we refer to as the Maximum Posterior probability (MAP) estimate. We also derived the so-called <italic>linkage estimate</italic> from the MCMC run results [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. To obtain the linkage estimate, we first derive an <italic>adjacency matrix</italic> from each partition visited in the mcmc run. The adjacency matrix is a square matrix with entry (<italic>i</italic>, <italic>j</italic>) taking value 1 if sequences <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> are in the same transmission chain, and 0 otherwise. We then compute a mean of all the obtained matrices, and round up to 1 all elements above a pre-specified threshold, e.g. 0.7, and down to 0 all the others. We consider the resulting matrix a representation of an undirected unweighted network. The distinct components, called <italic>modules</italic>, it contains form the linkage estimate. We present a more detailed description in Supplementary Material S5.</p><p>The Gap Procedure is a pure distance-based partitioning algorithm that avoids reliance on ad hoc cutpoints by separating sets of sequences into distinctive components without requiring phylogenetic estimation [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. When the true chains are compact and separable enough, the Gap Procedure can propose partitions that largely agree with conventional phylogenetic estimates, but in a fraction of the time normally required for such analyses, thus making the method ideal for handling large datasets. For example, in an analysis presented in [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], partitioning a dataset comprising 627 sequences of length 810 took 126 hours with MrBayes and less than a second with the Gap Procedure. The method takes as sole input a matrix of <italic>p</italic>-distances, which we obtain under the Kimura 1980 (K80) model. We leave tuning parameters at their default values.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Cutpoint selection for the conventional maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods</title><p>We wish to retain only one chain estimate per method used, and must therefore select a &#x0201c;best&#x0201d; partition among those proposed. Prior to the analyses, clinicians involved in the Quebec HIV genotyping program had performed a preliminary partitioning of the dataset. The partition they proposed results from successive updates, performed at different points in time, of an initial set of transmission chains. They inferred the initial set by imposing very stringent bootstrap support (&#x02265; 98%) and maximum within-chain patristic distance requirements (&#x0003c; 0.015 nt/bp) [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Such conservative thresholds are meant to ensure that any two sequences found to co-cluster indeed belong to the same transmission chain. In the following updates, once a sequence is attributed to a chain, it cannot be re-attributed to another chain. They identified from the results seven noteworthy chains comprising 372 sequences in total, which we use as a reference [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One of those chains, for instance, has 68 sequences, among which more than half harbour the Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NNRTI) mutation K103N. We compare all partitions we obtain with that reference using the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), a measure of similarity between two partitions, with the aim of maximising overlap. Greater ARI values are better, and the measure is bounded above by 1, indicating perfect correspondence. We describe the comparison scheme in more details in Supplementary Material S2.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Growth of transmission chains</title><p>To evaluate the growth of transmission chains, ideally, we would need to know seroconversion dates for all cases whose sequences were sampled. Indeed, it is not enough to infer that a sequence belongs to a known chain: it might be that the infection event happened a long time ago, but was only diagnosed recently. In that situation, the chain did not actually expand: we are merely observing the effects of an increase in the sampling rate. This is a common problem in transmission chain inference [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The dataset contains an infection stage indicator, equivalent to a censored estimate of infection time, i.e. smaller (greater or equal) than six months prior to the sampling date for PHIs (chronic cases). Since HIV genetic diversity is low in newly-infected individuals [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we can more accurately associate PHIs to the different chains. Most HIV-positive individuals are diagnosed while already in the chronic stage, at which point seroconversion date estimates are very imprecise [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As a result, we decide to use PHIs only to obtain a lower bound estimate for the growth of inferred chains, since infection dates for PHIs can be placed reliably within a short time window prior to sampling. We focus on a period ranging from January 1, 2012 to February 1, 2016. For example, one of the methods may propose a chain of size 20, with eight of its sequences having been obtained from cases diagnosed while in the PHI stage at some point in 2014. We can therefore be certain that those cases were infected after January 1, 2012 and so, we conclude that the chain has accrued at least eight new cases in the selected period.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Software</title><p>We import phylogenetic estimates from RAxML or MrBayes into R v3.2.3 and produce partitions of the data with custom functions built with the help of the <italic>phangorn</italic> and <italic>ape</italic> libraries [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].

Under the maximum patristic distance scheme of [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we found that a distance requirement of 7.7% maximised the correspondence (ARI = 0.91). With ClusterPicker, requirements of either 6.8% or 7.7% were preferable (ARI = 0.91). In PhyloPart, a median within-chain patristic distance requirement of 0.03 resulted in the largest overlap with the reference (ARI = 0.98). Finally, in the Bayesian analysis, in addition to a posterior probability requirement of 1, we determined that a 6.8% or 7.7% requirement for maximum within-chain <italic>p</italic>-distances were equivalent (ARI = 0.91).

We note that the longest chain includes sequences from transmission chain C163; other methods found instead that the longest chain comprised sequences from chain C050, which DM-PhyClus split up. Other conventional estimates, the Gap Procedure, and DM-PhyClus + Linkage lead to similar conclusions, as can be seen in Supplementary Material S6. The split of C099 in the DM-PhyClus estimate is also meaningful, as it reflects successive waves of infections. All sequences in C099(01) are from a wild-type virus. In C099(2), 36 out of 43 sequences harbour transmitted drug-resistance mutation K103N, four out of 43 harbour mutation V106I, and finally, only three out of 43 are from a wild-type virus.</p><fig id="pone.0213366.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0213366.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Bar plot showing the breakdown in membership for the 30 longest chains in the ML + PhyloPart estimate.</title><p>The labels at the end of each bar indicate the sequence collection dates for the first and last &#x0201c;recent&#x0201d; PHIs in the chain, that is, recorded on or after July 1st, 2012.

Previous findings had suggested that long chains play a substantial role in sustaining HIV epidemics in the era of Treatment-as-Prevention [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In Quebec, people belonging to long chains are mostly MSMs, younger, and concentrated in the greater Montreal area [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Viral species found in long chains may be characterised by improved replicative fitness and the ability to overcome transmission barriers [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Moreover, poor testing habits may exacerbate the persistence of long chains [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It remains important to identify and target growing transmission chains in near real-time [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>This study compared several phylogenetic approaches applied to a subset of a large HIV sequence database, representative of the molecular diversity in the HIV epidemic among MSMs in Quebec. More specifically, we looked at HIV-1 transmission chains among 3,704 HIV-1 cases belonging to the MSM risk category. We compared estimates from seven methods, four conventional approaches relying on a variety of cutpoints applied to phylogenetic estimates, and three additional recent approaches seeking to reduce reliance on cutpoints, the Gap Procedure and two variations on DM-PhyClus. We found that estimates obtained from conventional methods were overall fairly similar. The estimates from DM-PhyClus involved a noticeably different chain length distribution. All estimates however produced a similar assessment of chain growth in the period ranging from January 1st, 2012 to February 1st, 2016: nine of the ten longest chains had grown in the selected period, three of those having accrued at least ten new cases. Further, we observed emerging chains, as well as an increase in the proportion of recent PHIs belonging to chains of size 5 or more.</p><p>The study has several limitations. Cutpoint selection remains inherently subjective. In the current work, the observed similarities in the proposed choices of cutpoints were not surprising. Chain estimation based on the consensus tree obtained after running the MCMC algorithm relied on ClusterPicker, just like one of the ML-bootstrap approaches. Often, chains found through a Bayesian analysis agree substantially with those obtained through a sensibly-tuned ML-bootstrap approach [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Also, ClusterPicker uses maximum within-chain <italic>p</italic>-distances, which provide a rough approximation of patristic distances. It follows that tuning ClusterPicker to produce estimates in line with those from the method of [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] is possible.</p><p>Choosing cutpoints as to maximise overlap with a reference set does not guarantee that other chains will be estimated well. Moreover, identifying a suitable reference set can be difficult. In our study, researchers involved in the Quebec HIV genotyping program proposed the set. A different reference set might have led to different cutpoints. Several of the approaches we used did manage to recover the reference set very closely though, which suggests that it is not unrealistic.</p><p>DM-PhyClus, being a Bayesian method, rests on a number of prior assumptions, which are all more or less informative, and it follows that prior calibration is key. Although estimates are reasonably robust to some prior assumptions [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], it remains possible that a combination of very poorly chosen priors may result in misleading chain estimates. Further, DM-PhyClus looks for branch length patterns hinting at the existence of transmission cascades. This study focused instead on transmission chains, which do not necessarily involve such patterns. Therefore, the assumptions underlying DM-PhyClus might not be entirely appropriate.</p><p>Reliable infection date estimates for cases diagnosed while in the chronic stage are unavailable and so, we could only obtain a lower bound for chain growth between January 1st, 2012 and February 1st, 2016. Time between seroconversion and diagnosis can go from months to years, depending on an individual&#x02019;s testing habits, with a mean that could be above two years [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and it follows that several chronic cases diagnosed after June 30th, 2012 might have been infected during the selected period. Estimating infection time from the fraction of ambiguous nucleotides in each sequence would have been possible [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but the high standard deviation for such predictions would have limited their usefulness.</p><p>Because of the non-random sampling of cases, we cannot readily deduce from our estimates the population-level chain length distribution. In the absence of covariate information, we cannot model the sampling process. If, for example, the probability for a case to be sampled correlates positively with chain length, we might end up underestimating the length of shorter chains and the number of singletons, and consequently, overestimating the contribution of the chains we found to the epidemic. Nevertheless, the results we presented provide good evidence of chain growth, and that phenomenon alone warrants attention.</p><p>Determining which partition among the six proposed provides the most accurate representation of transmission chains in the sample is difficult. The choice depends ultimately on our confidence in the assumptions of each approach, and on substantive knowledge. The agreement between estimates from the conventional approaches, although explained in great part by shared assumptions, is still a good sign. The moderately different partitions proposed by the Gap Procedure and DM-PhyClus are not erroneous: they result from the way the two methods define a partition of interest. The two approaches also have additional aims and benefits. [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] designed the Gap Procedure with scalability in mind, and [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] formulated DM-PhyClus in such a way that it could offer a straightforward measure of uncertainty for its estimates.</p><p>The existence of long transmission chains is not only a feature of transmission of HIV-1 among MSMs in Montreal: it has been observed across Europe and other regions of North America as well [<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0213366.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0213366.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The increasing size of sequence databases represents a considerable computational challenge, especially in the Bayesian framework, and so, scalability should be an essential feature of future partitioning algorithms. We contend that methods that avoid cutpoint selection altogether are promising, and would benefit from further improvements. In addition to lightening their computational burden, adapting them to use time-stamp and covariate data, for example, would be a welcome extension. Further, methods designed to provide a clear measure of uncertainty for estimated partitions, like DM-PhyClus, would warrant more attention. Indeed, the strength of co-clustering between sequences within an inferred chain may vary sizeably, and the separation between some chains may not be very clear-cut. Such variability may be hard to measure rigorously under conventional phylogenetic partitioning approaches.</p><p>Phylogenetic surveillance of HIV transmission among MSMs provides helpful clues for explaining the persistence of the epidemic. Results from this study should help inform public health strategies to reduce transmission rates.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The current study did not involve data collection, as it is a secondary analysis of viral sequence data collected for the Quebec HIV genotyping program.
