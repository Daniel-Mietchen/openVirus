<p>Reviewer #1: In this paper the authors have described the influence of autophagy in Dengue and Zika virus production in insect cells. Autophagy has been described to play a critical role in flaviviral lifecycle as well as in the innate immune responses in human host cells. Both these viruses are however mosquito-borne and the corresponding role of autophagy in insect cells have not been investigated in the past. It is therefore certainly a significant knowledge gap that currently exists in the transmission cycle of these viruses. The findings presented in this paper are relevant; however, at the current state they seem rather preliminary and inconclusive. The authors need to clarify a few additional points via experiments and textual changes:</p>
