<p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "A limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells" (#PNTD-D-19-01476) for review by PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. Your manuscript was fully evaluated at the editorial level and by independent peer reviewers. The reviewers appreciated the attention to an important problem, but raised some substantial concerns about the manuscript as it currently stands. These issues must be addressed before we would be willing to consider a revised version of your study. We cannot, of course, promise publication at that time.</p>
