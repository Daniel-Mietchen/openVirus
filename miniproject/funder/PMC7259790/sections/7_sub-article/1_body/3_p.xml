<p>Before your manuscript can be formally accepted you will need to complete some formatting changes, which you will receive in a follow up email. A member of our team will be in touch with a set of requests. Also, please consider carefully additional comments by one reviewer in the hope of further improving the manuscript as it progresses forward to publication.</p>
