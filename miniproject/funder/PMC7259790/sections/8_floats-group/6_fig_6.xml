  <title>Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy decreases DENV-2 titers in BHK-21 cells.</title>
  <p>BHK-21 c15 cells were infected with DENV-2 and then treated with either torin-1 (1 μM), spautin-1 (10 μM), or 1% DMSO as a control. Samples were collected 48 hpi for titration. Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. (*) p&lt;0.05, (**) p&lt;0.01, (***) p&lt;0.001.</p>
