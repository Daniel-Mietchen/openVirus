<p>Because autophagy has been understudied in mosquitoes it is unclear if traditional methods for manipulating and analyzing autophagy, such as the use of chemical compounds, will be effective and/ or toxic in mosquito cells. Consequently, we verified the ability of commonly used chemical compounds to modulate autophagy in Aag2 cells. Treatment of Aag2 cells for 24 hrs. with bafilomycin A1 (inhibits autophagosome/ lysosome fusion), torin-1 (induces autophagy) and spautin-1 (blocks autophagy induction) alone had no discernible effects on the ratio of Atg8-PE to β-actin compared to the DMSO control cells as determined by immunoblot (

By inhibiting autophagolysosome acidification with bafilomycin A1 we were able to observe signs of autophagic activity suggesting that Aag2 cells have a high rate of autophagic flux (the steady state rate of autophagosomal turnover) and providing evidence that torin-1 and bafilomycin A1 are functioning as expected with regards to autophagy. As a result of the high autophagic flux, the addition of spautin-1 had no effect on baseline autophagy levels. However, when added to cells treated with torin-1 and bafilomycin A1, spautin-1 reduced the ratio of Atg8-PE to β-actin thereby validating its ability to inhibit autophagy in Aag2 cells (
