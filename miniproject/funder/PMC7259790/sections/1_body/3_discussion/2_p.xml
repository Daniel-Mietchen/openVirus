<p>In agreement with a previous report, we found spautin-1 treatment significantly reduced the release of infectious DENV-2 particles during infection of mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, Mateo et al. also observed that levels of extracellular viral RNA remained unchanged compared to the non-spautin-1 treated controls and that DENV-2 particles recovered from spautin-1 treated cells retained their ‘pr’ peptide after exocytosis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. During assembly, the viral nucleocapsid composed of genomic RNA and capsid protein, is packaged into a host-cell-derived envelope containing 180 copies of each of the E and prM structural proteins. Subsequently, immature virions undergo maturation in the trans-golgi network whereby the ‘pr’ peptide is proteolytically removed from M by host furin [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. ‘pr’ remains in association with the virion through exocytosis after which it disassociates. Improper cleavage or disassociation can result in the production of immature particles which have been shown to be less infectious than the fully mature virions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Based on this evidence it was hypothesized that either retention of the ‘pr’ peptide or altered virion confirmation diminished DENV-2 infectiousness after spautin-1 treatment [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, this outcome appears to be limited to mammalian cells as we observed increased infectiousness after spautin-1 treatment of infected Aag2 mosquito cells. The reasons for this are unknown. A previous study demonstrated that furin substrate specificity differs between vertebrate and invertebrate cells, which may explain why there is a higher proportion of immature virions produced in mosquito cells compared to mammalian cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interestingly, there doesn’t appear to be a reduction in infectiousness. One potential explanation could be that DENV adopts different conformational arrangements in mosquito and mammalian cells. In fact, at 28°C, the temperature at which mosquito cells are cultured, mature DENV virions contain 90 E-glycoprotein homodimers arranged in a tightly packed antiparallel formation with a smooth appearance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Conversely, at 37°C, E-glycoprotein homodimers adopt a very different conformation in which virions appear bumpy with large gaps allowing visualization of the underlying lipid membrane bilayer [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is possible that ‘pr’ cleavage and disassociation are not required to form infectious virions at 28°C due to the observed conformational rearrangements and therefore, spautin-1 has no adverse effects and potentially beneficial effects on the production of infectious virus particles. This could explain the differences observed between mosquito cells and mammalian cells upon spautin-1 treatment.
