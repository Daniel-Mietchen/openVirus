<p>Manipulation of the autophagy pathway has become a promising approach for treating a number of diseases including viral infections [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because arboviruses are maintained in a two-host system, the invertebrate vector and vertebrate host, there exists the possibility that autophagy can be manipulated in one or both systems in order to reduce disease burden and/ or transmission. Despite this two-host dependency, our understanding of the autophagy-arbovirus interface is primarily informed by one host, mammals [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is known that virus infections can induce an autophagic response in Diptera, specifically 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic>; however, there are conflicting reports as to the role of autophagy during infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Aside from having an intact and functional autophagy pathway, little is known about autophagy in mosquitoes. In an attempt to close this knowledge gap, this study characterized the autophagic response to arbovirus infection in the tractable Aag2 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cell culture system. Our findings suggest that while autophagy is induced, it seems to have a limited role during arbovirus infection of mosquito cell culture. Further, we demonstrate that while commonly used chemicals can modulate the autophagy pathway in mosquito cells, their effects on viruses are largely cell line dependent.
