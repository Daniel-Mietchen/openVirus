<p>Paradoxically, chemical induction and suppression of autophagy and inhibition of autophagolysosomal acidification all resulted in increased DENV-2, ZIKV and CHIKV titers in Aag2 cells at the assayed time points. In an attempt to reconcile these conflicting results, we performed RNAi suppression of autophagy genes. For both DENV-2 and CHIKV, no effects were observed upon suppression of Atg5, Atg14 or Atg8 despite high levels of suppression. Such results suggest that autophagy plays a limited role in mediating arbovirus infection of mosquito cells and that the effects conferred by the chemicals may be indirectly beneficial. Alternatively, it could suggest that &gt;80% suppression was not sufficient to diminish autophagic activity and therefore, the RNAi suppression infection assays were not sensitive enough to identify a role for autophagy during arbovirus infection. A third possible explanation could be that mosquitoes encode functional redundancy in key autophagic genes. It is known that Atg8 is part of a larger family of homologs that include genes such as GABARAP and GABARAPL. Recent work has shown that autophagy remains functional upon deletion of any of these homologs individually [
