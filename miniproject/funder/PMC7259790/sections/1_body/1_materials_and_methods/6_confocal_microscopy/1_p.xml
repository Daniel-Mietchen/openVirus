<p>In order to track autophagy during virus infection we quantified Atg8+ puncta by confocal microscopy. While we possess a polyclonal anti-Atg8 antibody, it did not produce reliable and consistent results. Therefore, we generated an expression vector to provide EGFP tagged Atg8

 <italic>aegypti</italic> Atg8 gene (AAEL007162) into the pIEx-EGFP vector 3’ to EGFP by Gibson Assembly. The generation of pIEx-EGFP has been described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Aag2 cells were seeded on coverslips at a density of 1.5x10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well in a 12 well plate and 24 hrs. later transfected with 1.5 μg/ well of pIEx-EGFP-Atg8 using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Two days post-transfection, cells were infected (M.O.I. 0.1) and/ or chemically treated. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde 24 hrs. post-treatment, washed 3x in warm PBS and mounted on microscope slides using ProLong Gold + DAPI. Microscopy was performed on a Leica SP5 confocal microscope at 100x magnification with a 3x zoom. Because the efficiency of transfection is relatively low in Aag2 cells, images were captured by scanning the slide and identifying field of views that contained multiple cells with EGFP expression. Five images per sample per experiment were acquired. Approximately 50 cells were imaged per treatment. Experiments were completed in triplicate and all identifying information was blinded to the microscopist. Quantification of puncta per cell was completed using the ImageJ software with the Puncta Analyzer plug-in. It should be noted that infection status of each cell could not be verified at the time of microscopy due to the rate of virus replication in these cells. Samples were harvested 24 hpi, yet viral antigen is in low abundance at this early time point making it difficult to detect signal above background auto-fluorescence. This limitation made it difficult to correlate virus replication with Atg8+ puncta accumulation.
