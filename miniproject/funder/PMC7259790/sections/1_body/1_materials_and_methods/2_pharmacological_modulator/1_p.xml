<p>To assess the effect of pharmacological modulators on autophagy, the following drugs were used in cell culture infections of C6/36, Aag2, and BHK21 cells: torin-1, an autophagy inducer that works early in the autophagy pathway by inhibiting mTOR kinase, and spautin-1 (
 <underline>s</underline>pecific and 
 <underline>p</underline>otent 
 <underline>aut</underline>ophagy 
 <underline>in</underline>hibitor 1) (Tocris Bioscience), which inhibits autophagy by interfering with USP10 and USP13, two ubiquitin-specific peptidases, resulting in the degradation of class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase complexes during the initial steps of autophagy [

Bafilomycin A1 (InvivoGen), an inhibitor of V-ATPase, was also used in inhibition of late stage autophagy in infectious and non-infectious immunoblotting of Aag2 cells. A further discussion of these chemicals is not included as others have nicely summarized their specific activity within the autophagy pathway [
