 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Atg5, Atg14, Atg8 and luciferase genes were amplified using primer sets containing the T7 promotor (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Amplicons were PCR purified and a T7 Megascript kit was used to synthesize dsRNA molecules for transfection per the manufacturer’s recommendations (Ambion). Two days prior to transfection, Aag2 cells were seeded at 1.5x10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well in 12-well plates. 1 μg/well of dsRNA was combined with OPTI-MEM and Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 20 minutes. The media on the Aag2 cells was discarded and replaced with 1 mL of Opti-MEM. The lipid-nucleic complexes were then added to the wells containing OPTI-MEM and were incubated at 28°C for four hours, after which the media was discarded and again replaced with the standard 10% FBS media. Cells were harvested 48 hours after transfection by manually scraping the cell monolayer using a 1 ml pipette tip. The cells were pelleted and re-suspended in QVL Lysis buffer from an Omega Bio-tek Viral RNA Extraction kit or RIPA buffer. Total RNA was then extracted following the manufacturer’s instructions. Extractions were DNase treated and purified via phenol/chloroform extraction.
