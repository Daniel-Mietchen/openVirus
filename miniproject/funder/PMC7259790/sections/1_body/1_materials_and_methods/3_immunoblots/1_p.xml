<p>Two days after Aag2 cells were seeded at 1.5x10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/well in a 12-well plate, cells were treated with 1% DMSO, 1 μM bafilomycin A1, 1 μM torin-1 or 10 μM spautin-1. Cells were harvested 24 hours later using RIPA buffer. Total protein in cell lysates was quantified using a Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit (ThermoFisher) on a microplate reader. An equal amount of protein from each sample was separated on a 16% Tris-glycine gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane. Autophagy was detected using a rabbit anti-Atg8 antibody at a 1:8,000 dilution in PBS + 5% BSA + 1% Tween. Polyclonal anti-Atg8 antibody was generated by ProSci Inc. as previously described [

Actin was detected using a rabbit anti-β-Actin antibody (Abcam) in PBS + 5% BSA + 1% Tween at a 1:8,000 dilution. The secondary probe was performed using the same secondary antibody as above. Membranes were developed in SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher) for 5 minutes at room temperature. Band intensities were quantified using ImageJ [
