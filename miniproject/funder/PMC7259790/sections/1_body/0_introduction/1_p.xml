<p>Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses, specifically those of the families 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, cause significant morbidity and mortality and pose a continued public health threat worldwide. This is highlighted by the sustained transmission of dengue virus (DENV; 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) throughout the tropics, the emergent epidemics of Zika virus (ZIKV; 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>), chikungunya virus (CHIKV; 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>) and West Nile virus (WNV; 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) in the Americas, and the sporadic outbreaks of yellow fever virus (YFV; 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) in Africa and South America. Arboviruses are maintained in a transmission cycle between vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors. Because therapeutics and vaccines are lacking for many of these viruses, public education and vector control strategies are the only defenses available to minimize disease burden and epidemic risk. However, as insecticide resistance is becoming more commonplace it is critical that novel approaches for preventing and treating arboviral diseases, targeting either vector or host, be developed.
