<p>To address this knowledge gap we investigated the role of autophagy during DENV-2 and CHIKV infection of Aag2 mosquito cells derived from the primary vector 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Using an anti-Atg8 (mammalian homolog LC3) specific antibody and recombinant Atg8-EGFP provided 
 <italic>in trans</italic>, we assessed autophagy induction and flux by immunoblot and microscopy. We observed an increase in the accumulation of Atg8 positive puncta and increased conversion of Atg8 to Atg8-PE (PE; phosphatidylethanolamine). Further, we found that chemical inhibition and induction of autophagy both increased viral titers, while suppression of autophagy related genes had no effect. Interestingly, chemical modulators had minimal effects on DENV-2 titers in another commonly used mosquito cell line, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36, and spautin-1 inhibition of autophagy significantly decreased DENV-2 titers in mammalian cells as previously reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Together, these data reveal a limited role for autophagy during DENV-2 and CHIKV infection of mosquito cells and highlights differences in autophagy-virus interactions between cell culture systems. Further, our data suggest that outcomes associated with commonly used chemical modulators of autophagy are cell-dependent and may result from cell-specific interactions with the chemicals.
