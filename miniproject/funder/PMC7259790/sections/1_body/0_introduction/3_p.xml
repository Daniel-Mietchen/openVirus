<p>Numerous stimuli have the ability to activate autophagy including innate immunity and cellular stress. It is therefore not surprising that viral infections often induce an autophagic response. In fact, studies have demonstrated that both flaviviruses and alphaviruses induce autophagy during infection and that this can occur through a number of mechanisms, all of which culminate in the inhibition of the Akt-TOR signaling pathway [

Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of the autophagy pathway via recombinant Beclin 1 reduces Sindbis virus and CHIKV titers and improves clinical outcomes in mice. This process is mediated by the autophagy cargo receptor p62, which recognizes poly-ubiquitin tagged viral capsid proteins and transports them to maturing autophagosomes for degradation [

For instance, during DENV-2 infection, p62 actively targets DENV-2 proteins for degradation and replication complexes associated with the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) are targeted by reticulophagy; however, DENV-2 benefits from an energetically favorable environment as a result of virus-induced lipophagy and efficient processing of mature virions [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While it is clear that arboviruses closely interact with autophagy during infection, these studies have been limited to either non-vector organisms or mammals. As a result we know very little about the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection within the invertebrate vector [
