It can additionally function as an innate immune response to viral infection as has been demonstrated for a number of arthropod-borne (arbo-) viruses. Arboviruses are maintained in a transmission cycle between vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors yet the majority of studies assessing autophagy-arbovirus interactions have been limited to the mammalian host. Therefore we evaluated the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection of the invertebrate vector using the tractable Aag2 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito cell culture system. Our data demonstrates that autophagy is significantly induced in mosquito cells upon infection with two divergent arboviruses: dengue virus-2 (DENV-2; <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV; <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, <italic>Alphavirus</italic>). While assessing the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection, we observed a somewhat paradoxical outcome. Both induction and suppression of autophagy via torin-1 and spautin-1, respectively, resulted in increased viral titers for both viruses, yet suppression of autophagy-related genes had no effect. Interestingly, chemical modulators of autophagy had either no effect or opposite effects in another widely used mosquito cell line, C6/36 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> cells. Together, our data reveals a limited role for autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells. Further, our findings suggest that commonly used chemical modulators of autophagy alter mosquito cells in such a way as to promote viral replication; however, it is unclear if this occurs directly through autophagic manipulation or other means.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Arthropod-borne (arbo) viruses, specifically those transmitted by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, cause significant morbidity and mortality and pose a continued public health threat worldwide. Many of these viruses lack vaccines or therapeutics and current mosquito control strategies are underperforming. For these reasons, identifying vulnerabilities within the transmission cycle that can be targeted will be critical to the development of novel control interventions. Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular pathway and previous studies manipulating this pathway have shown promise in minimizing viral infections in mammalian hosts. In this study we examined arbovirus-autophagy interactions within mosquito cells. The goal was to elucidate the role of autophagy during infection of these cells in hopes of identifying critical interactions that can be targeted by novel approaches to block infection of and transmission by vector mosquitoes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI099042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6486-3134</contrib-id><name><surname>Brackney</surname><given-names>Doug E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000030</institution-id><institution>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01/CK000509-01</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by grants from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/">https://www.cdc.gov/</ext-link>)(U01/CK000509-01) (DEB) and the National Institute of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/">https://www.niaid.nih.gov/</ext-link>)(AI099042) (DEB and MAC).

This is highlighted by the sustained transmission of dengue virus (DENV; <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) throughout the tropics, the emergent epidemics of Zika virus (ZIKV; <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, <italic>Flavivirus</italic>), chikungunya virus (CHIKV; <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, <italic>Alphavirus</italic>) and West Nile virus (WNV; <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) in the Americas, and the sporadic outbreaks of yellow fever virus (YFV; <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) in Africa and South America. Arboviruses are maintained in a transmission cycle between vertebrate hosts and invertebrate vectors. Because therapeutics and vaccines are lacking for many of these viruses, public education and vector control strategies are the only defenses available to minimize disease burden and epidemic risk. However, as insecticide resistance is becoming more commonplace it is critical that novel approaches for preventing and treating arboviral diseases, targeting either vector or host, be developed.</p><p>Macroautophagy (herein referred to as autophagy) is an essential cellular process required for maintaining homeostasis and plays a crucial role in development, cell differentiation and immunity [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Consequently, abnormal autophagic activity has been linked to a number of pathologies, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This evolutionarily conserved pathway mediates the degradation and recycling of cellular components. Upon induction, protein aggregates, damaged or dysfunctional organelles and foreign bodies are sequestered into cup-shaped double-membrane vesicles termed phagophores or isolation membranes [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Appropriation of cargo can occur in a non-selective manner known as bulk autophagy whereby cytoplasmic material is indiscriminately engulfed, or through selective autophagy, which specifically targets poly-ubiquitin tagged proteins [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Through a series of kinase signaling cascades and recruitment events, the phagophore elongates, eventually encompassing the cargo and forming an autophagosome [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Subsequently, the mature autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes resulting in the acidification of the newly formed autophagolysosome and degradation of the cargo [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Targeting aspects of the autophagy pathway has become a promising strategy for combatting a number of diseases [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Numerous stimuli have the ability to activate autophagy including innate immunity and cellular stress. It is therefore not surprising that viral infections often induce an autophagic response. In fact, studies have demonstrated that both flaviviruses and alphaviruses induce autophagy during infection and that this can occur through a number of mechanisms, all of which culminate in the inhibition of the Akt-TOR signaling pathway [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. During alphavirus infection, autophagy functions as an antiviral defense. Previous studies have demonstrated that activation of the autophagy pathway via recombinant Beclin 1 reduces Sindbis virus and CHIKV titers and improves clinical outcomes in mice. This process is mediated by the autophagy cargo receptor p62, which recognizes poly-ubiquitin tagged viral capsid proteins and transports them to maturing autophagosomes for degradation [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In comparison, flavivirus-autophagy interactions are much more nuanced [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. For instance, during DENV-2 infection, p62 actively targets DENV-2 proteins for degradation and replication complexes associated with the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) are targeted by reticulophagy; however, DENV-2 benefits from an energetically favorable environment as a result of virus-induced lipophagy and efficient processing of mature virions [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While it is clear that arboviruses closely interact with autophagy during infection, these studies have been limited to either non-vector organisms or mammals. As a result we know very little about the role of autophagy during arbovirus infection within the invertebrate vector [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>To address this knowledge gap we investigated the role of autophagy during DENV-2 and CHIKV infection of Aag2 mosquito cells derived from the primary vector <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Using an anti-Atg8 (mammalian homolog LC3) specific antibody and recombinant Atg8-EGFP provided <italic>in trans</italic>, we assessed autophagy induction and flux by immunoblot and microscopy. We observed an increase in the accumulation of Atg8 positive puncta and increased conversion of Atg8 to Atg8-PE (PE; phosphatidylethanolamine). Further, we found that chemical inhibition and induction of autophagy both increased viral titers, while suppression of autophagy related genes had no effect. Interestingly, chemical modulators had minimal effects on DENV-2 titers in another commonly used mosquito cell line, <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36, and spautin-1 inhibition of autophagy significantly decreased DENV-2 titers in mammalian cells as previously reported [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Together, these data reveal a limited role for autophagy during DENV-2 and CHIKV infection of mosquito cells and highlights differences in autophagy-virus interactions between cell culture systems. Further, our data suggest that outcomes associated with commonly used chemical modulators of autophagy are cell-dependent and may result from cell-specific interactions with the chemicals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Cell lines &#x00026; virus strains</title><p>Autophagy was modeled in three different cell lines, the mosquito-derived <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> C6/36 (ATCC; American Type Culture Collection) and <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Aag2 cells (Generously provided by Dr. Gregory Ebel, Colorado State University) and mammalian cell line BHK-21 clone 15 (Syrian golden hamster kidney cells) (Generously provided by Dr. Rushika Perrera, Colorado State University).

Consequently, we verified the ability of commonly used chemical compounds to modulate autophagy in Aag2 cells. Treatment of Aag2 cells for 24 hrs. with bafilomycin A1 (inhibits autophagosome/ lysosome fusion), torin-1 (induces autophagy) and spautin-1 (blocks autophagy induction) alone had no discernible effects on the ratio of Atg8-PE to &#x003b2;-actin compared to the DMSO control cells as determined by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007754.g001">Fig 1</xref>). However, the combination of torin-1 and bafilomycin A1 resulted in a significant increase in Atg8-PE to &#x003b2;-actin ratios. By inhibiting autophagolysosome acidification with bafilomycin A1 we were able to observe signs of autophagic activity suggesting that Aag2 cells have a high rate of autophagic flux (the steady state rate of autophagosomal turnover) and providing evidence that torin-1 and bafilomycin A1 are functioning as expected with regards to autophagy. As a result of the high autophagic flux, the addition of spautin-1 had no effect on baseline autophagy levels.

This data suggests that these commonly used chemical compounds can have profoundly different effects on host cell-virus interactions.</p><fig id="pntd.0007754.g006" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0007754.g006</object-id><label>Fig 6</label><caption><title>Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy decreases DENV-2 titers in BHK-21 cells.</title><p>BHK-21 c15 cells were infected with DENV-2 and then treated with either torin-1 (1 &#x003bc;M), spautin-1 (10 &#x003bc;M), or 1% DMSO as a control.

Because arboviruses are maintained in a two-host system, the invertebrate vector and vertebrate host, there exists the possibility that autophagy can be manipulated in one or both systems in order to reduce disease burden and/ or transmission. Despite this two-host dependency, our understanding of the autophagy-arbovirus interface is primarily informed by one host, mammals [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is known that virus infections can induce an autophagic response in Diptera, specifically <italic>Drosophila</italic>; however, there are conflicting reports as to the role of autophagy during infection [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Aside from having an intact and functional autophagy pathway, little is known about autophagy in mosquitoes. In an attempt to close this knowledge gap, this study characterized the autophagic response to arbovirus infection in the tractable Aag2 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cell culture system. Our findings suggest that while autophagy is induced, it seems to have a limited role during arbovirus infection of mosquito cell culture. Further, we demonstrate that while commonly used chemicals can modulate the autophagy pathway in mosquito cells, their effects on viruses are largely cell line dependent.</p><p>In agreement with a previous report, we found spautin-1 treatment significantly reduced the release of infectious DENV-2 particles during infection of mammalian cells [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, Mateo et al. also observed that levels of extracellular viral RNA remained unchanged compared to the non-spautin-1 treated controls and that DENV-2 particles recovered from spautin-1 treated cells retained their &#x02018;pr&#x02019; peptide after exocytosis [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. During assembly, the viral nucleocapsid composed of genomic RNA and capsid protein, is packaged into a host-cell-derived envelope containing 180 copies of each of the E and prM structural proteins. Subsequently, immature virions undergo maturation in the trans-golgi network whereby the &#x02018;pr&#x02019; peptide is proteolytically removed from M by host furin [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. &#x02018;pr&#x02019; remains in association with the virion through exocytosis after which it disassociates. Improper cleavage or disassociation can result in the production of immature particles which have been shown to be less infectious than the fully mature virions [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Based on this evidence it was hypothesized that either retention of the &#x02018;pr&#x02019; peptide or altered virion confirmation diminished DENV-2 infectiousness after spautin-1 treatment [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, this outcome appears to be limited to mammalian cells as we observed increased infectiousness after spautin-1 treatment of infected Aag2 mosquito cells. The reasons for this are unknown. A previous study demonstrated that furin substrate specificity differs between vertebrate and invertebrate cells, which may explain why there is a higher proportion of immature virions produced in mosquito cells compared to mammalian cells [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Interestingly, there doesn&#x02019;t appear to be a reduction in infectiousness. One potential explanation could be that DENV adopts different conformational arrangements in mosquito and mammalian cells. In fact, at 28&#x000b0;C, the temperature at which mosquito cells are cultured, mature DENV virions contain 90 E-glycoprotein homodimers arranged in a tightly packed antiparallel formation with a smooth appearance [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Conversely, at 37&#x000b0;C, E-glycoprotein homodimers adopt a very different conformation in which virions appear bumpy with large gaps allowing visualization of the underlying lipid membrane bilayer [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It is possible that &#x02018;pr&#x02019; cleavage and disassociation are not required to form infectious virions at 28&#x000b0;C due to the observed conformational rearrangements and therefore, spautin-1 has no adverse effects and potentially beneficial effects on the production of infectious virus particles. This could explain the differences observed between mosquito cells and mammalian cells upon spautin-1 treatment.</p><p>Paradoxically, chemical induction and suppression of autophagy and inhibition of autophagolysosomal acidification all resulted in increased DENV-2, ZIKV and CHIKV titers in Aag2 cells at the assayed time points. In an attempt to reconcile these conflicting results, we performed RNAi suppression of autophagy genes. For both DENV-2 and CHIKV, no effects were observed upon suppression of Atg5, Atg14 or Atg8 despite high levels of suppression. Such results suggest that autophagy plays a limited role in mediating arbovirus infection of mosquito cells and that the effects conferred by the chemicals may be indirectly beneficial. Alternatively, it could suggest that &#x0003e;80% suppression was not sufficient to diminish autophagic activity and therefore, the RNAi suppression infection assays were not sensitive enough to identify a role for autophagy during arbovirus infection. A third possible explanation could be that mosquitoes encode functional redundancy in key autophagic genes. It is known that Atg8 is part of a larger family of homologs that include genes such as GABARAP and GABARAPL. Recent work has shown that autophagy remains functional upon deletion of any of these homologs individually [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Further, humans encode four isoforms of Atg4 and that elimination of all four is necessary to eliminate cleavage of pro-LC3/GABARAP prior to lipidation [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. While additional homologs and/ or isoforms of Atg5 and Atg14 have not been identified in other systems, functional redundancy may exist in mosquitoes.</p><p>In this study we observed a significant increase in viral titers upon spautin-1 and torin-1 treatment in Aag2 cells; however, we observed no effect in another mosquito cell line, C6/36 cells. While both are mosquito cell lines, there are significant differences that could affect the chemical-arbovirus-cell interface. Aag2 cells are derived from <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes whereas C6/36 cells originate from <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>albopictus</italic> mosquitoes; however, due to the evolutionary conservation of autophagy it is unlikely that there are significant species-level differences in autophagic activity. A potentially more important factor could be the tissue source of the cells [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Mosquito cell culture is generally initiated by grinding up larvae (C6/36 cells) or embryos (Aag2 cells) and recovering cells amenable to growth in culture. Consequently, the specific cell type of the cells in culture is unknown. It could be that the differences arise because they are derived from different tissues and therefore respond differently to DENV-2 in the presence of chemicals. In addition, previous reports have demonstrated that Aag2 cells are persistently infected with multiple insect-specific viruses while C6/36 cells are not [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It is possible that additional viruses in the system could alter how the cells respond to both chemicals and arboviruses. Finally, the primary antiviral immune response, RNAi, is functionally impaired in C6/36 cells [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. How this would impact the host cells&#x02019; response to chemicals targeting the autophagy pathway during viral infection is unclear; however, previous studies have demonstrated that autophagy can selectively degrade components of the RNAi pathway [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. If RNAi is actively targeting viruses during infection, than induction with torin-1 could lead to increased viral replication in Aag2 cells but not C6/36 cells. Conversely, suppression of autophagy with spautin-1 would in theory increase available RNAi machinery thereby enabling a more potent RNAi response and reduction of viral titers; however, this is not what was observed. This may reflect the fact that RNAi genes are not significantly upregulated during arbovirus infection so suppression of autophagy has little effect on the normal levels of RNAi while increased autophagic activity could reduce activity allowing the viruses to replicate to higher titers [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Further research will be needed to fully elucidate autophagy-RNAi interactions and how they impact arbovirus infection of mosquitoes.</p><p>Comparing our results to what has been reported in mammalian systems reveals that at least for DENV-2 and ZIKV the general patterns are consistent. The increase in titers upon TOR-inhibition with torin-1 suggests that both DENV-2 and ZIKV benefit from downstream pathways regulated by TOR, one of which is autophagy. We observed increased flavivirus titers in Aag2 cells upon torin-1 treatment suggesting that flaviviruses benefit from an autophagic state and this is consistent with what has been found in mammalian cells [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, increased titers were also observed upon suppression of autophagy by spautin-1 suggesting an antiviral role. While these outcomes seem contradictory, they are consistent with the current model for DENV-autophagy interactions. In mammalian cells, DENV and DENV replication complexes are targeted for degradation by autophagy while simultaneously benefitting from more efficient mature virion processing and increased energy availability as a result of virus-induced lipophagy [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. While the flavivirus data was consistent with what has been observed in mammalian systems, the CHIKV data was not. Numerous studies have found that autophagy functions in an antiviral manner during infection with members of the family <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, specifically alphaviruses [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While inhibition of autophagy did result in increased CHIKV titers as would be expected, induction also increased titers. This discrepancy may reflect a difference in the role of autophagy during CHIKV infection of mosquito and mammalian cells.</p><p>This study provides an important first-step in understanding autophagy-arbovirus interactions within mosquitoes and highlights differences between the mammalian and mosquito autophagic response to infection. However, future work assessing these interactions within mosquitoes will be needed due to the limitations of our cell culture system. As previously mentioned, the origin of mosquito cell culture is unknown and therefore, it is difficult to determine if, in the context of natural infection, virus-autophagy interactions may function differently. Further, during infection, arboviruses must infect and replicate in a diversity of tissues and cell types before being transmitted. Previous studies have shown that autophagy can function differently between cell types and tissue types, and it is therefore possible that during the course of mosquito infection autophagy might interact differently with viruses depending on the tissue and cell type [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In addition, a recent study highlighted the genomic differences observed between C6/36 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> cells and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes [<xref rid="pntd.0007754.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The cells used in this study have been in culture for decades and may not accurately recapitulate the cellular environment of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>. Regardless, this study better defines autophagy-arbovirus interactions in a medically relevant vector system and provides insights that will be important for future <italic>in vivo</italic> studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007754.s001"><label>S1 Supporting Information</label><caption><title>Contains the materials and methods associated with supplemental figures.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0007754.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0007754.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Chemical modulators of autophagy have minimal toxicity in Aag2 cells.</title><p>Aag2 cells were treated with either torin-1 (1 &#x003bc;M), spautin-1 (10 &#x003bc;M), bafilomycin A1 (1 &#x003bc;M), 1% DMSO, or untreated for 24 hrs (n = 4).

If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p><p>Reviewer #1: In this paper the authors have described the influence of autophagy in Dengue and Zika virus production in insect cells. Autophagy has been described to play a critical role in flaviviral lifecycle as well as in the innate immune responses in human host cells. Both these viruses are however mosquito-borne and the corresponding role of autophagy in insect cells have not been investigated in the past. It is therefore certainly a significant knowledge gap that currently exists in the transmission cycle of these viruses. The findings presented in this paper are relevant; however, at the current state they seem rather preliminary and inconclusive. The authors need to clarify a few additional points via experiments and textual changes:</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Line 10: The process of Dengue induced lipophagy and its role in processing mature viral progenies was actually demonstrated in this paper (Zhang et al., 2018); this needs to be cited. Along the same lines, since both Dengue and Zika have been reported to induce autophagy for the purpose of hydrolyzing lipid droplets, it might be relevant to measure their abundance in infected insect cells, via simple Nile Red staining. This will provide useful information on similarities and differences between human and insect cells.</p><p>Figure 1-3: The authors have quantitated the appearance of EGFP-Atg8 punctae upon transient transfection of the plasmid into cells. From the images shown, it appears that the transfection efficiency is extremely low in these cells &#x02013; hence the quantitative estimates might not be reflective of the whole population. It might be a lot more interpretable if they stably expressed EGFP-Atg8 in these cells. </p><p>Figure 4: What is the authors&#x02019; explanation for the increase in viral titers with both inhibition and induction of autophagy? Also a more systematic time course analysis is probably called for to analyse how autophagy contributes to the early versus late stages in the viral life cycle.</p><p>Figure 5: Depletion of the three autophagosomal genes needs to be confirmed by immunoblotting at protein expression levels. If the extent of depletion is low, it is possible that the lack of a significant effect on viral titers is because of residual activity of the genes. Also, how do the authors reconcile the discrepancy in the phenotype with genetic depletion versus the pharmacological inhibition experiments? Gene-depletions show non-significant effect on viral titers whereas induction or inhibition with pharmacological compounds clearly increases viral titers.</p><p>Lastly, a lot of the conclusion from each of the figures has been compiled together with the discussion section. It will be a lot easier for the reader if the conclusion of the authors for each figure was added to the results section, while its implications and interpretations discussed in the discussion section.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Figure S1A: The annotation of Atg8-PE and Atg8 are reversed &#x02013; Atg8-PE runs as a smaller molecular weight species on the gel</p><p>There are several typographical errors in the manuscript that needs to be corrected.</p><p>Zhang, J., Lan, Y., Li, M.Y., Lamers, M.M., Fusade-Boyer, M., Klemm, E., Thiele, C., Ashour, J., Sanyal, S., 2018. Flaviviruses Exploit the Lipid Droplet Protein AUP1 to Trigger Lipophagy and Drive Virus Production. Cell Host Microbe 23, 819&#x02013;831.e5.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Specific comments are presented in a separate file.

</p><p>Dear Dr Brackney,</p><p>Thank you very much for submitting your manuscript "The impact of&#x000a0;autophagy during arbovirus infection of mosquito cells" for consideration at PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. As with all papers reviewed by the journal, your manuscript was once again reviewed by members of the editorial board and by two independent reviewers. </p><p>Although we remain appreciative of the topic, the last revised version still needs to be further improved. To consider the manuscript for publication, we encourage you to use the comments and suggestions of the reviewers from the first and second rounds of review to modify the manuscript, with a goal of increasing the clarity and transparency of the results.</p><p>Please prepare and submit your revised manuscript within 30 days. If you anticipate any delay, please let us know the expected resubmission date by replying to this email. &#x000a0;</p><p>When you are ready to resubmit, please upload the following:</p><p>[1] A letter containing a detailed list of your responses to all review comments, and a description of the changes you have made in the manuscript.&#x000a0;</p><p>Please note while forming your response, if your article is accepted, you may have the opportunity to make the peer review history publicly available. The record will include editor decision letters (with reviews) and your responses to reviewer comments. If eligible, we will contact you to opt in or out</p><p>[2] Two versions of the revised manuscript: one with either highlights or tracked changes denoting where the text has been changed; the other a clean version (uploaded as the manuscript file).</p><p>Important additional instructions are given below your reviewer comments. </p><p>Thank you again for your submission to our journal. We hope that our editorial process has been constructive so far, and we welcome your feedback at any time. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comments.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Rhoel Ramos Dinglasan</p><p>Associate Editor</p><p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p><p>Paulo Pimenta</p><p>Deputy Editor</p><p>PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases</p><p>***********************</p><p>Reviewer's Responses to Questions</p><p><bold>Key Review Criteria Required for Acceptance?</bold></p><p>As you describe the new analyses required for acceptance, please consider the following:</p><p><bold>Methods</bold></p><p>-Are the objectives of the study clearly articulated with a clear testable hypothesis stated?</p><p>-Is the study design appropriate to address the stated objectives?</p><p>-Is the population clearly described and appropriate for the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>-Is the sample size sufficient to ensure adequate power to address the hypothesis being tested?</p><p>-Were correct statistical analysis used to support conclusions?</p><p>-Are there concerns about ethical or regulatory requirements being met?</p><p>Reviewer #2: More in-depth descriptions are provided in the Reviewer Comments file. Overall the methods were straight forward and clear.</p><p>Reviewer #3: (No Response)</p><p>--------------------</p><p><bold>Results</bold></p><p>-Does the analysis presented match the analysis plan?</p><p>-Are the results clearly and completely presented?</p><p>-Are the figures (Tables, Images) of sufficient quality for clarity?</p><p>Reviewer #2: There needs to be some work in the results section, particularly with the figures to increase clarification, espescially with regards to significance asterisks and blotting images.</p><p>Reviewer #3: (No Response)</p><p>--------------------</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p>-Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?</p><p>-Are the limitations of analysis clearly described?</p><p>-Do the authors discuss how these data can be helpful to advance our understanding of the topic under study?</p><p>-Is public health relevance addressed?</p><p>Reviewer #2: The conclusions are supported by the data presented, yes. I think there could be a larger tie in to genes reported in mosquito RNAseq studies. The data is paradoxical, but these issues are addressed and discussed accordingly. As this is a study with DENV-2 and Aag2 cells, there is an implied public health relevance, yes.</p><p>Reviewer #3: (No Response)</p><p>--------------------</p><p><bold>Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications?</bold></p><p>Use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity. If the only modifications needed are minor and/or editorial, you may wish to recommend &#x0201c;Minor Revision&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Accept&#x0201d;. </p><p>Reviewer #2: Please see attached reviewer comments.</p><p>Reviewer #3: (No Response)</p><p>--------------------</p><p><bold>Summary and General Comments</bold></p><p>Use this section to provide overall comments, discuss strengths/weaknesses of the study, novelty, significance, general execution and scholarship. You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. If requesting major revision, please articulate the new experiments that are needed.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Please see attached reviewer comments.</p><p>Reviewer #3: Most of the important points I raised have been addressed. However, I wish the authors would have been more open to the reviewers comments. They are meant to improve the manuscript and should be seriously considered, rather than answered lightly and with general comments such as "this is science". </p><p>I do not understand the reluctance to implement changes that where highlighted by both reviewers, such as a better description of time points throughout the manuscript, that overall stil lacks precision. </p><p>Adding a small scheme that recapitulates the autophagy pathway, and highlighting the steps that are affected by the various drugs used in the paper would be very welcome and does not necessitate much extra work. Explaining in a more comprehensive way what "autophagic flux" is in the manuscript, as has been done in the answers to reviewers would be helpful to readers. </p><p>Line numbers were not always referred to properly in the reply to reviewers (where is Atg8-PE defined ? It is not page 5 line 106 as written) and leave a general impression of sloppiness.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">what does this mean?</ext-link>).
