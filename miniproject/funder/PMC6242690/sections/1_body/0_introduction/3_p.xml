<p>MAYV is thought to be principally transmitted by the bite of diurnal canopy-dwelling mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These mosquitoes are responsible for maintaining the sylvatic cycle involving nonhuman primates and birds as primary and secondary hosts, respectively. Human infections are sporadic, likely because 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> spp. rarely display anthropophilic behaviors, and they possess a preference for rural areas with proximity to forests [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Vector competence (VC) studies demonstrated that anthropophilic and urban-adapted species, such as 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Linnaeus, 1762) and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> (Skuse, 1895), are competent vectors for MAYV in laboratory conditions [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes positive for MAYV have also been identified from field collections during a DENV outbreak in Mato Groso County, Brazil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; however, their capacity to transmit MAYV has not been demonstrated.
