<p>Previously, only two alphaviruses were known to be transmitted by 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes: Oâ€™nyong-nyong virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and a single record for CHIKV [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, in the original paper describing the isolation of MAYV, the authors present an anecdote (no data) stating that when inoculated into 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>quadrimaculatus</italic> from Trinidad, MAYV was able to replicate (although neither oral infection nor transmission was investigated) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The capacity of 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>quadrimaculatus</italic> and 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>freeborni</italic> to transmit MAYV is particularly relevant to the United States, because the estimated geographic distribution of these species covers the entirety of the country [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The sylvatic cycle of MAYV involves principally non-human primates and birds, however there is serological evidence of MAYV circulation in other hosts including rodents and marsupials [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Nothing is known about the capacity of North American mammal species to act as vertebrate reservoirs. However, MAYV could be possibly maintained in a human-mosquito-human urban cycle similarly to what is observed with CHIKV. According to Tesh et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] human viremia during the acute-phase is comparable to that reached in experimentally infected nonhuman primates. 
 <italic>An freeborni</italic> and 
 <italic>An</italic>. 
 <italic>quadrimaculatus</italic> are opportunistic feeders and have a wide range of hosts including humans. Depending on ecological and epidemiological factors, these two mosquito species might have the capacity to sustain the transmission cycle and spread the MAYV in the United States in synergy with other competent species like 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. An interesting and important aspect of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> vector biology is their tendency to have multiple feeding events during a single gonotrophic cycle [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The bite frequency of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes increases their vectorial capacity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006895.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For these reasons, we highlight the need for more studies on the possible role of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes in spreading arboviruses in the United States.
