  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of the HA1 nucleotide sequence for 69 EIV strains, including representative strains of the main lineages and sub-lineages. The last French EIV strains belonging to the Florida sublineage clade 1 and clade 2 are underlined (open and closed circles, respectively). The FC1 EIV strains from the 2018 and 2019 French outbreaks are in red. The FC1 EIV vaccine strains are in bold text. Neighbor-Joining, Test phylogeny: Bootstrap method with 1000 bootstrap replication, Mode/method: Maximum composite Likelihood.</p>
