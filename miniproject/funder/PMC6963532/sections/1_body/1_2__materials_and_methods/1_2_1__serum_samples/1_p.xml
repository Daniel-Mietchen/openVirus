<p>The serological study was carried out on archived surplus serum samples from the LABÉO Diagnostic and Research Institute. The initial serum samples were obtained, for diagnostic reasons unrelated to this study, from 3004 individual horses located in France, of all ages, breeds, sexes and born in different countries over two time periods, from June 2017 to March 2018 (time period 1, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 2645) and from December 2018 to April 2019 (time period 2, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 359). All serum were kept at −20 °C until analysis. Archived sera were randomly selected from 4 different geographical regions in France with some of the highest equids and breeding center densities (Normandy, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1837; Pays de la Loire, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 269; Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 240 and Occitanie, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 299) and taking into account the North–South and East–West localization (

The larger number of samples from Normandy is explained by the highest number of horses and breeding centers in this specific region and the location of the LABÉO Institute. Samples were subdivided into 4 categories according to the initial diagnostic analyses requested: sanitary check for exportation, sale, breeding or illness diagnosis. Samples from late 2018 to early 2019 came from the north of France, including Normandy, where EI outbreaks were reported at the time of sampling (cf. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot4-vaccines-07-00174">Section 3.4</xref>). The number of serum samples per region and categories is detailed in the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-07-00174">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. In France, EI vaccination is mandatory for some of these categories (exportation, sale and breeding) but the vaccination history of these samples was unknown. Samples were anonymized by a third party prior to analysis, with the age of the horse at the time of sampling and its country of origin, (i.e., France or others) being the only information available for this study. This work received ethical approval from the LABÉO ethical advisor. During the 2018–2019 EI epizooties, 11 serum samples were obtained from field veterinary practitioners in the context of the epidemiological investigation conducted by the RESPE.
