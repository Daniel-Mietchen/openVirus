<p>The competition ID Screen Influenza A Antibody Competition Multispecies ELISA for the detection of anti-nucleoprotein (NP) antibodies of the Influenza A virus was carried out in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (ID Vet Innovative Diagnostics, Grabels, France). Briefly, the results were measured and recorded at the optical density (OD) at 450 nm using Thermo Labsystems Opsys MR (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA). For each sample, the competition percentage was calculated as follows: (sample OD value/negative serum control OD value × 100). The samples with a competition percentage of 45% or less were defined as positive and the samples with a competition percentage of 50% or more were considered as negative. A total of 495 serum samples were analyzed (410 for the time period 1 and 85 for the time period 2). </p>
