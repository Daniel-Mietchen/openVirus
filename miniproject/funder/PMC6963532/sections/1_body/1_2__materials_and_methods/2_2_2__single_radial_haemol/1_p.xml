<p>Antibodies were measured by single radial hemolysis (SRH) assay against the EIV strain A/equine/Jouars/4/06 (H3N8; Florida Clade 2), as previously described [
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-07-00174" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A control reference serum (A/equine/South Africa/4/03; H3N8; Florida Clade 1; reference Eu SA/4/03 Y0000712) from the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Healthcare (EDQM) was included on each plate and used to standardize the results [
 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-07-00174" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The titers of SRH antibody were expressed as the area of hemolysis (mm
 <sup>2</sup>). SRH antibody titers measured are correlated to protection (when there is no significant mismatch between the EIV vaccine and circulating strains); clinical signs of EI are significantly reduced when SRH antibody levels reach 85 mm
 <sup>2</sup> or greater, virus shedding is significantly reduced with SRH antibody titer of 154 mm
 <sup>2</sup> or greater [
