<p>The HA and neuraminidase (NA) sequences from 2018/2019 French EIV outbreak isolates were determined. The phylogenetic analysis was carried out for HA1 only. Gene was amplified in one-step after extraction. PCR products were generated using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen). HA and NA were amplified with M13 primer sequences as described previously [
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-07-00174" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Sequencing was performed by Biofidal (Vaulx en Velin, France) using the Sanger method. Sequences were assembled and contigs were analyzed with the CodonCode Aligner v1.5.2 software (CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA, USA). Multiple alignments of all sequences were conducted using the Muscle algorithm and neighbor-joining trees method (MEGA V7 software version 7.2.26, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA [
