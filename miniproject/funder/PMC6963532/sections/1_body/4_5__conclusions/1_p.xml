<p>These results have a field significance for both equine veterinarians and the scientific community. When extrapolated to a country level, they highlight the success of EI vaccination and are concomitant with a lack of detection of the pathogen and an absence of clinical EI in the horse population in France. This information is particularly timely; the French horse population has suffered from an extended epizooty of equine herpesvirus infection in early 2018, which could be an indirect consequence of a nationwide equine herpesvirus vaccine shortage in 2016 and potential modification of vaccination habit and coverage against this specific pathogen in 2017. As a result, this study and results could inspire equine veterinary practitioners and horse owners to continue and intensify their effort in terms of vaccination. While EI immune/vaccine coverage and EI vaccines commercially available are challenged by this FC1 EIV strain, the benefit of EI immunization in mitigating the disease severity and to reduce transmission remains clear. Further work is warranted to explain the 2019 EI epidemic. This study also highlights the beneficial use of serology as a meaningful tool to support disease surveillance and management in horses, not only to evaluate the immune coverage at a country level but also in sensitive populations or prior to exportation in order to prevent entry of unprotected horses into a new country/population.</p>
