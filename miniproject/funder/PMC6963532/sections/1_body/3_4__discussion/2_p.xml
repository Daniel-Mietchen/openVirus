<p>This study, which aimed to provide an idea of the immune/vaccine coverage against EI in the French horse population, used a serological test to evaluate the level of EIV-specific antibodies unlike equivalent studies in humans or horses that used questionnaires, epidemiological survey and provide vaccine coverage results based on owners and veterinarians confirmation of vaccination. The SRH assay was selected for this study due to the well-known and described correlation between SRH antibody titers and protection against EIV infection, development of clinical signs of EI and virus shedding. The EIV strain used as SRH antigen was selected to be close to the FC2 recommended vaccine strain A/eq/Richmond/07, which is contained in the HA recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine predominantly used in France. At the time of the serological study, EIV strains circulating in Europe were mostly belonging to the FC2 sub-lineage, which supported the SRH antigen choice. Cross-reactivity and cross-protection have also often been documented in recent vaccine clinical trials. Preliminary data indicates that serums used in this study also show cross-reactivity when tested against the FC1 EIV strain A/eq/Paris/1/2018, but further studies are warranted to explain the current EI epidemic in Europe. The current study aimed to be representative of the French horse population. However, some limitations were inevitable and should be taken into account for the interpretation of results: (i) four geographical regions that represented 57.5% of all French equids breeding centers were selected, with a known bias for Normandy due to the localization of the serum archive (i.e., LABÃ‰O). When adjusted on the number of breeding centers per region (cf.

 <sup>2</sup> (when compared with 87.6% without adjustment, cf. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00174-f001">Figure 1</xref>). (ii) Some horse populations are never visited by veterinary practitioners, for multiple reasons (e.g., economic, cultural, etc.). These populations, which are usually missed by the questionnaire and epidemiological surveys, are probably not represented in the current study. Obviously, such equids populations that are usually not vaccinated either, represent an important reservoir for pathogens and the weak link in any strategy of prevention.
