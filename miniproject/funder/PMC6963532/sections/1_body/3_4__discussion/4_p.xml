<p>The categories “breeding” and “exportation” present high protection rates that reach 87% at least (excepted for the “exportation” category from Pays de la Loire). This observation is not surprising because these categories are submitted to mandatory EI vaccination in France. For the covering season of stallions, some studbooks require that EI vaccination be carried out in accordance with the EI vaccine manufacturers recommendations (i.e., primary vaccination with two immunizations 4–6 weeks apart and a third dose 5 to 6 months after the last immunization, then annual boost immunization afterward) otherwise breeding cannot be authorized. Similarly, for mares, studbooks and horses, breeding centers require EI vaccination. The regulation to export horses is also strict. In most cases, the sanitary measures imposed by importing countries require that horses have received two immunizations prior to movement. The information available does not provide an explanation for the higher percentage of negative and &lt;85 mm
