<p>The overall immune coverage in 2018, which was estimated at 87.6%, was sufficient to prevent EI clinical cases induced by FC2 EIV strains circulating in the EU between 2015 and late 2018. Regretfully, such an immune coverage (based on historical SRH protection thresholds) was not high enough to prevent the 2018â€“2019 FC1 EIV strains circulation. However, it is very important to note that all known field and veterinary reports indicate that clinical signs of disease observed in EI vaccinated horses were clearly reduced when compared with unvaccinated animals, which continue to support the benefit of EI vaccination. Vaccination has probably slowed the spread of EI in France, which provided invaluable time to Equine Veterinary Practitioners.</p>
