<p>Recent data indicate that influenza vaccination coverage in the US is often below 60% in adult humans and below 45% in children [
 <xref rid="B6-vaccines-07-00174" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This present study uses a serological test to evaluate the level of specific antibodies to EIV unlike equivalent studies in humans that favor questionnaires and epidemiological surveys. The overall analysis of immune coverage in horses from the four French regions studied highlights that only 12.4% of horses were considered as unprotected, based on their SRH antibody level at the time of sampling. A large proportion of horses have reached the virological protection threshold (60.3% â‰¥ 154 mm
 <sup>2</sup>). Overall immune coverage is estimated at 87.6%, a level described by Satou and Nishiura (2006) [
 <xref rid="B12-vaccines-07-00174" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] as sufficient to protect an equine population against an equine influenza virus presenting a relatively low rate of transmission (retrospective study based on the 1971 EI outbreak in a Japanese racehorse facility). Such immune coverage in the French horse population studied could provide an explanation for a lack of detection of EIV and/or the disease between mid-2015 and late 2018, despite extensive surveillance by the RESPE and associated diagnostic laboratories (several hundreds of nasopharyngeal swab samples analyzed every year). Prior to this period, the last French EI outbreaks were reported in 2014 and 2015 but were limited in size and number (six and four, respectively) [

 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-07-00174" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While no or limited information is available, it would be interesting to investigate actual EI vaccine use and coverage in these countries to determine if more frequent and recurrent EI outbreaks recorded through the years may be explained by lower EI vaccination (e.g., anecdotal information based on the number of EI vaccine doses sold per year in relation to the number of horses may be used to calculate rough estimate of EI vaccine coverage).
