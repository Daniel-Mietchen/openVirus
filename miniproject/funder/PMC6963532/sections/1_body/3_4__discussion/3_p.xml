<p>Results for each French region selected in this study follow the same trend with protection rates reaching 84% to 87% (i.e., horses considered as vaccinated with clinical protection and reduced virus shedding in case of EIV infection). Some differences were measured between each sample’s categories. Results showed that “sale” and “diagnosis” categories were significantly lower when compared with other categories. Results indicate that after the exclusion of horses less than 2 years old at the time of sampling (born in 2016 and 2017), the immune coverage increased significantly from 79% to 96% for the “sale” category (in Normandy). A possible hypothesis is that horses born in 2016 and 2017 were sampled during their primary course of EI vaccination and may have not yet developed a complete and robust EI humoral immune response at the time of sampling. The results are correlated with a previous field study that highlighted a large frequency of Thoroughbred foals displaying low or negative SRH antibody titers during their primary EI immunization and up to 5 months after the third EI immunization (V3) [

 <sup>2</sup>) was greater than 25% at different sampling time points during the primary EI immunization (at the time of first immunization, two weeks and three months after the second immunization and two days after the third immunization) [

 <xref rid="B27-vaccines-07-00174" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In the present report, the frequency of horses located in Normandy and born in 2016 and 2017 with negative or low SRH titers was 49% and 42% for “sale” and “diagnosis” categories, respectively.
