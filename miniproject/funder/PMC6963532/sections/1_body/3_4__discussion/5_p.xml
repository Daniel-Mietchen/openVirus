<p>The use of an EIV NP-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) allows differentiating infected animals from horses vaccinated with the HA recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine (ProteqFlu

Horses infected with EIV or vaccinated with a whole inactivated EI vaccine produce antibodies against all viral proteins, including the EIV NP. These horses have a positive serological status for the NP (NP+) unlike horses immunized with the recombinant canarypox EI vaccine that seroconvert to HA only and therefore have a negative serological status for the NP (NP−) [

Emergency vaccination was implemented during the 2007 Australian EI outbreak and this specific vaccine was selected for its successful use in South Africa in 2003 and its DIVA ability, amongst other reasons. The possibility to differentiate infected animals from vaccinates was of a great importance for the Australian’s EI outbreak management because it allowed to monitored EIV transmission and disease spread in light of ring EI vaccination [

The use of a DIVA assay to evaluate EI vaccination coverage in an endemic situation depends on the type of EI vaccine available and used in the field (i.e., recombinant or whole inactivated EI vaccines). In France, based on anecdotal discussions with EI vaccine manufacturers, the HA recombinant canarypox-based EI vaccine is predominantly used. In our current study, the use of a DIVA test confirmed that the EI seropositivity of young horses (≤3 years) was primarily due to EI vaccination using this specific EI vaccine. The DIVA analysis showed that 83% of samples from young horses born in France and seropositive by SRH assay were EIV NP-seronegative compared to old horses for which only 52% were EIV NP-seronegative. This observation is consistent with the last EI outbreak registered in 2015 (RESPE) and the predominant use of this specific HA recombinant EI vaccine in France. Before 2015, EI cases have been occasionally observed, which could explain higher frequency of older horses seropositive for EIV-NP (48%). The high level of young horses seronegative for EIV-NP supports the RESPE surveillance data that reports no EI clinical case in France between mid-2015 and late 2018. While the use of whole inactivated EI vaccines may explain EIV-NP seropositivity for the other 17% of young horses born in France, a low level of EIV circulation in France could not entirely be ruled out. Only 53% of young horses born abroad were EIV-NP seronegative. These results could be explained by a broader diversity of EI vaccines used and possible EIV circulation in other countries. The use of the DIVA test revealed that 96% horses with SRH antibody titers equal to 0 mm
 <sup>2</sup> were also seronegative by NP-ELISA. In the absence of non-H3 equine influenza circulation, the remaining 4% (SRH negative and NP-ELISA) may be explained by a difference of sensitivity between the two assays. Hopefully, veterinary vaccine manufacturers will incorporate DIVA markers in their future EI vaccines, which will greatly benefit disease surveillance, would help to identify poor-vaccine responders and contribute to reducing fraudulent vaccination in horses in the long term (i.e., “pen vaccination”).
