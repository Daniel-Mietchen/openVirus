<p>The French horse population regroups 1.106 million horses (as recorded in 2016), which represents 15% of the European equid population with France placed third in terms of number behind Germany and the United Kingdom. Despite active disease surveillance that involves around 800 equine veterinary practitioners taking part in the French equine pathology epidemiological surveillance network (RESPE), EI has not been detected in France between mid-2015 to early December 2018 [

 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-07-00174" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Since early December 2018, several European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have reported unusual levels of EIV circulation. The number of EI outbreaks is staggering in some countries, with more than 200 outbreaks reported in the United Kingdom between January and October 2019, leading to a 6 day shutdown of horse racing in February (the last shutdown linked to EI dated from 1979) and more than 174 racing stables placed in lockdown with mandatory EIV testing. This situation, unseen in Europe since the late 1970s and 1980s, reminds us of the impact of the 5 months long EI in Australia in 2007, when over 76,000 horses were infected with EIV and with an economical cost reaching A$1 billion [
