<p>The current report aims to present and discuss the results from a large-scale sero-epidemiological study designed to provide a picture of the immunological status against EI of the French horse population in late 2017 and the first incursion in a decade of an FC1 EIV. These results should provide information about vaccine coverage and an explanation about the absence of reported EI outbreaks between mid-2015 and late 2018. Unlike previous studies on vaccination coverage against human and equine influenza A viruses, this study is based on an evaluation of antibody levels measured by single radial hemolysis assay (SRH), a well-recognized correlate of protection against EIV infection and by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which detects antibodies against the viral nucleoprotein (NP) of type A influenza viruses and could be used as a DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) marker in specific situations [

Due to the large-scale EI epizooty affecting France and other European countries since late 2018/early 2019, details of the French EI outbreaks will also be reported. A phylogenetic analysis of the EIV strains involved and the detail of amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein sequence and antigenic sites [
