<p>Due to the density of the equine population and a very high transmission capacity, prevention methods such as vaccination are essential to prevent or control EI outbreaks. The efficacy of vaccines against equine influenza virus (EIV) infection has been demonstrated through numerous clinical and field studies [

 <xref rid="B5-vaccines-07-00174" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] but little or no information is available about EI immunity in the field and vaccine coverage in horse populations. In humans, most of the studies that investigate vaccination coverage are based on an epidemiological questionnaire and showed that the influenza vaccination coverage is often less than 60% [

A postal questionnaire survey of randomly selected horse owners in Great Britain has reported a frequency of vaccination against EI and tetanus of 71.3% [

Through a retrospective mathematical modeling study of the 1971 Japanese EI outbreak in racehorse facilities, Satou and Nishiura calculated that 50% to 80% of an equine population should be vaccinated with a completely effective EI vaccine to achieve protection against an EIV strain with a relatively low to moderate rate of transmission, respectively. Taking into account that sterilizing immunity is rarely achieved by EI immunization and that EI vaccines efficacy wanes with time, the author also provided a more realistic vaccine coverage threshold of 86.5% [
