<p>The SRH antibody titers of the 2645 serum samples analyzed are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00174-f001">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-vaccines-07-00174">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. Of these samples, 12.4% (
 <italic>n</italic> = 328) were below 85 mm
 <sup>2</sup> (i.e., horses considered to be at risk of infection), including 190 samples with SRH antibody titer = 0 mm
 <sup>2</sup> and 138 seropositive samples (57.5 ± 17.4 mm
 <sup>2</sup>). Of remaining samples, 27.3% were ≥85 mm
 <sup>2</sup> and &lt;154 mm
 <sup>2</sup> (128.1 ± 19.1 mm
 <sup>2</sup>; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 721; i.e., horses considered as clinically protected) and 60.3% ≥ 154 mm
 <sup>2</sup> (194.8 ± 28 mm
 <sup>2</sup>; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1596; i.e., horses considered as optimally immunised with clinical protection and little or no virus shedding in case of EIV infection). Overall, 87.6% of serum samples tested possessed SRH antibody titers above the clinical protection threshold (85 mm
 <sup>2</sup>).
