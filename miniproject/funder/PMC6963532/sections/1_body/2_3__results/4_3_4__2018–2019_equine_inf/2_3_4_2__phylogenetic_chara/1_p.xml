<p>The HA genes from five EIV strains (EI outbreaks #1, #2, #3, #9 and #11) and the NA genes from two EIV strains (#2 and #9) were sequenced. Results reveals that H3N8 EIV strains at the origin of the 2018â€“2019 French outbreaks A/eq/Paris/1/2018 (MK501760), A/eq/Pas-de-Calais/1/2018 (MK501761 and MK501801), A/eq/Ardennes/1/2018 (MK501762), A/eq/Orne/1/2019 and A/eq/Calvados/1/2019 (MK501763 and MK501802) belong to the FC1 sub-lineage (

HA gene sequencing reveals two amino-acid substitutions (p.T163I and p.A372T) when compared with FC1 EIV strains isolated in South America in 2018 (A/eq/Concepcion/RO6C/2018 and A/eq/Santiago/TT3A/2018), but 13 amino-acid substitutions with the closest FC1 EI vaccine strain A/eq/Ohio/03 (
