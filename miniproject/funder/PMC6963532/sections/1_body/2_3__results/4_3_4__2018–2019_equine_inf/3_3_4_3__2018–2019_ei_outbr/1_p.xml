<p>The EI vaccination status at the time of infection was unknown for 134 horses. Vaccination status was known for 112 horses, with 68 (60.7%) declared as vaccinated against EI and 44 (39.3%) as unvaccinated (
 <xref rid="vaccines-07-00174-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Regretfully, details of EI vaccines used and the date of last vaccination were unknown for the majority of cases. Vaccination passports were available for 14 horses from 4 different outbreaks. As shown in 
 <xref rid="vaccines-07-00174-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the time between infection/disease and last vaccination ranged from 1 month to 19.5 months. Thirteen out of fourteen horses received the recombinant canarypox-based HA vaccine (C) for their last EI immunization. All horses had annual or bi-annual boost immunizations prior to infection, with the exception of horse #4 that developed EI signs of disease 2 months after V3 and horse #7 that was infected 3.5 months after V2. Serum samples were obtained at the onset of clinical signs of diseases from 11 out of 14 horses, with 9 negatives by DIVA test, one providing a borderline result (#7) and one positive (#1), which indicates a possible seroconversion due to EIV infection or a reminiscent NP antibody response linked to a past immunization with a whole inactivated EI vaccine (W1), 17.5 months prior to sampling. SRH analyses shown that horse #7 had no measurable SRH antibody titer at the time of infection, which could be linked to the immunity gap frequently observed in the weeks preceding V3. Five out of eleven horses (#3, #4, #8, #9 and #13) had an SRH antibody titer below the clinical protection threshold (i.e., 85 mm
 <sup>2</sup>). Three horses (#1, #5 and #10) had an SRH antibody titer between the clinical protection threshold and the virological protection threshold (i.e., 154 mm
 <sup>2</sup>). One horse (#6) had an SRH antibody titer above the virological protection threshold at the time of infection.
