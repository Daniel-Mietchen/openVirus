<p>Three hundred and fifty-nine (359) serum samples obtained from late December 2018 to April 2019 (time period 2) from horses located in the north of France were analyzed by SRH (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00174-f007">Figure 7</xref>A) and compared with results from time period 1 (i.e., 2017–2018). A significant difference was measured between the two groups (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.013) with an increased frequency of samples &gt;154 mm
 <sup>2</sup>. Seventy-six (76) of these serum samples were analyzed with the EIV NP ELISA (DIVA test) in order to measure an eventual NP-specific antibody seroconversion. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vaccines-07-00174-f007">Figure 7</xref>B, the percent of SRH+ NP+ serums reached 42%, when compared with only 14% for serum samples obtained during time period 1 from horses located in Normandy (geographically close to the north of France) and ≤3 years old at the time of sampling (i.e., born after 2015; 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.0024), while it remained unchanged in older horses. While vaccination status is unknown and with the assumption that the type of EI vaccine used as not significantly changed, such increase tends to support circulation of EIV during this period of time.
