<p>Nearly 9% (8.8%) of serum samples from horses located in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21) were below 85 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, including 4.2% samples with SRH antibody titer = 0 mm
 <sup>2</sup>. Of the samples, 31.3% were ≥85 mm
 <sup>2</sup> and &lt;154 mm
 <sup>2</sup> (126.6 ± 20.6 mm
 <sup>2</sup>; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 75) and 60.0% were ≥154 mm
 <sup>2</sup> (198.3 ± 31.0 mm
 <sup>2</sup>; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 144). Overall, 91.3% of serum samples tested possessed SRH antibody titers above the clinical protection threshold (85 mm
 <sup>2</sup>). A significant difference was observed between the serum samples from horses located in this region and those based in others (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.016). No difference was measured between the two categories analyzed (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.14).
