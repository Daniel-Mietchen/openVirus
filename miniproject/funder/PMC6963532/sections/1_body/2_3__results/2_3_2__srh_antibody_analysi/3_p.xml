<p>Sixteen percent of serum samples from horses located in Pays de la Loire (
 <italic>n</italic> = 43) were below 85 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, including 10.4% samples with SRH antibody titer = 0 mm
 <sup>2</sup>. Of these samples, 30.5% were ≥85 mm
 <sup>2</sup> and &lt;154 mm
 <sup>2</sup> (130.6 ± 19.5 mm
 <sup>2</sup>; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 82) and 53.5% ≥154 mm
 <sup>2</sup> (196.4 ± 28.3 mm
 <sup>2</sup>; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 144). Overall, 84% of serum samples tested possessed SRH antibody titers above the clinical protection threshold (85 mm
 <sup>2</sup>). A significant difference was observed between the serum samples from horses located in this region and those based in Normandy and Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.027). The breeding category showed a frequency of serum samples with SRH antibody titers above 85 mm
 <sup>2</sup> significantly higher (97.9%; 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.00081) compared to exportation, diagnosis and sale categories (63.8%, 80.6% and 77.8%, respectively).
