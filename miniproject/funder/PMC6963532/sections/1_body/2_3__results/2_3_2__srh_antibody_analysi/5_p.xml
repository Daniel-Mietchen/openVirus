<p>For serum samples from horses based in Occitanie, 13.7% of these samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 41) were below 85 mm
 <sup>2</sup>, including 20 samples with SRH antibody titer = 0mm
 <sup>2</sup> and 21 samples seroconverted (57.7 ± 20.2 mm
 <sup>2</sup>). 31.4% of samples were ≥85 mm
 <sup>2</sup> and &lt;154 mm
 <sup>2</sup> (127.3 ± 18.9 mm
 <sup>2</sup>; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 94) and 54.8% were ≥154 mm

 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.04). No significant difference has been shown between breeding and diagnosis categories. The frequency of serum samples, for both categories, with SRH antibody titers above the clinical protection threshold was 87%.
