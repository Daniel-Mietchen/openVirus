<p>A comparison of EIV NP ELISA results between serum samples from young (â‰¤3 years) and old (&gt;3 years) horses (i.e., at the time of sampling) that were seropositive by SRH test was carried out. The ELISA results showed that 83% of serums (
 <italic>n</italic> = 136) from young horses born in France were NP-ELISA negative when compared with serums from old horses (
 <italic>n</italic> = 128) for which 52% were NP-ELISA negative. This difference was significant (
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.00001). A significant difference was also observed between serum samples from young horses born in France (
 <italic>n</italic> = 126) and abroad (
 <italic>n</italic> = 15; 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.006), the NP-ELISA negative for serum samples from horses born abroad was 53%. Only 26% of samples from old horses were negative by NP-ELISA (
