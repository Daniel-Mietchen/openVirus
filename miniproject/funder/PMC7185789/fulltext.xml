We enrolled healthy adults aged 18&#x02013;50 years; exclusion criteria included previous infection or treatment of MERS. Eligible participants were enrolled sequentially using a dose-escalation protocol to receive 0&#x000b7;67 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300 administered by trained clinical site staff via a single intramuscular 1 mL injection at each vaccination at baseline, week 4, and week 12 followed immediately by co-localised intramuscular electroporation. Enrolment into the higher dose groups occurred after a safety monitoring committee reviewed the data following vaccination of the first five participants at the previous lower dose in each group. The primary outcome of the study was safety, assessed in all participants who received at least one study treatment and for whom post-dose study data were available, during the vaccination period with follow-up through to 48 weeks after dose 3. Safety was measured by the incidence of adverse events; administration site reactions and pain; and changes in safety laboratory parameters. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity.

No vaccine-associated serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, reported in 70 participants (93%) of 75. Overall, 73 participants (97%) of 75 reported at least one solicited adverse event; the most common systemic symptoms were headache (five [20%] with 0&#x000b7;67 mg, 11 [44%] with 2 mg, and seven [28%] with 6 mg), and malaise or fatigue (five [20%] with 0&#x000b7;67 mg, seven [28%] with 2 mg, and two [8%] with 6 mg). The most common local solicited symptoms were administration site pain (23 [92%] with all three doses) and tenderness (21 [84%] with all three doses). Most solicited symptoms were reported as mild (19 [76%] with 0&#x000b7;67 mg, 20 [80%] with 2 mg, and 17 [68%] with 6 mg) and were self-limiting. Unsolicited symptoms were reported for 56 participants (75%) of 75 and were deemed treatment-related for 26 (35%). The most common unsolicited adverse events were infections, occurring in 27 participants (36%); six (8%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment. There were no laboratory abnormalities of grade 3 or higher that were related to study treatment; laboratory abnormalities were uncommon, except for 15 increases in creatine phosphokinase in 14 participants (three participants in the 0&#x000b7;67 mg group, three in the 2 mg group, and seven in the 6 mg group). Of these 15 increases, five (33%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment (one in the 2 mg group and four in the 6 mg group). Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 59 (86%) of 69 participants and 61 (94%) of 65 participants after two and three vaccinations, respectively. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 34 (50%) of 68 participants. T-cell responses were detected in 47 (71%) of 66 participants after two vaccinations and in 44 (76%) of 58 participants after three vaccinations. There were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks. At week 60, vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were detected in 51 (77%) of 66 participants and 42 (64%) of 66, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>The GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus vaccine was well tolerated with no vaccine-associated serious adverse events. Immune responses were dose-independent, detected in more than 85% of participants after two vaccinations, and durable through 1 year of follow-up.

<bold>Evidence before this study</bold>
</p><p id="para30">There are no licensed vaccines to prevent or therapeutics to treat Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. The GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine tested in this phase 1 clinical trial has previously been reported to be immunogenic in mice, camels, and non-human primates, and to protect non-human primates from clinical disease in a challenge model of pulmonary infection. We searched the US National Library of Medicine, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.Gov" id="interrefs30">ClinicalTrials.Gov</ext-link>, and the European Union Clinical Trials Register databases to identify any clinical trials of MERS coronavirus vaccines using the terms &#x0201c;MERS&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;MERS-CoV&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Middle East Respiratory Syndrome&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;vaccine&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;phase&#x0201d;, and clinical trial&#x0201d;. To our knowledge, no other data from a human clinical trial of a MERS coronavirus vaccine has been reported to date.</p><p id="para40">
<bold>Added value of this study</bold>
</p><p id="para50">This study showed that the GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine was tolerable and immunogenic in humans. The vaccine induced both antibody-based and cellular MERS coronavirus-specific immune responses. The study also compared vaccine-specific responses with those from individuals who had recovered from natural MERS coronavirus infection during the 2015 Korean outbreak. The results showed that the immune responses generated in vaccinated study participants were similar to convalescent responses after natural infection.</p><p id="para60">
<bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
</p><p id="para70">The unpredictability of zoonotic transmission and a general decrease in the number of cases of MERS coronavirus in the Middle East will make future placebo-controlled trials challenging. Future testing of GLS-5300 is ongoing in a phase 1b/2a trial in South Korea and additional randomised clinical trials are being planned to test the vaccine in endemic regions. The GLS-5300 vaccine might have potential value in the response to any future MERS coronavirus oubreaks. The global public health community should maintain strong interest in the development of a vaccine that is safe and effective to control any potential situation of a MERS coronavirus outbreak.</p></boxed-text>

The safety analysis population included all participants who received at least one study treatment and for whom post-dose safety data were available, and were analysed as to the treatment they received. The per-protocol analysis population was used for the clinical study report's primary analysis and included participants who received all vaccine doses, had no major protocol deviations, and had primary endpoint data available. Because ten (13%) participants were excluded from the per-protocol analysis, the more inclusive modified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of immunogenicity, comprised all participants who received at least one dose of GLS-5300, is presented to support the main analysis. Participants in this population were grouped according to their original treatment assignment. S1-ELISA, full-length S-ELISA, and EMC-2012 Vero neutralisation assay results are reported as geometric mean endpoint titres with 95% CIs for each dose-group at each timepoint. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare values by dose at each timepoint. Fisher's exact test was used to compare S1 ELISA response rates by group. Two-sided t tests were used to compare mean IFN-&#x003b3;-ELISPOT values between groups. Intracellular cytokine staining data are reported as the mean frequency with 95% CI of MERS coronavirus S-peptide-stimulated cytokine responses in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p-value of less than 0&#x000b7;05 and were nominal as we did not adjust for multiple comparisons. Differences between acute and convalescent samples from natural MERS coronavirus infections and week 14 GLS-5300 samples were assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison.

Convalescent T-cell responses in naturally infected individuals were broad-based, spanning the S-glycoprotein (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 7</xref>) with mean total spot-forming units per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 110 (SD 108&#x000b7;0) versus 472 (817&#x000b7;6) induced by GLS-5300 at week 14, although the difference was not significant (p=0&#x000b7;17).</p></sec><sec id="cesec90"><title>Discussion</title><p id="para330">In our study, GLS-5300 DNA vaccine against MERS coronavirus was well tolerated, and no vaccine-associated serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events were injection site reactions, consistent with findings from other published clinical trial reports of DNA vaccines or placebo co-administered through intramuscular injection and electroporation.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> The vaccine was immunogenic, inducing seroconversion and T-cell responses in most participants. S1-ELISA binding antibody seroconversion and T-cell responses were rapid. Vaccine induced immune responses were durable, as most participants maintained detectable S1 binding antibodies and had cellular immune responses at almost 1 year after the last vaccination. The vaccine-induced antibody and cellular immune responses were similar to those in the convalescent phase from samples in patients who recovered from natural MERS coronavirus infection. Finally, GLS-5300 vaccination induced polyfunctional CD8+ T-cell responses that have been shown to correlate with less severe disease and lower MERS coronavirus shedding.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Immune responses to GLS-5300 were dose-independent across a nearly 10-fold dose range (0&#x000b7;67 mg to 6 mg per vaccination) suggesting further dose reductions might be possible. A lower dose could extend the vaccine supply in an outbreak situation.</p><p id="para340">GLS-5300 is the first MERS coronavirus vaccine to advance into human trials. Among vaccine candidates in development,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> four have started or will soon start phase 1 testing, including measles-vectored,<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> and modified vaccinia Ankara-vectored vaccines, all expressing full-length S-glycoprotein.<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> DNA vaccines and viral-vectored vaccines use recombinant technology that allows for rapid vaccine design in response to emerging infectious diseases. DNA vaccines have additional advantages in rapid manufacture and avoidance of potential toxicities that might occur in live viral-vectored vaccines. Underscoring the potential for rapid deployment of DNA vaccines, GLS-5300 was advanced into the clinic within 9 months of pre-clinical vaccine candidate selection.</p><p id="para350">Our phase 1 study was not designed to measure GLS-5300 efficacy, as this would require larger randomised studies in a MERS coronavirus-endemic region. Our study had other limitations: as a first-in-man trial primarily assessing vaccine safety, the study was open-label and single-arm rather than a randomised, placebo-controlled, clinical trial (the absence of a placebo group could introduce bias on behalf of investigators or participants). Additionally, the study was not statistically powered to measure any specific outcome, which limits our ability to detect rare events.</p><p id="para360">In conclusion, this phase 1 clinical trial showed a tolerable safety profile and robust immunogenicity for GLS-5300, a MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine candidate. GLS-5300 vaccination induced similar cellular and antibody responses to those in patients recovered from MERS coronavirus natural infection. An ongoing phase 1/2 a study in South Korea (<ext-link ext-link-type="ClinicalTrials.gov" xlink:href="NCT03721718" id="interrefs60">NCT03721718</ext-link>) will provide additional information on the immunogenicity of GLS-5300 delivered by intradermal injection followed by electroporation and the ability to further reduce the DNA vaccine dose. Additional studies are required to test the efficacy of GLS-5300 in a region endemic for MERS coronavirus. A phase 2 trial is being planned to assess GLS-5300 in the Middle East and South Korea, areas which have been most affected by MERS coronavirus infection. A general decrease in the number of cases of MERS in the Middle East will make future placebo-controlled trials challenging. However, the global public health community should maintain interest in the development of a vaccine that is safe and effective to control any potential future outbreaks.</p><p id="para370">
