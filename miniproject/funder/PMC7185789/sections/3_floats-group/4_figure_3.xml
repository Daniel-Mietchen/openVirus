  <p>Vaccine-associated cellular responses</p>
  <p>Cellular responses to Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus S peptides were determined by IFNÎ³-enzyme-linked immunospot assay for available specimens of peripheral blood mononuclear cells at each timepoint in the modified intention-to-treat dataset. (A) shows the proportion of participants with a positive response. (B) shows the total spot-forming units per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells as the sum of average responses to each of the five peptide pools by participants' peripheral blood mononuclear cells in each group at each time, with a representation of the region of the S glycoprotein included in each peptide pool below.</p>
