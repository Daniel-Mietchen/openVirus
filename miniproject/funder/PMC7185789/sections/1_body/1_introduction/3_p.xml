<p id="para100">Correlates of protection from MERS coronavirus infection and disease have not been definitively established. Animal challenge studies have shown protection for several vaccines;

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> however, clearly discriminating between binding antibodies, neutralising antibodies, and T-cell responses as the determinant of protection is not possible. Both humoral and cellular immunity probably play a substantial role in viral clearance and mitigation of human clinical disease. MERS coronavirus infection induces neutralising antibodies that persist for several years.
