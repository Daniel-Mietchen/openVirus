<p id="para310">Vaccination with GLS-5300 induced MERS coronavirus S-specific IFN γ-ELISPOT responses in 66 participants overall (88%) of 75, with T-cell responses in 47 participants (71%) of 66 at week 12 after the second vaccination, and in 44 (76%) of 58 at week 14 after the third vaccination. 42 participants (64%) of 66 maintained IFN γ-ELISPOT cellular responses through to the end of the study at week 60 (

Except for a higher response at week 6 for the 0·67 mg group versus the 2 mg group and at week 36 for the 6 mg group versus the 2 mg group, there were no differences in T-cell responses between dose groups (
