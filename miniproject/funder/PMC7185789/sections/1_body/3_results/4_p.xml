<p id="para290">59 (94%) of 63 participants had measurable MERS coronavirus S1 binding antibodies at 2 weeks after the third vaccination at week 14 (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2A</xref> ). Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 48 participants (66%) of 73 at week 4 just before the second vaccination, and in 59 (86%) of 69 at week 12 just before the third vaccination. There were no differences in S1-ELISA response rates between dose groups from week 4 onward (

 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 12</xref>). S1-ELISA seroconversion was also noted in 59 participants (86%) of 69 after two vaccinations and in 61 (94%) of 65 after three vaccinations. S1 ELISA seroreactivity was maintained in 52 participants (79%) of 66 up to study end at week 60. There was a significant difference in S1-ELISA geometric mean endpoint titres between dose groups at week 1, with none thereafter (
