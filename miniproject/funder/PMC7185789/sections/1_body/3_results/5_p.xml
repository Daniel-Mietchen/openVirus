<p id="para300">Neutralising antibodies against MERS coronavirus EMC-2012 infection of Vero cells were detected in 27 participants (43%) of 63 at week 14 and 25 (39%) of 65 at week 24, but only two (3%) of 66 maintained neutralisation activity to end of study. Overall, 34 participants (50%) of 68 had detectable neutralising antibodies at one or more timepoints during the study. Half-maximal neutralising geometric mean endpoint titres peaked at week 14 with a range between 7·9 and 508 (
