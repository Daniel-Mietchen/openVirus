<p id="para270">67 (89%) of the enrolled participants completed the entire three-dose vaccination series (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, reported in 70 participants (93%) of 75. 73 participants (97%) of 75 reported at least one solicited adverse event (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref> ; 
 <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 3</xref>). One or more injection-site reactions were reported by 92% or more participants in all dose groups. Systemic reactions were reported by 32% of participants in the 0Â·67 mg group, 62% in the 2 mg group and 32% in the 6 mg dose group. The most common solicited systemic adverse event was headache, followed by malaise or fatigue, and myalgia; most solicited adverse events were mild in all groups. One participant in the 6 mg dose group reported one episode of severe induration following the third vaccination that resolved within 24 h. One serious adverse event was reported: a second-degree burn reported to have occurred 15 days after the third vaccination. The participant provided no further information and did not return for follow-up. The principal investigator deemed the incident as unrelated to study treatment.
