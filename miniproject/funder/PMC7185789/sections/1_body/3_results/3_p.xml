Of unsolicited adverse events, 27 (36%) were infections, of which 24 (89%) were seasonal including 21 upper respiratory tract or viral infections (88%), two occurrences of non-specific or bacterial pharyngitis (8%), and one of otitis (4%). Other infections included single episodes of gastroenteritis, nematode infection, and oral herpetic infection. No infections were considered by the principal investigator as definitely related to study treatment; four upper respiratory tract infections, one oral herpes, and one ear infection were considered as possibly related to study treatment.
