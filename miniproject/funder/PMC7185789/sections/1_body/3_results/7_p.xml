<p id="para320">Between Dec 27, 2016, and April 1, 2017, ten adults, previously infected with MERS, were enrolled for the separate MERS coronavirus natural-infection sample collection study (median age 55·5 years, IQR 36·0–56·2). All ten participants (100%) had measurable binding antibodies by S1-ELISA in acute and convalescent samples (

Compared with vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses, antibody titres following natural infection were significantly higher in the acute phase in MERS-infected participants but were not different than vaccine for S1-ELISA or neutralising antibodies in convalescent samples (
