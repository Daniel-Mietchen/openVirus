<p id="para170">Participants were enrolled sequentially using a dose-escalation protocol to receive GLS-5300 at one of three doses: 0·67 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg per vaccination, with enrolment into higher dose groups occurring after a safety monitoring committee reviewed the data following vaccination of the first five participants at the previous lower dose in each group. GLS-5300 was administered to participants by trained clinical site staff as a single 1 mL intramuscular deltoid injection followed immediately by colocalised intramuscular electroporation to enhance cellular entry of plasmid DNA with the Cellectra-5P Adaptive Constant Current Electroporation device (Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) as described previously
