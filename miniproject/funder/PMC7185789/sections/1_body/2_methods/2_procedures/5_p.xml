<p id="para200">Whole blood was collected and processed for peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation at the same timepoints as collection of serum samples, except peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which were collected at only one early timepoint between the first two vaccinations (week 1, 2, 3, or 4). T-cell responses were measured by IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assays (IFN-γ-ELISPOT) after incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with pools of overlapping 15-mer peptides (44–45 peptides per pool) spanning the entire MERS coronavirus S-glycoprotein. IFN-γ-ELISPOT responses were reported as spot-forming units per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the total of five MERS S peptide pools. A positive response to vaccination was defined as twice the study mean at baseline: at least 141 spot-forming units per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Additionally, multiparameter intracellular cytokine staining flow cytometry to detect CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α, IL-2, or IL-4 following MERS coronavirus S-peptide stimulation was done with evaluable samples at baseline and week 14 (
