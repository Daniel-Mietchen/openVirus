<p id="para230">The secondary outcome of this study was immunogenicity. We assessed the cellular and humoral responses to GLS-5300 overall and by dose. Humoral immunogenicity was assessed by qualitative and quantitative ELISAs of binding antibody titres to the S1 glycoprotein subunit and the full-length MERS coronavirus S glycoprotein, and of neutralising antibodies against MERS coronavirus strain EMC2012 on Vero cells. Antigen-specific cellular immune responses to MERS coronavirus S glycoprotein were assessed using IFN-γ-ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining assays. Exploratory outcomes were: comparison of S binding antibody and MERS CoV neutralising antibody titres; kinetics and durability of S binding antibody and MERS coronavirus neutralising antibody titres; comparison of IFN-γ ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining responses across different vaccine doses; kinetics and durability of IFN-γ ELISPOT; expression of the full length MERS coronavirus S protein in peripheral blood over time; host immune-genotyping when available; epitope mapping of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte responses; immunophenotyping and functional characterisation of cellular subsets of interest, including natural killer cells; and isolation, expression, and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies against the MERS coronavirus S protein and assessment of their neutralising and non-neutralising functional activity (study protocol,
