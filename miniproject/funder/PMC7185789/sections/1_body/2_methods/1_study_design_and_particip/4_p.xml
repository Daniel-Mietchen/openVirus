<p id="para150">A separate MERS coronavirus natural-infection sample collection study enrolled participants at the Seoul National University Hospital (SNUH; Seoul, South Korea). Eligible participants were adults previously infected with MERS coronavirus during the outbreak in South Korea in 2015 who had recovered from the illness. Serum was collected from naturally infected participants at the time of acute illness and diagnosis in 2015. Participants were asked to return in 2016â€“17 for collection of convalescent phase serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This study was reviewed and approved by the SNUH institutional review board and all participants provided written informed consent before enrolment.</p>
