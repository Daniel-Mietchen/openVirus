  </p>
  <p id="para30">There are no licensed vaccines to prevent or therapeutics to treat Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. The GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine tested in this phase 1 clinical trial has previously been reported to be immunogenic in mice, camels, and non-human primates, and to protect non-human primates from clinical disease in a challenge model of pulmonary infection. We searched the US National Library of Medicine, 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.Gov" id="interrefs30" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">ClinicalTrials.Gov</ext-link>, and the European Union Clinical Trials Register databases to identify any clinical trials of MERS coronavirus vaccines using the terms “MERS”, “MERS-CoV”, “Middle East Respiratory Syndrome”, “vaccine”, “phase”, and clinical trial”. To our knowledge, no other data from a human clinical trial of a MERS coronavirus vaccine has been reported to date.

   <bold>Added value of this study</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para50">This study showed that the GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine was tolerable and immunogenic in humans. The vaccine induced both antibody-based and cellular MERS coronavirus-specific immune responses. The study also compared vaccine-specific responses with those from individuals who had recovered from natural MERS coronavirus infection during the 2015 Korean outbreak. The results showed that the immune responses generated in vaccinated study participants were similar to convalescent responses after natural infection.</p>

   <bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold>
  </p>
  <p id="para70">The unpredictability of zoonotic transmission and a general decrease in the number of cases of MERS coronavirus in the Middle East will make future placebo-controlled trials challenging. Future testing of GLS-5300 is ongoing in a phase 1b/2a trial in South Korea and additional randomised clinical trials are being planned to test the vaccine in endemic regions. The GLS-5300 vaccine might have potential value in the response to any future MERS coronavirus oubreaks. The global public health community should maintain strong interest in the development of a vaccine that is safe and effective to control any potential situation of a MERS coronavirus outbreak.</p>
