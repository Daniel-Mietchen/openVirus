<p id="para350">Our phase 1 study was not designed to measure GLS-5300 efficacy, as this would require larger randomised studies in a MERS coronavirus-endemic region. Our study had other limitations: as a first-in-man trial primarily assessing vaccine safety, the study was open-label and single-arm rather than a randomised, placebo-controlled, clinical trial (the absence of a placebo group could introduce bias on behalf of investigators or participants). Additionally, the study was not statistically powered to measure any specific outcome, which limits our ability to detect rare events.</p>
