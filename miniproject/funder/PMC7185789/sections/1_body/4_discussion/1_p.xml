<p id="para330">In our study, GLS-5300 DNA vaccine against MERS coronavirus was well tolerated, and no vaccine-associated serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events were injection site reactions, consistent with findings from other published clinical trial reports of DNA vaccines or placebo co-administered through intramuscular injection and electroporation.

 </xref> The vaccine was immunogenic, inducing seroconversion and T-cell responses in most participants. S1-ELISA binding antibody seroconversion and T-cell responses were rapid. Vaccine induced immune responses were durable, as most participants maintained detectable S1 binding antibodies and had cellular immune responses at almost 1 year after the last vaccination. The vaccine-induced antibody and cellular immune responses were similar to those in the convalescent phase from samples in patients who recovered from natural MERS coronavirus infection. Finally, GLS-5300 vaccination induced polyfunctional CD8+ T-cell responses that have been shown to correlate with less severe disease and lower MERS coronavirus shedding.

 </xref> Immune responses to GLS-5300 were dose-independent across a nearly 10-fold dose range (0Â·67 mg to 6 mg per vaccination) suggesting further dose reductions might be possible. A lower dose could extend the vaccine supply in an outbreak situation.
