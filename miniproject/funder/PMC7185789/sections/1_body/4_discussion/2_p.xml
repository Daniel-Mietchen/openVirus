DNA vaccines have additional advantages in rapid manufacture and avoidance of potential toxicities that might occur in live viral-vectored vaccines. Underscoring the potential for rapid deployment of DNA vaccines, GLS-5300 was advanced into the clinic within 9 months of pre-clinical vaccine candidate selection.
