<p id="para360">In conclusion, this phase 1 clinical trial showed a tolerable safety profile and robust immunogenicity for GLS-5300, a MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine candidate. GLS-5300 vaccination induced similar cellular and antibody responses to those in patients recovered from MERS coronavirus natural infection. An ongoing phase 1/2 a study in South Korea (

Additional studies are required to test the efficacy of GLS-5300 in a region endemic for MERS coronavirus. A phase 2 trial is being planned to assess GLS-5300 in the Middle East and South Korea, areas which have been most affected by MERS coronavirus infection. A general decrease in the number of cases of MERS in the Middle East will make future placebo-controlled trials challenging. However, the global public health community should maintain interest in the development of a vaccine that is safe and effective to control any potential future outbreaks.
