Background</div> <p>Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus causes a highly fatal lower-respiratory tract infection. There are as yet no licensed MERS vaccines or therapeutics. This study (WRAIR-2274) assessed the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine in healthy adults.</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p>This study was a phase 1, open-label, single-arm, dose-escalation study of GLS-5300 done at the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research Clinical Trials Center (Silver Spring, MD, USA). We enrolled healthy adults aged 18–50 years; exclusion criteria included previous infection or treatment of MERS. Eligible participants were enrolled sequentially using a dose-escalation protocol to receive 0·67 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300 administered by trained clinical site staff via a single intramuscular 1 mL injection at each vaccination at baseline, week 4, and week 12 followed immediately by co-localised intramuscular electroporation. Enrolment into the higher dose groups occurred after a safety monitoring committee reviewed the data following vaccination of the first five participants at the previous lower dose in each group. The primary outcome of the study was safety, assessed in all participants who received at least one study treatment and for whom post-dose study data were available, during the vaccination period with follow-up through to 48 weeks after dose 3. Safety was measured by the incidence of adverse events; administration site reactions and pain; and changes in safety laboratory parameters. The secondary outcome was immunogenicity.

Findings</div> <p>Between Feb 17 and July 22, 2016, we enrolled 75 individuals and allocated 25 each to 0·67 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300. No vaccine-associated serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events were injection-site reactions, reported in 70 participants (93%) of 75. Overall, 73 participants (97%) of 75 reported at least one solicited adverse event; the most common systemic symptoms were headache (five [20%] with 0·67 mg, 11 [44%] with 2 mg, and seven [28%] with 6 mg), and malaise or fatigue (five [20%] with 0·67 mg, seven [28%] with 2 mg, and two [8%] with 6 mg). The most common local solicited symptoms were administration site pain (23 [92%] with all three doses) and tenderness (21 [84%] with all three doses). Most solicited symptoms were reported as mild (19 [76%] with 0·67 mg, 20 [80%] with 2 mg, and 17 [68%] with 6 mg) and were self-limiting. Unsolicited symptoms were reported for 56 participants (75%) of 75 and were deemed treatment-related for 26 (35%). The most common unsolicited adverse events were infections, occurring in 27 participants (36%); six (8%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment. There were no laboratory abnormalities of grade 3 or higher that were related to study treatment; laboratory abnormalities were uncommon, except for 15 increases in creatine phosphokinase in 14 participants (three participants in the 0·67 mg group, three in the 2 mg group, and seven in the 6 mg group). Of these 15 increases, five (33%) were deemed possibly related to study treatment (one in the 2 mg group and four in the 6 mg group). Seroconversion measured by S1-ELISA occurred in 59 (86%) of 69 participants and 61 (94%) of 65 participants after two and three vaccinations, respectively. Neutralising antibodies were detected in 34 (50%) of 68 participants. T-cell responses were detected in 47 (71%) of 66 participants after two vaccinations and in 44 (76%) of 58 participants after three vaccinations. There were no differences in immune responses between dose groups after 6 weeks. At week 60, vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were detected in 51 (77%) of 66 participants and 42 (64%) of 66, respectively.</p> </div> <div class="interpretation" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Interpretation</div> <p>The GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus vaccine was well tolerated with no vaccine-associated serious adverse events. Immune responses were dose-independent, detected in more than 85% of participants after two vaccinations, and durable through 1 year of follow-up. The data support further development of the GLS-5300 vaccine, including additional studies to test the efficacy of GLS-5300 in a region endemic for MERS coronavirus.</p> </div> <div class="funding" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Research in context</div>  <p id="para20"><b>Evidence before this study</b></p> <p id="para30">There are no licensed vaccines to prevent or therapeutics to treat Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infection. The GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine tested in this phase 1 clinical trial has previously been reported to be immunogenic in mice, camels, and non-human primates, and to protect non-human primates from clinical disease in a challenge model of pulmonary infection. We searched the US National Library of Medicine, <a href="http://ClinicalTrials.Gov">ClinicalTrials.Gov</a>, and the European Union Clinical Trials Register databases to identify any clinical trials of MERS coronavirus vaccines using the terms "MERS�?, "MERS-CoV�?, "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome�?, "vaccine�?, "phase�?, and clinical trial�?. To our knowledge, no other data from a human clinical trial of a MERS coronavirus vaccine has been reported to date.</p> <p id="para40"><b>Added value of this study</b></p> <p id="para50">This study showed that the GLS-5300 MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine was tolerable and immunogenic in humans. The vaccine induced both antibody-based and cellular MERS coronavirus-specific immune responses. The study also compared vaccine-specific responses with those from individuals who had recovered from natural MERS coronavirus infection during the 2015 Korean outbreak. The results showed that the immune responses generated in vaccinated study participants were similar to convalescent responses after natural infection.</p> <p id="para60"><b>Implications of all the available evidence</b></p> <p id="para70">The unpredictability of zoonotic transmission and a general decrease in the number of cases of MERS coronavirus in the Middle East will make future placebo-controlled trials challenging. Future testing of GLS-5300 is ongoing in a phase 1b/2a trial in South Korea and additional randomised clinical trials are being planned to test the vaccine in endemic regions. The GLS-5300 vaccine might have potential value in the response to any future MERS coronavirus oubreaks. The global public health community should maintain strong interest in the development of a vaccine that is safe and effective to control any potential situation of a MERS coronavirus outbreak.</p> </div> <p /> <div class="introduction" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Introduction</div> <p id="para80">Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus is a highly fatal cause of lower respiratory tract infection first identified in 2012 in a Saudi Arabian man.<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a> As of May, 2019, 2442 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS and 842 (35%) associated deaths were reported across 27 countries.<a href="#bib2">2</a>, <a href="#bib3">3</a> Most reported infections have been in Saudi Arabia (1983 cases and 745 [38%] deaths).<a href="#bib2">2</a>, <a href="#bib3">3</a></p> <p id="para90">Despite the low transmissibility of MERS coronavirus between humans, the threat of regional or global MERS epidemics is substantial, as exemplified by continued transmission outside the Middle East<a href="#bib4">4</a>, <a href="#bib5">5</a>, <a href="#bib6">6</a> and particularly by a South Korean outbreak in 2015 that emanated from a single traveller and resulted in 186 cases and 38 deaths.<a href="#bib7"><sup>7</sup></a></p> <p id="para100">Correlates of protection from MERS coronavirus infection and disease have not been definitively established.

Eligible participants were adults previously infected with MERS coronavirus during the outbreak in South Korea in 2015 who had recovered from the illness. Serum was collected from naturally infected participants at the time of acute illness and diagnosis in 2015. Participants were asked to return in 2016–17 for collection of convalescent phase serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Procedures</div> <p id="para160">The study vaccine GLS-5300 was manufactured at VGXI (The Woodlands, TX, USA) according to good manufacturing practices. GLS-5300 contains 6 mg/mL of plasmid pGX9101 in sterile water for injection. Plasmid pGX9101 contains a gene insert designed as an optimised, full-length, microconsensus of the MERS coronavirus S-glycoprotein generated from publicly available clinical sequences up to August 2015.<a href="#bib10"><sup>10</sup></a></p> <p id="para170">Participants were enrolled sequentially using a dose-escalation protocol to receive GLS-5300 at one of three doses: 0·67 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg per vaccination, with enrolment into higher dose groups occurring after a safety monitoring committee reviewed the data following vaccination of the first five participants at the previous lower dose in each group. GLS-5300 was administered to participants by trained clinical site staff as a single 1 mL intramuscular deltoid injection followed immediately by colocalised intramuscular electroporation to enhance cellular entry of plasmid DNA with the Cellectra-5P Adaptive Constant Current Electroporation device (Inovio Pharmaceuticals, Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) as described previously<a href="#bib19"><sup>19</sup></a> at the site of inoculation in a three-dose series at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. The Cellectra-5P electroporation device applies three pulses at 1 s intervals at strengths of 0·5 A current and voltage of 1–200 V per pulse.</p> <p id="para180">Local and systemic adverse events were recorded at each study visit and graded by the clinical site investigators.<a href="#bib20"><sup>20</sup></a> Additionally, participants were asked to record local and general symptoms for 1 week following each vaccination in a memory aid that was reviewed by study staff at the following visit. Screening and safety laboratory assessments included complete blood counts, comprehensive metabolic panels, measurement of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine phosphokinase, and a baseline electrocardiogram.</p> <p id="para190">Serum samples were collected at baseline and weeks 1, 2 or 3, 4, 6, 12, 14, 24, 36, and 60. ELISAs developed in-house (assay details in the <a href="#sec1">appendix, p 9</a>) were done to detect antibodies with binding specificity for the S1 subunit (amino acids 1–725) of MERS coronavirus S (S1-ELISA) and for the full-length S-glycoprotein (full-length-S-ELISA),<a href="#bib10"><sup>10</sup></a> reported as end-point titres; positivity cutoffs were the lowest dilutions tested, 100 for S1 and 10 for full-length S ELISA. Serum samples were also assessed for their ability to neutralise MERS coronavirus strain EMC-2012 infection of Vero cells. (<a href="#sec1">appendix p 9</a>). Samples were tested in triplicate for neutralising antibodies and a sample was scored as positive if two of three replicates showed 50% neutralising activity resulting in a geometric mean titre of at least 7·9.</p> <p id="para200">Whole blood was collected and processed for peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation at the same timepoints as collection of serum samples, except peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which were collected at only one early timepoint between the first two vaccinations (week 1, 2, 3, or 4). T-cell responses were measured by IFN-γ enzyme-linked immunospot assays (IFN-γ-ELISPOT) after incubation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells with pools of overlapping 15-mer peptides (44–45 peptides per pool) spanning the entire MERS coronavirus S-glycoprotein. IFN-γ-ELISPOT responses were reported as spot-forming units per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the total of five MERS S peptide pools. A positive response to vaccination was defined as twice the study mean at baseline: at least 141 spot-forming units per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Additionally, multiparameter intracellular cytokine staining flow cytometry to detect CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreting IFN-γ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α, IL-2, or IL-4 following MERS coronavirus S-peptide stimulation was done with evaluable samples at baseline and week 14 (<a href="#sec1">appendix p 9</a>).</p> <p id="para210">Serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were also collected from individuals who were diagnosed with MERS coronavirus infection during the 2015 Korean outbreak. Convalescent samples were obtained at a mean of 19·8 months (SD 0·7) from MERS diagnosis. Acute phase serum samples from the time of initial admission to hospital, collected a mean of 20·8 days (14·3) from diagnosis and 25·1 days (15·1) from symptom onset, were available in small volumes from each participant. Samples were analysed using the same methods as vaccine sample testing.

Outcomes</div> <p id="para220">The primary outcome of this study was safety, measured by incidence of adverse events classified by system organ class, preferred term severity, and relationship to study treatment and schedule; administration site reactions (described by frequency and severity grade) and administration site pain; and changes in safety laboratory variables described by frequency and severity grade (eg, liver panel tests and vital signs).</p> <p id="para230">The secondary outcome of this study was immunogenicity. We assessed the cellular and humoral responses to GLS-5300 overall and by dose. Humoral immunogenicity was assessed by qualitative and quantitative ELISAs of binding antibody titres to the S1 glycoprotein subunit and the full-length MERS coronavirus S glycoprotein, and of neutralising antibodies against MERS coronavirus strain EMC2012 on Vero cells. Antigen-specific cellular immune responses to MERS coronavirus S glycoprotein were assessed using IFN-γ-ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining assays. Exploratory outcomes were: comparison of S binding antibody and MERS CoV neutralising antibody titres; kinetics and durability of S binding antibody and MERS coronavirus neutralising antibody titres; comparison of IFN-γ ELISPOT and intracellular cytokine staining responses across different vaccine doses; kinetics and durability of IFN-γ ELISPOT; expression of the full length MERS coronavirus S protein in peripheral blood over time; host immune-genotyping when available; epitope mapping of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte responses; immunophenotyping and functional characterisation of cellular subsets of interest, including natural killer cells; and isolation, expression, and characterisation of monoclonal antibodies against the MERS coronavirus S protein and assessment of their neutralising and non-neutralising functional activity (study protocol, <a href="#sec1">appendix p 17</a>).</p> </div> <div class="statisticalanalysis" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Statistical analysis</div> <p id="para240">This study was designed as an exploratory trial with defined group sizes of 25 participants per dose group, and was not statistically powered to measure any specific outcome. The safety analysis population included all participants who received at least one study treatment and for whom post-dose safety data were available, and were analysed as to the treatment they received. The per-protocol analysis population was used for the clinical study report's primary analysis and included participants who received all vaccine doses, had no major protocol deviations, and had primary endpoint data available. Because ten (13%) participants were excluded from the per-protocol analysis, the more inclusive modified intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis of immunogenicity, comprised all participants who received at least one dose of GLS-5300, is presented to support the main analysis. Participants in this population were grouped according to their original treatment assignment. S1-ELISA, full-length S-ELISA, and EMC-2012 Vero neutralisation assay results are reported as geometric mean endpoint titres with 95% CIs for each dose-group at each timepoint. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare values by dose at each timepoint. Fisher's exact test was used to compare S1 ELISA response rates by group. Two-sided t tests were used to compare mean IFN-γ-ELISPOT values between groups. Intracellular cytokine staining data are reported as the mean frequency with 95% CI of MERS coronavirus S-peptide-stimulated cytokine responses in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Statistical significance was defined as a two-sided p-value of less than 0·05 and were nominal as we did not adjust for multiple comparisons. Differences between acute and convalescent samples from natural MERS coronavirus infections and week 14 GLS-5300 samples were assessed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison. We used GraphPad Prism statistical software (v.7) for analyses.

Discussion</div> <p id="para330">In our study, GLS-5300 DNA vaccine against MERS coronavirus was well tolerated, and no vaccine-associated serious adverse events were reported. The most common adverse events were injection site reactions, consistent with findings from other published clinical trial reports of DNA vaccines or placebo co-administered through intramuscular injection and electroporation.<a href="#bib21"><sup>21</sup></a> The vaccine was immunogenic, inducing seroconversion and T-cell responses in most participants. S1-ELISA binding antibody seroconversion and T-cell responses were rapid. Vaccine induced immune responses were durable, as most participants maintained detectable S1 binding antibodies and had cellular immune responses at almost 1 year after the last vaccination. The vaccine-induced antibody and cellular immune responses were similar to those in the convalescent phase from samples in patients who recovered from natural MERS coronavirus infection. Finally, GLS-5300 vaccination induced polyfunctional CD8+ T-cell responses that have been shown to correlate with less severe disease and lower MERS coronavirus shedding.<a href="#bib14"><sup>14</sup></a> Immune responses to GLS-5300 were dose-independent across a nearly 10-fold dose range (0·67 mg to 6 mg per vaccination) suggesting further dose reductions might be possible. A lower dose could extend the vaccine supply in an outbreak situation.</p> <p id="para340">GLS-5300 is the first MERS coronavirus vaccine to advance into human trials. Among vaccine candidates in development,<a href="#bib22"><sup>22</sup></a> four have started or will soon start phase 1 testing, including measles-vectored,<a href="#bib9">9</a>, <a href="#bib23">23</a> chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored,<a href="#bib24"><sup>24</sup></a> and modified vaccinia Ankara-vectored vaccines, all expressing full-length S-glycoprotein.<a href="#bib25">25</a>, <a href="#bib26">26</a>, <a href="#bib27">27</a> DNA vaccines and viral-vectored vaccines use recombinant technology that allows for rapid vaccine design in response to emerging infectious diseases. DNA vaccines have additional advantages in rapid manufacture and avoidance of potential toxicities that might occur in live viral-vectored vaccines. Underscoring the potential for rapid deployment of DNA vaccines, GLS-5300 was advanced into the clinic within 9 months of pre-clinical vaccine candidate selection.</p> <p id="para350">Our phase 1 study was not designed to measure GLS-5300 efficacy, as this would require larger randomised studies in a MERS coronavirus-endemic region. Our study had other limitations: as a first-in-man trial primarily assessing vaccine safety, the study was open-label and single-arm rather than a randomised, placebo-controlled, clinical trial (the absence of a placebo group could introduce bias on behalf of investigators or participants). Additionally, the study was not statistically powered to measure any specific outcome, which limits our ability to detect rare events.</p> <p id="para360">In conclusion, this phase 1 clinical trial showed a tolerable safety profile and robust immunogenicity for GLS-5300, a MERS coronavirus DNA vaccine candidate. GLS-5300 vaccination induced similar cellular and antibody responses to those in patients recovered from MERS coronavirus natural infection. An ongoing phase 1/2 a study in South Korea (<a href="NCT03721718">NCT03721718</a>) will provide additional information on the immunogenicity of GLS-5300 delivered by intradermal injection followed by electroporation and the ability to further reduce the DNA vaccine dose. Additional studies are required to test the efficacy of GLS-5300 in a region endemic for MERS coronavirus. A phase 2 trial is being planned to assess GLS-5300 in the Middle East and South Korea, areas which have been most affected by MERS coronavirus infection. A general decrease in the number of cases of MERS in the Middle East will make future placebo-controlled trials challenging. However, the global public health community should maintain interest in the development of a vaccine that is safe and effective to control any potential future outbreaks.</p> <p id="para370"><b>Contributors</b></p> <p id="para380">The study was designed by KMo, NLM, SJT, CCR, MJ, YKP, CR, and JNM.
