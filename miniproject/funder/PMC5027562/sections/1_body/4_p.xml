<p>One important focus of phylogenetic analyses is on clusters: groups of sequences more related to each other than to the rest of the tree. Clustered sequences represent epidemiologically linked infections with short durations of time between transmissions and thus clusters represent the leading edge of the epidemic. High clustering of sequences within a country indicates rapid transmission and a bias towards within-country transmission.</p>
