<p>Despite the two countries sharing similar epidemic histories, separate analyses have suggested different structures of the two countries’ epidemics, including distinct proportions of clustered sequences. In the UK, 24%, 40% and 22% of patients infected with HIV-1 subtypes B

 <sup>12</sup>, respectively, cluster, whereas the numbers for Switzerland are 55%, 21% and 16%
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Clearly these differences arise in part due to distinct cluster definitions: the SHCS defines a cluster as ≥10 sequences supported by &gt;80% bootstrap
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, while the UK studies defined clusters by a genetic distance (GD) ≤4.5% and bootstrap ≥90%
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Variable cluster definitions are a common problem in the literature. Bootstraps from 70% to 99% are used, in combination with GD from 1.5% to 4.5%. Another reason for the disparity could be differences in sampling procedures. However it is also possible that the contact and transmission processes between Switzerland and the UK differ. Given these observed differences, it is unclear to what extent findings from one country can be applied to the other, and more importantly whether results from either can be extended to other less densely sampled European epidemics.
