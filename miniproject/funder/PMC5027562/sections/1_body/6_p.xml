<p>Because access to data from national cohorts is subject to restrictions, and because analyses have been conducted according to in-house bioinformatics pipelines, the differences between the two epidemics have never been elucidated. Here, we present an analysis conducted in parallel on the two epidemics using a standardised approach. We hypothesised that because of its geography, the Swiss epidemic might be more integrated into the European epidemic and less clustered because of unsampled links in Swiss transmission chains. Using the same cluster definition, we compared the cluster distributions (the number and sizes of clusters) of the two countries as an indicator of underlying epidemic dynamics. We determined whether clustering was affected by risk group and ethnicity and compared the degree distributions (the number of linked partners) of heterosexual, MSM and PWID to test whether differences between countries were down to any specific risk group. Finally, we tested whether the UK and Swiss epidemics intermingled with the same foreign countries through sequence analysis.</p>
