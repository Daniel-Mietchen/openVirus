<p>In conclusion, we showed that apparent major differences in clustering patterns between the UK and Switzerland subtype B epidemics can be explained for the most part by differences in size and sampling time. This is the first study leveraging the vast amounts of data available in multiple national HIV databases. We made use of data without breaching data governance procedures and highlighted that transmission trends in these two countries are driven by similar underlying factors. From a methodological perspective, our study highlights the importance of using the same cluster-detection algorithm and correcting for demographic factors when comparing clustering patterns across settings.</p>
