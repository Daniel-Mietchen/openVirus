<p>The degree distribution of UK heterosexuals had a long tail representing male heterosexuals clustered exclusively with MSM. Previous UK analyses have demonstrated that a proportion of self-reported male heterosexuals are likely to have been infected through sex with men
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, which appears to be the case here. When those high degree heterosexuals were removed from the dataset, the UK and Swiss no longer differed. Male heterosexuals who have sex with men are likely to also have sex with women and provide a bridge between MSM and heterosexual epidemics. This is a likely route for the spread of non-B subtypes among MSM in the UK
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. More detailed analyses of the Swiss epidemic have found little overlap between the MSM and HET epidemics
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>; however, the Swiss heterosexual with the highest degree was similarly part of a HET/MSM cluster comprising 36 individuals, while the largest exclusively heterosexual cluster contained only 9. In fact, 47% of UK and 38% of Swiss heterosexuals were in HET/MSM clusters. The present analysis cannot determine whether bridging is more common in the UK or whether risk group classification is assessed more thoroughly in Switzerland.
