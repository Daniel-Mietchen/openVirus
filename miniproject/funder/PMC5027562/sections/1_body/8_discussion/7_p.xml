<p>Although degree distributions are a blunt tool for elucidating the dynamics of an epidemic
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, they allowed us to apply statistically robust methods to compare the two epidemics without the need for exchanging sensitive data. Sequences from national databases were never exchanged and while this precluded a combined phylogenetic analysis of UK and Swiss sequences, one of the strengths of the study stems from undertaking such an analysis without compromising patient privacy. A second issue, the distributions of sample dates differing between the two cohorts, arose because the SHCS has conducted extensive retrospective sequencing on patients diagnosed early on in the epidemic and for whom samples had been stored. The SHCS coverage of older samples explains in part the lower clustering observed in Switzerland. However, clustering remained significantly higher in the UK at 4.5% GD after sample date was adjusted for. Thirdly, international comparisons were based on the LANL database which is in essence a large-scale convenience sample and not necessarily representative. We suggest the apparently important contribution of the Czech Republic to both epidemics may arise from recent submission of large numbers of sequences from that country.
