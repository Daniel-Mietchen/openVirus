<p>The aim of this study was to compare epidemic dynamics between the two most densely sampled HIV epidemics, the UK and Switzerland, while adhering to data governance procedures and privacy protection requirements. We found that the fraction of sequences in transmission clusters was similar between the UK and Switzerland for a strict GD threshold (1.5%) but that they differed at a more relaxed GD threshold (4.5%). This suggests that the two epidemics resemble each other at a micro-level but differ at a macro-level. Because a statistical framework for comparing cluster distributions directly is lacking, we generated degree distributions based on cluster sizes and compared them through formal statistical tests: the KS test, the DDQC and bootstrapping. Based on the KS test, there were differences between the UK and Swiss subtype B degree distributions at 4.5% GD. However, downsampling the UK dataset to the size of the Swiss dataset rendered this difference insignificant in MSM and the population as a whole, but not heterosexuals (
