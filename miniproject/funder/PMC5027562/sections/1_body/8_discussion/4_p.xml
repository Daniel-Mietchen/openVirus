<p>Our findings were consistent across bootstrap thresholds. At 1.5% GD, we found no difference between the degree distributions of the Swiss and UK epidemics. At tight thresholds mostly pairs and recently infected patients are captured and these groupings are similar across the two countries. At 4.5% GD, the UK was more clustered and so the UK HIV RDB is more likely to capture larger transmission chains. However, the downsampled UK epidemic degree distribution overlapped with the Swiss degree distribution. While the proportion of clustered individuals in the UK is higher, the difference is seemingly due to the UK greater epidemic size rather than because of differences in contact or transmission processes. Both countries are similarly integrated into global unsampled epidemics, and this study underlines the importance of HIV public health interventions at the European and global levels.</p>
