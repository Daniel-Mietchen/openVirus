<p>The UK and Switzerland have two of the most extensive HIV sequence databases in the world: the UK HIV Drug Resistance Database (UK HIV RDB) and the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS), which contain 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from at least 60% of diagnosed patients within each country. These databases have allowed Switzerland and the UK to lead the way in population-level HIV research, including HIV phylogenetics. Phylogenetic analyses of HIV in these densely sampled epidemics have been used to estimate epidemic parameters including times between transmissions according to risk group
