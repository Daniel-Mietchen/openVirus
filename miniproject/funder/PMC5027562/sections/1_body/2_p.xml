<p>HIV was introduced into UK men who have sex with men (MSM) around 1980
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>, probably from the USA
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Until the early 1990 s the epidemic was dominated by the transmission of subtype B among MSM and people who inject drugs (PWID). Six large reconstructed MSM transmission chains reflect independent introductions. The MSM epidemic displayed exponential growth in the 1980 s then stabilised in the 1990 s but continues to be highly clustered
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. In the 1990 s, cases among heterosexuals became more common
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and non-B subtypes increased

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Within MSM clusters, 25% of transmissions occur within 6 months of infection
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Heterosexuals in the UK display far less clustering and slower epidemic dynamics: only 2% of transmissions occur within 6 months of infection
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Currently, 100,000 people are living with HIV (0.15% prevalence), one quarter of whom are unaware of their infection
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) became available to residents in 1996 and to all in 2012. HIV positive people on successful treatment in the UK have normal life expectancy
