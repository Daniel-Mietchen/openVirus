<p>Switzerland had the highest HIV prevalence in Europe in the 1980 s
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. HIV initially spread among MSM and PWID
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> with heterosexual transmission starting to play a role after the mid-1980 s. The number of new diagnoses declined in the 1990 s, owing to needle exchange, heightened awareness, wide-scale testing, and the introduction of HAART in 1996. The number of new HIV diagnoses in Switzerland has fluctuated since 2000 with no clear time trends. The MSM and PWID epidemics display limited overlap. The heterosexual subtype B epidemic appears to be reseeded by PWID, migration, and (to a limited extent) MSM, with the importance of PWID in driving new infections decreasing over time
