<p>Duplicate sequences were removed. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed for each country and subtype separately (six trees in total) using FastTree v2.0
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> with 100 bootstraps. Initially clusters were selected for further analysis if they were supported by bootstrap thresholds of 70%, 80%, 90% and 95% and maximum GD of 1.5% or 4.5% (8 thresholds total)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Of the initially identified clusters, those in the Swiss trees were further selected to contain at least 80% SHCS sequences, and clusters in the UK trees at least 80% UK sequences. In a separate analysis, we examined all clusters with at least one UK or Swiss sequence (within the respective datasets) to investigate mixing between national and foreign sequences. The automated pipeline included analysis with the Cluster Picker and Cluster Matcher
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> as well as processing through python and R scripts (available upon request). The Cluster Picker was upgraded to recognise IUPAC nucleotide ambiguity codes as matches (version available upon request from the authors), increasing clustering by around 15% in both datasets.
