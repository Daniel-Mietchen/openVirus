<p>From the Cluster Picker and Cluster Matcher output files, we generated degree distributions (the number of links for each node). As files contained risk group composition for each cluster, it was possible to break down degree distribution by risk group. Nodes were sampled with replacement from the network with information on their cluster membership. Nodes sampled with the same cluster membership were linked together in each bootstrapped network, so that clusters sometimes increased in size, sometimes decreased in size or otherwise disappeared, and degree distribution was re-estimated each time. Jack-knife resampling where the number of nodes sampled was smaller than the full network size was also performed.</p>
