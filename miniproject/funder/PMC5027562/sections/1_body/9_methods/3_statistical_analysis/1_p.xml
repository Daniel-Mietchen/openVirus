<p>The number of sequences clustering at different thresholds between the two epidemics was compared using Fisherâ€™s exact test with Bonferroni correction (24 comparisons across clustering thresholds and subtypes). Degree distributions were compared using the KS test
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and the DDQC algorithm
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. The KS test is a nonparametric test which compares the cumulative distribution of two samples to estimate whether they have been drawn from the same distribution and is frequently used to compare degree distributions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. The DDQC was developed specifically to compare degree distributions and corrects for differences in population size while the KS test does not. The DDQC extracts a vector of eight values from degree distributions for comparison. In brief, the range of node degrees is divided into eight regions based on the minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation of the degree distribution. The probability of the degree of any node being contained within each interval is calculated. The distance between two networks is the sum of the absolute differences for each of the eight features extracted.
