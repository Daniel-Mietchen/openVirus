<p>The UK subtype B dataset used here was 3.75 times larger than the Swiss dataset; the UK MSM dataset was 5.7 times larger and the UK heterosexual dataset was 1.3 times larger (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). To investigate the effect of the difference in size of the pool of possible infectors, the UK dataset was jack-knife sampled to the size of the Swiss dataset. One hundred jack-knife replicates were generated, and in each replicate the degree distribution was re-estimated based on the links present in the sample.
