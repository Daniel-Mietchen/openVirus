<p>63,065 HIV 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were obtained from the UK HIV RDB (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hivrdb.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.hivrdb.org</ext-link>). Sequences cover protease and 900 bases of reverse transcriptase. After age, sex, risk group and ethnicity were attached, the data were anonymised and delinked. Subtypes were assigned using SCUEAL
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> and REGA
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The three most common subtypes were B (48.6%), C (24.4%), and A1 (4.0%). Ethical approval was given by the London Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (MREC/01/2/10; 5 April 2001).
