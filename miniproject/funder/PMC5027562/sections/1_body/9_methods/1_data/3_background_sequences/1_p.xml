<p>All 
 <italic>pol</italic> (HXB2 positions 2253â€“3870) sequences of HIV subtype A1, B, and C longer than 900 bases were retrieved from LANL (January 2014). To limit the size of alignments, the ten closest sequences to each of the local (UK and Swiss) sequences were selected using Viroblast
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. For this step, UK sequences were removed from LANL alignments before the UK Viroblast run, and Swiss LANL sequences were removed before the Swiss run.
