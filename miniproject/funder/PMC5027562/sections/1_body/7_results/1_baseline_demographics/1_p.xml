<p>HIV 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were retrieved from the SHCS drug resistance database
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> (SHCS DRDB, 2014) and from the UK HIV RDB (sequences up to mid-2013). Closely related sequences were obtained from the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) database as described in the Methods. In the final analyses, the Swiss datasets contained 1,374 subtype A1 sequences (435 Swiss, 939 LANL), 15,043 B (8,390 Swiss, 6,653 LANL) and 1,571 C (419 Swiss, 1,152 LANL). The UK datasets comprised 4,421 A1 (2,507 UK, 1,914 LANL), 38,863 B (31,450 UK, 7,413 LANL) and 22,027 C (15,815 UK, 6,212 LANL). The Swiss epidemic comprised more PWID, fewer heterosexuals and more patients of White ethnicity (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). These differences were in part a result of the different subtype composition across the two countries, but even within subtype B there were notable differences, with proportionally more cases among heterosexuals and PWID in Switzerland.
