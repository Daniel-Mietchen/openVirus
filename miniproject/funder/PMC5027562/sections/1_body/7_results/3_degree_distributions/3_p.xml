<p>We hypothesised that the difference highlighted by the KS test at 4.5% might be the result of a difference in scale between the two epidemics. The UK population (and the HIV+ population) is much larger than that of Switzerland and so the pool of partners available is bigger. To examine the effect of epidemic size on clustering and degree distributions, we down-sampled the UK subtype B datasets to match the size of the Swiss datasets. In parallel, the Swiss datasets were bootstrap sampled with replacement. When these equal-sized resampled datasets were compared, the UK and Swiss degree distributions overlapped for the population as a whole and for the MSM population, but not for heterosexuals (
