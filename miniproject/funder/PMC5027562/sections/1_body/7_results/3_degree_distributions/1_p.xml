<p>Degree distributions for each country and risk group were generated based on cluster size distributions and compositions. For example a cluster containing 3 heterosexuals is equivalent to 3 heterosexuals each with degree 2. Statistical frameworks exist to formally compare degree distributions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Based on the KS test, there was no difference between the two countries at 1.5% GD. At 4.5% GD, distributions differed significantly for HET, MSM and the population as a whole, but not for PWID (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref>). The difference appeared to be driven by the longer tail of the UK distributions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), indicating the existence of larger clusters in the UK. The UK epidemic thus comprised not only a higher proportion of sequences in clusters, but also clusters were larger.
