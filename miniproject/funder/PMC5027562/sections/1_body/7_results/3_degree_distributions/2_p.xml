<p>Because the KS test is sensitive to network size, we applied the DDQC, which is robust to differences in scale. The DDQC measures the distance between networks based on features extracted from their degree distributions. However, it does not indicate whether distances calculated are significant or not. In order to generate null distributions, the UK and Swiss degree distributions were compared to themselves through bootstrapping. The UK and Swiss degree distributions were each bootstrapped 100 times to simulate the effect of sampling (see Methods) and the DDQC distance calculated between the true data and each bootstrap replicate (

 <sup>th</sup> percentile DDQC = 0.97, observed HET DDQC = 1.22).
