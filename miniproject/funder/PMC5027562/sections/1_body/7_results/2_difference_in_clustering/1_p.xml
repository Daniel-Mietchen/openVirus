<p>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed and clusters were selected
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> at a range of genetic distance (GD) and bootstrap thresholds. A significantly larger proportion of UK subtype B sequences clustered in the uncorrected analysis at all thresholds (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Concordantly, the UK was more clustered in the univariate analysis (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>) with odds for being in a cluster 4 times higher at 4.5% GD. At 4.5% GD, subtypes C and A1 were also more clustered in the UK, but there was no significant difference at 1.5% GD. The subsequent analysis focused mainly on subtype B.
