<p>Because of the difference in sampling time distributions and demographics between the two subtype B datasets, we considered the logistic regression adjusting for those variables. More recent samples were much more likely to cluster than older samples (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>) and when the model was adjusted for sample date, the Swiss epidemic was more clustered than the UK epidemic at 1.5% GD. At 4.5% GD, clustering remained higher for the UK but the strength of the association was halved compared with the univariate model. The effect of risk group and ethnicity on clustering was consistent across the two countries, with MSM in both countries showing the highest propensity for clustering.
