<p>We investigated intermingling between national and foreign sequences by removing the 80% national criterion. We used a tight GD threshold (1.5%, 70% bootstrap) to capture close transmission partners. At this threshold, Swiss sequences clustered with 162 non-Swiss sequences and UK sequences clustered with 353 non-UK sequences. For Switzerland, Western European countries provided over 75% of the links. For the UK, 50% of close links were with other European countries and 20% originated from other Anglophone countries: Australia, Canada and the USA (
