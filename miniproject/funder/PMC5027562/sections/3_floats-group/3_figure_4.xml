  <title>Jack-knife and bootstrap sampled degree distributions of the UK (pink) and Swiss (blue) epidemics.</title>
  <p>UK subtype B degree distribution for men who have sex with men (MSM), heterosexuals (HET) and the population as a whole (all) were jack-knife sampled 100 times to match the size of the Swiss epidemics (in light pink). The Swiss epidemic was bootstrapped 100 times to its full size (in light blue). Degree distributions are shown on a double-logged scale. Samples overlapped for MSM and the dataset as a whole, but not for HET. Where Swiss replicates cannot be seen they are covered by the UK replicates.</p>
