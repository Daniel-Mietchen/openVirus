  <title>DDQC distances within and between countries.</title>
  <p>DDQC – Degree Distribution Quantification and Comparison, CH - Switzerland, MSM - men who have sex with men, HET - heterosexuals. PWID – people who inject drugs. Cluster definition was: genetic distance = 4.5% and bootstrap = 90%. In order to generate null distributions of the expected values for the DDQC, we bootstrapped the Swiss and UK distributions and calculated DDQC values comparing the original datasets to their bootstrap samples (in blue and pink). The top of the coloured bars represent the mean distance of within country comparisons and the whiskers represent the 95% percentiles. The DDQC distance was then calculated between the UK and Swiss degree distributions (black triangles). The distance between countries was considered significant if it exceeded the 95% percentile from the simulated values, which was the case only for HET at 4.5% GD (indicated by *). When we removed heterosexuals who were likely to have been infected through sex with men from the UK dataset, the DDQC distance between the UK and Swiss HET degree distributions fell within the simulated null distribution (orange triangle).</p>
