  <title>Functional fingerprint of cellular gene expression in MDM infected with multiple clinical isolates of RSV subtype B.</title>
  <p>(A) Transcriptional heatmaps of cellular genes of MDM (donor #66) infected with RSV. RNA was extracted 18 hours post infection and gene expression was determined by RNA-SEQ. Each row represents a virus (18 hours post infection) or mock infected cells (M) processed at 0 or 18 hours. Clinical isolates include subtype B strains NH1125B (1125), NH1001B (1001), NH1161B (1161), NH1067B (1067), NH1182B (1182), and TX11-56B (11–56). Viruses were designated as “low” or “high” inducers based on their capacity to induce IL-6 and RANTES as shown in the graph (B). IL-6 and RANTES secretion in response to viral infection was measured by BioPlex. (C) Heatmap demonstrating the expression of a subset of cellular genes in MDM infected with clinical isolates of RSV. These genes were selected based on published data indicating that their expression can be regulated by the RSV G protein and or interferon-stimulated gene.</p>
