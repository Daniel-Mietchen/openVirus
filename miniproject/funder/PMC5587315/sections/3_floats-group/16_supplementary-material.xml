  <title>RSV gene expression during infection of MDM.</title>
  <p>MDM (donor #66) were infected with NH1125B (A) or NH1067B (B) and at 18 hours post infection, RNA was isolated and gene expression was determined by RNA-SEQ. Here, reads that did not map to the human genome were aligned to the viral genome. The Y-axis represents the magnitude of transcription for each region of the viral genome. A map of the viral genome (C) including the coding regions for the RSV genes is displayed beneath the graph of the gene expression. (D) Comparison of the genome sequence of clinical isolates NH1125B and NH1067B. Each vertical bar represents a nucleotide polymorphism between the 2 strains. The "*" represent 1 or 3 base insertions and the triangle designates the location of the 60 base duplication in the G gene of NH1067B.</p>
