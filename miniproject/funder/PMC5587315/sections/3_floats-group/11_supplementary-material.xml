  <title>Host gene expression in response to RSV infection.</title>
  <p>A549 cells or MDM (donor #67 and #68) were infected with NH1067B and NH1125B. RNA was extracted at the designated times post infection and gene expression was determined by RNA-SEQ. Individual genes are in rows and variations in expression are depicted using the color scale on the left of the figure. In MDM heatmap, for each time point, the left column represents donor #67 and the right column represents donor #68. For A549 cells, each column at each time point represents a biological replicate. Mock infected (U) cells were used as controls.</p>
