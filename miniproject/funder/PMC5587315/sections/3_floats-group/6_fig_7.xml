  <title>Phylogeny of RSV isolates and correlation to the induction phenotype within the viral genome.</title>
  <p>(A) Phylogenetic analysis of 33 RSV A and B strains. Analysis was based on the whole genome sequence of each virus. The portion of the dendrogram circle in pink represents B strains and the portion of the dendrogram circle in light blue represents A strains. “High inducers” are in red text and “low inducers” are in blue text. (B) Phylogenic analysis based on the region of the viral genome containing the sequential genes 
   <italic>SH</italic>, 
   <italic>G</italic> and 
   <italic>F</italic>. Sequence and phylogenic analysis suggested that the induction phenotype (“high” vs. “low”; see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g006">Fig 6</xref>) mapped to this region of the genome. Based on these analyses, segregation of the viral isolates correlated with the cytokine/chemokine induction phenotype.
