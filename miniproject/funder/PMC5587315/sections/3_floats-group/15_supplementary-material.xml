   <bold>(A-E). Functional fingerprint of cellular gene expression during RSV infection.</bold> MDM (donor #64) were infected with clinical isolates NH1125B or NH1067B and at several times post-infection, RNA was isolated and cellular gene expression was determined by RNA-SEQ. Genes are clustered based on their functionality which is described on the left side of the figure. The gene expression profiles correspond to the data represented in Figs
