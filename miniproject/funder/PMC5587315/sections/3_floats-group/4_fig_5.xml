  <title>Host-associated differences in response to RSV infection.</title>
  <p>MDM obtained from 5 donors (#40, #64, #52, #54, #66) were infected with NH1125B. At 24 hours post infection RNA was extracted and gene expression profiles were determined by RNA-SEQ. This heatmap includes expression of genes supporting virus infections (viral entry and replication; see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and expression of genes in response to viral infection (host-viral recognition, innate immunity, interferon response and adaptive immunity; see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g003">Fig 3</xref>).
