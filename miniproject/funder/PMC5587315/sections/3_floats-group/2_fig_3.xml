  <title>Host gene expression in response to RSV infection.</title>
  <p>A549 cells or MDM (donor #64) were infected with NH1067B and NH1125B. RNA was extracted at the designated times post infection and gene expression was determined by RNA-SEQ. Individual genes are in rows and variations in expression are depicted using the color scale on the right of the figure. Expression of genes favorable for virus infection (viral entry and viral replication) and expression of genes in response to viral infection (host-viral recognition, innate immunity response, interferon (IFN) response and adaptive immunity) are clustered and relative expression induced by each virus is presented. Some of the genes and biological and biochemical pathways assessed are listed in each category. Mock infected (U) cells were used as controls.</p>
