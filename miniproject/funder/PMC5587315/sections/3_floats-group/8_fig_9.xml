  <title>Pathway analysis of interferon stimulated genes after RSV infection.</title>
  <p>Interferon stimulated genes are organized based on known established pathways and subcellular locations. Symbols are bi-colored with the left half characterizing genes activated by NH1125B and the right half genes activated by NH1067B. The differences in color intensity reflect differences in the expression levels of the genes by each virus. Data for this figure were obtained at 8 hours (A) and 24 hours (B) post infection of MDM cells.</p>
