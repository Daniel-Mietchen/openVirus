  <title>Induction of cytokines and chemokines by clinical isolates of RSV in A549 cells and primary monocyte-derived human macrophages (MDM).</title>
  <p>(A) A549 cells or (B) MDM (donor #66, 67 and 68) were infected with clinical isolates NH1125B or NH1067B. Mock infected cells were used as controls. At multiple time points post-infection, cell culture supernatant were collected and concentration of IL-6 and RANTES (CCL5) were measured by BioPlex assay. For the A549 cell experiments, biological triplicates were used and the error bars are displayed (for several time points, the error bars are too small to be seen in the figure). To make the MDM data from different donors compatible, we applied a standardization procedure with the average expression over all time points (for each donor) equal zero and the standard deviation equal 1. Data along ordinate axis is given in these standardized units. Nineteen donors (including donor #66, 67 and 68) were screened for secretion of IL-6 (C) and CCL5 (D) at 24 hours post infection using the methodologies described above.</p>
