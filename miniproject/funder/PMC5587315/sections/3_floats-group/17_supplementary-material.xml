  <title>Dynamics of RSV gene expression during infection of A549 cells and MDM.</title>
  <p>MDM (donor #64) or A549 cells were infected with either NH1125B or NH1067B and at several times post infection, RNA was isolated and viral gene expressions was determined with RNAâ€“SEQ. Reads that did not map to the human genome were used to determine viral gene expression. Hours post infection are designated by the number following the virus (e.g. NH1067-4.0 represents the 4.0 hour time point). The Y-axis represents the magnitude of viral gene expression or total gene reads normalized to housekeeping genes (see Methods).</p>
