  <title>Host gene expression following RSV infection.</title>
  <p>MDM (donor #64) or A549 cells were infected with clinical isolate NH1125B (1125) or NH1067B (1067). At several time points post infection, RNA was isolated and gene expression was determined by RNA-SEQ. In the scatter plot diagrams of cellular gene expression in MDM or A549 cells, each circle represents a specific gene (expressed as reads per kilobase per million (RPKM)) relative to expression of that gene in uninfected cells. Gene expression in cells infected with NH1125B (1125) are displayed as red dots and gene expression in cells infected with NH1067B (1067) are displayed as light blue dots. Genes associated with specific pathways are labeled. Venn diagram displays differential cellular gene expression of MDMs infected with clinical isolates NH1125B (pink), NH1067B (blue) or both (purple) at different time point post-infection compared to mock control. The numbers in the diagram, also displayed in the 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s008">S1 Table</xref>, represent up-regulated genes (numerators) and down-regulated genes (denominators).
