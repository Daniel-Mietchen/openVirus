  <title>Induction of IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES) by clinical isolates of RSV is abrogated by pretreatment of virus with an RSV neutralizing antibody.</title>
  <p>MDM (donor #96 and #98) were infected with clinical isolate NH1125B (1125) or 1125 pre-treated with an RSV-neutralizing antibody (1125+SYN). As controls, cells were incubated with an RSV-neutralizing antibody (SYN), TLR7 stimulator (R848) or incubated with R848 and SYN (R848+SYN). At 20 hours post-infection, cell culture supernatants were collected and concentration of IL-6 (A, C) and RANTES (B, D) were measured by BioPlex assay.</p>
