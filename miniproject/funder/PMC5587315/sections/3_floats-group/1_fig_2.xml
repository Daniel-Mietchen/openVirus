  <title>Transcriptome analyses of A549 cells and MDM during infection with clinical isolates of RSV.</title>
  <p>A549 cells and MDM (donor#64) were infected with NH1067B and NH1125B. RNA was extracted at the designated times post infection and gene expression was determined by RNA-SEQ (A) or quantitative RT-PCR (B). (A) Heat map illustrating changes in cytokine and chemokine transcription following infection. Individual genes are in rows and variations in expression are depicted using the color scale on the right of the figure. Each column is a time point (in hours) post infection. “U” represents mock infected cells. Each row represents a unique cytokine. Arrows point to transcription of IL-6, CCL5 and TNFα. (B) Quantitative RT-PCR of specific genes in virus infected A549 and MDMs. RNA was extracted from MDM from donor #67 and 68 at several times post infection (as described above) and gene expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. The Y-axis represents fold expression over mock infected cells and error bars are included for statistical perspectives.</p>
