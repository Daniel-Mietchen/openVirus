  <title>Sequence analyses of RSV isolates and correlation to the induction phenotype within the viral genome.</title>
  <p>(A) Amino acid sequence of a portion of the G protein of clinical isolates of RSV B. Amino acid sequence, consensus sequence and amino acid number are displayed. The G gene of “low inducers” contains a 20 amino acid duplication (corresponding to the 60 base duplication) absent in “high inducers”. Like the duplication, amino acid residue at position 229 corresponds to viral induction phenotype (isoleucine in “low inducers” and threonine in “high inducers”). (B) Amino acid sequence of a portion of the M2-1 protein of clinical isolates of RSV B. Amino acid sequence, consensus sequence and amino acid number are displayed. Amino acid residue at position 142 corresponds to viral induction phenotype (serine in “low inducers” and asparagine in “high inducers”).</p>
