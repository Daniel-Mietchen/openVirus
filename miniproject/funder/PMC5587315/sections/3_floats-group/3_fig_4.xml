  <title>Comparison of time dynamics of cellular genes in response to infection with RSV NH1067B or NH1125B.</title>
  <p>MDM (donor #64) (A) or A549 cells (B) were infected with NH1067B and NH1125B. RNA was extracted at the designated times post infection and assayed by RNA-SEQ. Time dynamics of expression of genes favorable for virus infection (viral entry and viral replication) and the innate immune response to viral infection (host-viral recognition, innate immunity response, interferon (IFN) response and adaptive immunity) are shown separately in each graph. Representative genes are labeled.</p>
