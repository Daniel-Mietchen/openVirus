<p>The epidemiology of RSV is complex and dynamic. RSV strains can be classified, based on serological [

 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], into 2 subgroups, A or B. Both subgroup A and B viruses circulate during seasonal epidemics (typically the late fall, winter and early spring in temperate climates) and unlike influenza virus pandemics, RSV strains may vary from location to location in any given RSV season [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Likewise, strains identified in one location may be similar to strains from vastly different geographic locations identified in different years [
