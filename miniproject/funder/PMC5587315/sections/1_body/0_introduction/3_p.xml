<p>The pathogenesis of RSV is not fully defined. Several animal models, including mice, cotton rats, and non-human primates, have been used to study RSV infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The vast majority of these investigations have used laboratory strains of RSV or recombinant virus derived from these laboratory strains. Many of these strains were isolated decades ago. For example, the reference A2 strain was isolated in Australia in 1961, and the passage histories of this strain, as with most laboratory strains of RSV, are not known or poorly documented. It is unclear whether these strains have adapted to cell culture systems or to animal models in which they are used, and in so doing, acquired mutations. Therefore, these strains may not be authentic representatives of feral strains of RSV. In fact, the reference A2 strain differs from several clinical isolates in its ability to replicate on primary human bronchial epithelial cells and induce interferon-inducible protein 10 and CCL5 suggesting that A2 alone may not be the ideal strain to study RSV pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, 6 clinical subgroup A isolates, representing difference subgroup A clades and apparently chosen randomly, displayed distinct replication kinetics, IL-13 and gob-5 induction and mucin production in BALB/c mice. These studies, which relied, for the most part, on randomly chosen clinical strains, strongly suggest that a more thorough, focused and systematic investigation of clinical isolates of RSV may lead to the identification of strains with dramatic differences in phenotype, specifically, induction of innate immunity and inflammation and may lead to the identification of previously unrecognized viral virulence factors.
