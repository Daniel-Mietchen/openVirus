<p>Here, we have used comprehensive RNA-SEQ analyses to characterize both host cell and viral strain gene expression. Our results indicate that NH1125B and NH1067B differ significantly in their ability to control innate immune activation early in the viral infection cycle. This functional variation coincides with the presence of distinct features within the 
 <italic>G</italic> gene, specifically a 60 base duplication and a single amino acid polymorphism and or a single amino acid polymorphism in the M2-1 protein.
