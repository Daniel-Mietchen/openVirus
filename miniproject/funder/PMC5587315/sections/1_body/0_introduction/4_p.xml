<p>We have previously screened subgroup B isolates for their capacity to induce cytokines and chemokines, specifically IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES), in A549 cells, a continuous human pulmonary epithelial cell line [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. IL-6 is secreted by a variety of cell types including T cells and macrophages. In T cells and macrophages, IL-6 is secreted in response to infection and acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-6 is required for protection against a variety of microbial pathogens; deficiency of this molecule results in impair innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CCL5, a chemokine, attracts immune and inflammatory cells to the site of infection and is secreted by a variety of immune cells, among them macrophages and non-immune cells such as epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We chose to study these 2 molecules because there is 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, animal and clinical data to support that these factors are induced during RSV infection and may play a role in the immune and inflammatory response to RSV [

 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We found that 2 isolates, NH1125B and NH1067B, differed in their ability to induce IL-6 and CCL5. The replication kinetics of the 2 viruses were essentially identical suggesting that the observed difference is cytokine and chemokine induction could not be explained by differences in the kinetics of viral replication.
