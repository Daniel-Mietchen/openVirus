<p>Gene reads (described above) that did not map to the human genome were used for viral transcriptome analyses. RSV gene expression was normalized for reads per base pair gene length (RPB) as follows: RPB = R/G where R is the total reads and G is the gene length (in bases). The RPB for each RSV gene was normalized to housekeeping gene expression in the corresponding human transcriptome to rule out the possibility of reduced cell number and different read depth. The normalized reads per gene base pair RPKN) is calculated as RPK/N, where N is the normalization of housekeeping genes [
