<p>Phylogenic analyses were performed and phylogenic trees were generated using CLC-Biosystems Genomic Workbench (Qiagen). In-study RSV strain genomes were assembled by mapping gene reads (described above) to either NH1125B or NH1067B genome that did not match to the human genome [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Genome assemblies of representative RSV-A and RSV-B strains used in phylogenic analysis were downloaded from NCBI database. For phylogenic analysis of RSV
