<p>Monolayers of A549 cells or MDM were infected with sucrose-purified clinical isolates of RSV. After 90 minutes of infection, the inoculum was removed, the cells were washed with serum-free media and fresh media (F-12 Kaighn’s modification media for A549 cells; RPMI1640 for macrophages) containing 5% FBS was added to the infected monolayers. M-CSF (50 ng/ml) was added to the media of the macrophages cultures. For cytokine analysis, supernatants were collected, clarified by centrifugation and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until the specific assay was performed. Concentrations of IL-6 and CCL5 were measured using Bio-Plex Pro™ with conjugated magnetic beads according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cytokine data were analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager™ version 4.1.1 software.</p>
