<p>The study of the time dynamics in gene expressions were used genes whose expression level varied significantly when compared to the variability to that of the ‘reference group’ (denoted hyper-variable (HVE) genes). Details of the statistical selection of these genes and clustering procedures used for analysis of their collective behavior are presented elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Heatmaps were generated with the Matlab and Spotfire Decision Site 9 (TIBCO, Palo Alto, CA) with gene subsets created from the list of significant genes. Functional analysis of identified genes was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; Ingenuity® Systems, Redwood City, CA,
