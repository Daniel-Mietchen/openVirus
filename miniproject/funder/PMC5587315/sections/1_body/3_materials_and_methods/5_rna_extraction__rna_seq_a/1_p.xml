<p>Total cellular RNA was extracted from A549 cell or MDM using the QIAshredder columns and RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. RNA concentration and quality were determined by Aligent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA-SEQ was performed as previous described [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Briefly, 0.1 to 1.0 micrograms of high quality purified RNA (RNA integrity number [RIN]&gt;8.5; the RIN is a verified methodology for assessing the quality of RNA for gene expression measurements [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]) were used for producing RNA-SEQ cDNA libraries using TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina, Inc.) as per the manufacturer’s recommendation. For any given experiment, the amount of RNA used was equal. (Note: replicates using RNA concentrations in the ranges specified did not result in significant differences in transcriptome data.) This included using standard protocols for cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, addition of adaptors, size selection, amplification and QC (Illumina). SE50 single-end sequencing was done using HI-SEQ 2500 (Illumina) with &gt; 18,000,000 reads/sample. Basic data analysis was done using CLC-Biosystems Genomic Workbench analysis programs to generate quantitative data for all genes, including reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) values, unique and total gene reads, annotated transcripts and detected transcripts, median coverage, chromosomal location, and putative exons. The data for the heatmap are expressed in standardized units: Dst = (D—Avr)/STD, where D is level of expression of given gene (RPKM) in given time point, Avr and STD are averaged expression and standard deviation correspondingly for given gene over all conditions presented in the figure.
