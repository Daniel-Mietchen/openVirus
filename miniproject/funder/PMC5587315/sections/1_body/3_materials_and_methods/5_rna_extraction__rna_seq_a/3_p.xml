<p>In the analysis of the time dynamics of gene expressions in the infected MDM we first selected all genes demonstrating significantly increased variability (hyper variable expressed genes [HVE]). One of the most important criteria in the selection of HVE-genes and the analysis of their behavior is the choice of the ‘Reference Group’—which is composed of genes expressed above the background of control samples with a low variability of expression (as determined by an F-test). Procedure for establishing the ‘Reference Group’ was described in detail elsewhere [
