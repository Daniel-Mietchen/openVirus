<p>Methods for data normalization and analysis are based on the use of “internal standards” [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] that characterize some aspects of the system’s behavior, such as technical variability, as presented elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Internal standard in this context is considered as a large family of genes sharing some useful features for analysis, which in turn are neither dependent on the particular gene sequence nor on the level of expression. The internal standard methodology serves us as a stepping stone to normalization procedure and differential gene expression analysis in a statistically robust manner, to finding functional associations through clustering and networking genes having similar dynamical behavior. The internal standard used for the data normalization and for selection of differentially expressed genes consists of the majority of equally expressed genes obtained with iterative procedure described elsewhere[
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. At the beginning, all genes are represented by their residuals (relatively averaged profile), which after normalization and log transformation lose their sample-dependent individuality as well as their expression level-dependent individuality. Differentially expressed genes were selected as outliers from this standard (normally distributed gene expression residuals) beyond of some statistical thresholds, that was used in our case equal to 1/(approximate number of genes expressed distinctively from background noise) ~ 10e4.
