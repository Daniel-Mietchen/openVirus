<p>Briefly, 500 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using the SuperScript ® III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. RT-qPCR was performed using PowerUp™ SYBR® Green Master Mix (applied biosystems) on the QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (applied biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s directions. Primers were as follows: GAPDH, 
 <monospace>5′-TCTCTGCCCCCTCTGCTG-3′</monospace> (forward) and 
 <monospace>5′-AGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAA-3′</monospace> (reverse); IL6, 
 <monospace>5′-CACACAGACAGCCACTCACC-3′</monospace> (forward) and 
 <monospace>5′-CCTCAAACTCCAAAAGACCA-3′</monospace> (reverse); CCL5, 
 <monospace>5′-CGCTGTCATCCTCATTGCTA-3′</monospace> (forward) and 
 <monospace>5′-ACACACTTGGCGGTTCTTTC-3′</monospace> (reverse); and TNFα, 
 <monospace>5′-CTCCTCACCCACACCATCA-3′</monospace> (forward) and 
 <monospace>5′-GGAAGACCCCTCCCAGATAG-3′</monospace> (reverse). GAPDH was used as an internal control. The comparative CT (ΔΔCT) method was used for data analysis. Error bars represent means ±SD.
