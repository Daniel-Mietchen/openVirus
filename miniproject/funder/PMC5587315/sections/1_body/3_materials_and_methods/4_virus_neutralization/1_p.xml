<p>For neutralization experiments, clinical isolates of RSV were incubated with an RSV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (Synagis®, MedImmune, Gaithersburg, MD, catalogue # NDC60574) at a final dilution of 1:400 at 37°C for 1 hour prior to infection of MDM. After 90 minutes of infection, the inoculum was removed, cells were washed with serum-free media and incubated for 18 hours with RPMI1640 containing 5% FBS and M-CSF (50 ng/ml). Neutralization of RSV was confirmed by plaque assay. Overall, pretreatment of RSV with Synagis reduced the titer of virus greater than 4 orders of magnitude.</p>
