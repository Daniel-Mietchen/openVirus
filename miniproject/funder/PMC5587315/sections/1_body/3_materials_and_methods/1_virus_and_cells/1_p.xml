<p>RSV clinical isolates were obtained from RSV-infected individuals, as described previously, in New Haven, CT [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and Dallas, TX [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Isolates were plaque-purified, concentrated, quantified by plaque titration and working stocks prepared as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Viral stocks were prepared with a low inoculum (m.o.i. of 0.01–0.05) to minimize the production of defective interfering (DI) particles. Further, the number of passages of virus in cell culture was limited to prevent the potential viral adaption to cell culture. For all experiments, a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.2–0.33 was used. The m.o.i. was dependent upon the titers of the stocks of each of the clinical isolates. For each individual experiment, the m.o.i of each virus was identical. All specimens from which viruses were obtained were submitted as part of routine care. Only left over material was used for viral propagation. Collection of specimens from the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Yale-New Haven Hospital was approved by the Yale University Human Investigations Committee. The single isolate from Dallas, Texas was propagated from a de-identified clinical specimen obtained from the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Children’s Medical Center, Dallas. Collection and use of clinical isolates followed all institutional requirements and guidelines and was consistent with policies and regulations for the use of patient derived materials.
