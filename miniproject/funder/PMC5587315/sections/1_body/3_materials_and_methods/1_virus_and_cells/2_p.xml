<p>A549 (CCL-185) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultivated in F-12 Kaighn’s modification media with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary monocyte-derived human macrophages (MDM) were prepared as follows: peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy human (white Caucasian female) donors were enriched by density gradient centrifugation through a Ficoll- Hypaque gradient. For generation of MDM, PBMCs were plated in tissue culture treated dishes and incubated for 2 hours at 37°C in a humidified CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator. To obtain monocytes, non-adherent cells were discarded by washing 3 times. RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, 2mM L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin and 50ng/ml M-CSF were added to the dish. The culture media which contained fresh M-CSF were replaced every 2 days. MDMs were harvested on day 7.
