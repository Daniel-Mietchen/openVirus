<p>To explore in more detail the differences in induction of cellular gene expression by NH1125B and NH1067B, whole transcriptome analyses were performed at various time points after infection of A549 and MDM (donor #64) cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Modulation of host gene expression favorable to viral entry and replication were apparent at 4.0 hours post infection in MDM infected with NH1125B though this cellular response was not observed in MDM infected with NH1067B. Genes involved in the response to viral infection, innate immune response, response to interferon and the adaptive immune response were up-regulated in NH1125B-infected MDM by 8.0 hours post-infection whereas this response was, for the most part, delayed in NH1067B-infected MDM. Overall, the patterns of gene expression differed in A549 cells. While there were distinct differences between cells infected with the 2 viruses, particularly at 8.0 hours post infection, there was minimal up regulation of viral recognition, innate immunity, interferon response or adaptive immunity genes in the epithelial cell line, which contrasted sharply with the response of MDM cells infected in an identical fashion.
