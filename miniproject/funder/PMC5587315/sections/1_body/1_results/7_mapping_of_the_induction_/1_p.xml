<p>Our data indicate that clinical isolates of RSV are highly variable in their capacity to stimulate or inhibit the innate cellular immune response and that these functional variations are controlled by structural changes in the viral genome. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g007">Fig 7A</xref> presents a phylogenetic analysis of the whole genome sequences of 33 subgroup A and B strains and demonstrates that the strains examined in this investigation were related to subgroup B strains identified in different years. Detailed phylogenetic analysis of the 6 clinical isolates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) revealed that the induction phenotype (“high” vs. “low”) mapped within the 
 <italic>SH-G-F</italic> gene region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Sequencing of that region indicated that the phenotype mapped to the RSV G gene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Sequence analysis of all of the genes in the viral genome revealed a polymorphism in the 
 <italic>M2-1</italic> gene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) that also segregated with induction phenotype. The induction phenotype did not map to any other non-synonymous polymorphisms in any of the other genes in the viral genome. The polymorphisms that correlated with the induction phenotypes in the 
 <italic>RSV G</italic> gene were the 60 base duplication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, boxed) and a single amino acid substitution at position 229 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g008">Fig 8A</xref>, boxed) which corresponds to a threonine in “high inducers” and an isoleucine in “low inducers” and a single amino acid substitution at position 142 in the M2-1 protein which corresponds to an asparagine in “high inducers” and a serine in “low inducers” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). The 60 base duplication in the 
 <italic>G</italic> gene of RSV subgroup B isolates was first described in RSV strains identified in South America [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Viruses containing this duplication have nearly completely displaced viruses lacking this duplication [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] suggesting an evolutionary advantage for this particular genetic polymorphism. Taken together, these data indicate that viruses containing the duplication and or a threonine at position 229 in the G protein and or the serine at position 142 in the M2-1 protein, such as NH1067B, are more successful in inhibiting the innate immune response early in the viral replication cycle and that this property affords these viral strains with an evolutionary fitness advantage over strains that lack these elements. GenBank accession number for the RSV isolates used in this study are as follows: JQ582844 (NH1067B), JQ582843 (NH1125B), MF185751 (NH1161B), MF185752 (NH1182B), MF185753 (TX11-56B) and MF185754 (NH1001B).
