<p>There are distinct patterns of host cell gene expression induced by these 2 clinical isolates at different times post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g004">Fig 4</xref>; based on the same data set as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g003">Fig 3</xref>)). Genes favorable for viral entry and replication were up regulated at 4 hours in NH1125B-infected MDM as compared to NH1067B-infected MDM. These same genes were expressed at high levels in A549 cells prior to infection and down-regulated in NH1125B-infected A549 cells at 8 hours but not by NH1067B. In both A549 and MDM cells infected with NH1067B, there was far less variability over time of host genes impacting innate immunity, interferon response and the adaptive immune response as compared to NH1125B infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Globally, host cell gene activation and suppression occurs earlier during infection with NH1125B as compared to NH1067B (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The number of genes up or down regulated by NH1125B were much greater during early times post infection as compared to NH1067B (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). For example, at 4.0 hours post infection of MDM, 533 genes were up-regulated in NH1125B infected MDM of which only 19 were up-regulated in NH1067B infected MDM (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Likewise, at that time point, 485 genes were down-regulated during NH1125B infection of which none were down-regulated in NH1067B infected cells (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). The only gene up regulated in NH1067B-infected MDM that was not upregulated in NH1125B-infected MDM at 4.0 hours post infection was IFIT2. Among the genes upregulated at 24 hours in NH1125B-infected MDM but not NH1067B-infected MDM was 
 <italic>JUN</italic>, a component of the transcription factor AP-1, which is a mediator of pro-inflammatory cytokine production [
