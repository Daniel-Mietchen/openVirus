<p>The expression of several cellular genes is purported to be influence by the RSV G glycoprotein (for comprehensive review see Oshansky, et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]), including several TLRs, interferon and 
 <italic>STAT</italic>-related genes. Functional fingerprint analyses of the expression of these genes during viral infection are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g006">Fig 6C</xref>. Again, the viruses appear to segregate in a similar fashion based on the expression of these genes. Thus, NH1161B, NH1001B and NH1125B, inducing higher levels of expression of these genes as compared with the low inducers subgroup B strains. Among the genes up-regulated by the “high inducers” are several key components of antiviral pathways including

 <italic>STAT2</italic>, 
 <italic>MYD88</italic>, 
 <italic>MAVS</italic>, 
 <italic>TLRs</italic> among others.
