<p>MDM from a single donor (donor #66) were infected with a variety of subgroup B isolates. RNA was extracted at 18 hours post-infection and gene expression was determined by RNA-SEQ. The 18 hour time point for this experiment was chosen because the greatest fold difference in cytokine and chemokine induction between the NH1125B and NH1067B was at this time point (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) demonstrated differences at this time point. Functional fingerprint of the dynamic changes in the genes described in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g006">Fig 6</xref>. There were marked differences in expression across viral strains. Viral strains which induced relatively high levels of IL-6 and CCL5, (NH1125B, NH1001B and NH1161B) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref> designated as “high inducers”), had similar dynamic changes in overall gene expression whereas viral strains that induced relatively lower concentrations of IL-6 and CCL5, (NH1067B, NH1182B, TX11-56B) (designated as “low inducers; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), displayed similar functional fingerprints and relatively little induction of genes that are typically expressed in response to viral infection. In all, it appears that there is concordance between induction of IL-6 and CCL5 (as measured by BioPlex) and the functional fingerprints of cellular gene expression induced by specific RSV viruses.
