<p>In order to determine whether the response to virus infection was uniform among individual donors, we infected MDM from several healthy donors and defined the host cell gene activation profiles. Using the same gene clustering approach as described for 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g003">Fig 3</xref>, we identified the transcriptional profiles of MDM in response to NH1125B infection. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g005">Fig 5</xref>, there was diversity in the host response of donors in response to RSV infection at 24 hours. While some donors appeared to have a robust innate response (e.g. donor #40), others did not (e.g. donor #66).
