<p>Several studies of RSV and related paramyxoviruses have demonstrated that there is a gradient of transcription across the viral genome from the genomic 3’ end to the genomic 5’ end such that, for RSV, the level of transcription of the genes decreases in the following gene order: 
 <italic>NS1-NS2-N-P-M-SH-G-F-M2-1/M2-2-L</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. RSV gene expression in infected MDM cells was determined using RNA-SEQ reads that did not map to the human genome. At 18 hours post-infection (donor #66), for both NH1067B and NH1125B, there appeared to be relatively active gene expression for all genes except for the polymerase gene (L) (

 <italic>NS1</italic>/
 <italic>NS2</italic> and 
 <italic>SH</italic>/
 <italic>G</italic> junctions for both viruses. To further explore the dynamics of RSV gene expression over time, RNA was extracted from infected cells, both A549 and MDM (donor #64), at numerous time points post-infection gene expression was determined using RNA-SEQ. In all, there appeared to be an overall gradient of gene expression (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). However, the expression of the 
 <italic>P</italic> gene or the 
 <italic>G</italic> gene appeared to be highest among all genes at nearly every time point for both viruses. There was a marked reduction in viral gene expression in NH1125B-infected MDM at 4.0 hours post-infection as compared to NH1067B infected MDM and this coincided with the most dramatic difference in host gene expression as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g003">Fig 3</xref>. This difference was not observed in infected A549 cells (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Consistent with the data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, expression of the 
 <italic>L</italic> gene was substantially lower than other viral genes at each time points.
