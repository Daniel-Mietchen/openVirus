<p>One of the risks in using virus isolated from clinical specimens is that prepared viral stocks (even if plaque-purified 3 times as is the case with all viruses used in this set of experiments) may contain undetectable viruses that may contribute to cytokine induction and therefore result in misleading data. To address this issue and to determine whether infection with RSV was necessary for induction of IL-6 and CCL5 in MDM, a virus neutralization experiment was performed using clinical isolate NH1125B (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g001">Fig 1</xref>, NH1125B induced IL-6 and CCL5 in MDM from 2 independent donors (#96 and 98). This induction was blocked by incubation of NH1125B with an RSV-neutralizing antibody (palivizumab, SYN) prior to infection (Panel A, B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). To establish that the RSV neutralizing antibody did not independently affect the induction of IL-6 or CCL5, MDM were stimulated with the TLR7/8 stimulator (R848) in the absence and presence of the RSV neutralizing antibody (using the same concentration as that used in the virus-neutralization experiment). The RSV-neutralizing antibody did not have any effect on the induction of IL-6 and CCL5 (Panel C, D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This series of experiments indicated that the induction of IL-6 and CCL5 by NH1125B is virus specific, requires viral infection and was not due to some other factor (e.g. virus) in the viral stock preparation.
