<p>These initial observations were broadened by the analysis of transcriptome sequence data obtained from virus-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) which demonstrates variations in the induction of multiple cytokines transcription in both infected A549 and MDM cells. Furthermore, MDM cells transcribe many more chemokines than A549 cells infected identically consistent with the well-established potency of the macrophage to induce inflammation during infections. The differences in the expression of IL-6, CCL5 and TNFα were confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Consistent with our RNA-SEQ data, the induction of IL-6 and CCL5 in A549 cells was significantly greater in cells infected with NH1125B as compared to NH1067B (there was minimal induction of TNFα in A549 cells is response to either virus so this data was not included in the figure). NH1125B, as compared to NH1067B, induced IL-6 earlier during infection and induced greater levels of CCL5 and TNFα transcripts in the MDM of the 2 donors (#67 and #68) presented. Host transcriptome data for A549 cells and MDMs from these 2 donors supported the differences in the time of gene expression by the NH1125B and NH1067B (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s001">S1 Fig</xref>; all genes displayed are statistically significantly different vs. mock infected cells). Although the overall patterns of gene expression in cells infected with NH1125B and NH1067B were, in general similar, there were distinct differences in the kinetics of gene expression between the 2 viruses. Based on these data, the induction of several cellular pathways was deciphered (Panel A-I in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) providing insights into the defined cellular responses to RSV infection. In all, the level of induction of cytokine and chemokine genes was dependent on the infecting virus strain, with NH1125B allowing significantly greater transcription levels of many innate immune response genes. The replication kinetics of NH1125B and NH1067B were essentially identical [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] indicating that some other intrinsic property of the viruses, other than replication dynamics, drives the innate immune response.
