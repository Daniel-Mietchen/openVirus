<p>We have previously demonstrated that clinical isolates of RSV differ in their capacity to induce cytokines and chemokines in a standard human respiratory epithelial cell line, A549 [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To determine whether this was the case during infection of monocyte-derived human macrophages (MDM), NH1125B and NH1067B were used to infect MDM (donor #66, 67 and 68). At several time points post infection, supernatants were collected and the concentrations of IL-6 and CCL5 determined by BioPlex assay (

These time points were chosen, in large part, because initial experiments indicated that at early times post infection (typically 8â€“18 hours) the most significant differences between the 2 viruses were observed. We included later times (up to 24 hours post infection) as subsequent experiments suggested that the induction patterns of NH1067B trended towards that observed for NH1125B. For A549 cells and MDM, the induction of IL-6 and CCL5 was greater during infection with NH1125B than NH1067B at both 18 and 24 hours post-infection. To explore whether this observation was specific to these 3 donors or an inherent property of the viral strains, we screened MDMs from an additional 16 donors for induction of IL-6 and CCL5 during viral infection. In each case, IL-6 and CCL5 induction was greater during infection with NH1125B than NH1067B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>, respectively) indicating that there are likely viral-specific factors involved in the degree of cytokine and chemokine induction during infection.
