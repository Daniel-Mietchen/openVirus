<p>Here, we describe an investigation of clinical isolates of RSV in cells of human origin, including MDM from a variety of donors. We chose human MDM because macrophages represent a key cell lineage in the control of RSV infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and are responsible for much of the inflammatory response during infection with RSV [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, there is mounting data indicating that the innate immune response to RSV drives pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and that immune dysregulation in response to RSV, as defined by gene expression profiles of children infected with RSV, contribute to pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our results demonstrate that the patterns of host cell gene expression differ in cells infected with clinical strains of RSV, strongly suggesting that viral genomic polymorphism underlie, in part, the differences in the severity of clinical disease observed in infants and young children. These data are consistent with previous studies that demonstrate that A549 cells infected with viruses collected from children with severe disease produced higher levels of IL6 and CCL5 (RANTES) than cells infected with viruses obtained from children with mild disease[
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While some of the viruses (e.g. NH1125B) induced a strong inflammatory response, consistent with gene profiles observed in animal models [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], several viruses (e.g. NH1067B) did so to lesser extent suggesting that these viruses may possess different disease potential. It appears that NH1067B and other NH1067B-like viruses are more efficient at inhibiting innate immune responses, including the induction of cytokines early in viral infection and that this may contribute to the viral pathogenicity. Indeed, blood transcriptome profiles of RSV-infected children has been used to predict prognosis of severe disease supporting the use of these types of genomic and transcription signatures studying viral pathogenesis[
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and in the case of this study identifying mapping elements in the viral genome that induce or perhaps suppress the innate immune response.
