<p>Many human genes have been implicated in the host innate immune response to viral infection. RIG-I (encoded by the DDX58 gene), a pattern recognition receptor for viral RNA, and MAVS, which mediates the activation of NFKB and IRF3 in response to viral infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], both key molecules in the cellular innate immune response, are activated to a lesser extent by NH1067B and other “low inducers” as compared to NH1125B and other “high inducers” at early times post infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). These data imply that “low inducer” viruses such as NH1067B either suppress or evade early recognition of the innate immune system, perhaps resulting in an evolutionary advantage for these viruses that may have contributed to the increased frequency of RSV clinical isolates with this G gene duplication over the past decade. Clinical studies have identified polymorphisms in specific innate immune response genes that appear to be associated with increased susceptibility to severe RSV disease. For example, the 7 genes listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184318.t001">Table 1</xref>, which are differentially induced by NH1125B and NH1067B, have been implicated in clinical investigations to be linked to severity of illness further supporting the hypothesis that feral strains of RSV differ in disease potential. Genes linked to host defenses are also differentially expressed in response to infection with clinical isolates of RSV. For example, the expression of 
 <italic>JUN</italic>, which encodes a component of the transcription factor AP-1, which is a mediator of proinflammatory cytokine production [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], is stimulated in the early stages of infection of MDM with NH1125B but not NH1067B. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in 
 <italic>JUN</italic> has been associated with susceptibility of children to RSV bronchiolitis [
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Large data sets, incorporating in vitro and clinical data, have identified a small number of genes upregulated during RSV infection (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184318.t002">Table 2</xref>). The expression of these genes differs in cells infected with NH1125B as compared to NH1067B. While the function of some of these genes in RSV disease remains unknown, it is likely that the upregulation of expression is a key component of the cellular innate immune response. Two distinct patterns of induction of &gt;200 genes by RSV were observed in cells obtained from 5 human donors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g005">Fig 5</xref>) indicating that variations in the human genome impact the magnitude of the innate immune response induced by RSV. Taken together, the data presented suggests that the viral-host couple may determine the severity of disease with both viral and host genetic factors involved in the complex dynamics of pathogenesis.
