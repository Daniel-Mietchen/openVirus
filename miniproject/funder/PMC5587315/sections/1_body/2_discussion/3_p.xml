<p>The activation of the interferon pathways by NH1125B and NH1067 differ quantitatively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g009">Fig 9</xref>) with, based on our transcriptome data, predictable downstream gene activation sequelae. In vitro studies using recombinant virus have demonstrated that the non-structural genes of RSV, 
 <italic>NS1</italic> and 
 <italic>NS2</italic>, possess anti-interferon activities and are, at least to some extent, part of the RSV encoded anti-viral armamentarium [

 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, the differences in cytokine induction observed between clinical strains NH1125B and NH1067B are unlikely to be associated with polymorphisms in the 
 <italic>NS1</italic> gene of these viruses. Overall, there is a single silent nucleotide polymorphism present in the 
 <italic>NS1</italic> gene between NH1125B and NH1067B. There are 4 nucleotide polymorphisms in the 
 <italic>NS2</italic> gene between NH1125B and NH1067B, 3 of which are silent and 1 which results in a methionine (NH1125B) to leucine (NH1067B) at position 10 ([
 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], GenBank JQ582843, JQ582844). These 
 <italic>NS1</italic> and 
 <italic>NS2</italic> variants did not correlate with the magnitude of innate immunity they induced suggesting that there may be other components of the viral genome which contribute to interferon suppression or induction.
