<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that clinical isolates of RSV are heterogeneous in regards to biological properties, including the induction or suppression of host cell innate immune responses. Overall, it seems that the timing of the induction of the innate immune system is dependent on the virus while the magnitude of the response is dependent on the host. Early activation of the innate immune system, as is the case with NH1125B, likely has implications for disease severity and pathogenesis. Experimental infection of non-human primates with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 demonstrated that disease severity is associated with differential gene expression early in infection. Overall, the induction of interferon-induced upregulation of genes related to innate immunity, apoptosis and antigen presentation during early stages of infection was limited in severe infection[

Our data indicate that viral sequences may dictate pathogenesis and, in fact, may explain, in part, the varying degrees of severity of illness observed in infants and young children. Furthermore, we show that the investigation of clinical isolates, which possesses naturally-occurring polymorphisms, may lead to the identification of sequences that underlie viral virulence. Whether a more efficient suppression of innate immunity correlates with increases or decreases in viral pathogenesis remains to be determined. Our ongoing investigation of the variations in the RSV genome may lead to the development of novel antiviral agents and approaches.
