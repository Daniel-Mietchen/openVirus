<p>Transcriptome analyses are a powerful tool to define the cellular and organismal response to pathogens. Likewise, this powerful technology can be used to define the kinetics of viral gene expression during infection. Here we showed that the expression of viral genes was consistent with previous studies using hybridization technologies. For example, our data revealed that there was relatively low expression of the 
 <italic>L</italic> gene. This is not entirely unexpected as this gene encodes the enzymatic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is contained within virions and delivered into the cytoplasm upon infection, and is likely needed in relatively small quantities in infected cells to perform its transcriptional and replicative functions. Our data are consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated that there is a gradient of transcription of viral genes across the viral genome from the 3’ end (of the negative strand beginning with a leader sequence and the 
 <italic>NS1</italic> gene) to the 5’ end [

 <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This pattern is present in both infected A549 cells and MDM (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s006">S6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s007">S7</xref> Figs). However, there are 2 genes that appear to stand out from this pattern, the 
 <italic>G</italic> gene as noted above, and the 
 <italic>P</italic> gene. In both A549 cells and MDM, RSV G expression was the highest among all viral genes in NH1125B infected cells at late times post infection (8.0 and 24 hours, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). This was not the case with NH1067B. The significance of 
 <italic>G</italic> gene expression and its relationship to host cell gene expression remains to be determined.
