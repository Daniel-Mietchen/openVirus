Multiple strains of both subgroup A and B viruses circulate during each seasonal epidemic. Genetic heterogeneity among RSV genomes, in large part due to the error prone RNA-dependent, RNA polymerase, could mediate variations in pathogenicity. We evaluated clinical strains of RSV for their ability to induce the innate immune response. Subgroup B viruses were used to infect human pulmonary epithelial cells (A549) and primary monocyte-derived human macrophages (MDM) from a variety of donors. Secretions of IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES) from infected cells were measured following infection. Host and viral transcriptome expression were assessed using RNA-SEQ technology and the genomic sequences of several clinical isolates were determined. There were dramatic differences in the induction of IL-6 and CCL5 in both A549 cells and MDM infected with a variety of clinical isolates of RSV. Transcriptome analyses revealed that the pattern of innate immune activation in MDM was virus-specific and host-specific. Specifically, viruses that induced high levels of secreted IL-6 and CCL5 tended to induce cellular innate immune pathways whereas viruses that induced relatively low level of IL-6 or CCL5 did not induce or suppressed innate immune gene expression. Activation of the host innate immune response mapped to variations in the <italic>RSV G</italic> gene and the <italic>M2-1</italic> gene. Viral transcriptome data indicated that there was a gradient of transcription across the RSV genome though in some strains, <italic>RSV G</italic> was the expressed in the highest amounts at late times post-infection. Clinical strains of RSV differ in cytokine/chemokine induction and in induction and suppression of host genes expression suggesting that these viruses may have inherent differences in virulence potential. Identification of the genetic elements responsible for these differences may lead to novel approaches to antiviral agents and vaccines.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AI126109-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4139-155X</contrib-id><name><surname>Kahn</surname><given-names>Jeffrey S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007914</institution-id><institution>University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4139-155X</contrib-id><name><surname>Kahn</surname><given-names>Jeffrey S.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the Department of Pediatrics and The Sarah M. &#x00026; Charles E.

RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization of young children in the United States accounting for ~80,000 hospitalizations each year[<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Globally, RSV is the most common cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection responsible for significant mortality in children less than 5 years of age (up to 199,000 deaths per year), mostly in developing countries [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. RSV is responsible for ~50% of all pneumonias in infancy[<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The virus is ubiquitous&#x02014;by the age of 2 years, nearly every child has exposed to and infected with RSV[<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The epidemiology of RSV is complex and dynamic. RSV strains can be classified, based on serological [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or genetic methods [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], into 2 subgroups, A or B. Both subgroup A and B viruses circulate during seasonal epidemics (typically the late fall, winter and early spring in temperate climates) and unlike influenza virus pandemics, RSV strains may vary from location to location in any given RSV season [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Likewise, strains identified in one location may be similar to strains from vastly different geographic locations identified in different years [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of RSV is not fully defined. Several animal models, including mice, cotton rats, and non-human primates, have been used to study RSV infection [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The vast majority of these investigations have used laboratory strains of RSV or recombinant virus derived from these laboratory strains. Many of these strains were isolated decades ago. For example, the reference A2 strain was isolated in Australia in 1961, and the passage histories of this strain, as with most laboratory strains of RSV, are not known or poorly documented. It is unclear whether these strains have adapted to cell culture systems or to animal models in which they are used, and in so doing, acquired mutations. Therefore, these strains may not be authentic representatives of feral strains of RSV. In fact, the reference A2 strain differs from several clinical isolates in its ability to replicate on primary human bronchial epithelial cells and induce interferon-inducible protein 10 and CCL5 suggesting that A2 alone may not be the ideal strain to study RSV pathogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, Line 19, a potential vaccine strain derived from a subgroup A isolate possesses biological features that differ from the reference A2 strain. This phenotype has been mapped to the RSV F gene [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, wild-type RSV strains are highly polymorphic and are likely to contain variations that impact virulence. Stokes et al demonstrated that clinical isolates varied in their capacity to induce airway mucous production in mice [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this study, 6 clinical subgroup A isolates, representing difference subgroup A clades and apparently chosen randomly, displayed distinct replication kinetics, IL-13 and gob-5 induction and mucin production in BALB/c mice. These studies, which relied, for the most part, on randomly chosen clinical strains, strongly suggest that a more thorough, focused and systematic investigation of clinical isolates of RSV may lead to the identification of strains with dramatic differences in phenotype, specifically, induction of innate immunity and inflammation and may lead to the identification of previously unrecognized viral virulence factors.</p><p>We have previously screened subgroup B isolates for their capacity to induce cytokines and chemokines, specifically IL-6 and CCL5 (RANTES), in A549 cells, a continuous human pulmonary epithelial cell line [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. IL-6 is secreted by a variety of cell types including T cells and macrophages. In T cells and macrophages, IL-6 is secreted in response to infection and acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-6 is required for protection against a variety of microbial pathogens; deficiency of this molecule results in impair innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infections [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. CCL5, a chemokine, attracts immune and inflammatory cells to the site of infection and is secreted by a variety of immune cells, among them macrophages and non-immune cells such as epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We chose to study these 2 molecules because there is <italic>in vitro</italic>, animal and clinical data to support that these factors are induced during RSV infection and may play a role in the immune and inflammatory response to RSV [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We found that 2 isolates, NH1125B and NH1067B, differed in their ability to induce IL-6 and CCL5. The replication kinetics of the 2 viruses were essentially identical suggesting that the observed difference is cytokine and chemokine induction could not be explained by differences in the kinetics of viral replication.</p><p>Here, we have used comprehensive RNA-SEQ analyses to characterize both host cell and viral strain gene expression. Our results indicate that NH1125B and NH1067B differ significantly in their ability to control innate immune activation early in the viral infection cycle. This functional variation coincides with the presence of distinct features within the <italic>G</italic> gene, specifically a 60 base duplication and a single amino acid polymorphism and or a single amino acid polymorphism in the M2-1 protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Magnitude of induction of IL-6 and CCL5 in A549 cells and primary monocyte-derived human macrophages (MDM) by clinical isolates of RSV is strain- and host-specific</title><p>We have previously demonstrated that clinical isolates of RSV differ in their capacity to induce cytokines and chemokines in a standard human respiratory epithelial cell line, A549 [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. To determine whether this was the case during infection of monocyte-derived human macrophages (MDM), NH1125B and NH1067B were used to infect MDM (donor #66, 67 and 68). At several time points post infection, supernatants were collected and the concentrations of IL-6 and CCL5 determined by BioPlex assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). These time points were chosen, in large part, because initial experiments indicated that at early times post infection (typically 8&#x02013;18 hours) the most significant differences between the 2 viruses were observed. We included later times (up to 24 hours post infection) as subsequent experiments suggested that the induction patterns of NH1067B trended towards that observed for NH1125B. For A549 cells and MDM, the induction of IL-6 and CCL5 was greater during infection with NH1125B than NH1067B at both 18 and 24 hours post-infection. To explore whether this observation was specific to these 3 donors or an inherent property of the viral strains, we screened MDMs from an additional 16 donors for induction of IL-6 and CCL5 during viral infection. In each case, IL-6 and CCL5 induction was greater during infection with NH1125B than NH1067B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>, respectively) indicating that there are likely viral-specific factors involved in the degree of cytokine and chemokine induction during infection.</p><fig id="pone.0184318.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0184318.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Induction of cytokines and chemokines by clinical isolates of RSV in A549 cells and primary monocyte-derived human macrophages (MDM).</title><p>(A) A549 cells or (B) MDM (donor #66, 67 and 68) were infected with clinical isolates NH1125B or NH1067B. Mock infected cells were used as controls. At multiple time points post-infection, cell culture supernatant were collected and concentration of IL-6 and RANTES (CCL5) were measured by BioPlex assay. For the A549 cell experiments, biological triplicates were used and the error bars are displayed (for several time points, the error bars are too small to be seen in the figure). To make the MDM data from different donors compatible, we applied a standardization procedure with the average expression over all time points (for each donor) equal zero and the standard deviation equal 1. Data along ordinate axis is given in these standardized units. Nineteen donors (including donor #66, 67 and 68) were screened for secretion of IL-6 (C) and CCL5 (D) at 24 hours post infection using the methodologies described above.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0184318.g001"/></fig><p>These initial observations were broadened by the analysis of transcriptome sequence data obtained from virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) which demonstrates variations in the induction of multiple cytokines transcription in both infected A549 and MDM cells. Furthermore, MDM cells transcribe many more chemokines than A549 cells infected identically consistent with the well-established potency of the macrophage to induce inflammation during infections. The differences in the expression of IL-6, CCL5 and TNF&#x003b1; were confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Consistent with our RNA-SEQ data, the induction of IL-6 and CCL5 in A549 cells was significantly greater in cells infected with NH1125B as compared to NH1067B (there was minimal induction of TNF&#x003b1; in A549 cells is response to either virus so this data was not included in the figure). NH1125B, as compared to NH1067B, induced IL-6 earlier during infection and induced greater levels of CCL5 and TNF&#x003b1; transcripts in the MDM of the 2 donors (#67 and #68) presented.

To establish that the RSV neutralizing antibody did not independently affect the induction of IL-6 or CCL5, MDM were stimulated with the TLR7/8 stimulator (R848) in the absence and presence of the RSV neutralizing antibody (using the same concentration as that used in the virus-neutralization experiment).

While some of the viruses (e.g. NH1125B) induced a strong inflammatory response, consistent with gene profiles observed in animal models [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], several viruses (e.g. NH1067B) did so to lesser extent suggesting that these viruses may possess different disease potential. It appears that NH1067B and other NH1067B-like viruses are more efficient at inhibiting innate immune responses, including the induction of cytokines early in viral infection and that this may contribute to the viral pathogenicity. Indeed, blood transcriptome profiles of RSV-infected children has been used to predict prognosis of severe disease supporting the use of these types of genomic and transcription signatures studying viral pathogenesis[<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and in the case of this study identifying mapping elements in the viral genome that induce or perhaps suppress the innate immune response.</p><p>The study of clinical isolates and naturally-occurring variants has been an essential element in defining pathogenesis or the role of specific viral genes in human infections.

Ebola virus Reston, closely related to the highly virulent Ebola virus Zaire, appears to be non-pathogenic in humans. By comparing the sequences of the pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses, potential Ebola virulence factors, such as the virion glycoprotein, were identified [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, it is a reasonable hypothesis that clinical strains of RSV differ in their pathogenic potential and that the variability of clinical disease observed in RSV-infected children may be due, in part, the variability in virulence factors encoded by the virus. In fact, among laboratory strains of RSV, the capacity to inhibit TLR-dependent and TLR-independent responses in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells differs [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] further supporting our hypothesis.</p><p>The activation of the interferon pathways by NH1125B and NH1067 differ quantitatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g009">Fig 9</xref>) with, based on our transcriptome data, predictable downstream gene activation sequelae. In vitro studies using recombinant virus have demonstrated that the non-structural genes of RSV, <italic>NS1</italic> and <italic>NS2</italic>, possess anti-interferon activities and are, at least to some extent, part of the RSV encoded anti-viral armamentarium [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, the differences in cytokine induction observed between clinical strains NH1125B and NH1067B are unlikely to be associated with polymorphisms in the <italic>NS1</italic> gene of these viruses. Overall, there is a single silent nucleotide polymorphism present in the <italic>NS1</italic> gene between NH1125B and NH1067B. There are 4 nucleotide polymorphisms in the <italic>NS2</italic> gene between NH1125B and NH1067B, 3 of which are silent and 1 which results in a methionine (NH1125B) to leucine (NH1067B) at position 10 ([<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], GenBank JQ582843, JQ582844). These <italic>NS1</italic> and <italic>NS2</italic> variants did not correlate with the magnitude of innate immunity they induced suggesting that there may be other components of the viral genome which contribute to interferon suppression or induction.</p><fig id="pone.0184318.g009" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0184318.g009</object-id><label>Fig 9</label><caption><title>Pathway analysis of interferon stimulated genes after RSV infection.</title><p>Interferon stimulated genes are organized based on known established pathways and subcellular locations.

The genetic diversity in RSV strains is most pronounced in the <italic>G</italic> gene [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] and, consistent with that observation, the viruses examined in this study displayed the greatest level of diversity in this gene. Notably, NH1067B and the other low-inducing viruses (NH1182B and TX11-56B) all contain a 60 base duplication (not present in NH1125B) which was initially described in isolates in South America [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The duplication in the <italic>G</italic> gene has been reported to augment viral attachment and fitness [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] perhaps providing these viruses with an evolutionary advantage over viruses that do have this duplication. Indeed, subgroup B viruses harboring this duplication have nearly displaced subgroup B viruses that lack this duplication [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our data correlate the presence of this duplication with &#x0201c;low induction&#x0201d; phenotype however, it is not clear whether this duplication and/or the single amino acid polymorphism at position 229 of the G protein or the amino acid substitution at position 142 of the M2-1 protein are solely responsible for the &#x0201c;low inducer&#x0201d; phenotype. The CX3C motif (amino acid 182&#x02013;186) was identical in all viruses [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The M2-1 protein acts as a transcriptional elongation factor that prevents premature termination during transcription and functions as an anti-termination factor as the polymerase switches from the transciptase activity to a genomic replicase activity [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Based on the RNA-SEQ data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s007">S7</xref> Figs), there does not appear to be a global difference in the gene transcript profile of NH1125B as compared to NH1067B suggesting that this amino acid polymorphism may have an alternative role (if any) in the viral phenotypes. Nonetheless, the contribution of these amino acid polymorphisms will need to be deciphered using alternative approaches. Furthermore, non-synonymous or non-coding region polymorphisms may play a role in the observed differences in the viral phenotypes.</p><p>Transcriptome analyses are a powerful tool to define the cellular and organismal response to pathogens. Likewise, this powerful technology can be used to define the kinetics of viral gene expression during infection. Here we showed that the expression of viral genes was consistent with previous studies using hybridization technologies. For example, our data revealed that there was relatively low expression of the <italic>L</italic> gene. This is not entirely unexpected as this gene encodes the enzymatic RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is contained within virions and delivered into the cytoplasm upon infection, and is likely needed in relatively small quantities in infected cells to perform its transcriptional and replicative functions. Our data are consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated that there is a gradient of transcription of viral genes across the viral genome from the 3&#x02019; end (of the negative strand beginning with a leader sequence and the <italic>NS1</italic> gene) to the 5&#x02019; end [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This pattern is present in both infected A549 cells and MDM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s007">S7</xref> Figs). However, there are 2 genes that appear to stand out from this pattern, the <italic>G</italic> gene as noted above, and the <italic>P</italic> gene. In both A549 cells and MDM, RSV G expression was the highest among all viral genes in NH1125B infected cells at late times post infection (8.0 and 24 hours, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184318.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). This was not the case with NH1067B. The significance of <italic>G</italic> gene expression and its relationship to host cell gene expression remains to be determined.</p><p>Many human genes have been implicated in the host innate immune response to viral infection. RIG-I (encoded by the DDX58 gene), a pattern recognition receptor for viral RNA, and MAVS, which mediates the activation of NFKB and IRF3 in response to viral infection [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>], both key molecules in the cellular innate immune response, are activated to a lesser extent by NH1067B and other &#x0201c;low inducers&#x0201d; as compared to NH1125B and other &#x0201c;high inducers&#x0201d; at early times post infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). These data imply that &#x0201c;low inducer&#x0201d; viruses such as NH1067B either suppress or evade early recognition of the innate immune system, perhaps resulting in an evolutionary advantage for these viruses that may have contributed to the increased frequency of RSV clinical isolates with this G gene duplication over the past decade. Clinical studies have identified polymorphisms in specific innate immune response genes that appear to be associated with increased susceptibility to severe RSV disease. For example, the 7 genes listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184318.t001">Table 1</xref>, which are differentially induced by NH1125B and NH1067B, have been implicated in clinical investigations to be linked to severity of illness further supporting the hypothesis that feral strains of RSV differ in disease potential. Genes linked to host defenses are also differentially expressed in response to infection with clinical isolates of RSV. For example, the expression of <italic>JUN</italic>, which encodes a component of the transcription factor AP-1, which is a mediator of proinflammatory cytokine production [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], is stimulated in the early stages of infection of MDM with NH1125B but not NH1067B. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in <italic>JUN</italic> has been associated with susceptibility of children to RSV bronchiolitis [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Large data sets, incorporating in vitro and clinical data, have identified a small number of genes upregulated during RSV infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0184318.t002">Table 2</xref>). The expression of these genes differs in cells infected with NH1125B as compared to NH1067B. While the function of some of these genes in RSV disease remains unknown, it is likely that the upregulation of expression is a key component of the cellular innate immune response. Two distinct patterns of induction of &#x0003e;200 genes by RSV were observed in cells obtained from 5 human donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g005">Fig 5</xref>) indicating that variations in the human genome impact the magnitude of the innate immune response induced by RSV. Taken together, the data presented suggests that the viral-host couple may determine the severity of disease with both viral and host genetic factors involved in the complex dynamics of pathogenesis.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0184318.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0184318.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Genes associated with RSV pathogenesis and expressed differently in response to NH1125B or NH1067B infection.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0184318.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0184318.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">#</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene name</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Figure</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein name</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein Function</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Claims for Severity / pathogenesis (reference #)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>1</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MX1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184318.g006">Fig 6C</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Myxovirus Resistance Protein 1&#x000a0;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">This gene encodes a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-metabolizing protein that participates in the cellular antiviral response.

Overall, it seems that the timing of the induction of the innate immune system is dependent on the virus while the magnitude of the response is dependent on the host. Early activation of the innate immune system, as is the case with NH1125B, likely has implications for disease severity and pathogenesis. Experimental infection of non-human primates with highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 demonstrated that disease severity is associated with differential gene expression early in infection. Overall, the induction of interferon-induced upregulation of genes related to innate immunity, apoptosis and antigen presentation during early stages of infection was limited in severe infection[<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Whether this is the case with RSV strains identified here remains to be determined. Our data indicate that viral sequences may dictate pathogenesis and, in fact, may explain, in part, the varying degrees of severity of illness observed in infants and young children. Furthermore, we show that the investigation of clinical isolates, which possesses naturally-occurring polymorphisms, may lead to the identification of sequences that underlie viral virulence. Whether a more efficient suppression of innate immunity correlates with increases or decreases in viral pathogenesis remains to be determined. Our ongoing investigation of the variations in the RSV genome may lead to the development of novel antiviral agents and approaches.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Virus and cells</title><p>RSV clinical isolates were obtained from RSV-infected individuals, as described previously, in New Haven, CT [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and Dallas, TX [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].

Briefly, 0.1 to 1.0 micrograms of high quality purified RNA (RNA integrity number [RIN]&#x0003e;8.5; the RIN is a verified methodology for assessing the quality of RNA for gene expression measurements [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]) were used for producing RNA-SEQ cDNA libraries using TruSeq RNA Library Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina, Inc.) as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendation. For any given experiment, the amount of RNA used was equal. (Note: replicates using RNA concentrations in the ranges specified did not result in significant differences in transcriptome data.) This included using standard protocols for cDNA synthesis, fragmentation, addition of adaptors, size selection, amplification and QC (Illumina). SE50 single-end sequencing was done using HI-SEQ 2500 (Illumina) with &#x0003e; 18,000,000 reads/sample. Basic data analysis was done using CLC-Biosystems Genomic Workbench analysis programs to generate quantitative data for all genes, including reads per kilobase per million (RPKM) values, unique and total gene reads, annotated transcripts and detected transcripts, median coverage, chromosomal location, and putative exons. The data for the heatmap are expressed in standardized units: Dst = (D&#x02014;Avr)/STD, where D is level of expression of given gene (RPKM) in given time point, Avr and STD are averaged expression and standard deviation correspondingly for given gene over all conditions presented in the figure.</p><p>Methods for data normalization and analysis are based on the use of &#x0201c;internal standards&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>] that characterize some aspects of the system&#x02019;s behavior, such as technical variability, as presented elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0184318.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Internal standard in this context is considered as a large family of genes sharing some useful features for analysis, which in turn are neither dependent on the particular gene sequence nor on the level of expression. The internal standard methodology serves us as a stepping stone to normalization procedure and differential gene expression analysis in a statistically robust manner, to finding functional associations through clustering and networking genes having similar dynamical behavior. The internal standard used for the data normalization and for selection of differentially expressed genes consists of the majority of equally expressed genes obtained with iterative procedure described elsewhere[<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. At the beginning, all genes are represented by their residuals (relatively averaged profile), which after normalization and log transformation lose their sample-dependent individuality as well as their expression level-dependent individuality. Differentially expressed genes were selected as outliers from this standard (normally distributed gene expression residuals) beyond of some statistical thresholds, that was used in our case equal to 1/(approximate number of genes expressed distinctively from background noise) ~ 10e4.</p><p>In the analysis of the time dynamics of gene expressions in the infected MDM we first selected all genes demonstrating significantly increased variability (hyper variable expressed genes [HVE]). One of the most important criteria in the selection of HVE-genes and the analysis of their behavior is the choice of the &#x02018;Reference Group&#x02019;&#x02014;which is composed of genes expressed above the background of control samples with a low variability of expression (as determined by an F-test). Procedure for establishing the &#x02018;Reference Group&#x02019; was described in detail elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The comparison of these methods with some other normalization and analysis procedures was presented elsewhere[<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Created initially for the analysis of microarray data they were slightly modified to the needs of RNA-SEQ data analysis.</p><p>The two-step normalization procedure and the associative analysis functions are implemented in MatLab (Mathworks, MA) and available from authors upon request. These algorithms are also obtainable from an R package diffGeneAnalysis, available as a part of Bioconductor packages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.5/bioc/html/diffGeneAnalysis.html">http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.5/bioc/html/diffGeneAnalysis.html</ext-link>).</p><p>The study of the time dynamics in gene expressions were used genes whose expression level varied significantly when compared to the variability to that of the &#x02018;reference group&#x02019; (denoted hyper-variable (HVE) genes). Details of the statistical selection of these genes and clustering procedures used for analysis of their collective behavior are presented elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0184318.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>].
