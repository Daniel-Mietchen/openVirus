<p>11) The 4 themes presented are quite broad, and I am wondering if the analysis included identifying any subthemes? With some of the topics (i.e. education), sub-themes seem to be emerging in the different paragraphs. The authors should try to more formally assess sub-themes in all of their data as it would help make sense of some of the very broad findings. As an example, under education, there was formal “education” received in structured sessions with doctors/nurses/researchers. But then the authors also describe more “informal” education that happened during talks with neighbors (i.e. a participant reported being worried because his neighbor had TB and this prompted the participant to want to take IPT). The same is true in the section on perceptions regarding mode of delivery, where quality of care is explored along with waiting times, resources to get to clinics, etc.</p>
