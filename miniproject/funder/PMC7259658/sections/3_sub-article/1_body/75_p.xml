<p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting paper which explores factors that can contribute to high levels of adherence to IPT in Eswatini. Considering the persisting importance of TB in Eswatini and Sub-Saharan Africa, the paper investigates a relevant public health topic and is consequently of general interest. The paper clearly situates the problem and research question, That said, the manuscript has several shortcomings.</p>
