<p>Thank you for submitting your manuscript to PLOS ONE. After careful consideration, we feel that it has merit but does not fully meet PLOS ONEâ€™s publication criteria as it currently stands. Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses all the points raised during the review process. Additionally, please note that while PLOS ONE considers qualitative and mixed-methods studies for publication, authors should use the COREQ checklist, or other relevant checklists listed by the Equator Network, such as the SRQR, to ensure complete reporting (

In general, we would expect qualitative studies to include the following: 1) defined objectives or research questions; 2) description of the sampling strategy, including rationale for the recruitment method, participant inclusion/exclusion criteria and the number of participants recruited; 3) detailed reporting of the data collection procedures; 4) data analysis procedures described in sufficient detail to enable replication; 5) a discussion of potential sources of bias; and 6) a discussion of limitations.
