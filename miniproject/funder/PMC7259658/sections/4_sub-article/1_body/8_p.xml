<p>Three IPT delivery models included a community-based model, peer-support model, and a facility-based model. The community-model had clinic staff visit patients at home where they provided TB screening, adherence monitoring, and ART and INH refills. The facility-model asked patients to receive their screening, monitoring, and refills at a clinic. The peer-support model had patients join a peer-support group with a clinic staff member where screenings and monitoring were done and refills provided. </p>
