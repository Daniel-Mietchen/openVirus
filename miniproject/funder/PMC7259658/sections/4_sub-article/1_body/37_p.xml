<p>Response 13) We very much appreciate the thoughts shared by the reviewer. We respectfully have to defend our substantive choice to keep the four main themes. These reflect hours and weeks of interdisciplinary discussion and debate across continents and cultures. While there is always room to recharacterize some of the relationships between themes and their contexts, my colleagues and I stand by these data as reflective of our participants and their lived experiences. As such we feel compelled to address some of the reviewers suggestions as they are useful and will improve the manuscript. </p>
