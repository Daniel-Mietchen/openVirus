<p>Response 5) We thank the reviewer for pointing to this gap in the manuscript. As we commented to the first reviewer, the themes generated reflect months of careful consideration and communication between researchers and community members. As a result we feel strongly that education functions as an umbrella theme to much of the work that contributed to participant adherence. We detail those contributions in the results, and do not provide sub-themes as there is meaningful overlap and nuance that needed to be stated. At the same time, we have produced a figure to support the four main themes and believe this figure provides a parsimonious. We hope this mitigates the reviewers worries about communicating key findings and meaning. </p>
