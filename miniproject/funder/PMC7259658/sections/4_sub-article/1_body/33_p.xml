<p>Comment 12) In the section on disclosing status and enrollment in the IPT study, the authors report multiple positive experiences. This is interesting and may be due to the fact that most people in the study completed therapy. However, given the stigma often associated with disclosing TB status, this is somewhat surprising and merits further exploration. Perhaps people were more likely to disclose since they did not actually have TB (and thus did not fear transmission to others)? This topic should be discussed in more detail in the discussion section.</p>
