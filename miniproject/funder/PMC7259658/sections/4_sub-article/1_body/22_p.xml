<p>Response 7) We thank the reviewer for their comment and agree that recordings are an accepted way to collect participantsâ€™ responses carefully and accurately. We had intended to have our researchers used recording devices but due to resource-related issues our team had to rely on written responses, note taking, and memo writing. Given the time researchers spent with participants and checked understanding, we were confident that data we collected accurately reflects participant knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. Also, as we tried to state in our results, thematic analysis was validated using 28 questionnaires to support the findings from data collected from the 136 participants sampled. We acknowledge this limitation and have addressed this in the discussion.</p>
