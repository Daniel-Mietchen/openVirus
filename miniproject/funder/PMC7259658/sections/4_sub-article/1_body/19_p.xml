<p>Comment 6) Under the data collection section, the authors report that the researchers “conducted interviews and completed surveys”. In looking through the interview guide, I see that there were some questions in which several options were offered and some that were more open-ended. However, from the guide it also appears that even when specific answer options were offered, there was also an opportunity for people to provide more details. Therefore, I would just refer to these as “conductive interviews.”</p>
