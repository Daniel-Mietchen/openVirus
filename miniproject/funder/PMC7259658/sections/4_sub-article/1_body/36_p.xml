<p>Comment 13) The four domains identified are interesting and important, but they also seem to have possible interactions with one another. For example, an experience with education from a clinician/nurse/study personnel may have given the patient more trust in the facility and thus they may have had more trust in the facility. While it is important to describe the 4 themes, the data analysis should also look at how these themes may have interacted with one another. Such an analysis is missing from this paper. A figure documenting the different themes, sub-themes, interactions between them, and their overall impact on IPT completion would greatly add to the value of this work.</p>
