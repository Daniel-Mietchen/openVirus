<p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful comments and helpful suggestions. We have worked hard to acknowledge each of their comments and think the contributions have improved the overall quality of the manuscript. We have shifted focus, based on reviewer comments, to the nature of our findings and how young people who had difficulty describing their symptoms and state of well-being were able to do so more effectively once they began using Genia. Further edits will show that we have recognized the limitations of this study and have addressed each of the reviewersâ€™ comments as parsimoniously as possible.</p>
