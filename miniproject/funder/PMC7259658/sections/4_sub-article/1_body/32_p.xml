<p>Response 11) We thank the reviewer for taking the time to review the data with such detail and care. The inclusion of sub-themes was not part of the initial or follow-up data review process. As our team met multiple times over the course of several months and via web-chat, there were many decisions along the way to consolidate findings to focus on the main themes/factors contributing to ‘self-reported’ adherence. Sub-themes were viewed as taking away from the the broader impact of education and mode of delivery. In fact, as a research team we attempted at several points to break up the “broad theme” of education, but found it wasn’t easily differentiated into buckets, as individuals shared overlapping experiences and sentiments, suggesting there was a broader or more general form of education occuring, one based on lived experience.</p>
