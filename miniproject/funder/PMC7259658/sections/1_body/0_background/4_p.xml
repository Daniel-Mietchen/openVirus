<p>While newer models of health communication have emerged in the last decade to promote adherence, very few studies have looked to modify treatment strategies with applying novel delivery strategies with TB, HIV, or IPT. In response, the authors conducted a larger observational study [

Of three models of IPT delivery examined (community, facility, and peer-support), a majority selected a facility-based model and none selected the peer-support model. Although findings showed that self-selected mode of IPT delivery contributed to higher rates (94.8%) of adherence, there was little explanation for these observed rates [
