<p>Eswatini rates of IPT treatment completion are low; at 32% [
 <xref rid="pone.0232841.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] they are even lower than the suboptimal rates of 40â€“50% reported in other settings [

Challenges of adherence for IPT among PLWH reflect issues consistent with previous studies and include inadequate patient education and awareness of treatment. This has led researchers to suggest that many at high risk for TB are not aware of IPT as a viable treatment option [
