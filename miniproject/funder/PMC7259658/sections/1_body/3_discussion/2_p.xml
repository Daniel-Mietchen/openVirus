<p>Our study found four main themes that characterized improved treatment adherence (

 <italic>choice</italic> of treatment delivery seen as helpful but not essential for treatment completion. Given the integrated nature of 
 <italic>choice</italic> and 
 <italic>mode of delivery</italic>, there is enough contextual overlap to compel parsimony in our model; yet, there is sufficient thematic difference to merit unique attribution of content. A consistent thread throughout was the perceived value of choice. While viewed as critical for many, and also not essential for treatment adherence, having a choice appeared to promote autonomy and empower participants to make necessary, preference-based decisions about where to receive their treatment. Our findings confirm that patients who understood the risks of treatment and were aware of the side-effects, were able to gain support needed to remain in the study and complete their treatment. Positive perceptions among communities about the risks and benefits of treatment to promote adherence has been shown to overcome stigma and appears consistent with our findings [
