<p>While the findings from this work are informative and novel to the context of TB care and prevention, based on some methodological limitations our conclusions should be read with caution. As our findings report qualitative results of open-ended responses, we recognize that some comments were biased towards those who were more confident in formal conversations and still others who were more confident having informal conversations with research assistants. In other scenarios, participants responded to surveys that were in siSwati and back translated into English. While these translations were checked by members of the research team and native siSwati and English speakers, it is possible that some participants may have misunderstood the intention of some concepts like the difference between community health services and health workers or other concepts like access to care and availability of services. Interview data were captured by open-ended survey response, and not recorded, which may have limited verbatim responses; however, recognizing these limitations, research assistants checked understanding with participants periodically to confirm or clarify these concepts. With any qualitative data there is a limit to generalization and interpretation. Some consideration of selection bias is needed as our study captured responses of those who completed treatment, purposive sampling to identify 150 participants, and finally those who were interviewed at the facility. These decisions reflect an intentional design to capture programmatic feasibility and impact among patient-selected IPT delivery model, which did not favor all patients. These findings reflect very specific responses to care received in Eswatini for TB and HIV and the delivery and receipt of IPT.</p>
