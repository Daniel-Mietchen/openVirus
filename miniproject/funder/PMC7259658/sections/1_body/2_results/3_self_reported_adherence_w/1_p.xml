<p>We define education as a process by which participants involved in the study supported a broader sensitization of communities about the value of IPT as well as the risks of untreated TB. Education includes being offered information and knowledge about IPT or TB and includes expressions of social support characterized as appraisal (useful for self-evaluation), informational (advice), and instrumental (service or direct aid). A level of awareness reported by participants, seemed to act as a contributing factor to sensitizing patient communities to benefits of IPT for TB prevention. In other words, the way people communicated about their illness with family and friends seemed to indicate an uncommon awareness of symptoms, risks, and treatments.</p>
