 <xref rid="pone.0232841.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>): 1) Adherence to IPT was positively impacted by broader education that sensitized communities to value of IPT and risks of untreated TB; 2) Disclosure of health status and IPT enrollment acted to empower participant completion of IPT; 3) Perceptions regarding specific mode of delivery contributed positively to participant adherence; and 4) Choice of treatment delivery seen as helpful, though not essential for treatment completion. These four themes suggest that a broader means to achieving higher rates of self-reported adherence for IPT include education, supporting health status disclosure, finding solutions that fit people's lives, and giving people an opportunity to choose for themselves the delivery mode of their treatment.
