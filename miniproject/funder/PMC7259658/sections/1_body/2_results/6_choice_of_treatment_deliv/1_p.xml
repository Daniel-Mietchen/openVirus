<p>In the scope of patient experiences in Eswatini, models of care delivery reflect a more paternalistic approach to patient communication. Consequently, when asked about having a choice or having the opportunity to choose how and where they would receive their IPT protocol, many participants positively remarked that having a choice made a positive impression. A deeper look into these responses, it became clear than many participants had never been offered a choice of treatment prior to the IPT study. While a majority of participants chose to receive their treatment at regional facilities, this preference reflected a widely held sentiment that facilities are respected and provide high quality care. Further, facilities were seen as having fewer stigma-related challenges, while communities were higher risk for unintentional status disclosure.</p>
