<p>The formal process for conducting interviews was as follows: the team arrived at the clinic and met with clinic managers; the clinic manager introduced the interviewer to the patient; the researcher obtained written consent, and then conducted the interview in a private room or private outdoor space at the clinic. The interviewers usually conducted the interviews individually, where they would read the survey questions to the participants and take notes, adding comments to supplement qualitative questions. All the interviews were conducted in siSwati and in every case the semi-structured questionnaire was in both siSwati and English. The research team took notes in both English and siSwati, depending on the level of literacy of the participants and their preference for viewing and confirming written notes. Local team members would discuss and debrief survey findings each day they traveled to the sites to collect data. These reviews were summarized in bi-weekly updates shared with all research partners on a password protected file-sharing service.</p>
