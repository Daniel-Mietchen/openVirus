<p>Eswatini researchers conducted interviews in person with participants at each of the five healthcare facilities. The time and date of interview were scheduled to coincide with participantsâ€™ usual HIV clinic appointment. All interviews were conducted in person, after obtaining written consent. In situations where a participant was unable or unwilling to meet in person, a phone survey was offered. For participants interviewed remotely, we obtained a waiver for written consent as permitted by the ethics review committee of record.</p>
