<p>The first phase of our analysis process was to discuss and review the data as it was being collected. As a team we then began to construct draft codes to describe what we were observing in the data. This process of identifying codes and revising codes occurred at multiple time points over the course of the study. Each time the team met in Eswatini, the data would be reviewed as a team, new codes would be introduced (where necessary) and old codes would be consolidated. The process of clarifying groups of codes and drafting themes would involve engaging each team member in discussions about survey responses, informal discussions with participants, and cultural reflections by team members about their own experiences collecting data. At the end of each data collection trip the local researchers would meet to clarify their experiences and compare notes. Every three months, during the data collection process, the team would have video “check-in” sessions using a video chat software to speak with a more senior qualitative research member about progress and theme developments. As data were discussed, codes grouped together, and initial themes formed.</p>
