<p>The research team included a US-based medical sociologist, and three Eswatini researchers: two University Research Council (URC) research assistants, and a project manager, all of whom were supported by project principal investigators in the US and Eswatini. URC has been working on TB and HIV programs in Eswatini for decades. As such, the two research assistants and project manager were from the region and familiar with the TB and HIV care systems as well as local culture, contexts, and language. These team members were critical to the data collection process from both a socio-cultural perspective as well as from a researcher perspective. They were able to easily navigate local dialects, habits, and were especially considerate of clinical needs at each of the five locations.</p>
