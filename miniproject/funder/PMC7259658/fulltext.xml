While the country is moving quickly towards UNAIDS treatment targets of 90-90-90 (90% aware of status, 90% on HIV treatment, and 90% virally suppressed), there are concerns that immune compromised individuals remain at a much higher risk of acquiring tuberculosis. Impressive gains in the fight against HIV and TB demonstrate how local systems can coordinate to mitigate international epidemics; however, due to social and behavioral factors and speed of disease progression, screening rates for TB are much lower than necessary, limiting health systems&#x02019; ability to reduce new TB infection [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0232841.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) is the recommended course of treatment to reduce the incidence of TB in PLWH. The challenge, according to the WHO, is ensuring continuation of care to reduce high rates of TB among PLWH who started ART [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite the adoption of a government program to provide IPT to tuberculosis child contacts and PLWH in 2011, by 2014 less than 10% of eligible individuals were receiving IPT [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recent evidence points to the importance of self-selection of treatment delivery as a potential game-changing intervention to promote adherence of IPT [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], yet inadequate management of diagnosis and treatment are not having the desired success because of inadequate patient education, incomplete care coordination, and lack of healthcare communication [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0232841.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0232841.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Eswatini rates of IPT treatment completion are low; at 32% [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] they are even lower than the suboptimal rates of 40&#x02013;50% reported in other settings [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Clinical definitions of adherence mean successfully taking medications &#x0003e;80% of the time, the right way at the right time. Challenges of adherence for IPT among PLWH reflect issues consistent with previous studies and include inadequate patient education and awareness of treatment. This has led researchers to suggest that many at high risk for TB are not aware of IPT as a viable treatment option [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Further, what these findings underscore are the persistent environmental challenges of acquiring medication and managing the demands of home, work, and health among PLWH and others needing preventive TB treatment.</p><p>While newer models of health communication have emerged in the last decade to promote adherence, very few studies have looked to modify treatment strategies with applying novel delivery strategies with TB, HIV, or IPT. In response, the authors conducted a larger observational study [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] to examine the impact of offering patients different modes of treatment delivery for receiving their IPT and its impact on adherence. Of three models of IPT delivery examined (community, facility, and peer-support), a majority selected a facility-based model and none selected the peer-support model. Although findings showed that self-selected mode of IPT delivery contributed to higher rates (94.8%) of adherence, there was little explanation for these observed rates [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As a result, the authors conducted a qualitative study to identify these unexplained factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Eswatini National Health Research Review Board, the University Research Co., LLC&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board (IRB) (USA), the IRB for Human Subject Research at Baylor College of Medicine and Affiliated Hospitals (USA), the IRB for Baylor College of Medicine Children&#x02019;s Foundation-Eswatini (Eswatini), and Dartmouth College&#x02019;s Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (USA).

URC has been working on TB and HIV programs in Eswatini for decades. As such, the two research assistants and project manager were from the region and familiar with the TB and HIV care systems as well as local culture, contexts, and language. These team members were critical to the data collection process from both a socio-cultural perspective as well as from a researcher perspective.

Eligibility for this study required participants to have fully adhered to a course of IPT delivered as part of our earlier study [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Three IPT delivery models included a community-based model, peer-support model, and a facility-based model. The community-model had clinic staff visit patients at home where they provided TB screening, adherence monitoring, and ART and INH refills. The facility-model asked patients to receive their screening, monitoring, and refills at a clinic. The peer-support model had patients join a peer-support group with a clinic staff member where screenings and monitoring were done and refills provided.</p><p>The local research team along with clinic managers across the five sites worked together to recruit participants. Initial contact was made by a clinical manager to identify and determine participant interest. In consultation with clinic managers, researchers contacted selected participants to coordinate a date and time for an interview. Once provisionally enrolled, members of the research team would meet with participants to obtain consent by describing the study or obtaining verbal assent from a caregiver or parent.</p><p>The site locations were chosen based on urban, rural, and peri-urban geography. Selection of the five study sites is previously described [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Two sites were rural, being over a 1.5 hour drive from the capital Mbabane. The other three locations were urban or peri-urban, and were located closer to a larger clinic/hospital. The research team who conducted the interviews were responsible for scheduling interviews and travelling by car to conduct the interview.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Data collection</title><p>Data were collected between June and October of 2017. The research team designed an interview protocol to capture patient responses to a semi-structured questionnaire (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232841.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232841.s002">S2</xref> Files). Several topic domains were considered to help characterize the questionnaire, which were based on observations from the previous study and supported by professional experiences of the team. These included participants&#x02019; interaction with the healthcare system, perspectives receiving care while in the IPT study, perceptions of choice of IPT treatment, perceived challenges to and support for IPT use in Eswatini, and individual reactions to being in a research study.</p><p>Eswatini researchers conducted interviews in person with participants at each of the five healthcare facilities. The time and date of interview were scheduled to coincide with participants&#x02019; usual HIV clinic appointment. All interviews were conducted in person, after obtaining written consent. In situations where a participant was unable or unwilling to meet in person, a phone survey was offered. For participants interviewed remotely, we obtained a waiver for written consent as permitted by the ethics review committee of record.</p><p>The formal process for conducting interviews was as follows: the team arrived at the clinic and met with clinic managers; the clinic manager introduced the interviewer to the patient; the researcher obtained written consent, and then conducted the interview in a private room or private outdoor space at the clinic. The interviewers usually conducted the interviews individually, where they would read the survey questions to the participants and take notes, adding comments to supplement qualitative questions. All the interviews were conducted in siSwati and in every case the semi-structured questionnaire was in both siSwati and English. The research team took notes in both English and siSwati, depending on the level of literacy of the participants and their preference for viewing and confirming written notes. Local team members would discuss and debrief survey findings each day they traveled to the sites to collect data. These reviews were summarized in bi-weekly updates shared with all research partners on a password protected file-sharing service.</p><p>Self-reported data from the questionnaire and additional open-ended questions were captured on paper for all participants. These data were then translated from siSwati to English in the database at the completion of every interview trip. At times when there was confusion around language or what was written on the survey, the team would meet and discuss until consensus was reached. Team members kept track of interviews, locations, and participants through a number classification system. This allowed international research partners to review data on a protected database with ease.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Analysis</title><p>Interviewers transferred the survey data from paper files to a shared database on a password protected computer at URC office in Mbabane. Qualitative data were assessed via shared platform where the team coordinated a data reduction process based on an established multi-step thematic analysis described by Braun and Clarke [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our approach was informed by a broader theoretical framework in that we utilized simultaneous data collection and analysis as well as a method of constant comparison [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As Braun and Clarke have suggested, the flexibility of thematic analysis permitted the parallel use of both inductive (data driven) and deductive (theory driven) approaches [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This flexibility permitted us to address certain concepts we knew <italic>a priori</italic> to be present as well as those we knew little about, the uncertainties around adherence behaviors.</p><p>The first phase of our analysis process was to discuss and review the data as it was being collected. As a team we then began to construct draft codes to describe what we were observing in the data. This process of identifying codes and revising codes occurred at multiple time points over the course of the study. Each time the team met in Eswatini, the data would be reviewed as a team, new codes would be introduced (where necessary) and old codes would be consolidated. The process of clarifying groups of codes and drafting themes would involve engaging each team member in discussions about survey responses, informal discussions with participants, and cultural reflections by team members about their own experiences collecting data. At the end of each data collection trip the local researchers would meet to clarify their experiences and compare notes. Every three months, during the data collection process, the team would have video &#x0201c;check-in&#x0201d; sessions using a video chat software to speak with a more senior qualitative research member about progress and theme developments. As data were discussed, codes grouped together, and initial themes formed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><p>From the 150 selected, 14 participants were excluded as they did not recall being offered a choice of treatment.

Education includes being offered information and knowledge about IPT or TB and includes expressions of social support characterized as appraisal (useful for self-evaluation), informational (advice), and instrumental (service or direct aid). A level of awareness reported by participants, seemed to act as a contributing factor to sensitizing patient communities to benefits of IPT for TB prevention. In other words, the way people communicated about their illness with family and friends seemed to indicate an uncommon awareness of symptoms, risks, and treatments.</p><p>Participants in the study reported that they learned informally from others involved in the previous study about the importance of IPT and the connection between HIV and TB. Another example of this knowledge transfer occurred when a woman shared the value of her learning about taking ART medications along with IPT and how her husband also supported her,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>I would look at the time, when I take ARTs I would also take IPT and my husband would also remind me.&#x0201d; (female, 36&#x02013;49 years, facility-based model)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>The presence of community health workers enabled the informal exchange of health-related information by promoting positive health behaviors and strategies. Participants reported that this was useful for learning up-to-date details on how to care for themselves and others. In this broad way, education affiliated with ART medication was also linked to adherence, as demonstrated by another participant commenting here about what she learned from her HIV education,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>I learned from the lesson we were given on ARTs, the importance of taking your treatment on time and completing your medication.&#x0201d; (female, 18&#x02013;36 years, facility-based model)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>How participants learned from site staff was reported as a key driver of IPT completion. Being alerted indirectly or directly to the risks of TB was recognized across interviews as being central to the success of IPT adherence. As TB and HIV are thought to have very similar symptoms, education at the clinics and in the communities was helpful for participants to differentiate between the two. Informal conversations with non-participants clarified for members of the research team that stigma associated with HIV symptoms are often conflated with symptoms of TB&#x02014;loss of weight, skin coloring, coughing, and going to the clinic often for medications. Sensitizing community members, one family member at a time, appeared to be a consistent refrain. One participant made it clear to our team that educating friends was important.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>&#x02026;[I told friends] I was raising awareness amongst them since I am a patient of TB so I wanted them to know the about the development in treatment.&#x0201d; (male, 36&#x02013;49 years, community-based model)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>For other participants, educational messages described how they gained knowledge through informal exchanges with friends. Further, the way participants described seeking help for TB as a PLWH demonstrated they understood that IPT was beneficial for the individual as well as for family and friends. We observed this in one participant who made the critical point that having HIV made them more susceptible to acquiring TB.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>If positive, there is a higher risk of opportunistic infections including TB.

Participants reported disclosing through sharing their study experience, disease experience, and health status with their friends, family, and employer. Disclosure helped in the transmission of basic support, reminding about appointments and taking their medications regularly. When asked if they shared being in the study, the vast majority did, and chose to disclose in order to gain support to help them finish medications.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>I didn't want them to be surprised by the car coming home, because the IPT pills were brought home; and because I had already disclosed my [HIV] status.&#x0201d; (female, 36&#x02013;49 years, community-based model)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>In these instances, we refer to personal relationships as any involving friends or family members, as well as neighbors and co-workers. We also observed a subtle difference in the disclosure of status between those who are seen as &#x0201c;inside&#x0201d; the household and those who are seen as &#x0201c;outside&#x0201d; the household. Here we have an example of someone who shared with their neighbors because they understood they needed more help, perhaps something they could not have achieved without disclosing.</p><disp-quote><p><italic>&#x0201c;They were all aware of the poor conditions I lived under</italic>, <italic>so they helped me with food parcels so that I can take my pills daily</italic>.&#x0201d;(<italic>female</italic>, <italic>36&#x02013;49 years</italic>, <italic>community-based model</italic>)</p></disp-quote><p>When asked about talking with others about being in the IPT study, participants appeared comfortable telling someone very close to them like a spouse or sibling. They could share the burden of remembering to take medication. In this way we observed better adherence in people who openly commented on the benefits and risks of disclosure, as those who disclosed were able to more successfully ask for help, share feelings of fear and sadness, and receive words of encouragement from those who matter most. One participant emphasized the importance of sharing with her sister.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>It very helpful since I was staying with my sister then, she would remind me encourage me to take my medication, even when I was no longer staying with her sometimes she would call and ask me if I am taking my medication accordingly and asked if I am eating the right diet.&#x0201d; (female, 18&#x02013;35 years, facility-based model)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>While some participants commented that being honest with friends and family was important to reduce any potential surprises, the majority of participants who disclosed did so as a means of gaining support and sympathy. One participant&#x02019;s comment exemplifies the value of disclosing to close family members,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>My husband and my mother, I wanted her to remind me since he is my treatment supporter even for my ART treatment.&#x0201d; (female, 18&#x02013;35 years, facility based-model)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>The act of disclosing status to employers appeared consistent with comments about disclosing to family. Sharing status with important others, including employers, strongly suggests that disclosure served to open opportunities that supported adherence and treatment completion.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Perceptions regarding specific mode of delivery contributed positively to participant adherence</title><p>We define perceptions among participants as attitudes and beliefs regarding mode of delivery: facility-based, community-based, and peer-support model (described previously Adams et al, [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Perceptions included ideas about quality of care, trust, and previous experience. The facility-based model of care delivery was the default choice for a majority of participants, as many felt services in the community were substandard. One participant described their experience,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>The RHMs are lazy, they are not active so any community based services are not good.&#x0201d; (female, facility-based model)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We observed that perceptions of sub-standard community-based services often motivated people to seek care at facilities which were perceived as having higher quality care, while also offering anonymity and access to a doctor. Many participants spoke about the comfort they had with facilities, as they represented a more established and reliable treatment option. Participants have a sense that if they arrive sick and need help, they know they will be seen at a facility. Consequently, the facility model was seen has being more trustworthy than the community model,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>&#x02026; but sometimes there are some stock- outs in some medication and not having adequate water supply will result in healthcare workers not working on that particular day which is inconvenience for patients.&#x0201d; (female, community-based model)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Participants expressed different preferences that influenced decision-making. This pointed to the need for determining ability to seek care at the facility, access to transportation, resources to pay for transportation, health / ability to travel long distances, and considerations of child care. As one participant suggested, the choice to receive care at a facility was made easier due to their access to resources,</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>Yes</italic>, <italic>I could do things based on my circumstances and financial abilities</italic>.<italic>&#x0201d; (male</italic>, <italic>36&#x02013;49 years</italic>, <italic>facility-based model)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>While the facility-based model was preferred, in many circumstances, participants commented on the value of having the choice to receive treatment in the community as necessary and key to their treatment completion. One participant described the challenge of not having transportation access as being much less of a problem because there was a second option available to receive treatment.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>I thought it would be convenient because I don&#x02019;t have bus fare to the clinic.&#x0201d; (N/A gender, &#x0003e;50years, community-based model)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Other participants also reflected on the value of convenience. In many circumstances, things emerge in day-to-day life that are unpredictable, and having a choice to get medications locally was viewed as a real benefit.

Consequently, when asked about having a choice or having the opportunity to choose how and where they would receive their IPT protocol, many participants positively remarked that having a choice made a positive impression. A deeper look into these responses, it became clear than many participants had never been offered a choice of treatment prior to the IPT study. While a majority of participants chose to receive their treatment at regional facilities, this preference reflected a widely held sentiment that facilities are respected and provide high quality care. Further, facilities were seen as having fewer stigma-related challenges, while communities were higher risk for unintentional status disclosure.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>I was avoiding discrimination and criticism from my community as I know stigma is associated with the diseases.&#x0201d; FBQ3 (Field note quote)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Participants who went to facilities also felt that receiving treatment at facilities there meant they would be able to get other care (e.g., health questions answered) at the same time while not having to go to multiple places.</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;<italic>We do have health programs amongst people living with HIV, getting to facility is much easier and we are taught about condoms and other related health issues.&#x0201d; GQ6 (Field note quote)</italic></p></disp-quote><p>Beyond whether it was a community or facility, the choice of mode of treatment delivery was viewed by a majority of participants as an important feature of the study that helped them adhere to treatment.

For many, the basic idea of being offered a choice, and then being given the opportunity to choose for themselves, reflected a new kind of thinking. Drawn from a field note regarding the value of nurses and their connection to participants, there was a recognized sentiment among some participants that being offered a choice showed that the nurses cared. Consequently, many of the responses support the notion that choice led to feelings of empowerment and feeling connected with clinic staff.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Discussion</title><p>A clinical study conducted by authors demonstrated notably high rates of IPT adherence. We concluded that more information was required to determine what factors promoted this high rate of adherence. This finding was of particular interest given recognized low rates of adherence in Eswatini compared to other sub-Saharan countries [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>; <xref rid="pone.0232841.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. One study suggested that discontinuation of IPT for PLWH was due in part to negative reactions to treatment [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] while others indicate nonadherence was due to misunderstanding risks and benefits [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Other potential causes for low rates of adherence have been attributed to patients not being fully informed about the pros and cons of treatment, and consequently patients not having enough information/confidence to complete their treatment given their reaction to medication [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Our study found four main themes that characterized improved treatment adherence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0232841.g001">Fig 1</xref>. As shown in the consolidated figure, <italic>treatment adherence</italic> was positively impacted by community education, <italic>disclosure</italic> of status served to empower participant completion, <italic>mode of delivery</italic> perceptions positively impacted adherence, and <italic>choice</italic> of treatment delivery seen as helpful but not essential for treatment completion. Given the integrated nature of <italic>choice</italic> and <italic>mode of delivery</italic>, there is enough contextual overlap to compel parsimony in our model; yet, there is sufficient thematic difference to merit unique attribution of content. A consistent thread throughout was the perceived value of choice. While viewed as critical for many, and also not essential for treatment adherence, having a choice appeared to promote autonomy and empower participants to make necessary, preference-based decisions about where to receive their treatment. Our findings confirm that patients who understood the risks of treatment and were aware of the side-effects, were able to gain support needed to remain in the study and complete their treatment. Positive perceptions among communities about the risks and benefits of treatment to promote adherence has been shown to overcome stigma and appears consistent with our findings [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0232841.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0232841.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><graphic xlink:href="pone.0232841.g001"/></fig><p>While the idea of patients being more likely to adhere to treatment if they understand the risks is not new, there is strong theoretical backing from the health education literature, particularly around health behavior theory, which shows that individuals tend to construct beliefs and motivations based on perceptions of severity of illness and susceptibility to acquiring illness [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Other health behavior theory, particularly the reasoned action approach, which focuses on how attitudes, social norms, and social pressures shape behavioral intentions, suggests that adherence may be influenced by a confluence of attitudes and normative considerations [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In our findings, these behavioral determinants were also raised by participants as being indicative of barriers to adherence; however, the difference appeared to be participants who took a risk and disclosed their status were able to overcome many of these barriers to receive IPT.</p><p>Research on adherence describes how important sharing information with others can be for helping people feel connected and responsible. We found that disclosure of status served this purpose. While this is consistent with other research describing the value of family and social support factors [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], our findings identify the act of disclosure as a means to empower and activate social support systems. Those who were able to complete their treatment were supported by those closest to them, which include friends, family, and employers. This also recognizes the value of overcoming stigma in the community as a way to support better public health. Much has been written on the negative effects of nondisclosure or keeping status a secret [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], while other more recent findings state that a majority of patients that disclosed status to family or household did so in order to receive support/care [<xref rid="pone.0232841.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Following the natural phenomenon of participants supporting others in these communities to share their status, there is evidence to suggest that people are more likely to take their medicines regularly, find ways to leave work and pick up medications, and receive emotional support when needed.</p><p>Our findings also illustrate the importance of education as a way to empower patients to be better prepared and activated to make decisions about their treatment. We found in our analysis that participants learned about the importance of IPT from multiple sources including clinic staff, who received specific training about the study, and from others who may have experienced TB or other forms of preventative treatment for TB. We know that information can be valuable when shared through the right channels, and our findings confirm that in all settings, especially when dissemination of information can be a challenge, providing adequate upfront education to clinic staff and study participants served to &#x0201c;sensitize&#x0201d; others in the community to the benefits of IPT.</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Limitations</title><p>While the findings from this work are informative and novel to the context of TB care and prevention, based on some methodological limitations our conclusions should be read with caution. As our findings report qualitative results of open-ended responses, we recognize that some comments were biased towards those who were more confident in formal conversations and still others who were more confident having informal conversations with research assistants. In other scenarios, participants responded to surveys that were in siSwati and back translated into English. While these translations were checked by members of the research team and native siSwati and English speakers, it is possible that some participants may have misunderstood the intention of some concepts like the difference between community health services and health workers or other concepts like access to care and availability of services. Interview data were captured by open-ended survey response, and not recorded, which may have limited verbatim responses; however, recognizing these limitations, research assistants checked understanding with participants periodically to confirm or clarify these concepts. With any qualitative data there is a limit to generalization and interpretation. Some consideration of selection bias is needed as our study captured responses of those who completed treatment, purposive sampling to identify 150 participants, and finally those who were interviewed at the facility. These decisions reflect an intentional design to capture programmatic feasibility and impact among patient-selected IPT delivery model, which did not favor all patients. These findings reflect very specific responses to care received in Eswatini for TB and HIV and the delivery and receipt of IPT.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Future considerations</title><p>Recommendations for improving IPT delivery include more focused and scaled community education sessions. At the conclusion of this project, our team designed an IPT toolkit that has been disseminated widely at international TB meetings and is freely available via the TB CARE II website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tbcare2.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IPT-Delivery-Toolkit-web.pdf">https://tbcare2.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/IPT-Delivery-Toolkit-web.pdf</ext-link>). The research process, working in partnership with a local NGO research team, building clinical communication strategies, offering choice of mode of treatment, and keeping in close contact with partnering clinics were essential aspects to this work. Our findings, while very specific to Eswatini, reflect basic strategies of work that can be replicated elsewhere when tailored appropriately to country context and culture.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec021"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our qualitative findings identified key features for improving rates of adherence of IPT in Eswatini, which include providing clear and authentic education of IPT services and benefits, supporting participants to disclose status, and offering patient choice for mode of IPT delivery. Based on these findings, recommendations for improved services for managing and preventing TB among PLWH are strongly linked to providing autonomy and empowering individuals to make treatment decisions that match their expectations and lifestyles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0232841.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Questionnaire (English).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0232841.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0232841.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Questionnaire (Siswati).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0232841.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0232841.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Pathmanathan</surname><given-names>Ishani</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pasipamire</surname><given-names>Munyaradzi</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pals</surname><given-names>Sherri</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Dokubo</surname><given-names>E.

The authors should be commended for using a qualitative methods approach to better understand this unexpected finding. There are, however, several concerns I have about the paper which I describe in more detail below:</p><p>1) The authors need to provide information about the different models of care offered in the study. While they reference the original Adams paper from the 2017 IJTLD in some places, this is not sufficient, and readers looking at this paper need to know what was offered within each model.</p><p>2) The introduction to this paper is too long and it needs to be condensed into 3-4 paragraphs that more concisely lay out the issues: Eswatini suffers from a high burden of both TB and HIV; IPT has been shown to save lives, but adherence rate are usually poor; in a larger study done by the group offering different models of IPT, high rates of adherence were seen; the authors decided to do a qualitative study to find out why.</p><p>3) The authors should describe in more detail the primary study that was done (just 2-3 sentences perhaps to give the readers more context).</p><p>4) In the methods section, the authors note that &#x0201c;The site locations were chosen based on proximity to clinics and hospitals&#x0201d;. This is understandable, but it may have biased the research significantly, as patients who had further to travel to the clinics might have preferred a different model of care delivery. This needs to be mentioned in the limitations section.</p><p>5) In the methods section, the authors note that they selected participants only among people who self-reported that they completed treatment. This is a nice example of focusing on a &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d; outcome. The authors also mention the potential for bias this sample has in their discussion section. However, they might want to spend more time discussing this. In qualitative research, one aim is to describe a range of experiences to fully describe an observed phenomenon and the exclusion of people who did not complete therapy limits this.</p><p>6) Under the data collection section, the authors report that the researchers &#x0201c;conducted interviews and completed surveys&#x0201d;. In looking through the interview guide, I see that there were some questions in which several options were offered and some that were more open-ended. However, from the guide it also appears that even when specific answer options were offered, there was also an opportunity for people to provide more details. Therefore, I would just refer to these as &#x0201c;conductive interviews.&#x0201d;</p><p>7) Is there a reason the interviews were not recorded and transcribed? This is generally the accepted methodology for qualitative research of this kind. The authors should specify why they did not do this and also the limitations of not recording the interviews.</p><p>8) It would also be helpful if the authors could describe in more detail the analysis method that was used. They note that they used a &#x0201c;thematic analysis&#x0201d;, and the process they describe seems to have both inductive elements (the open-ended questions) and deductive elements (the questions with specific options for answers that were based on previous research). They also should describe the theoretic framework more (i.e. they seemed to used grounded theory).</p><p>9) The authors need to note throughout the paper that they are describing self-reported adherence.</p><p>10) In the results section, sometimes the direct quotes from patients are presented in italics and set off from the text but in others, the quotes are just presented in the text. The authors should be consistent in how they are presenting this rich data.</p><p>11) The 4 themes presented are quite broad, and I am wondering if the analysis included identifying any subthemes? With some of the topics (i.e. education), sub-themes seem to be emerging in the different paragraphs. The authors should try to more formally assess sub-themes in all of their data as it would help make sense of some of the very broad findings. As an example, under education, there was formal &#x0201c;education&#x0201d; received in structured sessions with doctors/nurses/researchers. But then the authors also describe more &#x0201c;informal&#x0201d; education that happened during talks with neighbors (i.e. a participant reported being worried because his neighbor had TB and this prompted the participant to want to take IPT). The same is true in the section on perceptions regarding mode of delivery, where quality of care is explored along with waiting times, resources to get to clinics, etc.</p><p>12) In the section on disclosing status and enrollment in the IPT study, the authors report multiple positive experiences. This is interesting and may be due to the fact that most people in the study completed therapy. However, given the stigma often associated with disclosing TB status, this is somewhat surprising and merits further exploration. Perhaps people were more likely to disclose since they did not actually have TB (and thus did not fear transmission to others)? This topic should be discussed in more detail in the discussion section.</p><p>13) The four domains identified are interesting and important, but they also seem to have possible interactions with one another. For example, a experience with education from a clinician/nurse/study personnel may have given the patient more trust in the facility and thus they may have had more trust in the facility. While it is important to describe the 4 themes, the data analysis should also look at how these themes may have interacted with one another. Such an analysis is missing from this paper. A figure documenting the different themes, sub-themes, interactions between them, and their overall impact on IPT completion would greatly add to the value of this work.</p><p>14) Finally, in the conclusion, the authors note &#x0201c;alarming&#x0201d; rates of treatment adherence. I think the rates are surprisingly high, but the term alarming usually has a worrisome connotation to it, and I would recommend using a different term.</p><p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting paper which explores factors that can contribute to high levels of adherence to IPT in Eswatini. Considering the persisting importance of TB in Eswatini and Sub-Saharan Africa, the paper investigates a relevant public health topic and is consequently of general interest. The paper clearly situates the problem and research question, That said, the manuscript has several shortcomings.</p><p>1) The manuscript is very long and can be substantially shortened.</p><p>2) While this is a qualitative study, the findings contain long descriptions of the context and analyses of patients' experiences and perceptions. However, very few quotes are used to support these analyses for the 4 main themes. In addition, few of the quotes that are used support the claims that are made. In light of this, I recommend to shorten the analyses in the findings, distill the absolute essence for each theme and support it with patients' words.</p><p>3) For example, describing the waiting areas and waiting times distracts from the actual finding i.e. care at facilities is perceived as high quality and reliable.</p><p>4) Theme 3 describes perceptions regarding modes of delivery. These perceptions are well described but can be shortened. In addition, the observation that these perceptions contribute positively to IPT adherence is not sufficiently substantiated. I would recommend using more direct quotes to show the link.</p><p>5) Theme 1 describes different forms of education. Similar to the previous comment, this section can be shortened and needs more direct quotes to show the link between education and adherence.</p><p>6) I would recommend to simplify the language used, especially in the findings and discussion sections. As mentioned earlier, the topic and findings of this manuscript have an acute relevance for public health programming and as such could benefit from shorter, more succint and easier to read language to ensure it is accesible to a wide audience of healthcare workers, local goverment, programme implementers, policy writers, and researchers.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.

</p><p>Response to Reviewers</p><p>Dear Editors and reviewers,</p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers for their thoughtful comments and helpful suggestions. We have worked hard to acknowledge each of their comments and think the contributions have improved the overall quality of the manuscript. We have shifted focus, based on reviewer comments, to the nature of our findings and how young people who had difficulty describing their symptoms and state of well-being were able to do so more effectively once they began using Genia. Further edits will show that we have recognized the limitations of this study and have addressed each of the reviewers&#x02019; comments as parsimoniously as possible.</p><p>Reviewer #1:This is an interesting and important study done looking at factors associated with positive adherence to IPT in eSwatini. The authors should be commended for using a qualitative methods approach to better understand this unexpected finding. There are, however, several concerns I have about the paper which I describe in more detail below:</p><p>Response: We appreciate the reviewers recognition of the work conducted and their identification of qualitative inquiry as a legitimate and rigorous method. We hope we&#x02019;ve addressed their concerns sufficiently. </p><p>Comment 1) The authors need to provide information about the different models of care offered in the study. While they reference the original Adams paper from the 2017 IJTLD in some places, this is not sufficient, and readers looking at this paper need to know what was offered within each model.</p><p>Response 1) This is an important addition and we have included the following language:</p><p>Three IPT delivery models included a community-based model, peer-support model, and a facility-based model. The community-model had clinic staff visit patients at home where they provided TB screening, adherence monitoring, and ART and INH refills. The facility-model asked patients to receive their screening, monitoring, and refills at a clinic. The peer-support model had patients join a peer-support group with a clinic staff member where screenings and monitoring were done and refills provided. </p><p>Comment 2) The introduction to this paper is too long and it needs to be condensed into 3-4 paragraphs that more concisely lay out the issues: Eswatini suffers from a high burden of both TB and HIV; IPT has been shown to save lives, but adherence rate are usually poor; in a larger study done by the group offering different models of IPT, high rates of adherence were seen; the authors decided to do a qualitative study to find out why.</p><p>Response 2) We appreciate the suggestion and agree the introduction is too long. We have cut much of the language to enhance clarity. We have revised the entire introduction in response.</p><p>Comment 3) The authors should describe in more detail the primary study that was done (just 2-3 sentences perhaps to give the readers more context).</p><p>Response 3) We have added language to explain the initial study and give an explanation for the current study under review. Here is the added text:</p><p>In response, the authors conducted a larger observational study (Adams et al. 2017) to examine the impact of offering patients different modes of treatment delivery for receiving their IPT and its impact on adherence. Of three models of IPT delivery examined (community, facility, and peer-support), a majority selected a facility-based model and none selected the peer-support model. Although findings showed that self-selected mode of IPT delivery contributed to higher rates (94.8%) of adherence, there was little explanation for these observed rates (Adams et al. 2017).</p><p>Comment 4) In the methods section, the authors note that &#x0201c;The site locations were chosen based on proximity to clinics and hospitals&#x0201d;. This is understandable, but it may have biased the research significantly, as patients who had further to travel to the clinics might have preferred a different model of care delivery. This needs to be mentioned in the limitations section.</p><p>Response 4) We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this detail. We have revised the language to match our earlier protocol and include it below. We believe it more accurately reflects how the sites were chosen and why. As a result, we think the modified language does not require additional clarification in the limitations, yet, we due include language on selection bias in the limitations section.</p><p>The site locations were chosen based on urban, rural, and peri-urban geography</p><p>Comment 5) In the methods section, the authors note that they selected participants only among people who self-reported that they completed treatment. This is a nice example of focusing on a &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d; outcome. The authors also mention the potential for bias this sample has in their discussion section. However, they might want to spend more time discussing this. In qualitative research, one aim is to describe a range of experiences to fully describe an observed phenomenon and the exclusion of people who did not complete therapy limits this.</p><p>Response 5) We thank the reviewer for this insight, and agree that qualitative inquiry extends to deeper understanding of all cases and experiences. Noting this is a limitation, we simply do not have reports of those who did not complete treatment. As we note in the limitations section, this was due to our research question to understand high rates of adherence rather than experiences of participants. </p><p>Comment 6) Under the data collection section, the authors report that the researchers &#x0201c;conducted interviews and completed surveys&#x0201d;. In looking through the interview guide, I see that there were some questions in which several options were offered and some that were more open-ended. However, from the guide it also appears that even when specific answer options were offered, there was also an opportunity for people to provide more details. Therefore, I would just refer to these as &#x0201c;conductive interviews.&#x0201d;</p><p>Response 6) We very much appreciate this comment and suggestion. We agree that the interview guide was used to support a discussion, a give and take, rather than an explicit call and response as might be likely with a survey. We have made the revision in the manuscript.</p><p>Comment 7) Is there a reason the interviews were not recorded and transcribed? This is generally the accepted methodology for qualitative research of this kind. The authors should specify why they did not do this and also the limitations of not recording the interviews.</p><p>Response 7) We thank the reviewer for their comment and agree that recordings are an accepted way to collect participants&#x02019; responses carefully and accurately. We had intended to have our researchers used recording devices but due to resource-related issues our team had to rely on written responses, note taking, and memo writing. Given the time researchers spent with participants and checked understanding, we were confident that data we collected accurately reflects participant knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs. Also, as we tried to state in our results, thematic analysis was validated using 28 questionnaires to support the findings from data collected from the 136 participants sampled. We acknowledge this limitation and have addressed this in the discussion.</p><p>Interview data were captured by open-ended survey response, and not recorded, which may have limited verbatim responses; however, recognizing these limitations, research assistants checked understanding with participants periodically to confirm or clarify these concepts. </p><p>Comment 8) It would also be helpful if the authors could describe in more detail the analysis method that was used. They note that they used a &#x0201c;thematic analysis&#x0201d;, and the process they describe seems to have both inductive elements (the open-ended questions) and deductive elements (the questions with specific options for answers that were based on previous research). They also should describe the theoretic framework more (i.e. they seemed to used grounded theory).</p><p>Response 8) We thank the reviewer for this careful reading and thoughtful comment. To address this point we have added the following to the analysis section.</p><p>Our approach was informed by a broader theoretical framework in that we utilized simultaneous data collection and analysis as well as a method of constant comparison (Charmaz 2006). As Braun and Clarke have suggested, the flexibility of thematic analysis permitted the parallel use of both inductive (data driven) and deductive (theory driven) approaches (Braun and Clarke 2006). This flexibility permitted us to address certain concepts we knew a priori to be present as well as those we knew little about, the uncertainties around adherence behaviors.</p><p>Comment 9) The authors need to note throughout the paper that they are describing self-reported adherence.</p><p>Response 9) We have added the phrase &#x0201c;self-reported&#x0201d; periodically throughout the manuscript to attend to natural flow of writing. We also added self-reported to one of main themes to reflect this as a larger concept. </p><p>Comment 10) In the results section, sometimes the direct quotes from patients are presented in italics and set off from the text but in others, the quotes are just presented in the text. The authors should be consistent in how they are presenting this rich data.</p><p>Response 10) We appreciate this comment and want to be as consistent as possible. We also recognize that some quotes were multiple lines and others were not, which may depend on the journal&#x02019;s preference. </p><p>Comment 11) The 4 themes presented are quite broad, and I am wondering if the analysis included identifying any subthemes? With some of the topics (i.e. education), sub-themes seem to be emerging in the different paragraphs. The authors should try to more formally assess sub-themes in all of their data as it would help make sense of some of the very broad findings. As an example, under education, there was formal &#x0201c;education&#x0201d; received in structured sessions with doctors/nurses/researchers. But then the authors also describe more &#x0201c;informal&#x0201d; education that happened during talks with neighbors (i.e. a participant reported being worried because his neighbor had TB and this prompted the participant to want to take IPT). The same is true in the section on perceptions regarding mode of delivery, where quality of care is explored along with waiting times, resources to get to clinics, etc.</p><p>Response 11) We thank the reviewer for taking the time to review the data with such detail and care. The inclusion of sub-themes was not part of the initial or follow-up data review process. As our team met multiple times over the course of several months and via web-chat, there were many decisions along the way to consolidate findings to focus on the main themes/factors contributing to &#x02018;self-reported&#x02019; adherence. Sub-themes were viewed as taking away from the the broader impact of education and mode of delivery. In fact, as a research team we attempted at several points to break up the &#x0201c;broad theme&#x0201d; of education, but found it wasn&#x02019;t easily differentiated into buckets, as individuals shared overlapping experiences and sentiments, suggesting there was a broader or more general form of education occuring, one based on lived experience.</p><p>Comment 12) In the section on disclosing status and enrollment in the IPT study, the authors report multiple positive experiences. This is interesting and may be due to the fact that most people in the study completed therapy. However, given the stigma often associated with disclosing TB status, this is somewhat surprising and merits further exploration. Perhaps people were more likely to disclose since they did not actually have TB (and thus did not fear transmission to others)? This topic should be discussed in more detail in the discussion section.</p><p>Response 12) We agree that the nature of this finding merits further investigation, and as part of our analysis we sought deeper understanding through the data. However, it came up that based on a potential sampling bias (pointed out by the reviewer) that this finding may be skewed, which we identified in the discussion. Also, while we don&#x02019;t think we can speculate on potential fears of participants, our observations suggest that disclosure did occur and it appeared motivated by a desire for support, which was a finding supported by other recent research. </p><p>Much has been written on the negative effects of nondisclosure or keeping status a secret (Gebremariam et al. 2010), while other more recent findings state that a majority of patients that disclosed status to family or household did so in order to receive support/care (Nyangoma et al. 2020). </p><p>Comment 13) The four domains identified are interesting and important, but they also seem to have possible interactions with one another. For example, an experience with education from a clinician/nurse/study personnel may have given the patient more trust in the facility and thus they may have had more trust in the facility. While it is important to describe the 4 themes, the data analysis should also look at how these themes may have interacted with one another. Such an analysis is missing from this paper. A figure documenting the different themes, sub-themes, interactions between them, and their overall impact on IPT completion would greatly add to the value of this work.</p><p>Response 13) We very much appreciate the thoughts shared by the reviewer. We respectfully have to defend our substantive choice to keep the four main themes. These reflect hours and weeks of interdisciplinary discussion and debate across continents and cultures. While there is always room to recharacterize some of the relationships between themes and their contexts, my colleagues and I stand by these data as reflective of our participants and their lived experiences. As such we feel compelled to address some of the reviewers suggestions as they are useful and will improve the manuscript. </p><p>We&#x02019;ve added the following to the discussion:</p><p>Given the integrated nature of choice and mode of delivery, there is enough contextual overlap to compel parsimony in our model; yet, there is sufficient thematic difference to merit unique attribution of content.</p><p>We have also added the following figure to the manuscript to depict what we believe to be the interaction of each of the main themes, recognizing that choice and mode of treatment have some overlap.</p><p>Comment 14) Finally, in the conclusion, the authors note &#x0201c;alarming&#x0201d; rates of treatment adherence. I think the rates are surprisingly high, but the term alarming usually has a worrisome connotation to it, and I would recommend using a different term.</p><p>Response 14) We have changed to &#x0201c;notably&#x0201d;</p><p>---------------------------------------</p><p>Reviewer #2: Thank you for the opportunity to review this interesting paper which explores factors that can contribute to high levels of adherence to IPT in Eswatini. Considering the persisting importance of TB in Eswatini and Sub-Saharan Africa, the paper investigates a relevant public health topic and is consequently of general interest. The paper clearly situates the problem and research question, That said, the manuscript has several shortcomings.</p><p>Response) We appreciate the reviewers time and thoughts on the manuscript. We hope we have addressed the reviewers concerns in detail below.</p><p>Comment 1) The manuscript is very long and can be substantially shortened.</p><p>Response 1) We appreciate the reviewer&#x02019;s comment and have reduced the introduction and descriptions in the manuscript substantially.</p><p>Comment 2) While this is a qualitative study, the findings contain long descriptions of the context and analyses of patients' experiences and perceptions. However, very few quotes are used to support these analyses for the 4 main themes. In addition, few of the quotes that are used support the claims that are made. In light of this, I recommend to shorten the analyses in the findings, distill the absolute essence for each theme and support it with patients' words.</p><p>Response 2) We thank the reviewers comments and have worked to refine the language in the results. We have also added a parsimonious figure to help mitigate potential areas of confusion. </p><p>Comment 3) For example, describing the waiting areas and waiting times distracts from the actual finding i.e. care at facilities is perceived as high quality and reliable.</p><p>Response 3) We appreciate the reviewers comments and have made significant edits to the results sections, reducing narrative, and focusing on the key aspects of the findings. </p><p>Comment 4) Theme 3 describes perceptions regarding modes of delivery. These perceptions are well described but can be shortened. In addition, the observation that these perceptions contribute positively to IPT adherence is not sufficiently substantiated. I would recommend using more direct quotes to show the link.</p><p>Response 4) We thank the reviewer for drawing attention to this gap. We believe that the extra language took away from core theme and have substantially cut sections from the theme narrative.</p><p>Comment 5) Theme 1 describes different forms of education. Similar to the previous comment, this section can be shortened and needs more direct quotes to show the link between education and adherence.</p><p>Response 5) We thank the reviewer for pointing to this gap in the manuscript. As we commented to the first reviewer, the themes generated reflect months of careful consideration and communication between researchers and community members. As a result we feel strongly that education functions as an umbrella theme to much of the work that contributed to participant adherence. We detail those contributions in the results, and do not provide sub-themes as there is meaningful overlap and nuance that needed to be stated. At the same time, we have produced a figure to support the four main themes and believe this figure provides a parsimonious. We hope this mitigates the reviewers worries about communicating key findings and meaning. </p><p>Comment 6) I would recommend to simplify the language used, especially in the findings and discussion sections. As mentioned earlier, the topic and findings of this manuscript have an acute relevance for public health programming and as such could benefit from shorter, more succinct and easier to read language to ensure it is accessible to a wide audience of healthcare workers, local government, programme implementers, policy writers, and researchers.</p><p>Response 6) We very much appreciate the reviewers comments and have made substantial cuts to the narrative to improve the manuscript. Given the rich detail provided in the results, we were only able to cut in specific areas, but with a more streamlined introduction and new figure, we think we have sufficiently addressed the reviewers important concerns.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0232841.s003"><label>Attachment</label><caption><p>Submitted filename: <named-content content-type="submitted-filename">Response to Reviewers PONE-D-20-02451]_final.docx</named-content></p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0232841.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></body></sub-article><sub-article id="pone.0232841.r003" article-type="editor-report"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0232841.r003</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision Letter 1</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>Katalin Andrea</given-names></name><role>Academic Editor</role></contrib></contrib-group><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; 2020 Katalin Andrea Wilkinson</copyright-statement><copyright-year>2020</copyright-year><copyright-holder>Katalin Andrea Wilkinson</copyright-holder><license xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"><license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License</ext-link>, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.</license-p></license></permissions><related-article id="rel-obj003" ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.1371/journal.pone.0232841" related-article-type="reviewed-article"/><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Submission Version</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></front-stub><body><p>
