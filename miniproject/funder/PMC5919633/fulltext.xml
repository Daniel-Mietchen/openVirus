Humans become infected through close contact with blood and organs of infected animals or through bites from an infected mosquito [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Epidemics of RVF are a major global health security threat due to the high morbidity and mortality in humans, and the economic impact associated with loss of livestock and ban in international trade. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) identifies RVF as an important transboundary and notifiable disease because of its potential for rapidly spreading across international borders, resulting in devastating economic effects through losses in the international trade of animals and animal products [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. RVF epidemics are characterized by massive livestock abortions and death, resulting in high economic losses associated with animal quarantines and trade restrictions [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, the economic losses resulting from the 2006&#x02013;2007 RVF epidemic in Kenya were estimated at US $32 million [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In humans, over 80% of RVF virus-infected humans are either asymptomatic or have a mild influenza-like illness; however, high morbidity and mortality has been reported in some outbreaks [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A 1977 RVF epidemic in Egypt resulted in an estimated 200,000 human cases and 600 deaths whereas the RVF outbreak in East Africa (Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania) during 1997&#x02013;1998 resulted in over 100,000 cases and over 450 deaths in Kenya [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A RVF epidemic in Saudi Arabia and Yemen in 2002 resulted in an estimated 4000 human cases and over 200 deaths [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Globally, livestock RVF epidemics have been most frequently reported in Eastern Africa, occurring every 4 to 10 years and closely linked with periods of heavy rainfall that occur during the warm phase of the El Ni&#x000f1;o/Southern Oscillation phenomenon [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Predictions of RVF epidemics in the region can be given up to 5 months in advance, based on ecological parameters and satellite imagery [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In mid-2015, the United States&#x02019; Pandemic Prediction and Forecasting Science and Technical Working Group of the National Science and technology Council, Food and Agriculture Organization Emergency Prevention Systems, and Kenya Meteorological Department all issued alerts predicting a high possibility of El-Ni&#x000f1;o rainfall and RVF outbreaks in Eastern Africa [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In response to the alert, the Kenya Directorate of Veterinary Services (KDVS) in the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries pilot tested an enhanced surveillance system between November 2015 and February 2016 in 22 RVF high-risk counties [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In Kenya, as in many resources-limited countries, the routine livestock surveillance is passive where public and private animal health officers must wait for farmers to report animal illness before responding. The aim of the enhanced surveillance reported here was to collect near real-time data on syndromes and risk factors associated with RVF to enhance early detection of the disease in livestock before spill over to humans. We describe how the surveillance was conducted, results of the surveillance, and recommend next steps towards establishing a national syndromic surveillance system in livestock and wildlife populations in Kenya.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec006"><title>Selection of high-risk counties</title><p>To increase the chances of early detection of RVF disease in livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, and camels), an enhanced surveillance system was implemented over a 14-week between November 2015 and February 2016 in the 22 counties at a high-risk of RVF outbreak (out of the 47 counties in Kenya). The 22 RVF high-risk counties shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006353.g001">Fig 1</xref> had previously been identified through the RVF risk map for the country [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In each of the high-risk counties, we selected three sub-counties with the greater risk of the epidemic for the enhanced surveillance. The criteria used to select the sub-counties included the number of susceptible livestock, areas prone to flooding, and history of RVF outbreaks. For the 25 counties that were not at RVF high-risk and therefore not targeted with the enhanced RVF surveillance, routine RVF surveillance was maintained by KDVS.</p><fig id="pntd.0006353.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0006353.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Map of Kenya showing selected Rift Valley Fever (RVF) high-risk counties in grey.</title><p>A high-risk county was based on ecological and climatic factors associated with previous RVF outbreaks in Kenya, as defined by Munyua et al.

The SCVO in each sub-county was responsible for reporting cases of suspected RVF in livestock from the selected farms in their area, using a data collection tool developed for RVF reporting. Each SCVO identified 20 livestock owning farmers evenly spread across the sub-county, and whom they interviewed weekly by telephone to determine whether there were suspected RVF cases in cattle, sheep, goats, camels on their farms or neighboring farms, and any suspect RVF human cases. Weekly, the SCVO collected animal demographic data (farm location, animal numbers and species), RVF risk factors (livestock production system, vaccination status, weather, and vector information), and RVF associated syndromes (abortion, hemorrhagic disease, mortalities and human illness). The SCVOs sent reports every Friday to the RVF Alert Centre via email (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006353.g002">Fig 2</xref>).

The enhanced surveillance for RVF reported here provided animal RVF disease data that served as an effective early warning for a major outbreak, giving a chance to prevent spillover to humans. The pilot created a model communication network for emergency reporting of animal health status between farmers, county government surveillance officers, and the national government. While the pilot focused on a select number of farmers, it demonstrated the willingness of farmers to participate, which is vital for the success of any national syndromic surveillance system [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although the predicted heavy El Ni&#x000f1;o rainfall that is associated with RVF outbreaks was not received in the East Africa region, the occurrence pattern of syndromes and RVF herds showed a positive correlation with rainfall and flooding. Overall, the number of reports of RVF-associated syndromes, in particular abortions and hemorrhagic disease were high in the months that reported the highest rainfall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006353.g003">Fig 3</xref>). A similar trend was observed with suspected and probable RVF herds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006353.g006">Fig 6</xref>). These data resulted in increased awareness among farmers, and animal and human health officers in these areas, thus increasing the chance of detecting RVF cases.</p><p>The surveillance had a number of limitations that will be important to address for any future syndromic surveillance efforts in Kenya. Since this was for selected regions, the surveillance and resulting data collected were not representative of the targeted animal populations of interest. While it would then be possible that RVF cases could have occurred and not been detected by this system, it was expected that any other outbreaks would have been reported through regular reporting channels set by the KDVS. Another limitation of this work was that the surveillance officers submitted their reports on a weekly basis, affecting the timeliness of data collection. Furthermore, the data received at the RVF Alert Center had to be manually transferred to another database for analysis, a step that introduced possible additional human error and delays in data analysis. Leveraging current technologies for both data collection (e.g., mobile phones) and data integration/analysis that allow for near real-time reporting of animal health will be required in order for future syndromic surveillance efforts to successfully meet their intended purpose of early detection of disease events. Another limitation is that the laboratory results may not have been representative of disease status of the herd, with a possibility that IgM positivity in the suspected or probable herds was missed. This is because the method of collecting and testing of samples from suspected and probable herds was neither random nor did it target animals with the clinical signs.</p><p>There were no RVF outbreaks confirmed during the surveillance period, most likely because the predicted El Ni&#x000f1;o rainfall was not received. However, it is important to note that 27% of the farmers reported having vaccinated their livestock against RVF within the previous three months, and surveys in these RVF high-risk regions have typicaly reported &#x0003e;10% seropositivity in livestock, and up to 20% seropositivity in humans [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Given that occurrence of RVF epidemics seems to require low herd immunity, this level of immunity may have also have reduced the risk of RVF outbreak in the country.</p><p>This RVF enhanced surveillance pilot demonstrated the capacity and need for establishing a national syndromic surveillance system in livestock in Kenya. Such a system would need to be synergistic with other surveillance systems in the country so as not to overburden data providers. The fact that both the KDVS and Kenya Wildlife Services do not have established national disease surveillance systems is an advantage as it enables the designing of a system that works in both livestock and wildlife. Similarly, guidelines would need to be established between the responsible animal and public health government agencies so as to ensure the infrastructure is in place to handle the additional information, and to determine appropriate responses to potential disease events that are effective and do not overwhelm their resources [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. An ideal surveillance system should also implement data collection standards and be expanded to include a comprehensive set of clearly defined disease syndromes so as to have the capability to detect transboundary, emerging, and zoonotic disease events. Finally, the system should allow regular and near real-time feedback of the collected data to surveillance officers so as to enhance situational awareness and support the sustainability of the overall system. By leveraging current technologies such as mobile phones that are gaining usage globally for syndromic surveillance, most of the aforementioned successes can be enhanced, and the limitations from this RVF enhanced surveillance can be addressed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This surveillance demonstrated the need to establish a national syndromic surveillance system in livestock and wildlife in Kenya. Further, the interaction between humans, animals, and the environment reinforces the concept of syndromic surveillance within the One Health concept [<xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The RVF enhanced surveillance served as an important first step toward designing and implementing an animal syndromic surveillance system in Kenya.</p><p>As follow-up to these efforts, the United States&#x02019; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently funding work to develop and deploy syndromic surveillance system in domestic animals and wild animals in Kenya, using a mobile and data integrations/analysis technologies customized for the country, referred to as the Kenya Animal Biosurveillance System (KABS). The KABS is capable of integrated analysis of animal and public health data using algorithms defined by veterinary officers within the Kenya government. The KABS technology will allow data providers and government animal health officials to quickly detect and report the animal health status in domestic animals and wildlife populations across different geographical areas and provide early warning information from validated sources signaling activity to assist in decision-making and response during a disease event. Furthermore, KABS will be the first instance of implementing routine surveillance in Kenya wildlife populations. Once fully developed, KABS will be a low cost, easy to implement surveillance technology solution that can be customized and adapted to other country&#x02019;s needs and requirements for supporting human and animal health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the Kenya Directorate of Veterinary Services for hosting and managing RVF Alert Center and for coordinating the outbreak response system.
