<p>Globally, livestock RVF epidemics have been most frequently reported in Eastern Africa, occurring every 4 to 10 years and closely linked with periods of heavy rainfall that occur during the warm phase of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation phenomenon [

In mid-2015, the United States’ Pandemic Prediction and Forecasting Science and Technical Working Group of the National Science and technology Council, Food and Agriculture Organization Emergency Prevention Systems, and Kenya Meteorological Department all issued alerts predicting a high possibility of El-Niño rainfall and RVF outbreaks in Eastern Africa [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In response to the alert, the Kenya Directorate of Veterinary Services (KDVS) in the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries pilot tested an enhanced surveillance system between November 2015 and February 2016 in 22 RVF high-risk counties [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In Kenya, as in many resources-limited countries, the routine livestock surveillance is passive where public and private animal health officers must wait for farmers to report animal illness before responding. The aim of the enhanced surveillance reported here was to collect near real-time data on syndromes and risk factors associated with RVF to enhance early detection of the disease in livestock before spill over to humans. We describe how the surveillance was conducted, results of the surveillance, and recommend next steps towards establishing a national syndromic surveillance system in livestock and wildlife populations in Kenya.
