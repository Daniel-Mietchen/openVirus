 <xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Epidemics of RVF are a major global health security threat due to the high morbidity and mortality in humans, and the economic impact associated with loss of livestock and ban in international trade. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) identifies RVF as an important transboundary and notifiable disease because of its potential for rapidly spreading across international borders, resulting in devastating economic effects through losses in the international trade of animals and animal products [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006353.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. RVF epidemics are characterized by massive livestock abortions and death, resulting in high economic losses associated with animal quarantines and trade restrictions [
