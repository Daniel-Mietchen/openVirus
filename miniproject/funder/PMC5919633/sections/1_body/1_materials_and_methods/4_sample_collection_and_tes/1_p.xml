<p>During the follow-up investigation, the SCVO collected blood samples from suspected or probable herds and shipped them to the Central Veterinary Laboratories (CVL) at Kabete, Nairobi for testing. The presence of anti-RVF immunoglobulin (IgG) and IgM antibodies in sera was determined using the IDVet enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions (IDVet Innovative Diagnostic, Grabels, France). For detection of anti-RVF IgG antibodies, ELISA plates were coated with RVF virus recombinant nucleoprotein overnight before washing and adding 50ul of the test serum at 1:10 dilution. A positive and negative control sera were provided in the kit. The plates were incubated for one hour at 37°C, washed, and anti-RVF nucleoprotein peroxidase conjugate added. Following 30 mins incubation, the plates were washed and presence of anti-RVF IgG detected using odometer. For detection of anti-RVF IgM antibodies, anti-bovine, ovine, or caprine (for cattle, sheep and goat sera) IgM polyclonal antibodies were used to coat ELISA plates overnight, washed and test serum added at 1:10 dilution. Plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37°C, washed, and RVF nucleoprotein added and results recorded.</p>
