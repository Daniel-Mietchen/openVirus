<p>All data were exported as a Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA) file for data cleaning which was imported into STATA version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) where data variables were summarized to check for outliers. Suspected and probable RVF herd reports were flagged from these data, and descriptive analyses were performed to generate weekly plots of the RVF cases, and compared with the reported weather conditions and actual rainfall data. Correlations and associations between data variables were assessed by the value of Pearson’s correlation coefficient and Pearson’s Chi-Squared test of significance. The descriptive and statistical analyses were performed in both STATA and Tableau Desktop 10.0 (Tableau Software, Seattle, WA, USA) and geographic visualization performed in ArcMap 10.3.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).</p>
