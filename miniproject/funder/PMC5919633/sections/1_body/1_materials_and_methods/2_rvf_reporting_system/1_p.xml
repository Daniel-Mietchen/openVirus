<p>The surveillance system consisted of an RVF Alert Center at the KDVS headquarters to receive, compile and report the surveillance data from the ub-county veterinary officers (SCVOs) who carried out the surveillance at sub-county level, and the livestock farmers who provided the information to the SCVO (

The SCVO in each sub-county was responsible for reporting cases of suspected RVF in livestock from the selected farms in their area, using a data collection tool developed for RVF reporting. Each SCVO identified 20 livestock owning farmers evenly spread across the sub-county, and whom they interviewed weekly by telephone to determine whether there were suspected RVF cases in cattle, sheep, goats, camels on their farms or neighboring farms, and any suspect RVF human cases. Weekly, the SCVO collected animal demographic data (farm location, animal numbers and species), RVF risk factors (livestock production system, vaccination status, weather, and vector information), and RVF associated syndromes (abortion, hemorrhagic disease, mortalities and human illness). The SCVOs sent reports every Friday to the RVF Alert Centre via email (

Located at Veterinary Epidemiology and Economics Unit (VEEU) at the KDVS headquarters, the RVF Alert Centre was managed by two veterinary epidemiologists each reachable round the clock through a toll-free numbers.
