The data used were combined microwave-IR-gauge estimates generated from Version 7 Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis algorithm. Rainfall data for November 2015 to February 2016 (files 3B43.20151001.7.nc– 3B43.20160201.7.nc) with a resolution of 0.25° were downloaded and exported into R statistical software [
