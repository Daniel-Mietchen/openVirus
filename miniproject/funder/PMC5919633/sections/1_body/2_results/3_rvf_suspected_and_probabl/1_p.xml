<p>A total of 69 (19.1%) suspected RVF cases (abortion in flooded area) from 45 farmers in 10 counties were identified. Of these 24 (6.6%) cases from 18 farmers in 7 counties met the definition for a probable RVF herd.

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006353.g007">Fig 7</xref> plots the suspect RVF herds and actual rainfall over study period. The majority (45 of 69) of suspect RVF herds were reported in November and December 2015, whereas three probable RVF herds were reported in both January and February 2016. Although the mean monthly actual rainfall was lower than the amount typically observed each year during the same months and counties during this period, more rain occurred during November and December and this was highly associated with increased reporting of suspect RVF herds (Pearson’s Chi-Squared,
