<p>To evaluate the relationship between the reported syndromes and rainfall, we correlated the time-series plot of weekly reports of syndromes with reports of flooding and mosquito swarms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006353.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Across syndromes, 211 out of 362 (58.3%) were reported when no flooding was observed. In contrast, more syndromes (69.3%) were reported when mosquito swarms were observed. The reporting across all syndromes with observations of flooding and mosquito swarms were similar with high correlation (Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient, r&gt; 0.87 and p&lt;0.001). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006353.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the correlation between these variables).
