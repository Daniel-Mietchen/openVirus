<p>This RVF enhanced surveillance pilot demonstrated the capacity and need for establishing a national syndromic surveillance system in livestock in Kenya. Such a system would need to be synergistic with other surveillance systems in the country so as not to overburden data providers. The fact that both the KDVS and Kenya Wildlife Services do not have established national disease surveillance systems is an advantage as it enables the designing of a system that works in both livestock and wildlife. Similarly, guidelines would need to be established between the responsible animal and public health government agencies so as to ensure the infrastructure is in place to handle the additional information, and to determine appropriate responses to potential disease events that are effective and do not overwhelm their resources [

An ideal surveillance system should also implement data collection standards and be expanded to include a comprehensive set of clearly defined disease syndromes so as to have the capability to detect transboundary, emerging, and zoonotic disease events. Finally, the system should allow regular and near real-time feedback of the collected data to surveillance officers so as to enhance situational awareness and support the sustainability of the overall system. By leveraging current technologies such as mobile phones that are gaining usage globally for syndromic surveillance, most of the aforementioned successes can be enhanced, and the limitations from this RVF enhanced surveillance can be addressed.
