<p>CHIKV salivary glands titre was determined using a TCID50 assay, while CHIKV midgut viral load was determined by a one-step RT-qPCR assay targeting the non-structural protein 1 (
 <italic>nsP1</italic>) gene of CHIKV[
 <xref rid="pntd.0005496.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], using Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen, Germany) PCR machine. Briefly, total RNA was isolated from a mosquito’s midgut using the QIAamp Viral Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following manufacturer’s recommendation. Primers used were Chik nsP1F: 5’-TAGAGCAGGAAATTGATCCC-3’ and Chik nsP1R: 5’- CTTTAATCGCCTGGTGGTAT-3’. The PCR reactions were carried out using the Quantitech SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Germany) following manufacturer’s recommendation. Amplification of the target gene from each individual mosquito midgut was compared against a standard curve generated from 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA standard. Viral RNA copies below 10 were considered negative.
