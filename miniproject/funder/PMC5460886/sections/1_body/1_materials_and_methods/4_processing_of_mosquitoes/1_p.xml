 <xref rid="pntd.0005496.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, the midgut and both pairs of salivary glands were homogenized using three millimetre stainless grinding balls (Retsch, Germany) in a MM301 mixer mill (Retsch, Germany) set at a frequency of 12/sec for 1 min. The supernatant of the homogenates was used either for viral titration or real-time PCR assays.
