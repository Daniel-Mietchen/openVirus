<p>ZIKV midgut and salivary glands titres were determined using the tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay, an endpoint dilution technique, using Vero cells[
 <xref rid="pntd.0005496.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Briefly, 100 mL of 10-fold serial dilutions from each homogenate sample were titrated in 96-well microtitre plates and incubated with Vero cells (ATCC, USA) inside an incubator set at 37C and 5% CO2. At the end of a seven-day incubation period, the cells were examined microscopically for viral-induced cytopathic effect (CPE). A well was scored positive if any CPE was observed. All virus titres were expressed as Log
 <sub>10</sub>TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL.
