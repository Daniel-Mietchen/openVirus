<p>Two different strains of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were used in the experiments, a local field strain (WT) and a 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected strain (
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-Sg) that through a series of backcrosses was bred to contain &gt;98% WT genetic background. The local 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> strain used for the experiments, was established from larvae collected from residential premises across the island during routine inspections by enforcement officers of the National Environment Agency, Singapore. Mosquitoes were allowed to emerge and were maintained under standard insectary conditions at 27± 1°C and 75–80% relative humidity (RH), with a photoperiod of 12h:12h light:dark (L:D) cycles. F
 <sub>0</sub> mosquitoes were allowed to mate randomly and were fed with commercially obtained swine’s blood using a Hemotek membrane feeding system (Discovery Workshops, UK). F
 <sub>1</sub> eggs were allowed to hatch in de-chlorinated water. Two hundred fifty larvae were reared in enamel pans measuring 25cm x 30cm x 9cm containing approximately 2 L of water and fed with Plecomin fish food (Tetra, Germany). Pupae were placed inside 30cm x 30cm x 30cm cages and allowed to emerge into adults. The F
 <sub>3</sub> generations were used in the feeding experiments.
