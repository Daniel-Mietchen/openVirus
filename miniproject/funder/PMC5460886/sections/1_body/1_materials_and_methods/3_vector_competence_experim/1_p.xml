<p>Fresh viruses, mixed with 100% swine-packed Red Blood Cells, were used to infect five to seven-day old female mosquitoes to compare the infection and dissemination rates of ZIKV and CHIKVs in wMel-Sg and WT mosquitoes. Final concentration of ZIKV in blood meal was 7.34 Log
 <sub>10</sub> tissue culture infectious dose
 <sub>50</sub> per mL (Log
 <sub>10</sub>TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL); and those of CHIKVs, EHI0067Y08, EHIKJ71albY08 and EHI66SGKalbY13 strains were 7.14, 6.67 and 6.81 Log
 <sub>10</sub>TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL, respectively. Adenosine Triphosphate (Fermentas, USA) at a final concentration of 3mM was added to the infectious blood meal as a phagostimulant. For each of the infectious blood meals, 120 females were placed in 0.5L ca. containers and were allowed to feed on swine’s blood mixed with fresh virus suspension. After thirty minutes of feeding, all mosquitoes were cold anesthetized on ice and 20 to 25 fully engorged females were transferred to a 300 ml ca. paper cups with nettings on top. The engorged females were maintained in an environmental chamber (Sanyo, Japan) set at cyclical temperatures between 29°C to 31°C and 70–80% RH with a photoperiod of 12hL:12hD cycles and were provided with 10% sugar solution. The conditions set in the environmental chamber simulates that of indoor conditions in Singapore which was determined by placing data loggers inside naturally ventilated living rooms of eight homes randomly distributed across the island (Appendix 1). To determine viral midgut infection and salivary gland dissemination rates, at least ten wMel-Sg and WT mosquitoes were sampled at days 6, 9 and 13 post-infectious (p.i.) blood meals. All experiments were carried out inside an arthropod containment level 2 facility.
