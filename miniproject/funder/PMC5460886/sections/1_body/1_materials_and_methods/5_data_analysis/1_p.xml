<p>The midgut infection and salivary gland dissemination rates at each time point were calculated by dividing the number of infected midguts and salivary glands, respectively, by the total number of midguts and salivary glands sampled. Differences in midgut and salivary gland infection rates were analysed using paired Fisherâ€™s exact tests. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests indicated that the data did not conform to conditions of normality, hence non-parametric analyses were performed. The differences in each of the viruses titre between WT and wMel-Sg mosquitoes were analysed using the Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic>-tests. All statistical tests were performed using the MedCalc for Windows (MedCalc software, Belgium).
