<p>The Ugandan MR766 ZIKV strain used in the study was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, USA). This virus was originally isolated in 1947, from the blood of a sentinel rhesus monkey. The CHIKV strains used in this study were isolated in Singapore. All CHIKV strains belong to the ECSA genotype. The EHI0067Y08 (GenBank: EU441882) strain was isolated from a patient during the first outbreak of chikungunya in Singapore in January â€“ February 2008 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005496.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and 2013 (GenBank: KX925219), respectively. EHI0067Y08 did not possess the alanine to valine mutation at amino acid position 226 of the membrane fusion glycoprotein E1 gene, but was present in both EHIKJ71albY08 and EHI66SGKalbY13. All viruses used in the oral infection of mosquitoes have been passaged three times in Vero cells (ATCC, USA) prior to the infectious feed.
