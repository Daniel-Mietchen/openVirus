<p>Control of these mosquito-transmitted diseases is difficult and hampered by lack of effective tools beyond classical insecticide-based mosquito control and environmental management. In recent years some novel approaches to vector control are being developed that show promise for disease control. One of these approaches is through the use of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-carrying mosquitoes. 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is a maternally-inherited endosymbiotic bacterium present in 70% of insect species and is known to affect various reproduction manipulations in its hosts[

 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-based strategies include population replacement strategy and the incompatible insect technique (IIT).
