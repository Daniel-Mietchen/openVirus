<p>Vector-borne diseases are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Factors such as rapid urbanization, migration, increase in international trade and travel, climate change and pathogens’ plasticity in adapting to new hosts and vectors have contributed to the spread of emerging and re-emerging mosquito-borne diseases worldwide. The propensity of mosquito-borne diseases to spread outside their geographic range and cause wide-scale epidemics has clearly been demonstrated by the recent zika outbreaks in French Polynesia and South America and the recent chikungunya outbreak in La Reunion Island. During the outbreak in La Reunion Island, 37% of the population was infected by chikungunya virus (CHIKV)[

During 2008–2009 period, two independent outbreaks occurred in the country, the first localized outbreak in January-February 2008 and an island wide outbreak that started in June 2008. Both outbreaks were caused by CHIKV strains of the East, Central and South African (ECSA) genotype [
