<p>In the second experiment, we determined the ability of the 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel strain to block the dissemination of three CHIKV strains in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>. Irrespective of the CHIKV strains used to orally infect both 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> strains, a significantly lower number of 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-Sg had infections in their midguts and salivary glands when compared to the WT mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005496.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The midguts and salivary glands of all WT mosquitoes tested were found to be infected with CHIKV, across all time-points, except for one sample at day 6 p.i. (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005496.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, no more than 60% of the 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-Sg sampled at different days p.i. have detectable CHIKV RNA in their midguts. Of these, only three of the 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-Sg has detectable CHIKV in their salivary glands, two (EHIKJ71albY08 and EHI66SGKalbY13) at day 6 p.i. and one (KJ71) at day 13 p.i. None of the 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-Sg sampled at day 9 p.i. had detectable infectious CHIKV in their salivary glands. In general, pairwise comparison (Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) showed a significantly fewer 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-Sg 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were infected CHIKV compared to WT mosquitoes, especially at day 9 and 13 pi.
