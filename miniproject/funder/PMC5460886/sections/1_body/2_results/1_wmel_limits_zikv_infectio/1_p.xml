<p>In the first experiment, pairwise comparison of midgut infection and salivary gland dissemination rates showed that 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-Sg had significantly lower ZIKV infection rate when compared to WT mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005496.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All WT 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were found to have ZIKV in their midguts and salivary glands, across all sampling days, while fewer 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-Sg exhibited ZIKV infections in their midguts (71% (n = 14), 53% (n = 15) and 40% (n = 14) at days 6, 9, and 13 p.i., respectively) and nearly all of these mosquitoes had no detectable virus in their salivary glands (7.1% (n = 14), 6.7% (n = 15) and 14% (14) at days 6, 9 and 13 p.i., respectively). Pairwise comparison (Fisherâ€™s Exact Test, 
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) showed a significantly fewer 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-Sg 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were infected ZIKV compared to WT mosquitoes.
