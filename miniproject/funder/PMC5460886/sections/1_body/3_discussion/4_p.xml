<p>The results from this study have shown that 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel is able to block the dissemination of CHIKV and ZKV infection in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>â€™s salivary glands, the most important organ responsible for transmission. This indicates that establishment of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations should reduce transmission of dengue, chikungunya and zika viruses and presents a potential control measure in this setting. It has also been proposed that releasing males may be an alternative way of using 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> to suppress 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations. A potential concern of this method is that incomplete sexing may result in safety concerns due to the release of female mosquitoes that could potentially contribute to virus transmission. The results of this study show that any inadvertently released female mosquitoes should have reduced vector competence and mitigate this risk.
