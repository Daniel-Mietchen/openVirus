<p>Despite having a rigorous vector surveillance and control program in Singapore, large-scale dengue epidemics in 2005, 2007 and 2013â€“2014, and the chikungunya outbreaks in 2008 and 2013 attests to the vulnerability of the country to outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. These epidemics also highlight the limitations of the current vector control strategies and reveal the need for a more innovative approach, such as the use of Wolbachia in tackling the challenges of dengue prevention and control in Singapore[

 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> when introgressed onto a Singaporean 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> genetic background to interfere with arbovirus transmission. We have demonstrated that 
 <italic>w</italic>Mel-Sg have significantly reduced ZIKV and CHIKV midgut infection and dissemination rates when compared to WT mosquitoes (

 <italic>w</italic>Mel-Sg were compared, higher numbers of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-carrying mosquitoes were found to be infected with ZIKV. However, the number of
