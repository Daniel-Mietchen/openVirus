  <title>Background</title>
  <p>Zika (ZIKV) and Chikungunya (CHIKV) viruses are emerging Aedes-borne viruses that are spreading outside their known geographic range and causing wide-scale epidemics. It has been reported that these viruses can be transmitted efficiently by 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic>. Recent studies have shown that 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> when transinfected with certain 
   <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains shows a reduced replication and dissemination of dengue (DENV), Chikungunya (CHIKV), and Yellow Fever (YFV) viruses. The aim of this study was to determine whether the 
   <italic>w</italic>Mel strain of 
   <italic>Wolbachia</italic> introgressed onto a Singapore 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> genetic background was able to limit ZIKV and CHIKV infection in the mosquito.

  <title>Methodology/Principal findings</title>
  <p>Five to seven-day old mosquitoes either infected or uninfected with 
   <italic>w</italic>Mel Wolbachia were orally infected with a Ugandan strain of ZIKV and several outbreak strains of CHIKV. The midgut and salivary glands of each mosquito were sampled at days 6, 9 and 13 days post infectious blood meal to determine midgut infection and salivary glands dissemination rates, respectively. In general, all wild type 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> were found to have high ZIKV and CHIKV infections in their midguts and salivary glands, across all sampling days, compared to 
   <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infected counterparts. Median viral titre for all viruses in 
   <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infected mosquitoes were significantly lower across all time points when compared to wild type mosquitoes. Most significantly, all but two and one of the 
   <italic>w</italic>Mel infected mosquitoes had no detectable ZIKV and CHIKV, respectively, in their salivary glands at 14 days post-infectious blood meal.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>Our results showed that wMel limits both ZIKV and CHIKV infection when introgressed into a Singapore 
   <italic>Ae</italic>. 
   <italic>aegypti</italic> genetic background. These results also strongly suggest that female 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> carrying 
   <italic>Wolbachia</italic> will have a reduced capacity to transmit ZIKV and CHIKV.
