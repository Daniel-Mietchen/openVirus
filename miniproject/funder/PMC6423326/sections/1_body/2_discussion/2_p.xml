 </sup> consistently outperformed all others in terms of accuracy of identifying the sources of infection for each infected premises, model support for each inferred source, and timing of first exposure of each infected premises. SCOTTI performed the best for inference of genomic substitution rates. In inferring the transmission tree, Lau’s model incorporates inferences of the genomes present on infected premises in the transmission network at multiple points in time, a flexible spatial transmission kernel representing the proximity of infected premises, and epidemiological parameters including the latent and infectious periods (as sojourn times in the compartments of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered process). Genomes can be inferred with Lau’s model for known hosts that are unsampled, a common scenario in the highly resource-constrained environment of large infectious disease outbreak in a highly susceptible population. Lau’s model was understandably less accurate when run on outbreak simulations where genomic data was only available for 50% of observed infected premises. Nevertheless, Lau’s model was 60% accurate for the 356 of 764 (46%) inferred sources that attained consensus support. In comparison, Phybreak had higher accuracy (72%) when considering only those sources with consensus support. A limitation of Phybreak’s inference is that only 50 of 764 (6.5%) inferred sources considered attained consensus support. The three other models that also make transmission network inferences where there are unsampled cases (SCOTTI, Outbreaker and Outbreaker2) were all a lot less accurate.
