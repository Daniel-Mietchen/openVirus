<p id="Par18">Each method provided imperfect inference of the transmission network. Therefore, when implemented on the same benchmark outbreak, each model produced markedly different inferences of the transmission network. On the surface, such differences hinder interpretation and application in decision-making. However, when model support for each proposed ancestor was considered each model demonstrated improving accuracy as support increased, with considerably different patterns in this correlation. This makes sense considering that the models gain support for their proposed sources based on different likelihood estimation algorithms. In practice, where the models agree on a proposed source and that it has a high level of model support, then confidence can be increased that this is the source of infection for a given node in the transmission tree. Differences in model outputs may also be useful. An area for further research is in the application of Ensemble methods, such as weighted Bayesian model-averaging, given these have often been shown to perform better than any single model
