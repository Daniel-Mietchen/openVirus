<p id="Par20">It is not possible for transmission network models to capture all of the inherent complexity of an outbreak such as a foot-and-mouth disease incursion into a previously na√Øve animal population. Many unobserved biological processes operate at the farm level, the individual animal level and within the individual host, including complex evolutionary processes such as transmission bottlenecks, recombination of genomic material, and reassortment (in the case of influenza viruses). None of the models presented here can explicitly represent all the organisational hierarchies and complexities present in real biological systems (i.e., multiple viral pseudo-species evolving in multiple animals per farm across a landscape). Understandably, capturing all such detail is unlikely to be necessary, especially in the two main settings where such tools are intended to be used to inform decision-support: in real-time early in unfolding outbreaks and retrospectively to provide comprehensive assessments of what transpired to inform preparedness for future events.</p>
