 </sup>, although that comparison study had different objectives. The coalescent model represented the underlying within-host genomic diversity as a constant effective population size. This could favour the performance of models that happen to have a similar underlying nucleotide substitution models such as the Lau model, Outbreaker and Outbreaker2 over those that implement more complex genomic inferences (such as SCOTTI, Phybreak, TransPhylo, BeastLier and Sampled Ancestors). Resource constraints limited the range of scenarios that could be tested. In a sensitivity analysis designed to test the influence of two aspects of the underlying simulations, predictive accuracy of the Lau model appeared robust to substantial changes in spatial signal underlying transmission and on clock rate. Predictive accuracy of the modified Cottam method appeared to depend on spatial parameterisation and clock rate, SCOTTI’s accuracy depended on clock rate, as did the level of model support outputted by Outbreaker and Outbreaker2. It is therefore not advised to generalise the findings of the present analysis with respect to these models too widely without further testing. Past comparisons have largely relied on data simulated in similar frameworks to the models under investigation or been conducted on real data from outbreaks where it is impossible to truly know the transmission network and therefore not possible to objectively compare model performance. This analysis has advanced as far as practical the level of formal comparison of transmission network models by simulating outbreak data in a framework completely different to the Bayesian inferential frameworks evaluated.
