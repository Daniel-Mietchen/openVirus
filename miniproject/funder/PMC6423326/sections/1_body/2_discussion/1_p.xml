<p id="Par15">This analysis presents the first structured comparison of available transmission network modelling methods that attempt to infer ‘who infected whom’ in outbreaks. The strengths and limitations of nine publicly available models were identified based on inferences of a set of six independent simulations of a hypothetical foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Australia. Each model has various strengths and weaknesses, and each provides different outputs tailored to the purpose for which it was developed. Many of the differences observed in model performance may be explained by the amount of epidemiological data used and the entirely different approach each takes to infer the transmission network, including in each case highly sophisticated specifications of likelihood or pseudo-likelihood functions based on assumptions of the systems under inference.</p>
