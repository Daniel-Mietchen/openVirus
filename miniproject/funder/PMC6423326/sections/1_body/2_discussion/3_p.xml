<p id="Par17">Cottam’s original frequentist approach outperformed many of the more sophisticated Bayesian models, especially once modified to incorporate spatial relationships between infected premises and available contact-tracing data. The original formulation was able to accurately estimate a lot of the major structure of the transmission network and provides useful visualisation of the temporal epidemiological aspect of the outbreak under investigation. Lower accuracy of inference for sources of infected premises with lower likelihood was partly overcome by incorporating spatial relationships and available contract-tracing data. In outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic, infectious animal diseases in previously free countries, considerable resources are invested in accurately collecting such data within timeframes that can inform further field investigations and response activities. Such data are often imperfect, as represented in the present analysis by ‘true’ and ‘false traces’ that were considered in terms of likelihood based on other available epidemiological data, particularly estimated timing of onset of clinical signs and infectious period on the farms sending and receiving potentially infected animals. The method required extensive coding in R to automate the process of transcribing and capturing the considerable inherent ambiguities in the genomic parsimony tree exported from the TCS program

The Lau model is presently coded in C++ and although relatively straightforward to compile and run it could be made more accessible by recoding it for use as an R package.
