 </sup>. Bayesian transmission network models are the only tool presently capable of identifying the pathways of infectious disease transmission to a level of resolution required to pin-point sources. A variety of methods are available, many claiming to be a theoretical improvement on others available depending on context. A paucity of transparent multi-model comparisons unfortunately leaves it unclear how accurate they are in practice, thus reducing confidence in their interpretation and restricting their potential application in decision-support during future outbreaks. The aim of this study was to undertake a structured comparison of the performance of published transmission network models based on a set of simulated foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks so as to provide clear guidance on the application of such models to future outbreaks.
