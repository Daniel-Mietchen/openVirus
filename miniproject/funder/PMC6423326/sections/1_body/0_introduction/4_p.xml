<p id="Par5">Traditional epidemiological approaches to identifying transmission networks (contact-tracing, interviewing, laboratory sampling, typing and phylogeny of isolates), may reveal sources, points of control and provide insights into the future scale and course of an outbreak. However, obtaining detailed and accurate contact-tracing and surveillance data is not a trivial exercise early in a large outbreak. Delays in accessing data from the field and the quality of the data impact on the ability to develop meaningful predictions of disease transmission. Field investigations are resource intensive and involve a high degree of uncertainty in sources of infection and timings of unobserved events

 </sup>. The genomics revolution has provided new tools and opportunities for tackling infectious diseases. The application of whole genome sequencing has streamlined pathogen identification in disease emergences

 </sup>. Highly discriminatory laboratory techniques are now available for characterising the relationship between samples collected during an outbreak within appropriate timeframes and costs. Next-generation sequencing has advanced the identification of traceable differences in pathogen genomes and thereby the resolution of our understanding of disease transmission, in some cases down to the host-to-host scale

 </sup>. This technology is now available for real-time application during outbreak responses. In this setting it is essential that epidemiological tools to guide infectious disease outbreak response are adapted to keep pace with the advances in genomics and rapid pathogen identification.
