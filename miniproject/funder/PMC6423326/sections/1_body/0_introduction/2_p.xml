<p id="Par3">Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious, acute, vesicular disease of cloven-hoofed animals (including cattle, pigs, sheep, goats and buffalo)

 </sup>. FMD, caused by an RNA virus of the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, is endemic in large areas of Africa, Asia and South America, and periodically causes outbreaks in previously free countries and regions. FMD is extremely resource-intensive to control due to its wide host range, contagiousness, multiple modes of transmission (direct contact, airborne and via fomites), diminished clinical signs in some species dependent on serotype (sheep and goats), and the potential for long-term carrier status in ruminants. Outbreaks in previously free countries cause severe and widespread socio-economic impacts related to the closure of international markets in livestock and animal produce on top of the direct and indirect impacts of disease control measures

 </sup>. FMD-free countries therefore have stringent biosecurity measures in place to prevent incursions and investigate outbreaks very thoroughly.
