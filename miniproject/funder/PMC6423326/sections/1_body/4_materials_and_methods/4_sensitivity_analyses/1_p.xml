<p id="Par30">To test for the influence of key underlying simulation modelling assumptions on the accuracy comparison, and general applicability of this analysis, one of the moderately sized simulated outbreaks (run 3 with n = 98 IPs) was reparametrized in two ways. Firstly, a ‘non-spatial’ run was generated by randomising the spatial coordinates of each infected premises, thus eliminating the spatial signal in transmission. Then, separately, a ‘fast clock’ run was generated by increasing the rates of transitions and transversions by a factor of 10, leaving the generation time unchanged. All inferences were repeated on these two modified datasets and model outputs again compared.</p>
