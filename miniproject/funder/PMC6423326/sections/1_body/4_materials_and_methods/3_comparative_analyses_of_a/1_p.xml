<p id="Par28">To compare the ‘accuracy’ of each benchmarked method, we estimated the proportion of IPs whose true source was correctly identified across all six model runs. For methods that provided estimates of the support (confidence or posterior probability) in the proposed source, this was based on the potential source with the highest level of support, and we separately calculated the accuracy of the most likely tree for each method considering only those sources with consensus and &gt;0.80 support. For methods that estimated other parameters, such as mutation rates and timing of infection, estimates and coverage were compared to the true values.</p>
