 </sup>. However, not all such premises would be expected to be sampled. For all methods that could handle missing sequence data from observed cases, the analysis was repeated assuming that a more realistic subset of only 50% of the IPs had whole genome sequences available. This sampling density reflects expected practice in future outbreaks considering that 104 sequences were available from 292 infected premises in the 2010 FMD disease outbreak in Miyazaki, Japan
