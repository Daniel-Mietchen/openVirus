<p id="Par13">Of the Bayesian models that outputted inferred timing of exposure for each individual premises, Lau’s model provided the least biased inference of timing of exposure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) with overall coverage of 70% and median bias of +1 days (95% HPD: −8, +5 days); see Supplementary Materials S3 for detail on coverage and bias by model run. Klinkenberg’s Phybreak model had a higher overall coverage at 80% and highly comparable mean bias of +1 days (95% HPD −10, +16 days), however it had less certainty in the inference with inferred timings of infection later than actual dates at the start and end of the simulated epidemics (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Outbreaker2 provided a relatively unbiased inference of timing of exposure over the whole set of infected premises with high overall coverage of 87%, however this was confounded by the large uncertainty in the inferred timings of infection (median bias −2 days; 95% HPD: −22, +1 days) and the inferred timings appeared mostly earlier than the simulated values on visual inspection. Beastlier had an overall coverage of only 24 and tended to provide marginally later inferences than the true values early in the simulated outbreaks, rapidly improving as the outbreaks progressed (LOWESS estimator in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> departing above the reference line). Inference of timing of exposure by Jombart’s Outbreaker was consistently biased (overall median 11 days later than the true value; 95% HPD: −2, +29 days), irrespective of model run or time elapsed in the outbreak. Didelot 
 <italic>et al</italic>.’s TransPhylo model was largely inaccurate in the inference of timing of infection with coverage of only 17%.
