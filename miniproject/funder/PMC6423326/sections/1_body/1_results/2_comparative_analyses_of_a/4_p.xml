<p id="Par11">Under the more realistic scenario of genomic data only being available for 50% of observed infected premises, Lau’s model was again the most accurate of those analysed (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Supplementary Materials, S3). For those sources identified with high levels of model confidence, the Lau model’s inferences of the network of transmission remained very accurate (73% accuracy amongst those with &gt;0.80 model support), however the numbers of such sources attaining model confidence decreased from 58% to 20%. Accuracy was 60% for the 47% of sources with consensus support. Phybreak was again highly accurate in inferring sources, however only for the relatively small number of infected premises for which sources were identified with consensus support (only 50 of 764 inferred sources had consensus support).
