<p id="Par12">Of the seven studied models that infer mutation rates for the transmitted virus, SCOTTI consistently provided the most accurate inference of the simulated molecular clock rate (

 <sup>−1</sup> (mean bias + 15%; 95% highest posterior density [HPD] −5%, +39%), see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Lau’s model consistently provided inferences of the clock rate close to and around the true value (mean bias −1%; 95% HPD: −12%, +12%). The Sampled Ancestors, Phybreak and BeastLier models all marginally overestimated the mutation rates (mean biases of +64%, +64% and +235%, respectively), whereas the Outbreaker and Outbreaker2 models markedly overestimated the mutation rate by means of 24-fold (95% HPD: 20.7, 17.1-fold) and 7-fold (95% HPD: 6.1, 8.5), respectively, across the 6 model runs. SCOTTI, Lau’s model and BeastLier all provided accurate and precise inference of the transition to transversion ratio (
 <italic>κ</italic>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Sampled Ancestors’s inference of 
 <italic>κ</italic> was close to the true value of 15.22, however there was considerable uncertainty in the inference. Outbreaker underestimated κ by 55% (95% HPD: 35, 67%), largely due to underestimation of the rate of transitions (
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>). The Phybreak model assumes the Jukes-Cantor nucelotide substitution model under which only a single mutation rate is inferred, so the ratio of the rate of transitions (
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>1</sub>) to the rate of transversions (
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>2</sub>) is not a model output. The present implementation of Outbreaker2 only infers a single mutation rate (
