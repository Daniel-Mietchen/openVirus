 </sup> to incorporate spatial and contact-tracing data. Key attributes of these models are summarised in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Most of the modelling methods selected for comparison account for delays in sampling and tree uncertainty, make use of phylogenies, allow for unobserved hosts, and infer mutation rates and infection times for those sampled. Five of the models (‘Outbreaker’, ‘Outbreaker2’, Lau’s model, the Structured COalescent Transmission Tree Inference, ‘SCOTTI’ and ‘Phybreak’) can handle observed cases (infected premises) that have missing genomic data, a very common situation in large-scale foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks where field investigation and laboratory resources are typically severely constrained. Only four of the previously published models incorporate within-host dynamics, only two allow for multiple samples per case and only Outbreaker2 utilises contact-tracing data. The models differ in underlying likelihood estimation and the outputs returned and were only broadly comparable in terms of their accuracy of inferences of the transmission network, mutation rates and timing of first exposure. Most of the models selected for this comparison have been previously applied to infer transmission networks for foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks, with the exceptions being: ‘Sampled Ancestors’ implemented on data from a UK cluster of HIV-1 human patients, ‘BeastLier’ demonstrated through inference of a H7N7 avian influenza outbreak in the Netherlands and ‘TransPhylo’ applied on an outbreak of tuberculosis in Germany.
