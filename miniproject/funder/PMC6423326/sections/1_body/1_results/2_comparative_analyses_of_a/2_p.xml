<p id="Par9">The ten modelling methods differed markedly in their ability to accurately infer the underlying transmission network (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). When genomic data was assumed to be available for all known infected premises Lau’s systematic Bayesian integration framework performed best with 73% of source farms correctly identified. This increased to 82% accuracy for the 83% of infected premises for which there was consensus support for a single proposed source, and increased again to 91% for the 60% of infected premises for which model confidence in their source was &gt;0.8. The accuracy of Lau’s model was consistent across runs comprised of different numbers of infected premises (see Supplementary Materials, S3). An example of the accuracy of the inference of this model compared to the known (simulated) underlying transmission network is presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The ‘Phybreak’ model

 </sup> had comparable accuracy to Lau’s model for sources with high levels of model confidence, however, only 16% of infected premises had single sources with model support &gt;0.80 from Phybreak. De Maio’s SCOTTI and the modification to Cottam’s frequentist approach were also highly accurate at inferring sources when model support was &gt;0.80. Lau’s model identified &gt;2.8 times as many sources with such high levels of support (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), so overall it was the most accurate method of the ten models that were tested.
