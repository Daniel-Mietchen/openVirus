<p id="Par10">Highly informative outputs from Cottam’s approach are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, demonstrating the estimated timing of exposure and infectious periods for infected premises, and the estimated likelihood of each possible infection source for each infected premises. Modifying Cottam’s approach to incorporate typically available spatial and contact-tracing data improved accuracy of source identification for infected premises where model confidence in the source was &lt;80%, leading to accuracy that was overall similar to that of Phybreak and SCOTTI, and outperformed many of the highly complex Bayesian models for infected premises with lower levels of model confidence in their proposed source.
