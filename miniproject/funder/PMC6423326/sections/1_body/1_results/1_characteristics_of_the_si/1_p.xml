 </sup>. The median number of infected premises (IPs) per simulation run was 92 (range: 24, 853) and the median outbreak duration was 83 days (range: 49, 323). From these model runs, six were selected for further analyses (with n = 42, 70, 98, 100, 156 and 298 IPs, respectively, referred to hereafter as runs 1 to 6). These outbreak datasets, including their genomic data and tables summarising the epidemiological variables that were available for analysis, are provided as Supplementary Materials (S1). Cattle farms were the most frequently affected with large numbers of sheep infected on smaller numbers of properties. Local spread was the predominant mode of transmission, direct animal contacts and movements through saleyards were important for disseminating infection across large areas (two to three Australian States) with infrequent airborne spread over distances &gt;3 km.
