<p id="Par14">In a ‘non-spatial’ comparison run (with the spatial coordinates of each infected premises randomised) accuracy of prediction of sources decreased for the modified Cottam approach and BeastLier, whereas the Lau model’s predictive accuracy was robust to the lack of a spatial signal in transmission. As expected, predictive accuracy for the seven models that do not include a spatial aspect in their inference were highly comparable to baseline in the ‘non-spatial’ comparison run (see Supplementary Materials, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3.3</xref>). In a ‘fast clock’ comparison run (with a 10-fold increased rate of nucleotide substitutions), the modified Cottam approach demonstrated improved predictive accuracy for sources with lower than consensus model support. The predictive accuracy of SCOTTI was markedly reduced in the ‘fast clock’ scenario. Predictive accuracy of sources proposed by the Lau model were robust to the fast clock scenario, as were those of BeastLier, Phybreak, TransPhylo. Model support was higher for sources proposed by Outbreaker and Outbreaker2 under the ‘fast-clock’ scenario whilst predictive accuracy remained highly comparable to baseline.
