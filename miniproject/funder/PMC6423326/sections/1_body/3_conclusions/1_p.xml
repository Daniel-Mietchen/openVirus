<p id="Par22">The findings of this comparison study point to which models might reliably reconstruct future outbreaks and how to interpret the outputs to inform control. Each model assessed had its own strengths related to the purpose for which it was developed, and limitations related to its assumptions. These should be kept in mind when choosing a method, or methods, to implement based on a given context. The model developed by Lau and colleagues was consistently the most accurate in inference of the transmission tree. The Structured Coalescent Transmission Tree Inference (SCOTTI) provided a highly accurate inference of the molecular clock rates. Further research could involve extending the best-performing of these models to incorporate additional animal and farm-level covariates, represent within-host diversity so they can make most use of next-generation sequencing data, and to develop combined predictions using Ensemble methods and other approaches.</p>
