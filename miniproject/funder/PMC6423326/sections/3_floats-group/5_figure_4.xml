 <caption>
  <p>Comparison of the accuracy of inferences of mutation rates for six simulated outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Australia, by transmission network model. The red reference lines represent the true (simulated) value of each parameter. The Phybreak model assumes a Jukes-Cantor nucleotide substitution model under which the ratio of transitions to transversions (TrTv) is not inferred. Outbreaker2 also does not output TrTv. SampAnc = Sampled Ancestors model; SCOTTI = Structured COalescent Transmission Tree Inference.</p>
