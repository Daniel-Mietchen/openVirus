  <p>Comparison of the accuracy of inferences of transmission network models for simulated outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in Australia. Summarised over six simulation runs, with box-and-whiskers plots representing distribution of model support for the proposed ancestors; distribution numbers present the proportion of proposed ancestors with &gt;50% (i.e., consensus) and &gt;80% model support, respectively. SCOTTI = Structured COalescent Transmission Tree Inference.</p>
