  <p>Comparison of the accuracy of inferences of timing of exposure for infected premises in six simulated outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Australia, by transmission network model. Departures above the black reference line are premises with inferred day of exposure later than their true (simulated) day of exposure. LOESS smoothed line in blue with standard error of prediction.</p>
