  <p>Estimated transmission windows and likelihood matrix of who infected whom based on Cottamâ€™s frequentist approach for a simulated outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Australia. Black lines in temporal risk windows represent most likely period of the earliest infection of an animal on each infected premises (IP), grey lines represent estimated duration of infectiousness at the premises level, tapering as culling commences. During the most likely period when IP2 was infected, only IPs 1 to 11 were possibly infectious. Based on the likelihood transmission matrix IP2 was most likely to have been infected by IP1, and IP2 was more likely to have been infected by IP1 than vice versa. During the period when IP16 was most likely infected there were many potential sources. These likelihoods are used to rank ambiguities in the genomic parsimony network
