<p>There were some limitations to the study. First, many more important influential factors should be further explored and included in the GWR models to interpret much more spatial variation in the DF epidemic, since less than 60% was explained at present. In particular, an appropriate variable should be acquired to comprehensively reflect both public transportation and population density so as to further interpret the remained (40% or so) spatial variation in the current study. For this point, data derived from mobile devices, metro cards and/or bus cards could be used to capture information about mode of travel and the movement of local residents, both for confirmed and suspected DF cases. This is particularly relevant to the UVs, as the effects of the public transportation system and UVs on DF transmission could be further investigated and high intercept values (

Second, reliable monitoring data on the vectorsâ€™ population or density in the study area should be continuously collected and then used fully for a further comprehensive analysis of the link between DF epidemic and all the influencing factors in the future. Finally, the time series of the DF case data and the spatiotemporally matched remote sensing images should be longer. This would enable better validation of the typical influence of UVs, as DF epidemics have periodically occurred in the central region of Guangzhou City, with rapid land urbanization, since the 2000s.
