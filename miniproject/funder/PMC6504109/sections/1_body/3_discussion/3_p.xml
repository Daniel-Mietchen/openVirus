<p>A convenient public traffic system meets the commuting demands of local residents, including the floating population who reside in UVs but work outside of them. Earlier studies reported that traffic conditions impose important effects on DF transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], similar to our findings that public transportation (the presence of bus stops in particular) was not only directly associated with the DF incidence rates on the grid scale, but also influenced the aggregation effect of UVs on the DF epidemic, especially in zones with numerous UVs. We cautiously speculate that DF cases in infected UVs or units (grids) may have been potential infection sources when they entered other zones via the public traffic system. In other words, these UVs or units/grids with infections presence likely acted as transfer stations (receiving and/or exporting DF cases) during DF transmission. In a sense, it can be supposed to some degree that the infected cases/patients would also act as the diseaseâ€™s vector, since local residents are the other crucial element in the DF transmission and the flying distance of mosquitoes (

Accordingly, we recommend that targeted and effective interventions should be implemented in zones with numerous UVs and public traffic stations across the central region in Guangzhou City during the DF epidemic.
