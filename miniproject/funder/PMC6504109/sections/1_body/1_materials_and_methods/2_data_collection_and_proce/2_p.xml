<p>With consideration of the high degree of urbanization of the study area, land use types for 2012 and 2017 was divided into five categories: normal construction land (NCL), UV, water, vegetation and unused land. NCL and UVs are collectively referred to herein as construction land (CL) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007350.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). A total of 206 sample points were randomly selected to verify the classification results for 2012 and 2017. The overall accuracy and the Kappa coefficients for 2012 and 2017 were 82.67%, 0.802 and 87.40%, 0.851, respectively. As far as the producer’s and user’s accuracy were concerned, the UVs in 2017 possessed slightly lower accuracies (87.8% and 87.8%) than those of water (88.2% and 93.8%), and roads (90.0% and 87.1%), although the omission and commission of UVs had been appropriately controlled by the texture selection procedure. In a word, the present extraction accuracy can meet the requirements for further analysis. Detailed information about the retrieval of land-use types can be found in an earlier study [
