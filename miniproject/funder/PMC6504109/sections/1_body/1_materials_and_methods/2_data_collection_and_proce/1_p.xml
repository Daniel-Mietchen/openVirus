<p>DF is a notifiable disease in China which means that, once diagnosed, cases must be reported to the web-based National Notifiable Disease Reporting Information System (NIDRIS) within 24 h [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The DF case information includes age, sex, address, and time of onset. The DF epidemic data for this study were obtained from the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and included DF case data from 2012–2014 and from 2017. The targeted DF cases in our study included clinically diagnosed (based on clinical manifestations and epidemiologic exposure history) or laboratory-confirmed cases (“clinically diagnosed cases presenting with any of the following lab test results relating to DF: a 4-fold increase in specific IgG antibody titer, positive on a PCR test or viral isolation and identification test”). The address information of the confirmed cases, after desensitization, was used in conjunction with geocoding (

In 2014, DF cases in the Guangzhou region reached a peak, with a total of 36 344 cases reported, of which 18 350 were from the central area, accounting for 50.49% of the entire Guangzhou city. Moreover, the ratio of the total DF cases in 2012–2017 to the population in 2015 was calculated so as to indicate the DF incidence rates during the study period on the 1 km × 1 km grid scale.
