<p>In addition, the choice of spatial scale is the basis of spatial analysis. In many studies of infectious disease epidemiology, basic geographic units such as districts or townships/streets are often disturbed by changing administrative divisions, and the creation of regular spatial grids can effectively avoid this phenomenon [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], a spatial gridded unit of 1 km Ã— 1 km was used as the spatial unit in this study, and we analyzed the spatial autocorrelation degree of the DF epidemic at this grid scale.
