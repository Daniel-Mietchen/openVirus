<p>Spatial autocorrelation analyses are frequently utilized to explore the spatial patterns of incidence or mortality in terms of Moran’s I with z-score and/or 
 <italic>p</italic>-value because of their high statistical power [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Moran’s I is produced by standardizing spatial autocovariance by the data variance using a measure of the connectivity of the data [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Generally, Moran’s I value ranges from −1 to 1 and a high positive Moran’s I value with larger z-score and/or appropriate 
 <italic>p</italic>-value represents a tendency towards clustering, which means that adjacent units have similar incidence rates, whereas a low negative value indicates a tendency towards dispersal, which means that units with high incidence rates lie next to units with low incidence rates.
