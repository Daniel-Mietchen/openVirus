<p>In addition, we created a series of buffering zones with increasing radii based on the boundaries of the UVs, in which the incidence rates, the proportion of the DF cases, as well as its growth rates, in different years in each buffering zone were counted. Meanwhile, Pearson correlation analysis was applied to explore the relationships between DF incidences and all of the potential variables (UVs, population density, GDP, bus stops, subway stations, and road density) at the significance level of 0.05 and 0.01, by which some appropriate potential variables could be accordingly considered into the GWR models.</p>
