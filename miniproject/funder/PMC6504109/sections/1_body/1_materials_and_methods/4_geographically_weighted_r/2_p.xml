<p>By means of the exploratory regression tool, twenty-five OLS and GWR models with higher Adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> and lower values of AICc, Sigma, and VIF were recommended. Integrating various combinations of influencing factors in the OLS/GWR models with the lowest AICc and Sigma, the highest adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup>, and lower VIF than 7.5, eleven univariate models and fourteen multivariate models were respectively conducted for the comparison between CL, UV/NCL, water, vegetation, public traffic, road density, population density and GDP grouped factors.
