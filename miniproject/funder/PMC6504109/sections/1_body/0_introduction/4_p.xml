<p>Moreover, different factors influencing the DF epidemic have a spatial scale effect. Most of the available research has been focused on analysis at a relatively large spatial scale, such as at regional and prefecture level [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], with a small number of studies gradually expanding to small scales, such as at county, township, and even community or regular grid scales [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, these small spatial scales are often the final nodes where prevention and control measures can produce practical effects, and more research into the factors influencing DF and its prevention is required at this scale.
