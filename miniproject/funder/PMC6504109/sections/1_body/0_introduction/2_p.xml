<p>Both domestic and foreign scholars have carried out a considerable amount of research into DF epidemics, including into factors affecting the spread and prevalence of the disease and the corresponding prevention and control measures [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These studies have shown that the population, transportation, and living environment have undergone tremendous changes due to rapid urbanization, which in turn has led to changing DF transmission characteristics. In addition to some important natural environmental factors (e.g., temperature, precipitation) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], social and economic factors, such as population distribution and density, land urbanization level, and road network density will have an important impact on the temporal and spatial patterns of DF epidemics [
