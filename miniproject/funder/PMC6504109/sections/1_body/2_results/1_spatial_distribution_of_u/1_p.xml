<p>Land-use types across the central region, including Liwan, Haizhu, Yuexiu, and Tianhe districts in Guangzhou City, typically featured impervious surfaces (i.e., NCL and UVs) according to their dominant area percentage (53.80% in 2012 and 58.12% in 2017) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007350.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Among these four central regions, in 2012, Haizhu District had the largest area of UV (10.91 km
 <sup>2</sup>) and Yuexiu, Liwan, and Tianhe districts had 7.98, 4.06, and 8.80 km
 <sup>2</sup> of UV. There were more than 450 UVs with areas varying from less than 0.001 km
 <sup>2</sup> to 0.87 km
 <sup>2</sup>. As a result of urban renewal, the total area of UV decreased from 31.75 km
 <sup>2</sup> (2012) to 31.38 km
 <sup>2</sup> (2017), with a clear reduction in Liwan (about 0.12 km
 <sup>2</sup> in Xinglongfang and Dongjiao communities) and Tianhe (0.25 km
 <sup>2</sup> or so near Pingyun Square, the Second Xintang communities, and Xinxu communities) in particular, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007350.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Since there were so fewer changes of UVs during 2012â€“2017, the data of land-use information in 2012 was chosen for subsequent analysis.
