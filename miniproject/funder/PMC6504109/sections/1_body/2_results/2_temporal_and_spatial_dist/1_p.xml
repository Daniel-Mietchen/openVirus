<p>There were a total of 20 059 local DF cases reported in the central districts, which accounted for half of the total cases in the whole Guangzhou City during the study period. Meanwhile, the distribution of DF was spatially different across this typical region. The ratio of DF cases in each infected unit to the mean value of all the infected units (RDM) varied spatially on the 1 km × 1 km scale (close to the largest UV area) in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2017. However, the units with high RDM were mainly located around the Pearl River fork between Yuexiu, Liwan, and Haizhu districts (
