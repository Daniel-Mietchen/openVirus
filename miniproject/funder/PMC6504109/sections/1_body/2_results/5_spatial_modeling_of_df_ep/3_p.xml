<p>In terms of the influence of the three variables (GDP, UVs, and bus stops) on the spatial variation of DF infection, these variables were spatially differentiated across the central region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007350.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The presence of bus stops was positively associated with the DF epidemics in most of the units, especially the Liwan district. The influences of GDP displayed spatial disparities. They were positive effect in most areas of Tianhe and Haizhu districts and negative effect in Liwan, Yuexiu, and near the Pearl River fork of Haizhu district. In comparison, UVs tended to have a greater association with DF, with more units with relative higher local coefficient values in Liwan, Yuexiu, Haizhu, and Tianhe districts, although the association tended to be weaker (less than 200) in the central Haizhu where there were relatively fewer DF cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007350.g004">Fig 4</xref>), lower road density, less population density, and sparser public transportation stations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007350.g002">Fig 2</xref>). These results suggested that UVs were the most important factor in the spatial variations in the DF epidemic across the central region of Guangzhou.
