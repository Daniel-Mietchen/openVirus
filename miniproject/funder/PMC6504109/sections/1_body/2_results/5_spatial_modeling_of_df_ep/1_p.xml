<p>According to the adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup>, AICc and Sigma values (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), spatial variations in the gridded DF epidemic in the central region of Guangzhou City were appropriately explained by the GWR/OLS models, which employed each influencing factor or their various combinations. In comparison, the comprehensive explanatory performance of the GWR models was much better than that of the OLS models due to the higher adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup>, lower AICc and Sigma values. About 46% or more spatial variation was interpreted by the univariate GWR models. Among the potential influencing factors derived from the univariate GWR models, bus stops and UVs possessed relatively higher adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup>, lower Sigma and AICc values. However, population density possessed a relatively lower adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup>, higher Sigma and AICc values.
