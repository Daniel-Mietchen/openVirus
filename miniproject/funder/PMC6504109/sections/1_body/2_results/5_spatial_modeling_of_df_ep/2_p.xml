<p>Similarly, the GWR model (Com 1) integrating bus stops and UVs performed the best among all of the bivariate models. When this model further integrated either GDP or population density that possessed relatively weaker explanatory ability, the performances were increased according to the rising adjusted R
 <sup>2</sup> and declining values of AICc and Sigma in the GWR models (Com 9 and Com 10 in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In comparison, the other multivariate GWR models (Com 7, 8, and 11–14) had slightly weaker performances. In particular, the weakest performance was observed in the model (Com 12) even though the best bivariate GWR model (Com 1) further integrated both GDP and population density. And the reliability of its results quickly decayed because the potential risk of collinearity (VIF) had increased from 1.23 to 4.82 (

 <sup>2</sup> (0.59), the lowest AICc (5305.02), the lowest Sigma (272.80), and a lower VIF value (&lt;1.63). Moreover, according to the spatially random patterns of the StdResid values (Moran’s I = 0.04, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.26, Z-score = 1.12), the performance of this model was also spatially stable, although there were still a few units with absolute StdResid values &gt; 2 (
