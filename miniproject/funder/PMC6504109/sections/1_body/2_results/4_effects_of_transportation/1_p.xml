<p>Advanced traffic conditions, especially public transportation systems (such as bus services and subway lines) facilitate contact among people living in UVs. DF case density in the units (n = 272) with either bus stops or subway stations was much higher (73.21 cases per km
 <sup>2</sup>) than those without any bus stops or subway stations (7.74 cases per km
 <sup>2</sup>) (n = 19). Moreover, as given in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the gridded DF incidence rates were significantly positively associated with UV area (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.33, P = 0.000), number of bus stops (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.49, P = 0.000) and subway stations (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.27, P = 0.000), and road density (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.39, P = 0.000).
