<p>In comparison, the partial correlation coefficient between the gridded DF incidence rates and UV area individually decreased from 0.33 to 0.24 when traffic conditions were controlled for (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These partial correlation coefficients between DF incidence rates and traffic conditions (i.e., the number of bus stops, subway stations, all stops, and road density) were slightly decreased to 0.43, 0.27, 0.41, and 0.38, respectively, when UV area was controlled for. Among them, bus stops were the most suitable indicator of traffic conditions because of their high correlation coefficients. These results indicated that the aggregation effects on the gridded DF epidemic across the central region were heavily influenced by the traffic system, especially the presence of bus stops.
