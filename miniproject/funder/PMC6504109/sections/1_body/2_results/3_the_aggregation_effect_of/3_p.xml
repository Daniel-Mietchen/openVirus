<p>In addition, the regions surrounding UVs were obviously influenced by the DF epidemic in the UVs with DF cases. Along with the radius of buffers increasing, accumulated DF case count in regions including the UVs with DF cases and their surrounding buffering zones showed an ascending trend (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007350.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Until the radius of the buffer zones was 500m, about 90% of the total DF cases were concentrated in these regions (i.e., UVs and buffer zones). In comparison, newly included DF cases in the extended buffers per 50 m (i.e., increasing slope) displayed clear decreasing trends, especially in the first two buffers (50 m and 100 m). This decline was alleviated in the 200 m buffers. Meanwhile, the incidence rates of DF in the buffering zones gradually decreased, although there was larger and larger population proportion due to the increasing buffering distances. These results illustrated that UVs posed an obvious aggregation effect on the DF epidemic across the central region in Guangzhou City.
