<p>The sizes of the DF epidemic were associated with the UVsâ€™ area. In the UVs with recorded DF cases, the number of DF cases (the total in the study period) was strongly associated with acreage of these UVs (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.45, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.015), as shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Similarly, on the grid scale, the counts of DF cases were significantly correlated with the gridded UVs acreage (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.33, 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.000) in the infected units.
