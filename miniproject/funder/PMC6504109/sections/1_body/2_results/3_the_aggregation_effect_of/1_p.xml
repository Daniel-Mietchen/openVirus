<p>Between 2012 and 2017, DF patterns in the UVs differed from those of the NCL areas. As shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007350.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 61.76%– 71.45% of total DF cases in the CL zones were distributed in the NCL zones with proportionally larger areas (81.93% in 2012 and 83.47% in 2017) across the central four districts. By comparison, the rest (28.55%– 38.24%) were distributed in UVs with proportionally smaller areas (18.07% in 2012 and 16.53% in 2017). Meanwhile, population density (persons per km
 <sup>2</sup>) in the UVs was slightly higher than that of NCL in 2012 and 2017, although the population size of NCL is 4.55–4.94 times that of the UVs. As a result, the density of DF cases and the DF incidence rates in UVs were respectively 1.81–3.13 and 1.82–3.06 times that of NCL between 2012 and 2017. It can be clearly seen that UVs possessed higher values of DF cases density, incidence rates, and population density in the central region of Guangzhou City. In other words, DF cases were more likely to be found in UV areas.
