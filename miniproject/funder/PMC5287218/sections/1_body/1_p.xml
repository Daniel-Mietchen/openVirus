<p>With the past decade’s efforts of WHO and its partners, the accumulated knowledge, understanding, experience and practice of influenza vaccines results in a renewed landscape of progress and challenges. Among others, vaccine research and development led by US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) and increased potential vaccine production capacity pioneered by the WHO GAP have resulted in a far better pandemic preparedness 
 <xref rid="b0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. On the other hand, the need for thorough preparedness as learnt from the recent Ebola outbreak response 
 <xref rid="b0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> mirrors that for an influenza pandemic, including pandemic vaccine response. The most opportunistic estimate of current monovalent pandemic vaccine production capacity of 415 million doses per year in GAP-supported Low- and Lower-middle-income countries (GAP survey 2015 – unpublished) is far from the need to immunize the world’s population of more than 7 billion people, let alone that pandemic influenza waves may have swept over globally within a year. Aside from the supply, the current 50–60% effectiveness of seasonal vaccines, even with perfect match of vaccine viruses with circulating viruses 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, is rather disappointing and calls for better protective vaccines. The perception on influenza vaccines is further affected when there is a mismatch between vaccine composition and circulating viruses, which can result in effectiveness much lower than 50%. The scientific complexities e.g. issues associated with egg-propagated and cell-propagated virus isolates, and newly emerged viral features of seasonal H3N2 viruses 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> which is not fully comprehended by growing interest of the population, press the challenge further.
