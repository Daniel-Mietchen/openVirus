<p>The actual pandemic influenza vaccine response pathway, sharing many aspects with that of the seasonal vaccines, is subject to massive stress, extremely complex and dependent on many critical and concrete steps from detection of the pandemic virus, to vaccine production and roll-out. Aside from some response elements e.g. actual vaccine virus that would be available only when a pandemic hits, seasonal influenza â€“ a robust vaccine process and better vaccines, provides a critical opportunity to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the pandemic vaccine response. Luck, as was the 2009 pandemic, is not a strategy. The inter-pandemic period now presents a precious window, but the window may close at any moment.</p>
