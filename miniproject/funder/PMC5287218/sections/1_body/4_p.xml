<p>Early detection of a pandemic virus and development of a high-growth reassortant that can be used for large scale production are critical steps of pandemic vaccine response. The constraints of these early critical steps are reflected in seasonal vaccine response – which became very evident when an antigenic variant emerged late in spring 2014 
 <xref rid="b0085" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> leading to a mismatch of H3N2 component of the vaccines for use in the northern hemisphere 2014–15 season. Such events also call for a critical review of the resilience of current system from virus detection to vaccine production and distribution to deal with late emerging seasonal variants – the same mechanism for the pandemic vaccine response.
