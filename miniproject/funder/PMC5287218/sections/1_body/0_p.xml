<p>Influenza vaccine is the primary intervention to reduce mortality and morbidity in an influenza pandemic, in particular a severe pandemic. However, the current state of vaccine technology does not allow a rapid surge in pandemic vaccine production in the advent of a pandemic, to which the response will rely on the same production platform as seasonal vaccines. Thus how efficient a pandemic vaccine response would be depends largely on the extent of how well seasonal vaccine response to annual epidemics is rightly seized. Recognizing the shared pathways of vaccine response to both seasonal epidemics and pandemics, in 2002 WHO developed a “Global Agenda on Influenza Surveillance and Control” with an objective to increase influenza vaccine usage during inter-pandemic periods towards strengthen national and international pandemic preparedness. In 2003, the World Health Assembly (WHA 56.19) resolved to urge Member States to increase vaccination coverage of risk population
