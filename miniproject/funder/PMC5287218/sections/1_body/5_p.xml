<p>Since 1952, WHO through its Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) is working closely with its partners to further strengthen global surveillance, including the detection of novel antigenic variants and monitoring their spread â€“ a decisive signal of a pandemic, as part of the seasonal vaccine response. The adoption and implementation of the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> enables a systematic approach to understand burden of disease associated with influenza, which is essential for countries in particular in Low- and Lower-middle-income countries to shape their seasonal vaccination policies. Such vaccination policies will foster the development of national surveillance, regulatory and deployment capacity during the inter-pandemic periods to serve pandemic response preparedly.
