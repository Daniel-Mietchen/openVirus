<p>The relatively mild severity of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> does not in any way exempt the world from a catastrophic hit at any time by the next pandemic strain of an hitherto unknown virus subtype. The threat of the next influenza pandemic is getting more vivid than ever with the spreading of avian influenza viruses 
 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and increasing virus activity across the animal human ecosystem interface 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, of which, tip of the iceberg can be seen from the frequent as yet sporadic and extremely alarming human infections with H5, H7N9 and H9N2 avian viruses. WHO revised its pandemic preparedness plan and published an interim guidance document of Pandemic Influenza Risk Management Framework in 2013 
 <xref rid="b0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and is currently working with partners towards finalizing the pending chapter on pandemic vaccines.
