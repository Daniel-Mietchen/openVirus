<p>The complexities of vaccine response at the beginning of a pandemic were examined through an informal WHO consultation in June 2015 through scenarios, when seasonal influenza viruses may still be causing severe epidemics in parts of the world. Subsequently countries may have different priority needs for seasonal and pandemic vaccines, while a vaccine manufacturer can produce at one time either seasonal or pandemic vaccines but not both. The WHO process continued in July 2016 (unpublished) to develop response with critical elements including principles of consideration and a transparent process for decision to commence the pandemic vaccine production which might require “switch” from seasonal vaccine production. Such decision making process will not be fully operational until critical details e.g. data needs as evidence base are identified and vaccine production bottleneck solutions are in place. Except for some conditional regulatory processes
