For a world population of more than 7 billion currently with about 79% living in low and middle income countries, in the event of a severe pandemic, the only way to avoid a major global disaster is, from this moment on, to expedite research and development of new vaccines and vaccine production technologies in parallel with strengthening national and global surveillance, regulatory, logistics and communication capacities.

In this context, the WHO Global Influenza Program in Geneva has currently undertaken to update its research agenda first developed in 2009 and reviewed in 2011
