<p>Although numerous studies have described signals of positive and negative selection acting on codon sites within HIV-1M genomes (
 <xref rid="vey003-B33" ref-type="bibr">Ngandu et al. 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vey003-B29" ref-type="bibr">Mayrose et al. 2013</xref>), here we looked for evidence consistent with homologous codons from African A1 genomes, European A1 genomes, and CRF genomes being under subtly different selection pressures. We identified multiple codon sites within the A-attributed gene segments of some recombinants at which different encoded amino acids were selectively favoured relative to members of the parental African A1 lineage. The few exceptional sites that display this pattern of evolution have potentially undergone post-recombination or post-movement changes to better adapt fragments of subtype A sequence to their new genomic or environmental contexts. One example of this might come from the subtype A1 epidemic in Russia were a subtype A variant with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance mutation is highly prevalent (
 <xref rid="vey003-B21" ref-type="bibr">Kolomeets et al. 2014</xref>). However, our results also indicate that the vast majority of codon sites within the subtype A-derived portions of CRFs 01_AE, 02_AG, and 22_01A1 have not obviously undergone extensive adaptation to their new genomic contexts; that is that patterns of negative selection at these sites have remained broadly unchanged between these different groups of viruses and their parental A1 lineage. This suggests that, even before A1 sequences emigrated from Africa, or A1 genomic fragments were transferred into foreign genomic backgrounds, these sequences may have already been highly adapted to the geographical and/or genomic environments into which they were transferred. It is also likely, however, that, regardless of their geographical and/or genomic environments, similarities between the selection signals observable in the sequences of these different A1 lineages are a consequence of these lineages being subjected to similar selective forces following their diversification. In this regard, while similarities between these selection signals are consistent with pre-adaptation, they are not by themselves proof of pre-adaptation.
