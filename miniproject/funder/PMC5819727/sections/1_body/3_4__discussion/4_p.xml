<p>The global dissemination of A1 and A1-derived recombinants contrasts starkly with the lower prevalence and more geographically constrained ranges of the other main subtype A lineages. Just as there appear to be subtype-specific differences in rates of disease progression and pathogenesis (
 <xref rid="vey003-B25" ref-type="bibr">Mann et al. 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vey003-B5" ref-type="bibr">Brandenberg et al. 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vey003-B58" ref-type="bibr">Venner et al. 2016</xref>), it is possible that different subtype A lineages might also vary with respect to their epidemiologically relevant biological characteristics. The absence of non-disseminating subtype A lineages within or around hubs of human migration within the DRC during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s might explain the absence of these viruses in other parts of the world. It cannot, however, explain why A2, A3, A4, and A5 viruses have not spread throughout the CB as extensively as A1 viruses: especially given that viruses that were most closely related to the present A4 lineage were likely circulating within populous cities such as Kinshasa in the 1950s and 1960s (
 <xref rid="vey003-B59" ref-type="bibr">Worobey et al. 2008</xref>). It therefore remains plausible that viruses belonging to the rarer subtype A lineages could have simply been less fit than those belonging to the A1 lineage and, therefore, that in the 1950s, A1 was evolutionarily better poised for successful global dissemination. In addition, we identified fifteen subtype A-derived CRFs that most likely arose somewhere in the CB prior to the 1980s (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="vey003-T1">Table 1</xref>). Twelve of these have an A1 parent, two an A2 parent, and one an A5 parent. This is certainly consistent with the hypothesis that members of the A1 lineage were already fitter and/or more prevalent than members of the other A sub-subtypes throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when these recombination events likely occurred.
