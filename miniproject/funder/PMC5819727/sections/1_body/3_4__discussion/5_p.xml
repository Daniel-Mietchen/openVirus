<p>It remains unclear why, before the almost simultaneous exodus of subtype A, B, D, and C viruses from the CB, subtype A viruses appear to have participated more extensively in the generation of the known circulating recombinant viruses than those in these other subtypes. The geographical origins of these viruses may explain this enigma. It is presently believed that, as with subtypes B and C (
 <xref rid="vey003-B13" ref-type="bibr">Faria et al. 2014</xref>), A1 most likely originated in the CB. Our analyses, however, indicate that the MRCA of all the analysed A1 genomes most probably existed in a region that included Cameroon, Gabon, and the CAR. Furthermore, 64% of the recombination events involving transfers of A1 sequences that were inferred to have happened prior to the 1980s, were also predicted in our analyses to have most probably occurred within this same region (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="vey003-T1">Table 1</xref>). Consistent with this possibility is the fact that eleven out of the eighteen CRFs that contain A1-derived genome fragments have been sampled in Cameroon and four of these eleven (13, 36, 37, and 22) have been found only in either Cameroon or in Cameroonian individuals (whenever these have been found outside of Cameroon).
