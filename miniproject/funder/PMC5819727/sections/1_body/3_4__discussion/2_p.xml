<p>We inferred that, starting in the late 1950s within the CB, the best sampled of the subtype A sub-subtypes, A1, experienced a burst of diversification that involved frequent inter-subtype recombination. This suggests both that A1 was circulating at high frequencies within the CB at that time and that these high frequencies could have contributed to the global spread of A1 and A1-derived sequences out of this region during the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
