<p>Although both subtypes B (and its sister clade D) and C originated in the CB at approximately the same time as subtype A (

 <xref rid="vey003-B17" ref-type="bibr">Hemelaar et al. 2011</xref>), they have experienced only limited spread within the CB region; subtype C represents around 10% of viruses circulating in Angola (

 <xref rid="vey003-B45" ref-type="bibr">Rodgers et al. 2017b</xref>) and has only rarely been found in other countries of the CB. Subtype D, accounts for approximately 15% of HIV infections in the Republic of Congo (

 <xref rid="vey003-B45" ref-type="bibr">Rodgers et al. 2017b</xref>), but has also only been very rarely found in other CB countries. Further, despite the broad spectrum of HIV-1M genetic diversity within the CB today, there remains a predominance of subtype A and subtype A-derived recombinant forms in the DRC, Republic of Congo and Angola (where A1 dominates [

 <xref rid="vey003-B26" ref-type="bibr">Marechal et al. 2006</xref>]). It is possible that at the onset of the global epidemic, the A1 lineage was circulating within the CB at higher frequencies than subtypes B/D, C, and G. Although this could just have been a consequence of A1 viruses simply being present at the right places and times for dispersal, it remains plausible that within this large and diverse A1 population there were genetic variants with increased reproductive fitness that, upon dispersal, were poised to ‘colonize’ both the entire CB region and the rest of the world.
