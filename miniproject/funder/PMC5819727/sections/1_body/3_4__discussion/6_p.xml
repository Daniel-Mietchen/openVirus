<p>It is difficult to explain how so much recombination took place during the early HIV epidemic in Cameroon. Cameroon presently has an HIV prevalence of only 5%, which is very low by African standards, and presumably also has a correspondingly low prevalence of dual infections. It is, however, possible that isolated high HIV prevalence hotspots may have persisted for decades within the country. For example, in some remote Cameroonian villages, up to 20% of individuals are HIV positive (

 <xref rid="vey003-B44" ref-type="bibr">Rodgers et al. 2017a</xref>). It therefore follows that high HIV-1M prevalence in some of these remote Cameroonian villages might had provided the opportunity for A1 to extensively recombine. A factor that may, at least in part, account for these pockets of high prevalence, could be that HIV-1M variants within these regions of Cameroon have likely been adapting to a genetically consistent human population for far longer than HIV variants found in other, more cosmopolitan, parts of the world. If these Cameroonian viruses are better adapted to infecting humans than are HIV variants found elsewhere, this could be reflected in the average duration of HIV-1M infections and/or the transmissibility of viruses being substantially greater in Cameroon than they are in other parts of the world.
