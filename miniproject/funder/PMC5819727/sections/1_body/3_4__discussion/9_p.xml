<p>We have presented circumstantial evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that, at the onset of the global HIV epidemic, sub-subtype A1 viruses circulating in the CB were genetically predisposed to successfully found HIV epidemics in other parts of the world. This evidence includes: (1) the high number of instances where sub-subtype A1 viruses were inferred to have been transferred to, and founded new subepidemics in, different parts of the world prior to the 1980s; (2) the genesis within the CB during the 1960s and 1970s of large numbers of CRFs containing A1-derived genome fragments and the ensuing high prevalence of A1 attributable genome fragments within recombinant HIV genomes; and (3) evidence of consistently pervasive negative selection favouring the maintenance of the same amino acid states within A1-derived coding regions both between independent groups of A1 viruses sampled in Africa and Europe, and between parental A1 lineages and A1-derived genome fragments within CRFs. If sub-subtype A1 sequences are indeed predisposed to successfully seed new epidemics, it would be of utmost importance to identify the precise genetic underpinnings of this predisposition as knowing these could tremendously enhance our capacity to predict future HIV-1M emergence and dissemination events.</p>
