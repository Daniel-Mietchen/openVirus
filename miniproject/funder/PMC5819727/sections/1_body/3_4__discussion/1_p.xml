<p>Subtype A remains a major circulating lineage within the CB region where HIV-1M originated, and is both the most widely distributed and most genetically diverse of the known HIV-1M subtypes. Here, for the first time, we have analysed when and where the main subtype A lineages and subtype A-derived recombinant lineages arose using a comprehensive set of published subtype A, near full-length sequences together with subtype A-derived genome fragments from CRFs and URFs. Our analysis indicates the origins of most of the subtype A-derived CRFs were likely within the CB. We also present evidence supporting the occurrence of multiple independent epidemics being seeded by subtype A viruses and viruses containing subtype A-derived sequences throughout the world prior to the discovery of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s. We further examined subtype A
