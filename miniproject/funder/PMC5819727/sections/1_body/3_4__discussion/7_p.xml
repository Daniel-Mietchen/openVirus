<p>In our study, we found that the sub-subtype A3 is actually a sublinage inside the sub-subtype A1 radiation, and remains so in a tree constructed with only ‘pure’ subtype A sequences. This result contradicts the classification proposed by the Los Alamos HIV sequence database (
 <xref rid="vey003-B23" ref-type="bibr">LANL 2014</xref>). The apparent disagreement possibly stems from the fact that at the time when the A3 sequences were classified there were fewer and/or less diverse A1 whole genome sequences that were publically available for comparison. Further, the fact that the A3 clade connects with the A1 clade via a deep branch within the A1 radiation emphasizes the uncertainty of whether this clade should be considered a distinct sub-subtype or simply a divergent lineage of A1.
