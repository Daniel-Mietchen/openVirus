<p>To study the evolutionary history of HIV subtype A lineages, we retrieved (1) 136 near full-length sequences classified as belonging to subtype A within the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) HIV sequence database (
 <xref rid="vey003-B23" ref-type="bibr">LANL 2014</xref>) in June 2015; (2) 120 sequences from 21 CRFs containing A-attributed segments with a total length of at least 1,000 nucleotides (nt) according to the breakpoint locations defined by the LANL HIV sequence database; (3) two highly divergent URFs; and (4) ninety nine representatives of near full-length sequences from each of the other eight ‘pure’ HIV-1M subtypes that were available in the LANL database in June 2015 (
 <xref rid="vey003-B23" ref-type="bibr">LANL 2014</xref>). These representative sequences were specifically selected to include the broadest diversity of HIV-1M near full-length genomes previously identified as belonging to known HIV-1M subtypes (
 <xref rid="vey003-B53" ref-type="bibr">Tongo et al. 2015a</xref>). This selection procedure was also applied to CRFs 01_AE and 02_AG lineages because of the large numbers of sequences available for these two CRFs. This was achieved by constructing maximum likelihood (ML) trees from all available full-length sequences for each of the two CRFs using Fastree2 (
 <xref rid="vey003-B38" ref-type="bibr">Price, Dehal, and Arkin 2009</xref>) implemented in RDP4 (
 <xref rid="vey003-B28" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al. 2015</xref>), and selecting one sequence from each of the most basal lineages from the root of these CRFs (
 <xref rid="vey003-B53" ref-type="bibr">Tongo et al. 2015a</xref>). This yielded thirteen CRF01_AE and twelve CRF02_AG sequences that represent the entire breadth of genetic diversity within these clades (
