<p>We detected and compared signals of negative selection (natural selection disfavouring change) and positive selection (natural selection favouring change) within codon alignments of five sets of sequences drawn from the A1 sub-tree. These included: (1) a monophyletic clade of A1 strains circulating in Africa (A1
 <sub>Afr</sub>), (2) a monophyletic clade of A1 strains circulating in Europe (A1
 <sub>Eur</sub>), (3) a monophyletic clade of A1-derived sequences within CRF01_AE, (4) monophyletic A1-derived sequences within CRF02_AG, and (5) a monophyletic clade of A1-derived sequences within CRF22_01A1. These groups of sequences were selected because they display a degree of diversity that is sufficient to enable the quantification of relative synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitution rates at individual codon sites. For these analyses, all CRF 01_AE and 02_AG sequences currently available in the LANL HIV sequence database (
 <xref rid="vey003-B23" ref-type="bibr">LANL 2014</xref>) were retrieved (all of these sequences were not included in the original spatio-temporal sequence analysis). Genome fragments corresponding to the 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic>, and 
 <italic>env</italic> genes were codon aligned together with homologous sequences from A1
 <sub>Eur</sub>, A1
 <sub>Afr</sub>, and CRF22_01A1 using MUSCLE (
 <xref rid="vey003-B12" ref-type="bibr">Edgar 2004</xref>) and were manually edited in MEGA version 5 (
 <xref rid="vey003-B49" ref-type="bibr">Tamura et al. 2011</xref>). The alignments were segmented so that they only contained subtype A-derived genome fragments. The FUBAR method (
 <xref rid="vey003-B32" ref-type="bibr">Murrell et al. 2013</xref>) was used to estimate dN-dS scores for individual codons within these alignments, but only when these contained nucleotides that are most likely expressed in just one frame. The following pairwise comparisons and visualizations using SelectionMap (
 <xref rid="vey003-B48" ref-type="bibr">Stenzel et al. 2014</xref>) of selection patterns were made across genes drawn from the five different phylogenetically independent groups of viral sequences: A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> vs A1
 <sub>Eur</sub>, A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> vs CRF01_AE, A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> vs CRF02_AG; and A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> vs CRF22_01 A.
