<p>Full-length genome sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (
 <xref rid="vey003-B12" ref-type="bibr">Edgar 2004</xref>) with manual editing in IMPALE (Khoosal and Martin). Recombinant sequences were removed from the resulting alignments and split into their constituent recombinationally derived fragments based on previously inferred breakpoint locations. Individual subtype A-derived fragments larger than 1,000 nt in length were then re-added to the initial alignment, with gap characters being added to the 3′ and 5′ ends of the fragments to ensure that they remained correctly aligned with the rest of the dataset. Genome segments corresponding to HXB2 nt positions 4267–5041 of CRF06_cpx, 4040–6046 of CRF11_cpx, and 8790–9442 of CRF18_cpx that were previously identified as being subtype A derived were not included in this alignment because the actual origins of these sequences are uncertain (

 <xref rid="vey003-B46" ref-type="bibr">Stamatakis 2014</xref>) implemented in CIPRES (
 <xref rid="vey003-B30" ref-type="bibr">Miller, Pfeiffer, and Schwartz 2010</xref>). Although RAxML is limited to the use of GTR-based nucleotide substitution models (GTR-GAMMA in our case), it has been specifically designed to accurately infer phylogenies from alignments containing large amounts of missing data (

 <xref rid="vey003-B46" ref-type="bibr">Stamatakis 2014</xref>). This ideally suited it to the analysis of our mostly inter-subtype recombination-free alignment.
