<p>Estimation of the time to the most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs) of various sub-lineages represented within our subtype A dataset was achieved using a Bayesian statistical approach implemented in the software, BEAST v1.8.4 (
 <xref rid="vey003-B10" ref-type="bibr">Drummond and Rambaut 2007</xref>). To ensure that the subtype A and subtype A-attributed genome fragment dataset contained sufficient phylogenetic signal to produce accurate and precise estimates of the dates of the nodes of a maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree determined using BEAST, we randomized dates of the sequences during the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling procedure. This allowed the direct comparison of results obtained from the analyses of sequences with correct sampling times with those of these same sequences with randomized sampling times (

Significant temporal signal was inferred if no overlap existed between the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) credibility intervals for the nucleotide substitution rate estimates obtained from the real and randomized MCMC analyses. The best-fit nucleotide substitution model was estimated using J model test (
