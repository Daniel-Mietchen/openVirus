<p>To ensure convergence and sufficient mixing of the Markov chains for each of the evolutionary models, ten independent MCMC runs of 400 million generations with trees being sampled every 40,000 generations were performed until effective sample sizes for all model parameters were &gt;200. When similar results were obtained from independent runs of the same model, log and tree files were combined using LogCombiner and the MCC trees constructed using TreeAnnotator (both part of the BEAST package). The resulting log and tree output files were visualised using Tracer v1.6 (
