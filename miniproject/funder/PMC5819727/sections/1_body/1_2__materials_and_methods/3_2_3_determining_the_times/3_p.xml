<p>We estimated the times when recombination events most likely occurred by first identifying, for each of the individual recombinationally acquired subtype A segments within each CRF, the node in the MCC tree that represented the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of these segments. The inferred date and the upper bound of the 95% HPD for this node were respectively taken as being the upper bounds and upper 95% HPD bound of the date when the recombination event occurred. Similarly, the dates and lower bound of the 95% HPD for the node immediately ancestral to this MRCA node in the MCC tree were respectively taken as being the lower bound and lower 95% HPD bound of the date when the recombination event occurred (

Similarly, the geographical location where the recombination event likely occurred was inferred from the average of the location state probabilities inferred for the two nodes bounding the branch along which the recombination event most likely occurred.
