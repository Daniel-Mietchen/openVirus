<p>Subtype A was likely one of the most epidemiologically competent HIV-1M proto-subtypes circulating in the Congo Basin (CB) region during the 1950s (

The possibility that subtype A and its recombinant descendants (primarily including CRF02_AG) remain among the fittest HIV-1M lineages, is best supported by the fact that, unlike any of the other major HIV-1M subtypes, these viruses are still widely distributed and highly prevalent throughout equatorial west Africa; the region where HIV-1M initially emerged. Subtype A and its recombinant, CRF02_AG, account for ∼43% of HIV-1M infections in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), ∼50% of HIV-1M infections in Cameroon, ∼53.7% in Equatorial Guinea, 46.7% in Gabon, ∼30% in the Republic of Congo, and ∼22% in Angola (

While the possibility cannot be excluded that this distribution is just the result of subtype A or CRF02_AG having spread throughout this entire region by chance (i.e. without the need to invoke increased fitness), one should at least question how these two lineages have persisted as the predominant HIV lineages within the CB: a region where the potential for competition between these viruses and viruses belonging to almost all the other known HIV-1M subtypes is very high. Further, throughout the rest of the world, subtype A and its recombinant descendants account for ∼25% of HIV-1M infections and are second only to subtype C in terms of global prevalence (
