<p>Whereas many prospective cohort studies have suggested that there may be differences in rates of disease progression between subtypes (
 <xref rid="vey003-B50" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al. 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="vey003-B20" ref-type="bibr">Kiguoya et al. 2017</xref>), experimental efforts to detect differences in the fitness of viruses belonging to the different subtypes have primarily focused on quantifying individual gene functions. For example, whereas the 
 <italic>nef</italic> genes of subtype B isolates seem to downregulate CD4 and class I HLA allele expression more effectively than do the 
 <italic>nef</italic> genes from subtype A, C, and D isolates (
 <xref rid="vey003-B25" ref-type="bibr">Mann et al. 2013</xref>), the 
 <italic>vpu</italic> genes from subtype C isolates tend to downregulate CD4 and tetherin more effectively than do the 
 <italic>vpu</italic> genes of subtypes A, B, and A/D recombinant isolates (
 <xref rid="vey003-B39" ref-type="bibr">Rahimi et al. 2017</xref>). It is, however, very difficult to infer differences in the actual epidemiological potential (i.e. the overall fitness, reproductive rate, or pathogenesis) of viruses belonging to different HIV-1M subtypes based entirely on these types of directed fitness assays (
 <xref rid="vey003-B27" ref-type="bibr">Markle, Philip, and Brockman 2013</xref>). The relative fitness of different HIV-1M subtypes in an epidemiological sense should, at least in part, be reflected in their relative global prevalence and/or distributions over the course of the epidemic.
