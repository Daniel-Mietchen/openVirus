<p>Here, we gather for the first time a comprehensive dataset of subtype A full genome sequences together with fragments of subtype A-derived sequences from CRFs and unique recombinant forms (URFs) to phylogenetically infer when and where major recombination and dissemination events occurred during the evolutionary history of subtype A and subtypes A-derived recombinant viruses. We further assess whether there is evidence of subtle differences in selection pressures at individual codon sites within subtype A sequences sampled from different sub-epidemics.</p>
