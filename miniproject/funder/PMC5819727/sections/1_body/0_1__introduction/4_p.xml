<p>The viruses included within subtype A are in fact so diverse that they have been classified into six different sub-subtypes (referred to as A1 through A6) (
 <xref rid="vey003-B14" ref-type="bibr">Foley et al. 2016</xref>). As more evidence accumulates, additional sub-subtypes will likely need to be defined to keep track of the diversity within this subtype. For example, the existence of an A7 sub-subtype has been inferred through analyses of Angolan HIV-1M

 <xref rid="vey003-B4" ref-type="bibr">Bartolo et al. 2009</xref>) and an A8 sub-subtype has been inferred from the characterization of subtype A-derived sequences found within circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) 36_cpx and 37_cpx (Powell et al.
