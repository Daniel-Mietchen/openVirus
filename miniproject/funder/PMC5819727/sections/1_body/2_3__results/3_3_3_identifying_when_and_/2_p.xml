<p>The MCC tree yielded by these analyses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F2">Fig. 2</xref>) is broadly consistent with the ML tree produced from these sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F1">Fig. 1</xref>); four sub-lineages within subtype A were also identified and the A1 sub-lineage also contains the same three distinct clusters.
