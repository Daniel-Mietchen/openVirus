<p>To estimate the approximate dates when subtype A-derived sequences were incorporated within the recombinant genomes, we analysed the 306 subtype A and subtype A-attributed genome fragment dataset using a Bayesian phylogeographic approach (

 <xref rid="vey003-B16" ref-type="bibr">Guindon and Gascuel 2003</xref>) was the generalized time-reversible model with four gamma rate categories and a proportion of invariant sites (GTR + G4 + I). The best-fit molecular clock and demographic model combination identified using MLE by both path and stepping stone methods was the uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock, with the Bayesian Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) skygrid coalescent tree prior (

 <sup>−3</sup>, 95% HPD = 3.65–6.25 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup>) and those with the date-randomization procedure applied (mean rate = 5.35 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>, 95% HPD = 4.35–6.25 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>), providing evidence for significant temporal signal in the time-stamped dataset (
