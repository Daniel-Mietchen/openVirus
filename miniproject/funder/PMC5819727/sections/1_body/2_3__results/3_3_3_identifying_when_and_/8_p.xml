<p>A sequence too short to be included in our dataset and derived from a virus sampled in the DRC in 1960 (DRC60) was previously found to fall basal to the A4 viruses (
 <xref rid="vey003-B59" ref-type="bibr">Worobey et al. 2008</xref>). To work out where this sequence would have been located in our MCC tree, we manually aligned the 508 fragmentary nucleotides of this sequence to the rest of our dataset and constructed a ML tree with RAxML. This tree indicated that, as expected, DRC60 would have likely been located, near the base of the A4 cluster in our MCC tree (

 <xref rid="vey003-B59" ref-type="bibr">Worobey et al. 2008</xref>). This date falls within the 95% HPD of our estimate of the A4 MRCA (1958–74). Further, our inference that the A4 MRCA was located within the DRC is also consistent with the analysis of
