<p>Consistent with previous results (
 <xref rid="vey003-B1" ref-type="bibr">Abecasis, Vandamme, and Lemey 2009</xref>), the MRCA of the most sampled group, A1, could be traced back to 1951 (95% HPD 1946–57) and was most probably also located in Cameroon/Gabon/CAR (
 <italic>P</italic> = 1.0). As is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="vey003-T1">Table 1</xref>, eleven out of sixteen recombination events involving A1 lineages (mostly from cluster III) happened between 1957 and 1977, before the discovery of the global HIV epidemic in the 1980s. Seven of these likely occurred in Cameroon/Gabon/CAR (with a probability ranging from 0.87 to 1), two either in Cameroon/Gabon/CAR (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.5) or in other regions of the world (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.5) and two in West Africa (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.61 and 0.82). None of the detected recombination events involving A1 parental viruses are inferred to have occurred in the CB region after the 1980s.
