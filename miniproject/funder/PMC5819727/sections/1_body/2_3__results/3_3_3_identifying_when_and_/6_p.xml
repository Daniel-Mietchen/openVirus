<p>The MRCA of the A4 sub-lineage was estimated to have been circulating in ∼1966 (1958–74) in the DRC (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.99), around the same time as the MRCA of the A2 lineage (∼1968; 1964–73), which was most probably circulating in Cameroon/Gabon/CAR (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.98). The recombination events involving the A fragments of the A2-derived CRFs also likely happened before the global epidemic was first detected in the 1980s, with the recombination event in CRF16_A2D happening between ∼1968 and 1973 (1964–77) in Cameroon/Gabon/CAR (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.97) and that in CRF 21_A2D happening between 1970 and 1977 (1966–81) either in Cameroon/Gabon/CAR (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.5) or East Africa (
 <italic>P</italic>= 0.5) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F2">Fig. 2</xref> and

 <italic>P</italic> = 1).
