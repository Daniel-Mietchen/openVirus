<p>Analysis of the MCC tree produced from the posterior distribution of trees yielded by the BEAST analysis revealed that the MRCA of all the analysed subtype A sequences likely existed in ∼1946 (95% HPD: 1939–53; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="vey003-T1">Table 1</xref>). This is ∼10 years earlier than prior estimates for subtype A based upon analyses of partial 
 <italic>gag</italic> sequences (1956 ±1) (
 <xref rid="vey003-B2" ref-type="bibr">Abidi et al. 2014</xref>), but similar to the proposed date of the ancestor of subtypes B and C (∼1944 and 1940, respectively) (
 <xref rid="vey003-B13" ref-type="bibr">Faria et al. 2014</xref>). Further, the MRCAs of A1, A2, A4, and A5 are all likely to have existed at some time between the early 1950s and 1970s (
