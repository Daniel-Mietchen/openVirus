<p>It has been found that A-attributed segments of CRFs 02_AG appear to have been derived from different subtype A parental viruses (
 <xref rid="vey003-B60" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2010</xref>). To further investigate whether multiple subtype A parental viruses might have contributed to individual CRFs, we separately analysed each of the &gt;1,000 nt long A-attributed segments from the CRFs in cluster III in our dataset. Contiguous subtype A-attributed fragments within each of these CRFs were separated into new sequences (i.e. the original CRF genomes containing multiple separated tracts of subtype A sequence were split into multiple different sequences) with gap characters being added to the 3′ and 5′ ends of the fragments to ensure that they remained correctly aligned with the remainder of the dataset. Fragments smaller than ∼1,000 nt in length were removed from the alignment. In this regard, two fragments of CRF02_AG (HXB2 nt position 790–2155 and 6225–8311), two from CRF09_cpx (790–2155 and 3275–4175), two from CRF22_01A1 (2666–5452 and 6724–8470), three from CRF37_cpx (1126–2142, 2913–4663, and 6431–7743), and three from CRF45_cpx (790–2397, 4299–6041, and 6343–8236) were analysed separately. This yielded a dataset of 306 subtype A and subtype A-derived sequences. A MCC tree was then constructed with this dataset.
