<p>The two A-attributed fragments of CRF09_cpx cluster together within the same region of the phylogenetic tree indicating that it is plausible that they could have originated from the same parental virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F2">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). Similarly, the A-attributed fragments of CRF22_01A1 also cluster in the same sub-tree, also indicating a same origin. In contrast, the two analysed segments of CRF02_AG do not cluster within the same sub-tree and, as has been suggested elsewhere (
 <xref rid="vey003-B60" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2010</xref>), could plausibly have originated from two different parental sources. Similarly, the three A-attributed fragments of CRF37_cpx and CRF45_cpx that were analysed, possibly also originated from two different sources (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F2">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>).
