<p>The ML tree generated from this dataset revealed the presence of at least four major evolutionary sub-lineages within subtype A (A1, A2, A4, and A5), all of which form sub-trees with more than 90% bootstrap support (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F1">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The first sub-lineage comprises almost all the subtype A near full-length sequences previously characterized as belonging to sub-subtype A1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). This sub-lineage is highly diverse and contains a further three distinct groups. The first of these (cluster I) consists primarily of A1 viruses from Africa but also includes a small cluster of sequences sampled in Cyprus, which was likely founded by viruses disseminated directly from Africa. This lineage also includes subtype A-derived genome segments from CRFs 35_AD and 50_A1D (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The second major sequence lineage (cluster II) within A1 consists primarily of sequences sampled in Europe but also contains subtype A-attributed segments from CRFs 03_AB and 32_06A1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The third lineage includes two groups of highly divergent viruses (clusters IIIa and IIIb), most of which are the subtype A parental lineages of fourteen of the twenty-one CRFs analysed here (01_AE, 02_AG, 04_cpx, 06_cpx, 09_cpx, 11_cpx, 13_cpx, 18_cpx, 19_cpx, 22_01A1, 36_cpx, and 37_cpx, 45_cpx and 49_cpx). This cluster also includes viruses sampled in Senegal that have previously been identified as belonging to sub-subtype A3 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).
