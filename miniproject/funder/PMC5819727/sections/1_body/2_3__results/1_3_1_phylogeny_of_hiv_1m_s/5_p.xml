<p>The second major evolutionary sub-lineage within subtype A, A2, contains isolates previously described as sub-subtype A2 and includes subtype A-derived genome segments within CRFs 16_A2D and 21_A2D. Sub-lineage three, A4, contains all Congolese isolates previously identified as belonging to sub-subtype A4 and the final sub-lineage, A5, contains A-attributed genome segments from DRC CRF26_AU isolates that have been previously identified as being derived from a sub-subtype A5 parental virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F1">Fig. 1</xref>). While the A-attributed fragment in the URF, Z321, branches basal to sequences belonging to CRF13_cpx, the two A-segments from the 97CD1997.KMST91 genome have apparently been derived from divergent parental viruses that branch phylogenetically near the base of the subtype A sub-tree (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F1">Fig. 1</xref>), suggesting that subtype A might contain a variety of currently unsampled and/or undersampled divergent lineages; lineages which might even be still circulating at low frequencies.
