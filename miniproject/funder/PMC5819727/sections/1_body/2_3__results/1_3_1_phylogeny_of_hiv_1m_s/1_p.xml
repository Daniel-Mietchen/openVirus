<p>We began our investigation into the evolutionary fitness of subtype A by investigating the evolutionary relationships between HIV-1M subtype A viruses and fragments of subtype A sequence found within recombinant HIV-1M genomes. We assembled a dataset containing 136 near full-length subtype A sequences and 120 contiguous subtype A-derived genome segments from twenty-one CRF sequences and two URF sequences (each with a least one subtype A-derived genomic fragment greater than 1,000 nucleotides long). To phylogenetically contextualize the subtype A and subtype A-derived sequences, we included an additional ninety nine near full-length sequences representing the full spectrum of known HIV-1M diversity within subtypes B, C, F, G, H, J, and K.</p>
