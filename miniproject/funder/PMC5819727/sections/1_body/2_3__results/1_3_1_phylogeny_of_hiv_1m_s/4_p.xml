<p>Even if no evidence of intra-subtype recombination was detected in the subtype A-attributed genome fragments of CRFs 01_AE and 02_AG, there is still a possibility that A-attributed fragments from other CRFs included in our dataset were the result of intra-subtype A recombination. Therefore, to assess if this possibility could have influenced our phylogenetic tree, we constructed a new ML tree with a dataset that included only subtype A full-length sequences classified in the LANL database as A1–A4 and A6 plus representative sequences of the other eight ‘pure’ subtypes. The tree was constructed using RAxML (

 <xref rid="vey003-B30" ref-type="bibr">Miller, Pfeiffer, and Schwartz 2010</xref>). The distribution and classification of subtype A sequences in this tree was similar to that in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F1">Fig. 1</xref>, with sub-subtype A3 clustering within the A1 radiation (
