<p>It is likely that parental viruses of the A-attributed portions of the numerous CRFs were co-circulating in the CB and could have had the opportunity to recombine among themselves. To test this possibility, we generated two alignments corresponding to genome regions equivalent to the HXB2 genome coordinates 790–2155 and 3275–4174 of CRF02_AG; these are the only genome regions where both the 01_AE and 02_AG sequences (representing the two main lineages among the analysed CRFs) contained overlapping subtype A-attributed genome fragments. These alignments included not only the A-attributed fragments of these two CRFs, but also fragments from the ‘pure’ subtype A lineages. These two datasets were assessed for evidence of intra-subtype recombination events using RDP4 (
 <xref rid="vey003-B28" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al. 2015</xref>), which does not require prior identification of non-recombinant parental sequences and considers all sequences in the analysis as potential recombinant and/or parental sequences. These analyses failed to detect any convincing recombination signals within any of the analysed sequences (
