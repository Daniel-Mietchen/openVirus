<p>Taken together, these results imply that during the divergence of A1 sequences within the A1
 <sub>Eur</sub>, CRFs 01_AE, 02_AG and 22_01A clade from their A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> relatives, only low numbers of sites have been evolving under directional selection away from the A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> states, presumably to adapt these sequences to their new host or genomic environments. The overwhelming majority of negatively selected sites in A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> sequences have been consistently evolving to maintain the same encoded amino acids at these sites across all the A1 sequence lineages, presumably to maintain the fitness advantages provided by these amino acids.
