<p>Overall, the distributions of negatively selected sites were strongly conserved between the A1

 <sub>Eur</sub>, CRFs 01_AE, 02_AG, and 22_01A1 datasets (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>) in 
 <italic>gag</italic> and 
 <italic>pol</italic>. This broad conservation of negative selection patterns is consistent with sub-subtype A1

 <italic>pol</italic> sequences being pre-adapted to functioning in host and viral genomic environments different to those within which they evolved.
