<p>To uncover evidence of substantial evolutionary innovations within different sub-subtype A1 lineages during the era after these viruses began dispersing throughout the world, we compared signals of codon evolution between various monophyletic A1 sequence lineages. Specifically, we compared signals of selection acting at individual codon sites within the 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic>, and 
 <italic>env</italic> genes of A1 sequences circulating in Africa (A1
 <sub>Afr</sub>) with those of four independent monophyletic clades within the A1 radiation, namely (1) A1 viruses circulating in Europe (A1
 <sub>Eur</sub>), (2) CRF 01_AE, (3) CRF02_AG, and (4) CRF22_01A1. The alignments were segmented such that they contained only subtype A-derived genome fragments in all the analysed genes. Specifically, we tested whether signals of negative selection evident within A1 lineage sequences close to the location where A1 originated were preserved in A1 sequences that have either left Africa (in the case of A1
 <sub>Eur</sub>)
 <sup>,</sup> or have left the context of ‘pure’ A1 genomes (in the case of CRFs 01_AE, 02_AG, and 22_01A1). If A1 sequences are in general genetically predisposed either to become the founders of foreign epidemics, or to increase the fitness of the genomes into which they are transferred, then we anticipated that patterns of negative selection (i.e. selection favouring the maintenance of adaptively favourable amino acid sequences) should be broadly conserved between these different groups of viruses. Alternatively, if the A1 sequences that emigrated from Africa were not particularly well adapted to 
 <underline>t</underline>heir new host populations then we would expect them to display increased evidence relative to A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> of codon sites evolving under either diversifying positive selection (i.e. where changes away from amino acid sites found in A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> are selectively favoured), or directional positive selection (i.e. where changes toward specific amino acid sequences are favoured). Similarly, if the sub-subtype A1 sequences that had been transferred into foreign genomic backgrounds were not particularly well adapted to their new genomic contexts then we would also expect them to display increased evidence relative to A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> of codon sites evolving under either diversifying positive selection or directional positive selection.
