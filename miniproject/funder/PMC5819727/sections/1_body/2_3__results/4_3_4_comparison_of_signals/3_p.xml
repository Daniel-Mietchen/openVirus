<p>It is noteworthy, however, that there were some codon sites within the A1-attributed 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic>, and 
 <italic>env</italic> segments of CRFs 01_AE, 02_AG, 22_01A1 and in the A1
 <sub>Eur</sub> sequences, which were detectably evolving under negative selection favouring the maintenance of different amino acids than those which have been selectively favoured in the A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> viruses (sites indicated in green in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="vey003-F3">Fig. 3</xref> and in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="vey003-T2">Table 2</xref>). For example, whereas in the 01_AE 
 <italic>gag</italic> sequences, negative selection is detectably favouring the maintenance of asparagine at positions 165 (from the beginning of 
 <italic>gag</italic> and with gaps deleted) and lysine at position 384, in A1
 <sub>Afr</sub>, Serine and Asparagine are selectively favoured at positions 165 and 384, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="vey003-T2">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, Isoleucine at position 267 and Arginine at position 406 were replaced by Valine and Lysine, respectively in 02_AG (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="vey003-T2">Table 2</xref>). At all these positions in the 01_AE and 02_AG sequences, there were a minority of viruses that had the same amino acid at these sites as viruses in the A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> lineage (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="vey003-T2">Table 2</xref>). This suggests that directional selection favouring the non-A1
 <sub>Afr</sub> states has likely operated only after the founding of the 01_AE and 02_AG clades.
