 <caption>
  <p> A time-scaled MCC tree indicating the most probable geographical locations of sequences that are ancestral to 306 subtype A sequences. These subtype A sequences include full-length subtype A genomes and contiguous A-attributed fragments within CRF and URF genomes. The colours of the branches correspond to the probable geographic locations of the ancestral viruses indicated by the branches, as indicated in the legend. The tree is temporally scaled such that distances between the concentric grey circles represent 10 years of evolution. Nodes with posterior probabilities &gt;0.95 and &gt;0.80 are indicated with black and open dots, respectively.</p>
