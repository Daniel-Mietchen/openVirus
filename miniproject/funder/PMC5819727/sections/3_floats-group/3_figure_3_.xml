  <p> Patterns of natural selection acting at sub-subtype A1-derived 
   <italic>gag</italic> codon sites in CRFs 01_AE (A) and 02_AG (B) compared to those acting on homologous codon sites in sub-subtype A1 genomes that were sampled in Africa (A1
   <sub>Afr</sub>). Codon site locations that are indicated are specific for the alignment used to analyse all these sequences. At each site, absolute values of the inferred non-synonymous substitution rate minus the synonymous substitution rate (dN − dS) are plotted (as determined by the FUBAR method). Significantly positive dN − dS values which are indicative of positive selection are indicated in red, whereas significantly negative dN − dS values which are indicative of negative selection are plotted in blue if negative selection for the same amino acid state is found in the two compared lineages. They are plotted in green if negative selection is detected in both compared lineages, but different amino acids are being selected, and in grey if negative selection is only detectable in one of the compared lineages. Overall dN/dS ratios &lt;1 indicate that, as expected, the 
   <italic>gag</italic> gene in all three clades is evolving under predominantly negative selection. Black arrows indicate clusters of codon sites under negative selection for different amino acids in the two compared lineages.
