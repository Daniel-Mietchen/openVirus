  <p> ML tree indicating the phylogenetic relationships between 357 HIV-1M genome sequences. These represent all published near full-length subtype A sequences that were available in the LANL database in June 2015 (
   <xref rid="vey003-B23" ref-type="bibr">LANL 2014</xref>), contiguous subtype A-derived genome segments from twenty-one CRFs with a total length of at least 1,000 nt, three highly divergent subtype A-like sequence fragments from two URFs and ninety nine near full-length sequences representing the full spectrum of known diversity within subtypes B, C, F, G, H, J, and K. The tree is mid-point rooted and was constructed with 1,000 full ML bootstrap replicates using RAxML (
   <xref rid="vey003-B46" ref-type="bibr">Stamatakis 2014</xref>). Nodes with bootstrap ≥70% are indicated with black dots. Some clades have been condensed for the sake of clarity.
