<p>While hospital-based surveillance represents only the burden of severe HEV disease, it can provide valuable insights, especially regarding the contribution to mortality among severe acute jaundice patients. Patients with acute jaundice commonly present to hospitals in many resource-poor hepatitis E endemic countries, including Bangladesh [

However, there are few studies in hepatitis E endemic countries that systematically enrolled patients with acute jaundice to estimate the burden of acute HEV infection in hospital settings, especially the case fatality rate and delivery outcomes of pregnant women [

Previous hospital-based studies in Bangladesh suggest that most of the cases of acute jaundice (22–64%) were due to HEV infection, however, those studies were limited to a single study site or a short study period which may not be a representative estimate of the burden of hepatitis E among all hospitalized acute jaundice patients in Bangladesh [
