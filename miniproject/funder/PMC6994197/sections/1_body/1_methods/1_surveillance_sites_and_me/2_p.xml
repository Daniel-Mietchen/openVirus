<p>We recruited a physician in each of the six hospitals from the existing staff to oversee the surveillance activities. A field assistant from icddr,b in each hospital assisted the surveillance physicians to collect patient information and blood specimens, and to store and transport samples to the laboratory in Dhaka. Every weekday morning, the surveillance physicians visited the obstetrics and gynaecology wards and the adult medicine wards of the hospitals and reviewed admission records from the previous day to determine if any patients aged ≥14 years met the case definition of acute jaundice. Due to resource constraints, we were unable to conduct surveillance in all wards in each hospital; therefore we restricted enrolment to adult medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology wards (where patients aged &gt; 14 years are admitted) as children have been reported to have less severe presentations of HEV infection [

Acute jaundice was defined as new onset of either yellow eyes or skin for less than 3 months, and continuing on the day of admission. The field assistants also visited the intensive care unit (ICU) every weekday to ensure that no acute jaundice cases were overlooked. If anyone met the case definition of acute jaundice, the surveillance physicians recorded enrolled patients’ illness history and relevant clinical information (

The surveillance physicians also collected a 5 ml blood specimen for laboratory testing.
