<p>We sent a subset of samples (collected between December 2014 and December 2016) to the Division of Viral Hepatitis Laboratory of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, USA to test for HEV RNA. All samples from patients with onset within three weeks of the blood draw were selected for RNA testing. For other patients, a random sample of 20% of anti-HEV IgM positive samples, 20% of anti-HEV IgG positive samples, 20% of samples negative for both IgM and IgG were chosen to test for HEV RNA. Serum samples were tested for HEV RNA using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, capable of detecting HEV genotypes 1â€“3 with a limit of detection of 25 IU/ml, targeting a 69-bp fragment of open reading frame (ORF) 3 of HEV genome [
