<p>On the same day of sample collection, the field assistants centrifuged the blood specimen and prepared three aliquots of sera. One aliquot containing about 400μl of serum was sent to the hospital laboratory the same day of sample collection to test for bilirubin and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase to assess liver function. Two aliquots of serum were stored at the surveillance hospitals in a liquid nitrogen dry shipper and transported to the laboratory of IEDCR in Dhaka every two weeks. The samples were kept in a freezer at IEDCR at -80°C until they were tested. The samples were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies to HEV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits manufactured by Wantai, China (Beijing Wantai Biologic Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Acute HEV infection was defined as a positive test result for anti-HEV IgM antibodies. We also tested all samples for hepatitis A virus IgM antibodies (anti-HAV IgM) (a marker of HAV infection) and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) (a marker of acute or chronic HBV infection). The samples that were positive for HBsAg were also tested for hepatitis B virus core IgM antibodies (anti-HBc IgM; a marker of acute HBV infection). Chronic HBV infection was defined as a positive test result for HBsAg but negative test result for anti-HBc IgM. HBsAg negative samples are generally negative for anti-HBc IgM [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007586.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], therefore, only the HBsAg positive samples were tested for anti-HBc IgM. ELISA test kits manufactured by DiaSorin, Italy were used for testing anti-HAV IgM, HBsAg and anti-HBc IgM.
