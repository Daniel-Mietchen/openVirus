<p>We calculated the prevalence of acute HEV infection among patients with acute jaundice in each surveillance hospital and overall. Seroprevalence of acute hepatitis E was also calculated by patientsâ€™ demographic characteristics and rural-urban area of residence. We compared the signs and symptoms during illness, pregnancy complications, pregnancy outcome and case fatality between acute jaundice patients with and without evidence of acute HEV infection. We examined potential risk factors of death among patients with acute hepatitis E including co-infection with other hepatitis viruses (HAV, HBV). Comparison between categorical variables was performed using the chi-squared test or Fisher exact test where appropriate and comparison between continuous variables (non-normal distribution) was performed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The 95% confidence interval for proportions was calculated by using the Wilson method for a binomial distribution [

We also calculated the proportion of patients positive for anti-HEV IgM and anti-HEV IgG by duration of illness at the time of admission to hospital. The onset of illness was defined as the date when any sign and symptom developed, including experiencing yellow eyes or skin or nausea/vomiting, or also fever, anorexia, abdominal pain, melaena, or unconsciousness. Analyses were conducted in Stata 14 (StataCorp).
