<p>Hepatitis E patients were more likely to be more educated, reside in urban areas and from a high-income group than HEV negative acute jaundice patients. Higher HEV infection rates among educated and high-income group patients might be associated with higher exposure to contaminated drinking water due to their greater involvement in jobs outside the home as reported in previous studies [

Higher HEV infection among patients who resided in urban areas might be related to higher possibility of fecal contamination of drinking water sources in urban settings. In large cities in Bangladesh, municipal water pipes are commonly exposed to sewerage lines which may lead to fecal contamination of drinking water [
