<p>This study provides a reliable estimate of the prevalence of HEV infection among hospitalized patients with acute jaundice in a hepatitis E endemic country by enrolling patients admitted from a wide geographic area through systematic surveillance over a two and a half year period. It confirms that hepatitis E is the leading cause of acute jaundice in Bangladesh. We identified a high prevalence of hepatitis E among patients with acute jaundice in all of the hospitals included in the study and throughout the multiple ecological zones in Bangladesh. Hepatitis E is therefore a considerable public health problem in Bangladesh. Considering the high burden of HEV among hospitalized patients with acute jaundice, Bangladesh could consider to take control measures to reduce this risk including improvements in water quality, sanitation and hygiene practices and the introduction of hepatitis E vaccine in high-risk areas. An improved understanding of the burden of hepatitis E is required in other endemic countries to plan for effective global actions to prevent HEV infections including the introduction of hepatitis E vaccine.</p>
