However, an increase in the number of HEV IgM positive cases was reported from the Chittagong Medical College Hospital during Sep-Oct, 2016 and from the Barishal Medical College Hospital during Jun-Sep, 2017. The unusually high number of cases suggests that there might have been an outbreak in those months which was undetected in real-time, perhaps due to delays in laboratory testing. There were no reported hepatitis E outbreaks in Bangladesh during the surveillance period. A previous study conducted in a private laboratory in Dhaka identified small outbreaks of HEV infections throughout the year [
