<p>This study confirms that HEV is a major cause of acute jaundice, is often serious enough to require hospitalization in all regions in Bangladesh, occurs throughout the year, and is associated with considerable mortality, especially among pregnant women and those co-infected with other hepatitis viruses (HAV or HBV). Fifteen percent of HEV infected pregnant women had a miscarriage or stillbirth, and of the children who were born alive, 19% died, all within one week of birth. Three-quarters of the acute hepatitis E cases in hospitals were male, and HEV infection was higher among patients residing in urban areas than patients in rural areas (41% vs 32%).</p>
