<p>There are a number of limitations of our study. We observed a declining trend in HEV infection positivity by the duration of onset of illness at the time of hospitalization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007586.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Anti-HEV IgM antibody titres might have waned for patients who were admitted to hospital in the later stage of their illness [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007586.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]; this may lead to an underestimate the rate of HEV infection among acute jaundice patients. In our study, we used Wantai ELISA which is largely accepted as the most sensitive among the available commercial assays [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007586.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, the study conducted by Huang et al. observed that about 3% of acute hepatitis cases (defined as acute liver damage evidenced by a 2.5 fold upper limit of the normal level of alanine aminotransferase) were negative for anti-HEV IgM (using the Wantai kit) but had a 4-fold rise in anti-HEV IgG in their convalescent sera [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007586.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], which indicates an acute HEV infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007586.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007586.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Therefore, our results likely underestimate the true prevalence of acute hepatitis E due to the performance of the test kit. HEV infections are generally self-limiting and do not require hospitalization [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007586.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and the patients admitted in tertiary hospitals are severely ill; therefore, the findings in our study represent only the prevalence of hepatitis E among severely ill patients. Finally, in our study, the etiological agent of acute jaundice was unknown for about one-third of the patients, and the samples were not tested for hepatitis C virus.
