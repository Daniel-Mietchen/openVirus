<p>Although males and non-pregnant females who were HEV IgM negative were more likely to die than those with HEV infection, the case fatality in pregnancy was similar between both groups. Furthermore, the occurrence of stillbirths and miscarriages was also common in both HEV and non-HEV acute jaundice patients. However, the neonatal mortality among children born to mothers with HEV infection was significantly higher than the children born to mothers without HEV infection. The higher proportion of neonatal deaths among mother with HEV infection might be explained by the well-described risk of maternal to child transmission of HEV, or the frequency of pre-term delivery [
