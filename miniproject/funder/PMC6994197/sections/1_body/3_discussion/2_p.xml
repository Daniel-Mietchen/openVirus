<p>Previous estimates of hepatitis E prevalence among hospitalized acute jaundice patients in other endemic countries ranges from 10â€“70% [

The large variation of hepatitis E prevalence might be due to the small number of patients recruited, geographic location of hospitals, and the types of patients recruited. One study that recruited a large number of acute hepatitis patients (685 patients during four years) from the liver clinic of a tertiary hospital in India reported the prevalence of hepatitis E as 39% [
