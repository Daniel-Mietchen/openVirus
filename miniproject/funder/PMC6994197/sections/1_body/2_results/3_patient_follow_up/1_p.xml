<p>Of the 1,925 patients with acute jaundice, we followed up 1,765 (92%), and of them 302 (17%) died. Among those who died, 65 (22%) died during hospitalization and the remaining died after leaving hospital but within three months of hospital discharge. Patients with acute HEV infection were significantly less likely to die than the patients who were HEV negative [4.8% (95% CI: 3.2%-6.8%) vs. 23.3% (95% CI: 20.9%-25.8%);
