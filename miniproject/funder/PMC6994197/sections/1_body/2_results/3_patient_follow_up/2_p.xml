<p>Among the 192 enrolled pregnant women, we followed up 173 (90%) until the outcome of their pregnancy. Among the 66 mothers who were anti-HEV IgM positive, 53 (80%) had a live birth and among the 107 mothers who were anti-HEV IgM negative, 72 (67%) had a live birth (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007586.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Nineteen percent (10/53) of the live-born babies born to mothers with acute HEV infection died compared to 7% (5/72) of babies born to women without HEV infection (p = 0.038). The median age at death of the babies who were born to HEV infected mothers was two days (IQR: 1–3 days; all within one week) and was five days (IQR: 2–8 days) for those born to HEV uninfected mothers (p = 0.207). Of the 62 HEV infected mothers who were alive until the delivery, 9 (15%) had a miscarriage/abortion or stillbirth.
