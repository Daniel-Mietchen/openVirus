<p>Reviewer #1: This is an important paper which well describes the burden of HEV among severe jaundice cases seeking hospital care in Bangladesh. While the lack of quality burden of disease data is an important reason why there is not clear and strong guidance regarding use of the HEV vaccine, it is not the only limitation. There is insufficient experience with the vaccine in high risk populations , like pregnant women or those in humanitarian emergency settings or other areas (like Bangladesh) where genotype 1 and fecal-oral transmission is the common route. </p>
