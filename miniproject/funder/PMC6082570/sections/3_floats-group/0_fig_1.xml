  <p>(A) Interaction between LsST6 and the outer capsid or nucleocapsid protein of different viruses detected using an 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> yeast two-hybrid assay. Yeast strain NMY51 was cotransformed with LsST6 and the respective viral proteins. After 10
   <sup>−1</sup> to 10
   <sup>−4</sup> times dilution, the yeast cells were plated onto DDO (SD-trp-leu) and QDO (SD-trp-leu-his-ade-20 mM 3-AT) medium plates, respectively. Clones grown on DDO were selected for β-galactosidase activity assay. Large T + P53 was used as the positive control; Large T + LsST6 served as the negative control. (B) Confirmation of the interaction by 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Sf9 cells were cotransfected with the respective recombinant bacmids (LsST6 fused with His-tag and viral proteins linked with Myc-tag) for protein expression. After 72 h, cells were harvested, lysed in lysis buffer, then incubated with anti-Myc antibody and protein A/G plus agarose beads for IP. The anti-Myc antibody or anti-His antibody was used for western blots.
