  <title>RNAi knockdown of 
   <italic>LsST6</italic> had no effect on virus titre and transmission efficiency in viruliferous planthoppers.
  </title>
  <p>(A) 
   <italic>LsST6</italic> RNA expression was inhibited by injection with dsLsST6. Viruliferous insects were fed on health rice seedlings and collected at 2, 4 and 8 days after the dsRNA injection, then RNA levels quantified by RT-qPCR. (B-C) RSV titre in viruliferous insects after injection. RSV RNA levels were quantified by (B) RT-qPCR and (C) DIG-northern blots. (D) Transmission efficiency of virus to rice seedlings by viruliferous insects after injection with dsLsST6. (A-D) Mean ± SEM of three independent experiments (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, one-way ANOVA, LSD test). (E) Localization of LsST6 and RSV in midgut epithelial cells after injection with dsLsST6. Excised midguts at 2, 4 and 8 days were incubated with anti-LsST6 (green) and anti-RSV (red) antibodies and observed with LSCM. Scale bars, 50 μm.
