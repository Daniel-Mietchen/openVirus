  <title>RSV particles successfully invaded Sf9 cells that expressed the heterologous gene 
   <italic>LsST6</italic>.
  </title>
  <p>(A) RSV particle invasion of Sf9 cells was mediated by binding with LsST6. RSV particles were added to Sf9 cells, which had been transfected by recombinant bacmid plasmid of LsST6 at 48 h. After 7 h, 15 h and 20 h incubation with RSV particles, Sf9 cells were treated with anti-LsST6 labeled with Dylight 488 (green) and anti-RSV labeled with Dylight 549 (red) and observed with LSCM. Scale bars, 10 μm. (B-D) The accumulation level of RSV particles increased when LsST6 was expressed in Sf9 cells. Total RNA was extracted from Sf9 cells at 7, 15 and 20 h after adding virus particles and then probed by DIG-northern blot using specific probes (B) and by RT-qPCR (C and D) to analyse the levels of LsST6 and RSV RNA. The mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene ECD were used as an internal control, and mRNA for LsST6, and RNA for RSV level of LsST6 and RSV at 7 h was set to 1. (B–D) Mean ± SEM of three independent experiments (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, one-way ANOVA, LSD test).
