  <title>LsST6 affected the localization of interacting viral proteins in Sf9 cells.</title>
  <p>(A) Localization of LsST6 and outer capsid or nucleocapsid protein of different viruses in Sf9 cells. The recombinant bacmids (LsST6 and viral proteins) were individually used to transfect Sf9 cells, then observed with LSCM. (B) Colocalization of LsST6 and outer capsid or nucleocapsid protein of different viruses in Sf9 cells. LsST6 and the respective viral proteins were coexpressed in Sf9 cells and observed with LSCM 72 h after transfection. LsST6 was labeled with Dylight 488 (green); viral proteins were labeled with Dylight 549 (red). Cell nucleus was stained with DAPI (blue). Noninfected Sf9 cells served as the negative control. Scale bars, 10 Î¼m.</p>
