  <title>LsST6 is involved in rice stripe virus invasion of the midgut epithelial cells of

  <p>(A) LsST6 expression in different tissues. Total RNA was extracted from the salivary gland, gut, hemolymph and ovary for assay by RT-qPCR. The whole insect body served as the control. Means ± SEM of three independent experiments are shown (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; one-way ANOVA, least significant difference [LSD] test). WB: whole body; SG: salivary glands; Gu: gut; He: hemolymph; Ov: ovary. (B) Localization of LsST6 in midgut epithelial cells. Excised midgut was incubated with anti-LsST6 antibody labeled with Dylight 488 (green) and observed with LSCM. Dylight 633 phalloidin was used to label actin (blue) of midgut epithelial cells. Scale bars, 50 μm. (C-E) Colocalization of LsST6 and RSV on membrane of midgut epithelial cell during RSV invasion. Excised midguts were incubated with anti-LsST6 labeled with Dylight 488 (green) and anti-RSV labeled with Dylight 549 (red) at 2 days (C), 4 days (D) and 8 days (E) after a 2-day access acquisition period (AAP), then observed with CLSM. Scale bars, 50 μm.
