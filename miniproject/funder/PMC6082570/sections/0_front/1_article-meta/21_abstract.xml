 <p>Sap/blood-feeding arthropods are major vectors of viruses that infect plants and vertebrates. Studies on the insect midgut, the first barrier for virus transmission, and its interactions with viruses and parasites are fundamental to understanding the transmission mechanism in vector insects and the epidemics caused by the vectored pathogen. Some putative receptors in arthropods have been discovered by 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> protein interactions, but 
  <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence is still lacking. Here, we found that the specific interaction between viral nucleocapsid protein and vector sugar transporter 6 of 
  <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic> (LsST6) determines whether the virus can invade midgut epithelial cells or not. These results provide direct evidence that LsST6 is an essential and key factor in crossing the midgut infection barrier for viruses, especially for RSV. This vector protein may be a promising target for blocking transmission of diverse plant viruses. Our discovery has important implications for better understanding the interaction among host–virus–insect vector and disease epidemics caused by plant and animal arboviruses.
