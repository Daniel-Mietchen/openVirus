<p>Previous studies showed that 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cannot be infected by eastern equine encephalomyelitis virus after ingesting viruliferous blood; however, it can transmit this virus after a virus suspension is directly injected into the insectâ€™s abdomen [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Many plant viruses can also be transmitted by an insect that is not a natural host after the virus is injected into the hemocoel of the insect [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], thus bypassing the midgut infection barrier, the first major barrier that viruses encounter and an important factor limiting virus transmission [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To overcome the midgut barrier, viruses have evolved different strategies. The entry of rice dwarf virus into cultured cells of its vector insect and of tomato yellow leaf curl virus midgut in its vector 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>, is mediated by clathrin-dependent endocytosis [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], whereas southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus (SRBSDV) induces the formation of tubules as a vehicle for viral spread in infected epithelial cells of 
 <italic>Sogatella furcifera</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].
