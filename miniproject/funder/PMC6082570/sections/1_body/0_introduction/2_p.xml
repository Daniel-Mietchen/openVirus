<p>Plant viruses transmitted in a persistent propagative manner and animal arboviruses follow a similar circulative route within their insect vectors. After they are acquired from plant sap or blood ingested by the insect, the virions must first cross the cell membrane of the midgut epithelial cells where the viral particles multiply [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During the circulative process, arboviruses must overcome multiple barriers, including the infection and dissemination barriers of the midgut, salivary gland escape barrier, and transovarial barrier [
