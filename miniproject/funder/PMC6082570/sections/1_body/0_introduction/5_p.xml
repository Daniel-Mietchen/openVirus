<p>The genome of RSV consists of four single-stranded RNAs (RNA1-4), which can encode at least seven proteins including the major nucleocapsid protein (NP) encoded by the ORF at the 5â€² half of the viral complementary RNA3 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. NP is considered the key viral component for specifically interacting with the vector components and may play an important role in persistent transmission process. In previous studies, 66 proteins (including LsST6) were identified as being able to interact with the NP of RSV. Among these proteins, we chose several proteins according to molecular function and biological pathway to further investigate their function in virus transmission. CPR1 was demonstrated to stabilize the viral particles in the hemolymph [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, the proteins involved in the ability of RSV to overcome the midgut infection barrier were not identified. Because the sugar transporter Glut1 of human acts as a receptor for human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) infection [
