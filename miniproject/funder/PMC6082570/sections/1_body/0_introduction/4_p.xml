<p>The small brown planthopper, 
 <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic> (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), is an important vector because it transmits numerous viruses that cause serious diseases of staple crops such as rice stripe virus (RSV), rice black-streaked dwarf virus, maize rough dwarf virus, northern cereal mosaic virus and barley yellow striate mosaic virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In most experiments when feeding on RSV-infected plants, less than 30% of the insects acquire the virus [
