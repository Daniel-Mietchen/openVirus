<p>Many viruses persistently transmitted by arthropods cause serious diseases in plants, animals and humans. More than 76% of plant viruses and 40% of mammalian viruses are transmitted to the hosts by specific arthropods, mainly planthoppers, aphids, mosquitoes, and ticks [

Understanding the virus–insect vector interaction and transmission mechanisms will provide important information on the epidemics of the diseases caused by plant and animal arboviruses and lead to the development of better control strategies.
