<p>Sf9 cells were transfected using a recombinant baculovirus that produces LsST6 or different viral proteins. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) revealed that LsST6 (green) was mainly localized in the cell membrane, whereas viral proteins (red) localized in the cytoplasm of Sf9 cells (

Interestingly, RSV NP and p10 of RBSDV and SRBSDV moved from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane and colocalized with LsST6, while RGSV NP remained in the cytoplasm, separated from LsST6 when Sf9 cells coexpressed the respective viral protein and LsST6 (
