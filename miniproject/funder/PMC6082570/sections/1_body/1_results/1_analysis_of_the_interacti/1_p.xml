 <italic>striatellus</italic> using RT-PCR and 5â€™RACE, contained a 1470-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a predicted 489-amino-acid (aa) protein, which had 85.6% identity with sugar transporter NlST6 in the brown planthopper (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1007201.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). LsST6 belongs to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of membrane transport proteins because it has two symmetrical six-TMS (transmembrane spanner) units within a single polypeptide chain and a GRK domain conserved between TM2 and TM3 (
