<p>A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay based on split ubiquitin was used to verify whether LsST6 interacts 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> with the NP of RSV and rice grassy stunt virus (RGSV) or the p10 of RBSDV and SRBSDV. In nature, 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>striatellus</italic> can acquire RSV, RBSDV and SRBSDV, but not RGSV. The Y2H results showed that the yeast cells cotransformed with LsST6 and RSV NP, RBSDV p10 or SRBSDV p10, respectively, grew on the selective plates, but those with RGSV NP did not (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Further, we exploited the cells of 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> 9 (Sf9) to coexpress LsST6 and the respective viral proteins for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP). LsST6 was labeled with a His tag and viral proteins with Myc tags at their C termini. The result showed that the anti-Myc antibody coimmunoprecipitated LsST6 that was coexpressed with RSV NP, RBSDV p10 or SRBSDV p10 in Sf9 cells, but not with RGSV NP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). All these results demonstrated that LsST6 only interacted with the proteins encoded by viruses that can be acquired by 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>striatellus</italic>.
