<p>When dsRNA of LsST6 (dsLsST6) was injected into third-instar nymphs, LsST6 mRNA level in the midgut had declined by 61% and 87% at 1 d and 2 d compared with the control (insects injected with dsGFP). Subsequently, LsST6 mRNA level remained 20â€“40% lower than in the control group injected with dsGFP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). We then allowed third-instar nymphs that had been injected with dsLsST6 or dsGFP to feed on RSV-infected plants for a 2-d AAP, then quantified RSV and LsST6 mRNA levels in treated insects after different times using RT-qPCR and northern blots. The RSV mRNA level in insects injected with dsLsST6 was 22% to 35% of that in SBPH injected with dsGFP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g007">Fig 7C</xref>), indicating significant interference with LsST6 expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). The northern blot also showed that the quantity of RSV RNA was evidently lower than in the group injected with dsGFP after 4 and 8 d (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). In addition, viral acquisition and transmission by dsLsST6-injected SBPHs decreased by nearly 80% compared with those injected with dsGFP (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrated that RSV initial infection of the midgut epithelial cells was inhibited when
