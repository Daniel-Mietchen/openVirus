<p>We then quantified the mRNA level for RSV and LsST6 at various times using northern blots and RT-qPCR. The RSV mRNA level was obviously higher at 20 h than at 7 h when LsST6 was expressed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The RT-qPCR data also supported the northern blot results: at 15 h and 20 h, the level of viral RNA was 1.5 and 3.5 times higher, respectively, than at 7 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g005">Fig 5D</xref>), whereas the level of LsST6 mRNA was approximately 1.2 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, at 15 h and 20 h (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). That viral particles passed though the cell membrane, mediated by LsST6, revealed that LsST6 played a critical role in RSV entry Sf9 cells.
