<p>RSV particles were added to a liquid culture of Sf9 cells that expressed the heterologous gene 
 <italic>LsST6</italic>; by 7 h, they had colocalized with LsST6 on the cell membrane of Sf9 cells. Few viral fluorescence signals were found in the cytoplasm by 15 h, but more signals were detected in the cytoplasm by 20 h (
