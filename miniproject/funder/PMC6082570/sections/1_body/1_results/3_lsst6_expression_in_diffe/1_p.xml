<p>The salivary gland, gut, hemolymph and ovary were excised separately from adult insects, then total RNA was extracted from individual tissues to quantify LsST6 by RT-qPCR. The results showed that LsST6 had the highest expression in gut tissues, followed by the hemolymph, salivary glands and ovary (
