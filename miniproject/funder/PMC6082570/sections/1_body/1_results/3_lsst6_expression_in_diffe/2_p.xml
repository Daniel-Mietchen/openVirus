<p>The distribution of RSV particles in the alimentary canal over time was also visualized by LSCM using anti-RSV antibody labeled with Dylight 549 (red). At 2 d after a 2-d acquisition access period (AAP), a few RSV particles were observed in several epithelial cells of the midgut. By 4 d after the AAP, RSV particles had replicated and spread to the neighboring epithelial cells, and by 8 d after the AAP, RSV particles were observed in the entire alimentary canal (

At 4 d and 8 d after the AAP, viral particles were still colocalized with LsST6 in the cell membrane of the epithelial cells, and some particles had already invaded the cytoplasm, but the fluorescent signals indicative of the viral titre were stronger at 8 d (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007201.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). When we used immunoelectron microscopy to examine the virus-infected midgut epithelium, RSV particles also colocalized with LsST6 on the microvilli of cell membranes and cytoplasm (
