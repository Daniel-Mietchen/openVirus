<p>The insect midgut consists mainly of a single layer of epithelial cells, with extensive microvilli on the lumen side and a porous basal lamina on the hemocoel side [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The midgut absorbs the nutrients necessary for insect survival and provides an environment for the development and multiplication of viruses and parasites [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The midgut epithelial cells have been identified as the initial infection site and the first barrier to virus invasion [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Our results on the distribution of RSV particles in the alimentary canal over time also demonstrated that the midgut epithelial cells of

 <italic>striatellus</italic> served as the initial infection site of RSV. After successful invasion of the midgut, RSV began its replication process, then spread into neighboring cells.
