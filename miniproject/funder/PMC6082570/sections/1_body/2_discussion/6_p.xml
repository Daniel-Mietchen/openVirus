<p>In conclusion, our results provide direct evidence that LsST6 is essential for RSV invasion of the midgut epithelial cells in its insect vector. The fact that LsST6 can also interact and colocalize with the outer capsid or NP of other viruses transmitted by 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>striatellus</italic> suggests that numerous arboviruses might use a similar vector protein to invade the midgut epithelium of the insect vector. This key vector protein could be used as a target for blocking virus transmission and lead to a new strategy to control outbreaks of diseases caused by arboviruses.
