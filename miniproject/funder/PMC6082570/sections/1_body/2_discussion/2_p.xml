<p>Most viruses invade insect epithelial cells via specific interaction between the structural proteins of the virus and the cell surface receptor complexes in vectors, similar to their infection of host cells [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and putative surface receptors including glycans and glycoconjugates for flaviruses have been found in host and insect cells [
