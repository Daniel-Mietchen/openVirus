<p>Interestingly, we found that LsST6 not only interacted with the outer capsid of RBSDV and SRBSDV, but also colocalized with each in the cell membrane of Sf9 cells, but it did not colocalize with NP of RGSV. Because 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>striatellus</italic> can transmit both RSV and RBSDV but not RGSV, we consider that the two transmitted viruses may also require LsST6 to mediate their entry into midgut epithelial cells. Although the planthopper cannot transmit SRBSDV efficiently, previous evidence has shown that this virus does invade midgut tissues, but it does not spread into the hemolymph or other organs of SBPH [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. SRBSDV cannot break through the release barrier of the midgut because it cannot replicate enough to reach the threshold required for further spread, and/or the siRNA antiviral pathway has a direct role in controlling viral dissemination from the midgut [

 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. RGSV cannot invade the midgut epithelium of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>striatellus</italic>, because LsST6 did not interact or colocalize with the NP of RGSV. Therefore, LsST6 might specifically mediate initial infection by the numerous viruses that are transmitted by 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>striatellus</italic>. Based on all the data obtained, we propose a model by which RSV overcomes the midgut infection barrier in vector planthopper. After entering the alimentary canal of the vector insect and arriving in the midgut, intact RSV particles can bind to the midgut epithelial cells, where the NP of RSV interacts specifically with sugar transporter 6 on the cell membrane and is transported into the epithelial cells, where it replicates and finally disseminates to other parts of the vector (
