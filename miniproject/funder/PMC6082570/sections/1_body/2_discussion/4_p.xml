<p>Our previous bioinformatic analysis revealed that LsST6 has 85% similarity with NlST6, a facilitative glucose/fructose transporter in brown planthoppers (
 <italic>N</italic>. 
 <italic>lugen</italic>) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. They both belong to the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters, which are ubiquitous among organisms and enable the import and export of essential nutrients and ions (not just sugars), the excretion of metabolic end products and deleterious substances and communication of the cells with the environment [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Some members of the MFS are also exploited by viruses to invade host cells. Glut1, a receptor for HTLV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], was recently found to mediate glucose transport, which regulates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in human T cell lines [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Glut1 of shrimp is thought to be a putative cell surface receptor for white spot syndrome virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor (FLVCR), another member of the MFS, is considered to be the cell surface receptor for feline leukemia virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. HTLV and HIV infection of host cells are all regulated by Glut1-mediated glucose metabolism, via an increase in 
 <italic>Glut1</italic> expression and to a change in the conformation of the protein [
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1007201.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. These studies thus provide a precedent for the involvement of another MFS member, LsST6, in virus invasion of midgut epithelial cells in 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>striatellus</italic> using a similar transport mechanism, rather than receptor-/clathrin-dependent endocytosis or membrane fusion and/or actin-based tubular structures to overcome the cell barriers. Knock down of the expression of 
 <italic>LsST6</italic> in healthy insects of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>striatellus</italic>, resulted in a decrease in virus acquisition after they fed on RSV-infected rice plants compared with the control insects with the functional gene. The viral titre in viruliferous insects that were similarly treated by injection with dsLsST6 had no significant changes. These results suggest that LsST6 mediates RSV entry into cells but is not involved in virus replication. On the basis of our results, we propose that LsST6 on the cell membrane of epithelial cells in the midgut mediates RSV invasion during facilitative transport of glucose/fructose from the phloem sap of rice plants across the cell membrane.
