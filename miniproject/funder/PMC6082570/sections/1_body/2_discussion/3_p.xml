<p>We thus used cellular and molecular biological techniques to advance our understanding of the interaction between virus and insect vector. Here, we found that LsST6 not only strongly interacts with RSV NP 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, but also alters the cellular location of NP and then colocalizes with it in the cell membrane of Sf9 cells. Moreover, LsST6 mediates the entry of RSV particles into Sf9 cells that expressed the heterologous gene 
 <italic>LsST6</italic>. In the vector insect body, RSV initially binds to the cell surface of midgut epithelial cells where it colocalizes with LsST6 in the cell membrane. When expression of 
 <italic>LsST6</italic> was knocked down in healthy insects injected with dsLsST6, viral titre and acquisition subsequently decreased significantly. Therefore, LsST6 plays an important role in facilitating virus invasion in both Sf9 model cells and the midgut epithelial cells of the vector insect,
