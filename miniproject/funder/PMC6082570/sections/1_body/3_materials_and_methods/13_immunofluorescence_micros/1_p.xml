<p>Sf9 cells previously fixed on cover slips were incubated in 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After being washed 3 times with PBS buffer, the samples were then incubated in osmotic buffer (2% [vol/vol] TritonX-100 in PBS) for 15–30 min at room temperature, then incubated with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (MAB) (1:400), anti-His MAB (1:400), anti-His rabbit polyclonal AB (1:400) or anti-RSV MAB (1:500) in PBS containing 3% (wt/vol) BSA at room temperature for 1 h and then with goat anti-mouse (1:400) or goat anti-rabbit (1:400) secondary antibody labeled with Dylight 488 or Dylight 549 in PBS for 1 h at 37°C after extensive washing with PBS buffer. The nucleus was stained with 50 nM 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS at 37°C for 10 min. Midgut tissues excised from the planthoppers were fixed in 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde for 2 h at room temperature and incubated in osmotic buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Then the samples were incubated in anti-RSV MAB labeled with Dylight 549 (red) or anti-ST6 labeled with Dylight 488 (green) MAB for 1.5 h at room temperature. All samples were visualized with LSCM (Zeiss LSM880, GER), and the images saved in ZEN 2011 blue light.</p>
