<p>To confirm any interaction between LsST6 and RSV NP, RBSDV p10, SRBSDV p10 or RGSV NP, we used the DUALhunter starter kit, a yeast two-hybrid system based on the reconstitution of ubiquitin. A clone of yeast strain NMY51 was selected and incubated in 25 ml yeast peptone dextrose adenine agar (YPDA) at 30°C with shaking until the culture reached an OD
 <sub>546</sub> of 0.6–0.8. The culture was collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was suspended in 1.5 ml water. Then, 1.5 μg bait vector plasmid (pDHB1-NPs/-p10s) and 1.5 μg prey vector plasmid (pPR3-LsST6) were added to 100 μl culture resuspended in 300 μl PEG/ lithium acetate Master Mix (50% PEG, 1 M lithium acetate and 125 μl single-stranded carrier DNA) and incubated in a 42°C water bath for 45 min. Finally, the mixture was collected by centrifugation at 700 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and the pellet resuspended in 100 μl 0.9% NaCl (wt/vol), then plated onto selection plates of DDO (SD-trp-leu) and QDO (SD-trp-leu-his-ade) medium with 20 mM 3-aminotriazole (3-AT) and incubated for 3–4 days at 30°C. For distinguishing false-positive interactions, the clone grown on DDO was incubated on 1 ml liquid DDO overnight at 30°C with shaking until the culture reached an OD
 <sub>546</sub> of 0.5–0.8 to check for β-galactosidase activity. The culture was then collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was added to 100 μl of freshly prepared lysis mixture (9.95 ml of one-step lysis and assay reagent with 50 μl of dye stock solution) provided in the HTX High-throughput β-galactosidase kit with a brief vortex.
