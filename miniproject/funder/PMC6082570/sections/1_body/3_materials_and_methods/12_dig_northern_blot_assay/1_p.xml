<p>RNA probes for LsST6 and RSV detection were labeled with DIG using the DIG Northern Starter Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA extracted from SBPH or Sf9 cells was separated in 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel and then transferred to nylon membranes using a vacuum regulator (Bio-Rad, USA) for 3–4 h. The membranes were then incubated with the respective RNA probes for 16–20 h in a 65°C hybridization oven, incubated with anti-digoxigenin-AP for 30 min, then in CDP-Star solution for 5 min and imaged with the imageQuant LAS 4000 mini (GE, USA).</p>
