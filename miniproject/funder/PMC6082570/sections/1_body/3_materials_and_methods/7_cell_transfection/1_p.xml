<p>Sf9 cells were transfected using Cellfectin II according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells were added to each well of a 6-well culture dish for at least 30 min. Then 2 μg recombinant bacmid–plasmid DNA encoding LsST6, RSV NP, RBSDV p10, SRBSDV p10 or RGSV NP was mixed with 8 μl Cellfectin II and incubated for 20 min. Then each mixture was added to a well of the 6-well culture dish and incubated at 27°C for 5 h. The transfection mixture was then removed and replaced with growth medium. Transient expression was measured 72 h later using LSCM and western blot.
