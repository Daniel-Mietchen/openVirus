<p>cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using a FastQuant RT Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions at 4°C for 3 min, 42°C for 15 min, and 95°C for 3 min. The RT-qPCR was performed using a SuperRealPreMix Plus (SYBR Green) kit, a reaction volume of 20 μl (10 μl of PCR buffer, 0.6 μl of each primer [10 μM/μl], 3 μl of template cDNA, and 5.4 μl of DEPC H
 <sub>2</sub>O and 0.4 μl 50× ROX Reference Dye) and ABI-7500 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). The thermocyling program was 94°C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s and 60°C for 32 s. Fluorescence was measured at the end of every 60°C extension phase. Beta-actin of SBPHs or ecdysoneless (ECD) of Sf9 cells were used for normalization as housekeeping genes in respective experiments. RT-qPCR data were analysed using the Livak method (2
 <sup>−ΔΔCt</sup>) [
