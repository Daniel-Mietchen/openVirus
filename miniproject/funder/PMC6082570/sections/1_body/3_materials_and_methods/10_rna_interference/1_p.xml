<p>A partial sequence of LsST6 and GFP was amplified using specifically designed primers as templates to synthesize dsRNA using the protocol for the T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi System. Approximately 400 third-instar and nonviruliferous nymphs of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>striatellus</italic> were injected with 23 nl dsLsST6 (2.5 μg/μl) or GFP (2.5 μg/μl) using an Auto-Nanoliter Injector (Drummond, USA) and then allowed to feed on the RSV-infected rice plant for a 2-day acquisition access period (AAP). At 2, 4 and 8 days after the AAP, RNA was extracted from 50 insects to quantify the LsST6 and RSV mRNA levels by RT-qPCR and DIG-northern blot, and the midgut tissues were excised from 50 insects for immunofluorescence assay. The remaining insects were tested for RSV by RT-PCR with RSV-specific primers. To identify the influence of injection on RSV titre and transmission in insects, we injected 400 third-instar and viruliferous nymphs with 23 nl dsLsST6 (2.5 μg/μl) or dsGFP (2.5 μg/μl) and then transferred them to healthy rice seedlings. Fifty insects were collected for RNA extraction and detection at 2, 4 and 8 days after injection. One hundred insects were transferred to healthy seedlings (1/seedling) for a 10 h inoculation access period, and the seedlings were then grown in a greenhouse for 3 weeks. The infection status of each seedling was assessed by RT-PCR using specific primers for RSV NP. Midguts of the remaining insects were excised for immunofluorescence assay. RT-qPCR and northern blot were used to quantify any changes in RNA levels for RSV and LsST6, and LSCM was used to visualize RSV particles in the excised midgut of 
 <italic>L</italic>. 
 <italic>striatellus</italic>. Each set of experiments was repeated three times.
