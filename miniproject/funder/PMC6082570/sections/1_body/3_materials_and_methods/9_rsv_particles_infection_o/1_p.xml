<p>RSV particles (1.5 μg/μl) were added to the Sf9 cells transfected by recombinant bacmids LsST6 or empty bacmids at 48 h, then the sf9 cells were rinsed with PBS buffer 3 times and collected at 7, 15 and 20 h after RSV particles were added to the culture medium. To avoid the influence of residual inoculum, the cells are collected by centrifugation to remove the inoculum. Then they were washed with double-distilled water for 3 times to avoid residual inoculum, finally they were prepared for RNA extraction. The relative quantity of RSV particles RNA was determined using RT-qPCR and DIG-northern blot.</p>
