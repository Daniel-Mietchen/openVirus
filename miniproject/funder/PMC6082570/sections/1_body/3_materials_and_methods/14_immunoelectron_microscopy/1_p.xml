<p>Dissected midguts or Sf9 cells were fixed for 2 h in 2% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde and 2% (wt/vol) osmium tetroxide in PBS, and after sequential dehydration in 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 100% and 100% alcohol, midguts or Sf9 cells were embedded in LR Gold Resin (cat. 62659, Sigma). Sections (70â€“90 nm) of the midguts or Sf9 cells were cut using an ultramicrotome (Leica, GER), then blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer. The sections were then incubated at room temperature with the antibodies in the following order: anti-RSV rabbit serum (1:300) for 1.5 h, 10-nm gold-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h, anti-LsST6 mouse serum (1:50) for 1.5 h and 5-nm gold-conjugated goat-anti-mouse IgG for 1 h with a wash in distilled water after each antibody incubation. They were then stained in 2% neutral uranyl acetate (w/v in distilled water) for 10 min. The sections were viewed with a transmission electron microscope at 80 kV accelerating voltage.</p>
