<p>Over 140 WIPO Re:Search collaborations have been established to date, two-thirds of which are drug R&amp;D projects [
 <xref rid="B23-tropicalmed-04-00053" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The preponderance of such projects reflects researchersâ€™ strong interest in repurposing pharmaceutical company compounds (primarily molecules developed for other indications) to efficiently accelerate drug development for diseases of poverty in which homologous molecular pathways are disrupted [
 <xref rid="B15-tropicalmed-04-00053" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition to compounds, many industry/non-profit collaborations involve sharing of corporate validation data, technology platforms, and product development expertise to enable project success. Companies voluntarily collaborate and share their assets to contribute to R&amp;D for diseases of poverty and save lives around the world. The WIPO Re:Search model provides companies with a wide array of opportunities to do so in a manner that maximizes company contribution to collaborations and resulting product impacts. For example, BVGH vets potential partners to confirm their mutual interest in and readiness for collaborations with multinational pharmaceutical companies; coordinates collaborator interactions across potential barriers of time zones and cultural differences; provides high-quality alliance management services; and, as needed, assists in addressing the unique challenges associated with conducting drug R&amp;D in low-resource settings.
