<p>BVGH manages WIPO Re:Search collaboration development activities as the Partnership Hub Administrator, and has developed and implemented a unique process to connect Members for mutually beneficial R&amp;D collaborations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="tropicalmed-04-00053-f001">Figure 1</xref>). BVGH identifies investigators and companies with critical capabilities, synergistic expertise, and complementary priorities and needs, and then introduces those parties to determine if there is reciprocal interest in collaborating. If so, BVGH facilitates communications between partners to align on milestones and agree on timelines and responsibilities. Once legal agreements are in place between the participating entities, BVGH provides alliance management support to help ensure successful outcomes. Depending on the specific needs of the collaboration, such support includes coordination of regular update calls, recruitment of additional partners with needed expertise, and leveraging of BVGH FundFinder to help collaborators identify relevant and high-value award opportunities. BVGH FundFinder—built in a sortable database and housed in a highly optimized format—is a unique, comprehensive source for funding opportunities, from over 245 public- and private-sector entities, relevant to diseases of poverty. The most recent issue of BVGH FundFinder included 269 open and upcoming funding opportunities totaling upwards of US$249 million.
