<p>Professor Fidelis Cho-Ngwa at the University of Buea, Cameroon, has developed whole-parasite screening systems, in vitro and in vivo, to identify compounds that selectively kill both mf and adult 
 <italic>Onchocerca</italic> spp. but not 
 <italic>L. loa</italic> mf. To build on previous work demonstrating the potency of heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 inhibitors against 
 <italic>Brugia pahangi</italic>, a microfilarial nematode similar to 
 <italic>O. volvulus</italic>, Professor Cho-Ngwa connected with Merck KGaA through BVGH. With a strong interest in fostering collaborations between the global North and South to address IP barriers and accelerate infectious disease R&amp;D, Merck KGaA shared 5600 compounds (including Hsp90 inhibitors and molecules targeting other critical parasitic pathways) with Professor Cho-Ngwa.
