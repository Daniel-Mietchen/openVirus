<p>Using BVGH FundFinder, BVGH identified the Wellcome Trust Pathfinder Award—which aims to stimulate partnerships between companies and academic scientists—as a potential funding source for this project. Professor Cho-Ngwa and Merck KGaA co-applied for the grant and received US$184,000, which supported initial screening of the compounds in Cameroon. A number of promising hits were identified. BVGH assisted the partners in identifying a medicinal chemistry expert to collaborate on hit-to-lead optimization, and they are co-preparing a second proposal to Wellcome Trust to support this work. As part of the ongoing partnership with Professor Cho-Ngwa, Merck KGaA will contribute expertise from departments such as Corporate Affairs, IP/Patents, Global Health, and Medicinal Chemistry to inform continued drug development [
