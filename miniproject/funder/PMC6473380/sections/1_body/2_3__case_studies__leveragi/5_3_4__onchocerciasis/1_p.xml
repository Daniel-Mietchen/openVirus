<p>Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, affects an estimated 21 million people across the world, over one million of whom experience vision loss [

 <xref rid="B6-tropicalmed-04-00053" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, while Mectizan is active against the first-stage larvae, or microfilariae (mf), of 
 <italic>Onchocerca volvulus</italic>, it has limited efficacy against the adult worms (macrofilariae) that produce the mf [
 <xref rid="B38-tropicalmed-04-00053" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Consequently, patients must take the medication at least annually to cover the full lifespan of the adult worm (up to 14 years) [

 <italic>Loa loa</italic>—which is co-endemic with
