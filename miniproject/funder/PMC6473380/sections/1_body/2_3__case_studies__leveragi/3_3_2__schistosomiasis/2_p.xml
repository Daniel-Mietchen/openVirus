<p>While at the University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Conor Caffrey validated 
 <italic>Schistosoma</italic> 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (
 <italic>Sm</italic>HMGR) as a novel drug target for schistosomiasis and demonstrated that commercial statin drugs, which inhibit the human homolog of 
 <italic>Sm</italic>HMGR to treat hypercholesterolemia, have schistosomicidal activity [

 <italic>Sm</italic>HMGR. BVGH introduced Dr. Caffrey to research scientists at MSD, a pharmaceutical company with a history of statin discovery research, who provided statin analogs for his screening campaign. To inform future hit-to-lead optimization and medicinal chemistry efforts, BVGH also connected the collaborators to experts who are elucidating the crystal structure of 
 <italic>Sm</italic>HMGR. Dr. Caffreyâ€™s efforts on this project have been facilitated with competitively awarded funds from the National Institutes of Health [
