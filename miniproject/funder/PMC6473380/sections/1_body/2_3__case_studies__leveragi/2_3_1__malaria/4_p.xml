Professor Alister Craig and his team at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) found that inhibition of the protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 pathway might reduce brain swelling and mortality. After unsuccessfully reaching out to other companies to obtain PAR1 inhibitors, Professor Craig contacted BVGH, which connected him with Eisai Co., Ltd. through WIPO Re:Search. Seeking new opportunities to reposition its compounds to fight tropical diseases and potentially benefit millions of people worldwide, Eisai shared its PAR1 inhibitors (originally developed to treat coronary diseases) with the LSTM researchers. Based on promising initial results in an in vitro model of brain barrier function, Professor Craig was awarded a US$53,000 United Kingdom Medical Research Council Confidence in Concept grant to test additional Eisai PAR1 inhibitors using more complex models [
