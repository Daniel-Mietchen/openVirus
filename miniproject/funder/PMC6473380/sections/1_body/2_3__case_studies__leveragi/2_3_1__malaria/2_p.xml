<p>As part of its longstanding commitment to drug discovery for diseases of the developing world, MSD was interested in finding collaborators for an R&amp;D program focused on evaluating its collection of aspartyl protease inhibitors for the treatment of malaria. With assistance from BVGH, MSD identified Professor Alan Cowman of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI) in Australia—who had previously validated the aspartyl protease plasmepsin V as an antimalarial drug target with essential roles in protein export and parasite survival in human erythrocytes [

 <xref rid="B26-tropicalmed-04-00053" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]—as the best partner. Due to MSD’s prior experience with WIPO Re:Search, the company requested that BVGH catalyze and foster the collaboration through the Consortium. Professor Cowman and his colleagues Dr. Justin Boddey and Dr. Brad Sleebs screened MSD’s compounds in their high-throughput assays and identified hits, for which MSD is contributing its drug-hunting expertise to optimize potency, pharmacokinetics, and selectivity. After some initial encouraging results, BVGH advised the team to seek external funding via BVGH FundFinder to further advance the work. A funding opportunity from the Wellcome Trust, aimed at stimulating partnerships between for-profit and non-profit entities, was identified. MSD and WEHI jointly submitted a proposal and received an initial grant in 2015 and a second award in 2018, totaling more than US$3.5 million [
