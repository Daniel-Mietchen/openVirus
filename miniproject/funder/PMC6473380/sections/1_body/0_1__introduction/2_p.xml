<p>The enormous burden of tropical diseases, as well as the imperative for collective action to eradicate or eliminate them, are evidenced by their inclusion in the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG Target 3.3 aims to end the malaria and NTD epidemics by 2030 [

Uniting to Combat NTDs—an international coalition of pharmaceutical companies, government entities, and academic and non-profit organizations—exemplifies the power of coordinated efforts by private- and public-sector stakeholders to scale up healthcare programs in endemic countries to battle tropical diseases. A key component of the initiative is drug donations from the pharmaceutical industry—totaling US$17 billion in commitments from 2012 to 2020—including Mectizan
 <sup>®</sup> (ivermectin) for lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis from MSD (a trademark of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA), praziquantel (PZQ) for schistosomiasis from Merck KGaA, and Zithromax
 <sup>®</sup> (azithromycin) for trachoma from Pfizer. Partnerships with governments, non-governmental organizations, and healthcare workers in the recipient countries help ensure that the donations reach those in greatest need. In 2016 alone, one-seventh of the world’s population, representing more than one billion people across the poorest countries, was treated for at least one NTD. The efforts of the Uniting to Combat NTDs coalition have also contributed to the elimination of lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and trachoma in multiple countries across the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Middle East [
