<p>To address these issues, innovative and efficient models are needed that leverage the respective strengths of the public and private sectors to translate novel ideas into new tropical disease drugs in a coordinated, cost-effective, and mutually beneficial manner. In this article we present the WIPO Re:Search consortium—a global initiative co-led by BIO Ventures for Global Health (BVGH) and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)—as one such innovative and impactful public-private partnership model. As illustrated by the case studies herein, WIPO Re:Search empowers high-quality researchers from academic/non-profit organizations and small companies (including scientists in low- and middle-income countries [LMICs]) to leapfrog their tropical disease drug R&amp;D programs by accessing pharmaceutical company resources that may not otherwise be available to them. The Consortium catalyzes cross-sector drug discovery and development across a broad array of tropical diseases, including conditions outside the current scope of product development partnerships (PDPs) such as Drugs for Neglected Diseases

WIPO Re:Search also stimulates drug R&amp;D focused on molecular entities that may fall outside of current PDP portfolios but that, given sufficient validation and interest, could potentially be incorporated into their pipelines. As such, WIPO Re:Search augments the important work of PDPs.
