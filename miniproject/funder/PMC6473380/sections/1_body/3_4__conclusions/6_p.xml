<p>The pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in accelerating the translation of basic research into product development for tropical diseases and other diseases of poverty, and yet many academic/non-profit researchers and small companies remain unaware of the partnership opportunities that are available to them through initiatives such as WIPO Re:Search. Scientists and companies interested in learning more about WIPO Re:Search membership or the Consortium in general are encouraged to email Cathyryne Manner (cmanner@bvgh.org) to schedule an introductory phone call to discuss their R&amp;D needs and potential partnership opportunities within the WIPO Re:Search network. </p>
