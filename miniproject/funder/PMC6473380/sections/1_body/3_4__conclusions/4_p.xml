 <bold>The critical role of IP in driving innovation.</bold> The WIPO Re:Search model focuses on the sharing of valuable IP—often from companies—to advance product R&amp;D. As such, the Consortium demonstrates to diverse stakeholders that IP, which is often construed as a barrier to innovation and product development (particularly for diseases of poverty), can in fact promote such efforts. WIPO’s position as the UN agency responsible for global IP policy adds credibility and power to this messaging.
