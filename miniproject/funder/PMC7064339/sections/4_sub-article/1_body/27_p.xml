<p>Previously, ε was modeled as a 0-1 scaler that modified the rate of antiviral acquisition (ρ), which is why it was fixed. However, your comments inspired us to re-structure the model to estimate the induced immune rate of antiviral acquisition (ρ), which is multiplied by the proportion of exposed cells in tissue culture, separately from the constitutive rate of antiviral acquisition (ε), such that – to answer your questions – (a) ε is now estimated under models assuming some degree of constitutive immunity (it is fixed at 0 for induced-only and absent immune models) and (b) yes, ε is a rate (though it was not previously). We find this a much simpler way to present the model, allowing for greater flexibility in parameter estimation and more accurate fits to the data.</p>
