<p>Agreed, and thank you for highlighting this potential point of controversy. Certainly, antiviral cells do have the capacity to regress to susceptible status (see Samuel and Knutson, 1982; Rasmussen and Farley, 1975; Radke et al., 1974), but after reconsideration of our assumptions and more intensive review of the literature, we agree with this reviewer critique that this is unlikely to occur on the 200 hour timescale of our tissue cultures, especially in such a limited spatial environment with live virus still present (and therefore IFN-inducing) in the tissue culture. As a result of this, we have fixed the value of 
 <italic>c</italic> at 0 in all model fits (and bifurcation analyses) in the newest version of the manuscript, such that the regeneration of susceptibles to maintain late stage epidemic transmission can now only occur as a result of susceptible cell births. This greatly simplifies our model and also produces more robust model fits to the data. We have maintained the term 
 <italic>c</italic> in our model equations because this antiviral regression phenomenon is relevant at the scale of the whole organism, and we wished to keep our derivations for R
 <sub>0</sub> generalizable.
