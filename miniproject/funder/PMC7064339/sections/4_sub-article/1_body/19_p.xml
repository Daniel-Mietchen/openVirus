<p>Thank you, and yes, we agree. In our newest version of the manuscript, we have refitted the mean field model to all individual replicates for each cell line-virus-MOI combination, rather than to the mean of replicates. We find our fits to be much improved and now consistent with our hypotheses.</p>
