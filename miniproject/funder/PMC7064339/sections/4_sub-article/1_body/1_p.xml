<p>Thank you for taking the time to decipher our paper, and we apologize for any unnecessary complexity and confusing organization and/or writing. As highlighted above, our new version of the manuscript presents a completely reworked version of the model and, correspondingly, a complete rewrite of the text. The main messages of our paper are threefold: (1) we find support for immune phenotypes suggested from the literature for each of the three cell lines, in particular showing a necessary effect of top-down immune response in describing data for the bat cell lines (especially the constitutively antiviral PaKiT01 cell line); (2) we find that more pronounced immune responses (either induced or constitutive) are correlated with higher cell-to-cell viral transmission rates (β), suggesting that bats’ robust antiviral immune phenotype could be driving the evolution of higher within-host viral replication rates likely to cause virulence upon emergence into hosts lacking bat immune capacities; and (3) IFN-induced antiviral cells promote the maintenance of persistent within-host infections by protecting live cell refugia against rapid viral infection and mortality in the initial epidemic takeoff such that live cells are maintained that can sustain transmission at later timepoints.</p>
