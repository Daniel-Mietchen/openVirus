<p>In our most recent version of the manuscript, in order to address the criticisms highlighted above, we chose to fit a unique natural mortality rate (μ) for each cell line, rather than fixing all μ at a constant and consistent value as done previously. In order to do this (as highlighted in the Figure 1—figure supplement 7) and discussed in the Materials and methods), we fixed the birth rate, 
 <italic>b,</italic> at.025, then fit a μ for each cell line to recover the statistical mean of the declining susceptible count of all control well trials for that cell line. The net effect of these birth-death fits is still cell loss in tissue culture over time but with some cell turnover taking place. We feel confident that cell turnover 
 <italic>did</italic> take place because we grew cells to 90% confluency prior to initiating the plaque assay, then watched them subsequently fill the plate when they could not be split at later timepoints. In including cell turnover, our analysis additionally maintains consistency with previous in vitromodeling of IFN dynamics in cell culture in the general literature (Howat et al., 2006).
