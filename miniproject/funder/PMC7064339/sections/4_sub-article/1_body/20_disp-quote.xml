 <p>8) The cell cultures are grown to 90% confluency, and are modeled as systems in which there is cell birth and natural death (birth rate about 4x the natural death rate). Readers are likely to be left with a number of questions that the authors should address more explicitly: Where does the birth rate parameter come from? Is this a realistic estimate reflective of the dynamics of the cell culture, or is it a deduction based on the requirement to sustain the infection dynamics (either endemic or oscillatory?). The Materials and methods suggest that it is what would be required to maintain sustainable live cell populations, but is this what actually happens in the culture during the infection? What sort of turnover does this result in, in the absence of infection? What is the justification for frequency over density dependent dynamics? At the heart of these questions is whether it is appropriate to think of these cell cultures as a sort of viral chemostat which could maintain steady state or oscillatory dynamics indefinitely, or whether the system would be better modeled as an infection process in a fixed non-reproducing host population. The latter view would substantially simplify the paper if such a perspective was justifiable.</p>
