<p>Fair point, and thank you for bringing up this issue. We do believe that our mean field model can be generalized to the level of the whole host organism, as a description of viral spread throughout a host’s tissue, which is why we have undertaken the broad bifurcation analysis, in addition to fitting our model to the in vitrodata. Figure 2 and 3, as well as the derivation for R
 <sub>0</sub> (as a threshold for tissue invasion) presented in our text are, thus, truly representative of within-host dynamics. Nonetheless, we appreciate your concerns and have scaled back our claims to highlight the terms ‘in vitro
 <italic>’</italic> or ‘bat cell culture’ where appropriate, including in the title.
