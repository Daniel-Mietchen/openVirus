<p>Thank you for bringing this up. We’ve added to our Viruses section in the Materials and methods portion of the manuscript to further elaborate on and explain why the viruses were selected, as well as extended our Introduction to these time series upon first presentation in the Results section. We included both rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV because we wanted to include a known constitutively antiviral cell line-virus combination (rVSV-MARV on PaKiT01 cells), over and above the constitutive expression of IFN-α in these cells.</p>
