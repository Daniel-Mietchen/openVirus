<p>Thanks for these valid and important insights and questions. We touched a bit on these questions in our responses to point #2 above, but we will elaborate further here. We did attempt to fit several versions of the model that incorporated only the natural mortality rate (fitted for each cell line) and the epidemic dynamics of each time series, with no birth rate included in the model. These versions of the model were unable to re-capture the extended time series witnessed in the rVSV-EBOV infections on PaKiT01 cell lines, using fitted mortality (μ) and incubation (σ) rates and a fixed, standard infection-induced mortality rate (α= 1/6). Thus, cell turnover was needed in order to recapture the data, or we would need to re-evaluate the infection-induced mortality parameter. In order to recapture our data, however, the duration of the infectious period this parameter would necessarily need to be extended to allow for cells to produce infectious virus for over a week without dying in order to recover the sustained 200 hour infectious time series witnessed in our data. This is very unlikely.</p>
