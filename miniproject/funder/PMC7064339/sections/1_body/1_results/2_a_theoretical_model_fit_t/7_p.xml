<p>Bifurcation analysis of our mean field model revealed that regions of no infection (pathogen extinction) were bounded at lower threshold (Branch point) values for β, below which the pathogen was unable to invade. We found no upper threshold to invasion for β under any circumstances (i.e. β high enough to drive pathogen-induced extinction), but high β values resulted in Hopf bifurcations, which delineate regions of parameter space characterized by limit cycles. Since limit cycles so closely approach zero, high βs recovered in this range would likely produce virus-induced epidemic extinctions under experimental conditions. Under more robust representations of immunity, with higher values for either or both induced (ρ) and constitutive (

 </inline-formula>) rates of antiviral acquisition, Hopf bifurcations occurred at increasingly higher values for β, meaning that persistent infections could establish at higher viral transmission rates (
