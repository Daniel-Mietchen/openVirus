<p>We defined 'induced immunity' as complete, modeling all cells as susceptible to viral invasion at disease-free equilibrium, with defenses induced subsequent to viral exposure through the term ρ. By contrast, we allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range of

 </inline-formula> &gt; 0, defining a 'constitutive' system as one containing 
 <italic>any</italic> antiviral cells at disease-free equilibrium. In fitting this model to tissue culture data, we independently estimated both ρ and

 </inline-formula> as well as the cell-to-cell transmission rate, β, for each cell-virus combination. Since the extent to which constitutively-expressed IFN-α is constitutively translated into functional protein is not yet known for bat hosts (

 </inline-formula>, the return rate of antiviral cells to susceptible status, at 0. The small spatial scale and short time course (max 200 hours) of our experiments likely prohibited any return of antiviral cells to susceptible status in our empirical system; nonetheless, we retained the term
