 </inline-formula> both contribute to this initial antiviral rate, induced and constitutive immune assumptions are capable of yielding equally rapid rates, depending on parameter fits. Indeed, under fully induced immune assumptions, the induced antiviral acquisition rate (ρ) estimated for rVSV-MARV infection on PaKiT01 cells was so high that the initial antiviral rate exceeded even that estimated under constitutive assumptions for this cell-virus combination (

In reality, we know that NPC1 receptor incompatibilities make PaKiT01 cell lines constitutively refractory to rVSV-MARV infection (Ng and Chandrab, 2018, Unpublished results) and that PaKiT01 cells also constitutively express the antiviral cytokine, IFN-α. Model fitting results suggest that this constitutive expression of IFN-α may act more as a rapidly inducible immune response following virus invasion than as a constitutive secretion of functional IFN-α protein. Nonetheless, as hypothesized, PaKiT01 cell lines were by far the most antiviral of any in our study—with initial antiviral rates estimated several orders of magnitude higher than any others in our study, under either induced or constitutive assumptions (

RoNi/7.1 cells displayed the second-most-pronounced signature of immunity, followed by Vero cells, for which the initial antiviral rate was essentially zero even under forced assumptions of induced or constitutive immunity (
