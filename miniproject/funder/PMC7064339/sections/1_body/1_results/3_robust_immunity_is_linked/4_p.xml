<p>Finally, rVSV-G and rVSV-EBOV trials on PaKiT01 cells were best fit by models assuming constitutive immunity, while rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 were matched equivalently by models assuming either induced or constitutive immunity—with induced models favored over constitutive in AIC comparisons because one fewer parameter was estimated (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). For all virus infections, PaKiT01 cell lines yielded β estimates a full order of magnitude higher than Vero or RoNi/7.1 cells, with each β balanced by an immune response (either ρ, or ρ combined with

 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). As in RoNi/7.1 cells, PaKiT01 parameter fits localized in the region corresponding to endemic equilibrium for the deterministic theoretical model. Because constitutive immune processes can actually prohibit initial pathogen invasion, constitutive immune fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cell lines consistently localized at or below the Branch point threshold for virus invasion (

 </inline-formula> traded off, with one parameter optimized at values approximating zero, such that the immune response was modeled as almost entirely induced or entirely constitutive (
 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). For RoNi/7.1 cells, even when constitutive immunity was allowed, the immune response was estimated as almost entirely induced, while for rVSV-G and rVSV-EBOV fits on PaKiT01 cells, the immune response optimized as almost entirely constitutive. For rVSV-MARV on PaKiT01 cells, however, estimation of ρ was high under all assumptions, such that any additional antiviral contributions from

  </math>
 </inline-formula> prohibited virus from invading at all. The induced immune model thus produced a more parsimonious recapitulation of these data because virus invasion was always permitted, then rapidly controlled.
