<p>As anticipated, the immune absent model (a simple target cell model) offered the best fit to IFN-deficient Vero cell infections (

Among Vero cell trials, infections with rVSV-G produced the highest Î² estimates, followed by infections with rVSV-EBOV and rVSV-MARV. Best fit parameter estimates on Vero cell lines localized in the region of parameter space corresponding to theoretical limit cycles, consistent with observed virus-induced epidemic extinctions in stochastic tissue cultures.
