<p>In contrast to Vero cells, the induced immunity model offered the best fit to all RoNi/7.1 data, consistent with reported patterns in the literature and our own validation by qPCR (

As in Vero cell trials, we estimated highest β values for rVSV-G infections on RoNi/7.1 cell lines but here recovered higher β estimates for rVSV-MARV than for rVSV-EBOV. This reversal was balanced by a higher estimated rate of acquisition to antiviral status (ρ) for rVSV-EBOV versus rVSV-MARV. In general, we observed that more rapid rates of antiviral acquisition (either induced, ρ, constitutive,

 </inline-formula>, or both) correlated with higher transmission rates (β). When offset by ρ, β values estimated for RoNi/7.1 infections maintained the same amplitude as those estimated for immune-absent Vero cell lines but caused gentler epidemics and reduced cellular mortality (
