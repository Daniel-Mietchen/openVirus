<p>Hoechst stain colors cellular DNA, and viral infection is thought to interfere with the clarity of the stain (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dembowski and DeLuca, 2015</xref>). As such, infection termination, cell fixation, and Hoechst staining enables generation of a rough time series of uninfectious live cells (i.e. susceptible + antiviral cells) to complement the images which produced time series of proportions infectious. Due to uncertainty over the exact epidemic state of Hoechst-stained cells (i.e. exposed but not yet infectious cells may still stain), we elected to fit our models only to the infectious time series derived from GFP-expressing images and used Hoechst stain images as a
