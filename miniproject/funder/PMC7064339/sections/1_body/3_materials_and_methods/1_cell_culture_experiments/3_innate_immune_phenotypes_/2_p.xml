<p>Specifically, we carried out multiple time series of infection of each cell line with each of the viruses described above, under mock infection conditions and at MOIs of 0.0001 and 0.001—with the exception of rVSV-MARV on PaKiT01 cell lines, for which infection was only performed at MOI = 0.0001 due to limited viral stocks and the extremely low infectivity of this virus on this cell line (thus requiring high viral loads for initial infection). All experiments were run in duplicate on 6-well plates, such that a typical plate for any of the three viruses had two control (mock) wells, two MOI = 0.0001 wells and two MOI = 0.001 wells, excepting PaKiT01 plates, which had two control and four MOI = 0.0001 wells at a given time. We justify this PaKiT01 exemption through the expectation that IFN-α expression is constitutive for these cells, and by the assumption that any expression exhibited at the lower MOI should also be present at the higher MOI.</p>
