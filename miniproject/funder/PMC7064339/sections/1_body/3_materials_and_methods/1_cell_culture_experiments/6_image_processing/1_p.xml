<p>Images recovered from the time series above were processed into binary (‘infectious’ vs. ‘non-infectious’ or, for Hoechst-stained images, ‘live’ vs. ‘dead’) form using the EBImage package (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Pau et al., 2010</xref>) in R version 3.6 for MacIntosh, after methods further detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>. Binary images were then further processed into time series of infectious or, for Hoechst-stained images, live cells using a series of cell counting scripts. Because of logistical constraints (i.e. many plates of simultaneously running infection trials and only one available imaging microscope), the time course of imaging across the duration of each trial was quite variable. As such, we fitted a series of statistical models to our processed image data to reconstruct reliable values of the infectious proportion of each well per hour for each distinct trial in all cell line–virus-MOI combinations (
