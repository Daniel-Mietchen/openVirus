<p>In contrast to antiviral acquisition rates, transitions involving the birth rate (
 <italic>b</italic>) and the transmission rate (β) occurred probabilistically based on each cell’s local environment. The birth rate, 
 <italic>b</italic>, was multiplied by the proportion of susceptible cells within a six-neighbor circumference of a focal dead cell, while β was multiplied by the proportion of infectious cells within a thirty-six neighbor vicinity of a focal susceptible cell, thus allowing viral transmission to extend beyond the immediate nearest-neighbor boundaries of an infectious cell. To compensate for higher thresholds to cellular persistence and virus invasion which occur under local spatial conditions (
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Webb et al., 2007</xref>), we increased the birth rate, 
 <italic>b,</italic> and the cell-to-cell transmission rate, β, respectively, to six and ten times the values used in the mean field model (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). We derived these increases based on the assumption that births took place exclusively based on pairwise nearest-neighbor interactions (the six immediately adjacent cells to a focal dead cell), while viral transmission was locally concentrated but included a small (7.5%) global contribution, representing the thirty-six cell surrounding vicinity of a focal susceptible. We justify these increases and derive their origins further in
