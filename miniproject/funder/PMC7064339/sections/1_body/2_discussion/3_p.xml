<p>Fitting of our model to 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data supported expected immune phenotypes for different bat cell lines as described in the literature. Simple target cell models that ignore the effects of immunity best recapitulated infectious time series derived from IFN-deficient Vero cells, while models assuming induced immune processes most accurately reproduced trials derived from RoNi/7.1 (
 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic>) cells, which possess a standard virus-induced IFN-response. In most cases, models assuming constitutive immune processes best recreated virus epidemics produced on PaKiT01 (
 <italic>Pteropus alecto</italic>) cells, which are known to constitutively express the antiviral cytokine, IFN-α (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Model support for induced immune assumptions in fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells suggests that the constitutive IFN-α expression characteristic of 
 <italic>P. alecto</italic> cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process than a perpetual, functional, antiviral defense. Results from mean field model fitting were additionally confirmed in spatially explicit stochastic simulations of each time series.
