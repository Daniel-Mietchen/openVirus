 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Ho et al., 1995</xref>), assumptions of simple target-cell depletion can often provide satisfactory approximations of viral dynamics, especially those reproduced in simple

Critically, our model fitting emphasizes the need for incorporation of top-down effects of immune control in order to accurately reproduce infectious time series derived from bat cell tissue cultures, especially those resulting from the robustly antiviral PaKiT01 
 <italic>P. alecto</italic> cell line. These findings indicate that enhanced IFN-mediated immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated within-host virus replication rates prior to cross-species emergence. We nonetheless acknowledge the limitations imposed by 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments in tissue culture, especially involving recombinant viruses and immortalized cell lines. Future work should extend these cell culture studies to include measurements of multiple state variables (i.e. antiviral cells) to enhance epidemiological inference.
