<p>The continued recurrence of Ebola epidemics across central Africa highlights the importance of understanding batsâ€™ roles as reservoirs for virulent zoonotic disease. The past decade has born witness to emerging consensus regarding the unique pathways by which bats resist and tolerate highly virulent infections (

Nonetheless, an understanding of the mechanisms by which bats support endemic pathogens at the population level, or promote the evolution of virulent pathogens at the individual level, remains elusive. Endemic maintenance of infection is a defining characteristic of a pathogen reservoir (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Haydon et al., 2002</xref>), and bats appear to merit such a title, supporting long-term persistence of highly transmissible viral infections in isolated island populations well below expected critical community sizes (

 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Peel et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Brook et al., 2019</xref>). We present general methods to study cross-scale viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral responses characteristic of bat immune processes. Viruses which evolve rapid replication rates under these robust antiviral defenses may pose the greatest hazard for cross-species pathogen emergence into spillover hosts with immune systems that differ from those unique to bats.
