  <title>(A) Raw proportion infectious from cell culture images.</title>
  <p>Dataset gives raw proportion of infectious cells and time elapsed for all trials of all cell line/virus/MOI combinations, derived from image processing of binary images. (B) Raw proportion uninfectious from cell culture images. Dataset gives raw proportion of uninfectious cells and time elapsed for all trials of all cell line/virus/MOI combinations, derived from image processing of binary Hoechst-stained images. (C) Statistical mean of infectious time series for all trials of each cell line/virus/MOI experiment, from GAM fitted model incorporating random effects by trial. Data were smoothed to yield the proportion infectious per hourly timestep for each trial, and mean field mechanistic models were fit to the smoothed mean of all compiled trials for each cell line/virus/MOI combination. (D) Statistical mean of uninfectious time series for all eighteen cell line/virus/MOI experiments, from generalized linear model fit to Hoechst stain data reported on tab B. Note that these means were not used in epidemic model fitting but natural mortality rates for each cell line were derived from fitting an infection-absent model to the trajectory of susceptible decline for control trials for each cell line, as shown in
