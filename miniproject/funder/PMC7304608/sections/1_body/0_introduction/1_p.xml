<p>With the emergence and reemergence of dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and Zika (ZIKV), arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are increasingly important public health challenges [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The first major DENV epidemics were reported in 1779 and 1780 in Africa, Asia, and North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. DENV is now the most prevalent and rapidly spreading of the arboviruses, with transmission occurring in 128 countries, thereby creating risk for almost 4 billion people [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. There are 390 million DENV infections (95% credible interval: 284–528 million) worldwide annually, including 96 million (95% CI: 67–136 million) clinical cases, 500,000 dengue hemorrhagic fever cases, and 22,000 deaths, mostly among children &lt;5 years of age [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. CHIKV was first reported in the Americas in 2013, causing 1.8 million suspected cases from 2014–2017 in 44 countries and territories [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. CHIKV may also cause prolonged arthritis, meningoencephalitis, nephritis, retinitis, uveitis, myelitis, cranial nerve palsies, and acute encephalopathy [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. First identified in Uganda in 1947, ZIKV expanded into the South Pacific and Americas with 48 countries reporting active ZIKV by 2017 and 86 by 2019 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. From 2015–2018, there were over 580,000 suspected and 220,000 confirmed ZIKV cases in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. ZIKV has also been linked to congenital microcephaly, Guillain-Barré syndrome, craniofacial disproportion, cerebral palsy, spasticity, hearing loss, brainstem dysfunctions, joint deformities, and developmental and inflammatory ocular diseases [

 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This study focused on Guatemala, a country where arboviruses are endemic. Large arbovirus outbreaks have occurred in Guatemala with nearly 40,000 DENV cases from 2014–2015 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], 57,000 CHIKV cases from 2014–2015 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and 4,000 suspected ZIKV cases and 1,000 confirmed cases from 2015–2017 [
 <xref rid="pone.0234399.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
