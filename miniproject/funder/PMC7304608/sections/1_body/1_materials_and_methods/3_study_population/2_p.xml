<p>At the hospital and health center, surveillance staff searched the emergency room records, inpatient logs, and ward registers to identify patients admitted or presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of acute febrile illnesses (AFI) or diarrhea. AFI was defined as self-reported fever that began within one week of the current illness, or documented oral or axillary fever of ≥38ºC at presentation or within 24 hours of admission to the hospital or health center. Patients with evidence of an obvious source of fever on physical examination (e.g., otitis media, septic arthritis, pyogenic soft tissue infection) determined by the examining healthcare provider were excluded. Diarrhea was defined as ≥3 loose or liquid stools in a 24-hour period with onset of illness within seven days before presenting to the hospital or health center. Patients with other diarrheal episodes in the week before the start of the current episode were excluded to avoid capturing illnesses due to chronic diarrhea.</p>
