<p>Exposures and covariates for cases and controls were first evaluated with descriptive statistics (means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequency distributions for categorical variables). T-tests and Chi-square tests were then used to assess differences between cases and controls for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. The Chi-square test for trend (extended Mantelâ€“Haenszel) was used to test linear trends in HAP scores between cases and controls.</p>
