<p>Covariates included year of admission (2011–2018), season (dry, rainy), age (continuous), sex (female, male), ethnic group (Ladino, Xinca, other), recruitment location (hospital, health center), number of people in the house (continuous), community elevation (continuous), and community population density (continuous). The ‘Ladino’ people are Central Americans with a mix of indigenous and Spanish descent. The ‘dry’ season was from November-May, whereas ‘rainy’ was from June-October. Geographical information system software (ArcGIS Pro 2.2.4 software; ESRI, Redlands, CA) was used to calculate average elevation (meters) and average population density (numbers of people per hectare) per community. Population densities were obtained from WorldPop 2015 [

PCA was used to create a SES index from 14 variables based on all cases and controls and included: presence of a refrigerator, computer, radio, washing machine, clothes dryer, car, television, telephone/cellphone, microwave; number of rooms in house; family monthly income; electricity; roof material; and floor material (

One component was developed and retained which accounted for 29% of the variability in the data. Other components explained little variability in the data. These variables were weighted against their eigenvector coefficients. The SES index was categorized into quintiles with scores ranging from 0 to 5 with a higher score indicating higher SES.
