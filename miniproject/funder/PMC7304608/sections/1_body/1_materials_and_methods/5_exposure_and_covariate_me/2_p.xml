<p>We used principal components analysis (PCA) to create a HAP exposure score from firewood cooking location in house, firewood stove type, and firewood cooking frequency based on all cases and controls (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0234399.s001">S1 Table</xref>). First, we assigned scores ranging from 0–3 based on HAP exposure levels: firewood cooking location (3: in the main house, 2: in a kitchen that is separated from the main house or in an informal structure without walls or roofs, 1: outside the house, 0: does not cook with firewood), type of stove used to cook with firewood (3: open hearth, 2: improved stove without chimney, 1: improved stove with chimney, 0: does not cook with firewood), and times per week cooking at home with firewood (3: ≥5, 2: 3–4, 1: 1–2, 0: does not cook with firewood). The first component included all three variables and accounted for 88% of the variability in the data, and these variables were then weighted against their eigenvector coefficients [
