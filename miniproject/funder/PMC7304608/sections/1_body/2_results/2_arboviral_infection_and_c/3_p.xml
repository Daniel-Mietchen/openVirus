<p>Even after adjustment, analyses showed associations between arboviral infections and the two highest level HAP exposure classifications (high HAP scores: AOR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.25–0.68; very high HAP scores: AOR: 0.12; 95% CI: 0.03–0.44). Arboviral infections remained inversely associated with cooking with firewood ≥5 times per week (AOR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.36–0.81), cooking with firewood in the main house (AOR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.08–0.57), and cooking with firewood on an open hearth (AOR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.33–0.78), even after adjusting for relevant covariates (
