  <meta-value>We are unable to place data in a public repository, as such sharing of individual participant data was not included in the informed consent of the study. The surveys and data that support the findings of this study are not in English, but are available from the Institutional Review Board of the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala for researchers who meet the criteria for access to confidential data. Interested readers can request the data from the data access committee (contact via Anaite Diaz at 
   <email>adiaz@CES.UVG.EDU.GT</email>), or the corresponding author (Zachary Madewell at 
   <email>zmadewel@ucsd.edu</email>). Future researchers are welcome to quote the name, “Inverse association between dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus infection and indicators of household air pollution in Santa Rosa, Guatemala: a case-control study, 2011-2018,” for the access of relevant dataset associated with it.
