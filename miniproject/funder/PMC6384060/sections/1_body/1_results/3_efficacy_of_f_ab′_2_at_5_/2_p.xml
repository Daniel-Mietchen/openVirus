<p>Complete blood count results showed that, by the start of treatment at 5 dpi, all F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub>-treated animals had decreases in WBC counts, LYM counts, and LYM percentages, fluctuating MON percentages and NEU percentages, and substantial decreases in PLT counts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7A</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">F</xref>), consistent with EVD. However, increases in all of the aforementioned markers were subsequently observed, suggesting that F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> treatment provided the host sufficient time to generate its own immune responses. Control animals showed largely the same trends for these markers but did not recover from the infection. Serum biochemistry results showed that all F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub>-treated animals had increased ALT, ALP, TBIL, and BUN levels and decreased AMY and GLU levels during the course of the experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7G</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">L</xref>), suggesting that the animals had suffered organ damage. Control animals again showed the same trends, but the greater magnitude of marker changes indicated that these NHPs had more severe EVD. Analysis of viremia and virus shedding by RT-qPCR showed that the animals had, on average, over 10
 <sup>6</sup> EBOV genome equivalents (GEQ) per milliliter of blood by the start of F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> treatment, but values decreased to undetectable levels by 28 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8A</xref>). Virus shedding via the nasal and oral routes was not observed until 8 dpi and reached 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 10
 <sup>6</sup> GEQ/ml of sample but resolved by 28 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">C</xref>). Shedding via the rectal route was observed at 5 dpi and reached 10
 <sup>4</sup> GEQ/ml of sample but resolved by 28 dpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Fig. 8D</xref>). Surviving F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub>-treated animals had detectable levels of circulating serum IgM and IgG after challenge, which were not observed in PBS-treated control animals (
