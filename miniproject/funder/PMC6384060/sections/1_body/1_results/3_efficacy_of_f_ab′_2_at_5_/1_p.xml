<p>Results showed that all F(ab′)

 <sub>2</sub>-treated NHPs (

 <sub>2</sub>-treated animals at 5 to 11 dpi but resolved afterwards (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>). All F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub>-treated NHPs were observed to be symptomatic at the beginning of treatment, and symptoms became progressively worse until 8 dpi. The animals fully recovered by 28 dpi, and no signs of disease were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>). In contrast, control animals succumbed to infection by 8 dpi, with pronounced weight loss, fever, and increases in clinical scores to &gt;20.
