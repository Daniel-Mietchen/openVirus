<p>We first tested the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralizing activities of our current F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> batch (which had been stored at 4°C for 33 months) against a recombinant, live, Central African (EBOV-Mayinga) (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) or West African (EBOV-Makona-C07) (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) EBOV strain expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> was found to be potently neutralizing against both tested viruses, with 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) values of 1.7 and 1.4 μg/ml against EBOV-Mayinga-eGFP and EBOV-Makona-C07-eGFP, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The 90% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>90</sub>) values were 3.2 and 3.7 μg/ml against EBOV-Mayinga-eGFP and EBOV-Makona-C07-eGFP, respectively (
