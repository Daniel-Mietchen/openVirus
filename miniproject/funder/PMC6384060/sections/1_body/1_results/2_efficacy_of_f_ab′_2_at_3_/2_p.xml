<p>Serum biochemistry results showed no substantial changes in the activities or concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), amylase (AMY), total bilirubin (TBIL), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), or glucose (GLU) in the F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub>-treated NHPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3G</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">L</xref>). In contrast, control animals showed increased ALT, ALP, TBIL, BUN, and GLU levels, as well as decreased AMY levels, which are markers of organ damage and are known to fluctuate with EVD progression. Viremia, as well as shedding via the nasal, oral, and rectal mucosa, was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in both control NHPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref> to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">D</xref>). In contrast, transient viremia and shedding via the oral route were detected for 1 of 4 F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub>-treated NHPs. When these data were taken together, F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> appeared to be effective at postexposure treatment of infected NHPs, and the animals did not become severely ill. Surviving F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub>-treated animals had detectable levels of circulating serum IgM and IgG after challenge, which were not observed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated control animals (
