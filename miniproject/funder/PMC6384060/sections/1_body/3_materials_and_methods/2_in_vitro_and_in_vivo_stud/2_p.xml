<p>To test whether F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> was effective later in the course of EVD (when the animals were symptomatic), naive rhesus macaques were first infected with 1,000 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of EBOV-Makona-C07. Beginning at 5 dpi, animals (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) were treated with 100 mg/kg of F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> once daily until 9 dpi (5 doses), with identical doses also being given at 11 and 13 dpi. Control animals (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2) was given identical volumes of PBS in place of F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub>. All parameters were monitored for 28 dpi in a manner similar to that of the pilot experiment.
