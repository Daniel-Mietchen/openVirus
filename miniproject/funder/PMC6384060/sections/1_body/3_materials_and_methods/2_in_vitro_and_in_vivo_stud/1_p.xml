<p>Neutralization assays were performed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using a previously published protocol (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Equine F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> was generated as described in a previous study (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and the same batch was used in this study. In the pilot NHP experiment, rhesus macaques were infected with 1,000 times the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) of EBOV-Makona-C07. Beginning at 3 dpi, animals (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) were treated with 100 mg/kg of F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> once daily until 7 dpi (5 doses), with identical doses also being given at 9 and 11 dpi. A control animal (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1) was given identical volumes of PBS in place of F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub>. Another control animal (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1) was left untreated. Survival rates, in addition to changes in clinical, hematological, biochemical, and virological parameters, were monitored for 28 dpi using previously published protocols (
