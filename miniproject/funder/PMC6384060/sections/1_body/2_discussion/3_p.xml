<p>While the results suggested that F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> slowed EBOV infection in NHPs enough that the animals had sufficient time to develop a specific protective response, it is not known whether the animals would survive a rechallenge with EBOV, and this needs to be investigated in the future. A previous study showing complete protection of ZMAb-treated NHPs against an EBOV rechallenge 10 weeks after the initial infection suggested that surviving animals might have developed protective immunity. Without directly comparing different treatments under the same challenge conditions, we cannot conclude whether F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> is superior or inferior to ZMapp or other antibody-based products. However, our results convincingly show that F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> is effective as a postexposure treatment (as late as 5 dpi) in NHPs and should be included in clinical trials as soon as possible. Due to well-established production protocols and a good safety record, F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> should be considered as an alternative to MAbs for large-scale treatment of patients during EBOV epidemics.
