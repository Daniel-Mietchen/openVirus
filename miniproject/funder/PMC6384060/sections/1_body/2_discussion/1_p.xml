<p>In this study, we successfully rescued 100% of EBOV-infected NHPs using an equine F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> treatment initiated as late as 5 dpi, or 48 to 72 h before death. Passive immunotherapy against EBOV was investigated previously, with mixed results. During the 1995 EVD outbreak in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo, whole blood from survivors was passively transferred to ill patients, resulting in 7 of 8 survivors (

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). It should be noted, however, that levels of EBOV-specific neutralizing antibodies in the convalescent plasma were not tested; therefore, the quality of the plasma was neither standardized nor known.
