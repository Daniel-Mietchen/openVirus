<p>Scientists also previously investigated the use of hyperimmune equine antisera against EBOV. This treatment (1 mg/kg) was shown to be 100% effective in baboons treated before challenge and 67% effective postexposure, but the challenge dose was low (10 to 30 PFU) (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Delays to viremia and the onset of clinical symptoms were observed, but the treatment (approximately 10 mg/kg) did not confer a survival benefit in cynomolgus macaques (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, passive immunotherapy with purified IgG (80 mg/kg) from NHPs that survived EVD was successful in conferring postexposure protection when treatment was initiated as late as 2 dpi (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), suggesting that higher doses of antisera are needed. Building on this, our study shows that viral neutralization via F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> is sufficient to control EVD and is effective even when animals are symptomatic. However, it is known that immunoglobulin fragments usually have shorter half-lives than IgG and therefore must be administered frequently, as shown in the current study with seven injections. To develop this product further, it will be important to assess whether the half-life of F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> can be extended using strategies such as protein conjugation (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) in order to confer complete protection with fewer treatment doses, lower F(ab′)
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations, and reduced infusion times, as work conditions in EBOV treatment centers in Africa are demanding and multiple infusions can further complicate the work of primary caregivers in the field.
