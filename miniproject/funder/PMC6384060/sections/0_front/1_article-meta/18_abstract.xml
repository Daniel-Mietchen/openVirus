 <p>EBOV is one of the deadliest viruses to humans. It has been over 40 years since EBOV was first reported, but no cure is available. Research breakthroughs over the past 5 years have shown that MAbs constitute an effective therapy for EBOV infections. However, MAbs are expensive and difficult to produce in large amounts and therefore may only play a limited role during an epidemic. A cheaper alternative is required, especially since EBOV is endemic in several third world countries with limited medical resources. Here, we used a standard protocol to produce large amounts of antiserum F(ab′)
  <sub>2</sub> fragments from horses vaccinated with an EBOV vaccine, and we tested the protectiveness in monkeys. We showed that F(ab′)
  <sub>2</sub> was effective in 100% of monkeys even after the animals were visibly ill with EBOV disease. Thus, F(ab′)
  <sub>2</sub> could be a very good option for large-scale treatments of patients and should be advanced to clinical testing.
