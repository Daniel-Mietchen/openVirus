<p>Oseltamivir works, but with a limited efficacy that is constrained by its intrinsic pharmacokinetic parameters and influenza host dynamics. If oseltamivir is used as a therapeutic measure, the delay from the time of infection to the time of treatment initiation leads to the underperformance of the drug. While the efficacy could be increased by increasing dosage, a drug with 99% efficacy administered after 48 hpi yields a negligible effect on influenza virus dynamics and symptoms. If oseltamivir is used as a prophylactic measure, the drug effectiveness is only warranted under limited conditions and should only be considered as an expensive alternative to public health routines in epidemic control.</p>
