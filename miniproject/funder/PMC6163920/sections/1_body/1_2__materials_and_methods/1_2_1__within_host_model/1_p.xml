<p>The influenza infection dynamics has been described with the target cell-limited model (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f001">Figure 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The model considers a population of epithelial cells divided into susceptible (T), latently infected (J), and productively infected (I) cells. After infection occurs at rate β, susceptible cells enter the latent phase where they remain on average 1/k days, after which they become productively infected. Infected cells shed the virus at a rate 
 <italic>p</italic> and have a mean lifespan of 1/δ days. The free virus, in turn, is cleared at a constant rate 
 <italic>c</italic> per day. The intensity of the symptoms, denoted by ψ, increases with the proportion of infected cells—due to the release of cytokines [

 <xref rid="B17-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]—at a rate θ and has a constant resolving rate

 <xref rid="viruses-10-00454-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were calibrated with human data measuring viral load and symptom score in Lukens et al. [
