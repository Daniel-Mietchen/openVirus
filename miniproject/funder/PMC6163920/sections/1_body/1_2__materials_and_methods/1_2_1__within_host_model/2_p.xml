<p>For this study, the classical sigmoid dose-response effect of NAIs was added (see the 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-10-00454">Appendix</xref>). NAIs were assumed to reduce the rate of virus shedding 
 <italic>p</italic> and the symptom score. The former assumption is due to the drug blocking the release of the virus, and the latter is the result of the reduction in the host’s induction of cytokines [

In general, four parameters governed the effect of the NAIs: (i) the drug concentration elimination rate per day, (ii) the intake frequency (a constant interval was assumed), (iii) the dose in mg, and (iv) the concentration at which the drug reached a 50% efficacy (EC
 <sub>50</sub>). The two parameters, intake frequency and dose, defined the treatment regimen; the elimination rate and half-maximal concentration constituted the drug-specific parameters. The exploration of the sensitivity of the drug’s efficacy with respect to the above four parameters provided a complete efficacy landscape for the NAIs. The full system of equations and analytical analyses are given in the
