<p>Simulated scenarios were created based on the assumption that the interventions were constrained by a fixed amount of resources (US dollars). This was calculated based on the pandemic regimen of 150 mg oseltamivir twice daily and the minimum price for oseltamivir in large purchases: 1.6 US cents per mg as of 2006 [

Based on a given amount of investment, scenarios were further varied by the proportion of the population to be covered and the time during which uninfected subjects within coverage could be provided with the intended amount of drug without any disruptions. Each scenario was simulated 1000 times to obtain distributional epidemic trajectories.
