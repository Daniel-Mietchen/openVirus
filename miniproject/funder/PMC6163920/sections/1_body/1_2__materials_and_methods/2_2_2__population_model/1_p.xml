<p>To assess the prophylactic effects of NAIs in an epidemic context, the within-host model was used to generate the infection dynamics of an individual-based network model of influenza transmission (as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f002">Figure 2</xref> and detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot3-viruses-10-00454">Section 2.3</xref>). The following two conditions were assumed to determine the between-host transmission from the within-host dynamics: (i) the transmission potential of an infected subject at any given time is defined by its viral load at that time divided by the maximum viral load [
