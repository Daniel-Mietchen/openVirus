<p>Open-source code (written in Python and R) is provided in a public repository for all simulations performed in this study (

Epidemic simulations considered a static network (10,000 nodes) that embodied the average contact distribution from the POLYMOD survey [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This survey asked 7290 participants in ten European countries to record their number of contacts per day, providing the most comprehensive dataset on human contact distribution to date. This empirical distribution was used to generate the static network as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f002">Figure 2</xref>. The epidemic simulations were then carried out as follows (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f002">Figure 2</xref>): (1) seed 100 random infected nodes; (2) find nodes connected to the infected cases and evaluate Bernoulli trials with probabilities of success depending on the viral load of the infected case, record new infected cases if any; (3) move to the next time step and repeat step 2 until no infected cases remain. Note that we initiated the epidemic with 100 infected cases to ensure that all epidemic simulations will result in many infected cases if no intervention was implemented. As such, a reduction observed in the final number of infected cases can be attributed to the effect of the intervention. For computational efficiency, the epidemic simulations were run with a one-day time step to check the transmission between the nodes. In addition, random noise was added to the time of infection by sampling from a uniform distribution U(âˆ’0.5, 0.5) in order to represent different times of contact during a given day.
