<p>Despite using only oseltamivir as a case study, we parametrized the impact by its peak efficacy, rendering the analyses independent of the drug parameters. Specifically, while the actual value of the peak efficacy depended on the drug parameters, their functional relationship and the efficacy landscape did not. In other words, from the values of Î³ and EC
 <sub>50</sub> for any given NAI, one could find its corresponding peak efficacy from the efficacy landscape defined by Equation (1). As such, the results were expected to be generalizable to other NAIs.
