<p>Given a limited availability of the drug, as well as limited resources in the affected countries [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the selection of prevention strategies must be well-informed. It seems that prolonging coverage over three weeks is not cost-effective (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f006">Figure 6</xref>). This is likely to worsen in practice due to an imperfect adherence to the regimen. A best-case scenario corresponds to providing the drug for more than two weeks with as high a coverage as possible. However, this effect was observed in highly favorable conditions (see Materials and Methods), whereas several real-life conditions could compromise the drug effects. For example, the introduction of newly infected cases into the population after the coverage duration would reset the protection level of the drug. In addition, the actual drug stockpiles were very low in the 2001 H1N1 pandemic, ranging from 0.1% to 25% in rare cases [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (e.g., examining newcomers, providing quarantine and isolation measures, closing schools, and reducing social activities). The effect of the drug, in this case, is very difficult to discern. A more realistic approach is an unequal distribution of the drug in order to target highly transmissible subgroups of the population offered in tandem with public health routines [
