<p>The simulations indicated that, for a typical case, treatments starting from 48 hpi onwards had a small effect on the symptom dynamics (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f004">Figure 4</xref>). A treatment starting at 72 hpi resulted in a reduction of only a few hours in the time to symptom alleviation compared to the case without treatment. In an optimistic context, treatments started during the first-day post-infection would yield approximately a one-and-a-half-day reduction in the maximum time spent in symptomatic phase. This result was the main outcome reported when assessing oseltamivir effects in clinical settings [

In reality, unobservable variations of a few hours (e.g., related to infection time, treatment initiation time, and symptom-reporting timeâ€”which is subject to the reporting individual) would yield a slightly better or worse effect of the drug. The main implication is that it is highly unlikely that the drug would work as expected in practice: patients would not seek treatment without symptoms, while the typical incubation period of an influenza infection is approximately two days [
