<p>This study presented the following limitations: (i) the within-host model lacked a marker for mortality and, as a result, the effects of oseltamivir in reducing the risk of death could not be assessed, as suggested elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; (ii) the effects of the drug on viral load and symptom severity were assumed to be the same. However, if the same functional form was taken into consideration in both cases, the reduction in the production of cytokines was expected to be milder than the main effect of the drug-inhibiting virus shedding, so that this simplification could be considered as part of the best-case scenario assumption; and (iii) assessments of coverage and duration did not consider the potential emergence of drug-resistance influenza strains, which in effect might suggest a different strategy. For example, intermediate levels of coverage could be preferred to very high ones to keep both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains at bay [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; this again can be interpreted as a best-case scenario.
