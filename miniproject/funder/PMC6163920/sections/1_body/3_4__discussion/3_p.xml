<p>To show a best-case scenario for the oseltamivir, the upper bound of efficacy was used in all the analyses. This was achieved by allowing the drug concentration to converge instantaneously to its most effective level; however, in reality, this was not the case. Oseltamivir needs time to convert from oseltamivir phosphate (OP) to its active metabolite oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) [
