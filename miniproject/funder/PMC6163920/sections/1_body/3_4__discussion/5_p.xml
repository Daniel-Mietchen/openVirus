<p>Limited data exist supporting the use of high-dose oseltamivir in influenza treatment; moreover, using higher doses would intensify drug shortages [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f006">Figure 6</xref>). This result explained the small increase in efficacy when increasing oseltamivir dosage in practice [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Doubling the dose of oseltamivir in the pandemic regimen brings about an increase in efficacy of only approximately 10% compared to the curative regimen. To reach at least 90% efficacy (approximately 10% more than for the pandemic regimen), one might consider a dose of 500 mg twice per day; this regimen has been documented as safe [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The dose can be further increased, for example to 1000 mg twice per day, which results in more than 95% efficacy. However, it was noted that the current efficacy of approximately 62% of oseltamivir would still be able to attain the same net effect on the infection course if the drug were administered early enough.
