<p>Based on the relationship between the drug and treatment parameters (Equation (1)), the pharmaceutical reported values of the drug parameters were used to explore the maximum drug efficacy that could be theoretically achieved. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f005">Figure 5</xref> provides the landscape of oseltamivir in two treatment regimens: the curative case and epidemic cases of influenza. The former regimen provided two doses of 75 mg oseltamivir per day, whereas the latter doubled the dose to 150 mg per day. Taking into consideration the current pharmaceutical reported values for the drug [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], the maximum efficacy was approximately 60% in the curative regimen and less than 80% in the epidemic regimen. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f005">Figure 5</xref> can also be used to find a drug with the properties yielding a desired efficacy. If the curative dose is taken into consideration, a drug with a unit elimination rate would need a half-maximal concentration no larger than approximately 10 mg to have approximately 95% efficacy or, alternatively, the current drug should have an elimination rate of approximately five times slower to have more than 70% efficacy.
