<p>Instead of fixing the drug pharmacokinetic parameters, a more practical way to improve the drug efficacy would be to increase either the dosage or the frequency of intakes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f006">Figure 6</xref> shows that for the nominal value of EC
 <sub>50</sub> and the drug elimination rate as chosen in 
 <xref rid="viruses-10-00454-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, a higher level of efficacy corresponds to a much larger dose or more frequent intakes than the current two recommended regimens. For example, to achieve an efficacy of 90% based on the fixed dose of 75 mg oseltamivir, one would have to take the drug more than ten times per day; instead, if the intake frequency is kept at twice per day as the recommended regimens, then a dose of approximately 300 mg would be needed. It is to be noted that these numbers are reported only for illustrating the limited efficacy of the drug and do not have a practical application, as the side-effects or toxicity when taking the drug with a higher dosage were not assessed.
