 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f007">Figure 7</xref> shows the contribution of oseltamivir to reducing the spread of an ongoing epidemic. Sixteen intervention scenarios generated based on combinations of three practical aspects of an intervention were evaluated: the allocated financial resources for stockpiling the drug, the duration during which one wishes to supply the drug to the community, and the proportion of the community upon which the interventions are going to apply. There were reductions in epidemic size for all the evaluated scenarios, which varied markedly from approximately 10% to 100%, depending on the coverage and duration of treatment. There was a trade-off between coverage and duration: prolonging the duration from one to three weeks while keeping a similarly low coverage did not bring large changes in epidemic size (scenarios 5–7, 10–12, and 14–16). However, a high coverage with a short duration (scenario 2) was not useful either as most of the simulations resulted in large epidemics. An optimal coverage duration was set between two and three weeks. Specifically, scenarios 8 and 13 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f007">Figure 7</xref>, bottom) both had a high coverage (90%), but the former resulted in many simulations ending with a large epidemic size (upper part), while the latter provided more certainty in controlling the epidemic. The bimodal distribution observed in scenario 8 resembled the typical pattern of the stochastic epidemic model, where the final size of the epidemic in most simulations is small and the large epidemics converge to a normal distribution [
