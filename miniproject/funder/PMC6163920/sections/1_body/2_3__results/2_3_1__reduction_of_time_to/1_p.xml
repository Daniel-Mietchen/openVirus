<p>Simulations of the within-host model with the NAIs dynamics reproduced what had been observed in clinical trials (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Based on the symptom score dynamics of the case without treatment [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], 
 <italic>the time to first alleviation of symptoms</italic> was defined as the time when the symptom score crosses a threshold that gives this measure for the control case a value of 122.7 h [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. If the currently reported efficacy of oseltamivir is taken into consideration, the use of the defined threshold and the treatment regimen of 75 mg twice a day for five days [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] shortens the time to first alleviation of symptoms up to 1.53 daysâ€”if the drug is taken on the first-day post-infection (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-10-00454-f004">Figure 4</xref>, left). Treatments initiated earlier than 48 h led to a reduction of at least more than half a day (0.68 days); the later the start of the treatment, the lesser the effect on symptom dynamics (reduction of a few hours). If a perfect drug with a similar acting mechanism is assumed, treatment started at 48 hpi could lead to an effect similar to the current drug taken at 24 hpi.
