<p>The recommended antiviral drugs against influenza are neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) [

 <xref rid="B9-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Because the influenza infection course is fast, the effects of NAIs depend on the timing of the antiviral intakes. For example, clinical trials found that oseltamivir, the most common NAI, reduced viral shedding and shortened the time to symptom alleviation by up to 1.5 days when treatment was started during the first 48 h post-infection (hpi) [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Prophylaxis with NAIs (oseltamivir, 75 mg, once or twice per day, during ten days to six weeks) was shown to be 68â€“90% effective in preventing infection during an influenza activity period [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Doubling the dose of oseltamivir showed no difference in outcomes [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. By and large, the narrow time window required and the need for healthy individuals taking the drug daily for an extended period make an efficient use of NAIs questionable.
