<p>Providing concrete evidence for the drug effects from observational studies is difficult, methodologically and ethically [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, it is difficult to know the time of infection in symptomatic cases to define the drug effect. Quantifying the preventive effect is also difficult as it is not clear whether a participant was not infected or had an asymptomatic infection [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The long period required in the prophylaxis approach can also become problematic in terms of adherence and drug delivery. To this end, we attempted to evaluate the drug effects in a more transparent setting by using mathematical modelling and computer simulations: using a within-host infection model of influenza infection, we evaluated the efficacy of oseltamivir in general and in reducing the time to symptom alleviation; using a network model, we assessed the prophylactic effects of oseltamivir in a population and its associated cost. The analyses took oseltamivir as the example, but we expected the results to be generalizable to other NAIs.
