  <p>Effects of using oseltamivir on epidemic size with respect to different combinations of duration and coverage. The contour lines on the left panel show the cost in US dollars per individual, assuming the pandemic regimen (150 mg, twice daily) with 0.16 US cents per mg [
   <xref rid="B22-viruses-10-00454" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; the numbers denote the simulated scenarios. The violin plots on the right show the epidemic size distribution for the simulated scenarios, each corresponding to 1000 simulations. Colors on both panels indicate the same simulated scenarios. The distribution in scenario 8 is bimodal, while those of scenarios 2 and 13 are skewed.
