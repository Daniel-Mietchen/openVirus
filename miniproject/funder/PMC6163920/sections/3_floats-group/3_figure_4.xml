  <p>Illustration of the treatment effect on symptom score dynamics. Different shapes were used to indicate the time to first alleviation of symptoms of corresponding dynamics. The simulated treatment is 75 mg of oseltamivir taken twice daily, starting at different times post-infection; the solid line is the case without treatment. The value 122.7 h is the median of time to symptom alleviation reported in clinical trials [
