  <p>Left: Contour lines show the fraction of reduction in the area under the curve (AUC) of the viral load dynamics as a function of treatment initiation times and peak drug efficacy. Right: Dynamics of the within-host system in the case without treatment (black, dashed lines) and in the case with treatment for ε* = 0.95 and different therapy starting times (colored lines). To avoid artificial growth of the virus late after infection, simulations with a viral load below a prescribed tolerance–in this case, 10
