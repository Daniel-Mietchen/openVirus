  <p>Illustration of the epidemic network model simulations. Based on empirical contact distribution data, the number of contacts (edges) was sampled and assigned to each subject (node). Based on the coverage and duration of the intervention, the nodes were assigned to either taking the drug in the defined period or not. Based on the within-host model, each infected node xth (colored red in the network) will have its own viral dynamics (red area in the dynamic) depending on whether it was already taking the drug at the time of infection or not. The transmission between infected and uninfected nodes (colored blue in the network) was evaluated in every simulation time step (e.g., i and j), during which the transmission probability varied (indicated by the edgeâ€™s color intensity) following the infection dynamics of the infected subject under consideration (see
