<p>The Bland-Altman plots demonstrated that 96% of all samples fell into the 95% limits of agreement between PRNT and crude ELISA. However, the crude ELISA had a slightly wider limit of agreement with PRNT compared to IBL ELISA. The PRNT values were also consistently higher than for ELISA. The wider limit of agreement indicates that the crude RSV lysate IgG ELISA has a higher variability with PRNT compared to IBL ELISA. This again, raises the issue of specificity and affinity of binding for RSV specific IgG antibodies measured using the crude ELISA method. Very few studies have used Bland-Altman plots to assess agreement between two serological methods
