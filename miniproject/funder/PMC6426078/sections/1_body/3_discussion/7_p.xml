<p>The main limitation we highlight in this study is that the PRNT assay we are using is difficult to standardize, which complicates comparison of results between laboratories. However, during the time this study was conducted there was no RSV standard available. Nevertheless, we tried to mitigate this limitation by using a panel of reference serum samples from BEI resources to monitor and minimise assay variability and to make sure results of the test samples obtained are acceptable. Another limitation is the systematic bias observed with analysis using Bland-Altman plots. This was due to the differences in metrics used to measure RSV specific antibodies by ELISA and PRNT. The RSV specific antibodies in ELISA are measured as a concentration (log10) while in PRNT assay are measured as titres (log2). The Bland-Altman plots show a trend if analysis is done using the respective metrics of the serological assays, thus difficulty in estimating the mean difference. The plots in Bland-Altman analysis should demonstrate that the two methods are consistent in what they are measuring in the same metrics. We tried to minimise this by transforming ELISA values to log base 2 during Bland-Altman plot analysis.</p>
