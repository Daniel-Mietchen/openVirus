<p>We found moderate to good correlations between each ELISA (IBL (r =0.75) and crude (r=0.61)) and the reference method for neutralizing antibodies, PRNT. The stronger correlation in IBL ELISA could be explained by the fact that, both PRNT and IBL ELISA methods were designed to target specific antibodies against the RSV F and G protein. This is because, neutralising antibodies are presumed to dominate within the RSV F protein also commonly known as the key target for neutralizing antibodies

 </sup>. Consequently, there is increasing interest to use the RSV F protein as the maternal RSV vaccine candidate antigen

 <bold>.</bold> The moderate correlation with crude ELISA is likely caused by the wide range of antibodies against multiple RSV antigens the assay targets. This might have possibly led to detection of additional antibodies specific to other RSV proteins that are missed by both IBL ELISA and PRNT assay.
