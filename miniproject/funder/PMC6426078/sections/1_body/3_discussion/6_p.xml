<p>In this study, we could predict PRNT titres using ELISA with moderate accuracy. Using regression analysis, the IBL ELISA method predicted the mean PRNT titre at 95% prediction interval within a width of 4.8log 
 <sub>2</sub> PRNT, while, crude RSV lysate IgG ELISA predicted the mean PRNT titre within a width of 5.6 log 
 <sub>2</sub> PRNT units. This implies that, the PRNT titre of any given serum sample if estimated using an ELISA IgG antibody concentration measured directly by the ELISA method would fall within 2.4-2.8 fold higher or lower than the true value. In a perfect regression, if RSV antibody concentrations were measured by ELISA, the corresponding PRNT values would be estimated using (1.880 
 <italic>x</italic> + 6.517) and (1.419 
 <italic>x</italic> +6.164) for IBL ELISA and crude ELISA respectively. With, 
 <italic>x</italic> being the antibody concentration measured directly by the respective ELISA method. However, the high variability makes direct estimation of PRNT values by the above formula difficult. For instance, the 95% upper limit of detecting mean cord PRNT titre of 10.6 log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT by crude ELISA would be 13.4log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT, which is above the highest value (12.9log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT) the PRNT assay detected in this study. The combined analysis approach we have applied on the data is unique and we think, this could better guide the choice of a suitable serological technique for use in place of a PRNT assay for large vaccine studies; and especially if the units of measurements between the two methods are different.
