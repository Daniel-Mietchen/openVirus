<p>Although the PRNT is considered the “Gold standard” method for quantifying the level of RSV specific antibodies, it has several limitations: (i) PRNT antibody titres are currently not internationally standardised and therefore it is difficult to compare results across different studies, though work is under way to resolve this

 </sup>; (ii) the assay procedure is cumbersome - taking four to six days (according to method) to complete; and, (iii) the assay is costly in terms of laboratory technologist time. Hence, the PRNT is not ideal for large sero-epidemiological studies or large-scale vaccine trials.
