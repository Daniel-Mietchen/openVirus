<p>Due to these limitations, it would be beneficial to adopt a serological assay which is quicker, cheaper and can be easily standardized, for use in large vaccine studies. An ELISA method is an option. However, the method measures epitopes of the target antigen and does not discriminate antibodies specific to neutralizing sites. Presently, there are two RSV specific IgG ELISA assays in our laboratory: an ELISA which uses crude RSV A2 culture lysate as antigen (Crude ELISA), and a commercial ELISA (IBL ELISA) which uses 96 well micro titre ELISA plates pre-coated with RSV F protein and RSV group A cell extract as antigen. We examined the agreement between ELISA assays and the PRNT in quantifying RSV specific antibodies using serum samples from a birth cohort in Kilifi, a coastal part of Kenya.</p>
