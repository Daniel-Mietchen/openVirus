<p>The plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) has been the preferred technique by most studies to determine the correlates of protective immunity to RSV

 </sup>. This is because the assay determines the level of antibodies present that are presumed to be functional

 <italic>et al.</italic> showed that serum antibody titres correlate with protection

 <italic>et al</italic>. who showed that neutralisation antibody titres were inversely associated with RSV hospitalization in infants &lt;6months
