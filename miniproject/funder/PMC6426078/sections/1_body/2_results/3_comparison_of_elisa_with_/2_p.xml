<p>The distribution of log transformed RSV antibody concentrations were approximately log- normal for each ELISA dataset and for the PRNT data. Bland-Altman plots were drawn to assess the agreement between PRNT and ELISA in quantifying a high or low RSV specific antibody level from a sample ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). In this analysis, 95% of samples were observed to fall within the 95% level of agreement between PRNT and IBL ELISA and 96% of samples between PRNT and crude ELISA, respectively. The Bland-Altman plots showed a mean difference of 4.5 log 
 <sub>2</sub> PRNT (95% limits 1.3-7.6) between PRNT and IBL ELISA and 2.1 log 
 <sub>2</sub> PRNT (95% limits -1.9-6.2) between PRNT and crude ELISA. Crude RSV lysate IgG ELISA showed a slightly wider 95% limit of agreement (-1.866, 6.157) compared to IBL RSV IgG ELISA (1.392, 7.595).
