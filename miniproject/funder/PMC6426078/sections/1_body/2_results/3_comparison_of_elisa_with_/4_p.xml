<p>Further assessment using regression analysis ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>), estimated the standard error for predicting the mean PRNT titres by ELISA method to be 1.204 and 1.424 for IBL ELISA and crude ELISA, respectively. All samples with low concentrations of RSV specific antibody were within the 95% prediction limit for crude RSV lysate IgG ELISA ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4b</xref>). The predicted PRNT values by IBL ELISA were given as (1.880 
 <italic>x</italic> + 6.517), while the predicted PRNT values by crude ELISA were given as (1.419 
 <italic>x</italic> +6.164). The 95% prediction limits for PRNT antibodies were slightly higher for crude ELISA +/- 2.79 log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT compared to IBL ELISA +/-2.36 log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT.
