<p>Modified Bland-Altman plots ( 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>) show the difference in value of the ELISA and PRNT results plotted against age in months (i.e. time since birth of collection of the samples). Age did not have any appreciable effect on the agreement between PRNT and either of the ELISA result.
