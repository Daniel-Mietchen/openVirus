<p>Archived sera from 100 cohort participants were selected. However, for 1 participant, the samples were not sufficient to screen for ELISA IgG antibodies after screening for PRNT titres. A total of 229 samples (99 cord samples, 87 three-month samples and 43 six-month samples) from the 99 participants were therefore available with data for the 3 serological assays. The mean gestational age at birth was 38.5 weeks (95% CI 37.6 – 39.3), while the mean birth weight was 2.9 kilograms (95% CI 2.7 – 3.0). The mean concentration of log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT titres were: cord blood samples, 10.6 log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT (95% Confidence interval, CI; 10.3– 10.8); 3 months of age samples; 8.3 log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT (95% CI 8.1 – 8.6); and 6 months and over 7.6 log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT (95% CI 7.1 – 8.1). The highest PRNT titre observed among these participants was 12.9 log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT while the lowest was 5.1 log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT.
