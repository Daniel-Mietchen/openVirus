<p>Correlation analyses between PRNT antibodies (log 
 <sub>2</sub>PRNT) and IgG ELISA (log 
 <sub>10</sub>) antibodies was done using a Pearson correlation test. Agreement between PRNT and ELISA was done using Bland-Altman plots

 </sup>. For each serum sample, the difference between PRNT and ELISA result was plotted against the averages of both assays. During Bland-Altman analysis, concentrations for RSV IgG IBL ELISA and crude lysate RSV IgG ELISA were log transformed to (base 2) and the data tested for normality. Modified Bland-Altman plots were used to test the effect of age on agreement between ELISA and PRNT. Regression analysis between ELISA and PRNT was used to estimate the 95% prediction intervals of PRNT antibodies by IgG ELISA method. The standard error (SE) of the predicted PRNT titre for an individual was estimated using the formula:
