Archived serum and plasma samples were utilised arising from the Kilifi Birth Cohort (KBC) study conducted between 2002 and 2007, by the Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome Trust Research Programme (KEMRI-WTRP). The KBC study was an observational study to investigate susceptibility to invasive pneumococcal disease among children. In this study, newborn participants numbering around 6000, recruited at the maternity ward or the child health clinic of Kilifi County Hospital (KCH), were followed for a 2-year period with blood samples collected at birth and then every 3 months. Samples were stored as plasma (for cord bloods) or serum (follow-up samples) at -80°C. Details of the birth cohort study are described elsewhere
