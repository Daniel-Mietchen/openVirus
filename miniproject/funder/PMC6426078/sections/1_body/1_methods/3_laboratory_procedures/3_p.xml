 </sup>. In addition, a panel of control samples from BEI Resources (BEI RSV Reference panel catalogue #NR-32832) was included in each batch of the PRNT assay to monitor reproducibility of the assay results and deterioration of the antibodies used. Results obtained from screening of the BEI samples were compared with PRNT values of the samples as previously tested in BEI resources laboratories.
