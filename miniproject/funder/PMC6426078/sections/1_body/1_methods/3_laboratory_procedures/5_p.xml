  <italic>Commercial RSV IgG ELISA (IBL ELISA).</italic>
 </bold> Use of the commercial RSV IgG ELISA kit and the procedure followed manufacturerâ€™s guidelines as described in the package insert (Cat#: RE56881- IBL International GmbH, D-22335 Hamburg, Germany). The ELISA procedure was based on a sandwich principle. In this assay, the 96 well plates were pre-coated with Vero E6 cells; strain long, F-protein; cell extract of RSV subgroup A (long strain) containing F-protein as well as G-protein as antigen (IBL communication). Specific antibodies from the serum samples binding to the pre-coated antigen were detected by a secondary antibody, rabbit anti-human conjugated to horse radish peroxidase enzyme. The reaction was developed using Tetramethylbenzidine(TMB) solution as substrate. The intensity of the colour developed, which is proportional to the concentration of IgG-specific antibodies detected, was read at 450nm using an ELISA reader (SYNERGY 4, BioTeK). The concentration of RSV IgG antibodies from the samples was estimated by comparison with a standard curve fit using a four parameter logistic regression model conducted in a
