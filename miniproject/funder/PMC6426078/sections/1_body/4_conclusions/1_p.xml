<p>Both ELISA methods show a moderate-good correlation with PRNT in measuring RSV specific antibodies. However, a commercial anti RSV based ELISA antibody assay which has less variability and has a high positive correlation with PRNT assay in detecting RSV specific antibody responses, does not provide an accurate prediction of PRNT antibody values. The true PRNT value would lie 2.4 fold higher or 2.4 fold lower if a commercial RSV IgG IBL ELISA is used in place of a PRNT assay. Our results suggest that, should PRNT prove unsuitable as a Gold standard for quantifying RSV specific antibodies, the utility of an ELISA method in vaccine studies should be assessed independent of a PRNT assay.</p>
