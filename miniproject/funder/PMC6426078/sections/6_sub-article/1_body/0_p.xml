<p>This study investigates how well ELISA and PRNT methods agree in detecting levels of of RSV specific antibodies (also accuracy) and whether an ELISA method can be an appropriate replacement for PRNT. Generally it is well written and I only have minor comments listed as follows:

   <p>Can you please justify the sample size you selected for the purpose of this study?</p>

   <p>You mentioned that age did not have a substantial effect on the agreement between PRNT and ELISA methods. As age advances, will you expect the similar finding?</p>

   <p>What is your opinion of applying the similar ELISA methods quantifying RSV specific antibodies beyond young children? e.g. older adults?</p>
