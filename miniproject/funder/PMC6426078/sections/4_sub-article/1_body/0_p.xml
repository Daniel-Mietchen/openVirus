<p>This is an important study which addresses the question of whether RSV ELISAs can replace neutralizing antibody assays for use in vaccine trials. This study analyzes the agreement between and accuracy of measuring RSV specific antibodies using ELISA w/ crude RSV lysate and RSV IgG ELISA in comparison with the current “gold standard” method for measuring RSV specific antibodies, a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). In previous studies, ELISA and PRNT have not been shown to correlate well, due to non-neutralizing antibodies. </p>
