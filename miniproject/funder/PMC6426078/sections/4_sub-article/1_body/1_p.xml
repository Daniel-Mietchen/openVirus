<p> Methodologically, the study is sound. Comparison was made between the PRNT, utilizing a method that has been used by multiple labs. Results from a standardized set of reference sera are included, showing performance of the test within range. Comparison was made against a commercial and in-house ELISA. Samples tested included sera samples from the cord blood of 99 participants and subsequent 3 and 6-month samples from a fraction of these participants. Strength of association was calculated with a correlation test and agreement between PRNT and ELISA were examined on Bland-Altman plots.</p>
