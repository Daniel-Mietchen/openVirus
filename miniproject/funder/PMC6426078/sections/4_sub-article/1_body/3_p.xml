<p> Overall the commercial ELISA had higher correlation as compared to the ELISA using crude RSVA2 lysate, which as the authors point out, is likely due to targeting of F and G antigen in the commercial assay. Despite this higher correlation, the margin of error for the formula calculating the relationship between the ELISA and the PRNT is too high to be useful. This is a useful study, and reaffirms the use of RSV neutralizing antibody assays as the gold standard. One minor criticism, largely outside the scope of this study, is the consideration of other correlates of protection beyond neutralizing antibody as markers of protection against disease.</p>
