  <title>Modified Bland Altman scatter plot showing the effect of age on agreement between plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) and ELISA assays.</title>
  <p>Panel 
   <bold>A</bold> is a graph for difference between PRNT and Commercial IBL respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) IgG ELISA against age and panel 
   <bold>B</bold> is a graph for difference between PRNT and Crude RSV lysate IgG ELISA against age. The short dashed gray lines represent the 95% limits of agreement, solid gray line represent the mean difference of agreement for each graph. PRNT and ELISA IgG antibodies are presented using base2 log scale.
