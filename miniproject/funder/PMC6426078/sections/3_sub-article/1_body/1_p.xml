<p> The major objective of this manuscript was to determine if at least one of the two in house RSV ELISA assays could predict with accuracy the neutralizing antibody titers generated by a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Although the methodology used to make the comparisons and analytical approach used to make the prediction are sound, the basic assumption is flawed when using crude or poorly described viral antigens in the ELISA assays. The neutralization assay primarily measures neutralizing antibodies directed to site-specific sites on the F protein while the ELISA assay using viral antigens will measure binding antibodies direct to the surface glycoproteins (F, G &amp; SH) as well as the internal proteins (N, P, M, M2). Although good correlations are normally seen between ELISA and neutralization assays, it is entirely a different proposition to predict with accuracy neutralizing antibody titers when using viral antigens in an ELISA assay. Even site-specific competitive antibody assays to the F protein are not able to predict with accuracy neutralizing antibody tiers measured by neutralization assays because the immune response of individuals vary to the antigenic sites (Ø, II, IV, III, V) of the F protein even though they may have comparable neutralizing antibody activity. The lack of precision was evident in the results with the potential to have up to a 16 to 32-fold swing in the neutralizing antibody titer prediction using the ELISA assays.  </p>
