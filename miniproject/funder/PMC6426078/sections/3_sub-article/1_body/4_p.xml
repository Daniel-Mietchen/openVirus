<p> Neutralization assays are considered the best current method to evaluate the protective potential (neutralizing antibodies) induced by RSV infection or candidate vaccines. We now have an international standard (National Institute of Biological Standards and Control-NIBSC) against RSV/A (also being developed for RSV/B) that can be used to adjust neutralizing antibody titers generated by different neutralization assays into IU. This will greatly facilitate the comparisons of neutralizing antibody activity measured by different assays and induced by different candidate vaccines. The introduction section should be revised to reflect these up-dates.</p>
