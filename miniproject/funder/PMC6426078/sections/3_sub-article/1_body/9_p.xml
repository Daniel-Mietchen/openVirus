<p> For the ELISA assays it is unclear what the dilution scheme was for generating the ELISA units. The results are presented in log10, which suggest a dilution scheme of 10-fold. Please clarify the dilution scheme for the two ELISA assays. Also for all the assays please describe the range of the antibody titer and arbitrary unit for the assays. It would also be helpful to know the coefficient of variation for these assays at the lower limit of detection, dynamic range and upper limit of detection.</p>
