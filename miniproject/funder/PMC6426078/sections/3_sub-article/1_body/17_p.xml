<p> In my opinion, the main limitation is not the standardization of the PRNT but rather the assumption that accurate predictions can be made when using ELISA assays with poorly characterized viral antigens. A second major limitation is the use of immunological assays that do not appear to have been qualified. Information on the reproducibility, dynamic range, lower and upper limit of detection were not provided for these assays.</p>
