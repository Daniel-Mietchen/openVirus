<p> In the manuscript PRNT is described as the preferred technique to determine immune correlates of protection. It is important to point out that the PRNT is one of many neutralization assays that have been developed for measuring neutralizing antibody activity against RSV. There are two major classes of neutralization assays; the PRNT and the microneutralization assay. There are many assay variations depending on the cell line, the virus inoculum, the signal or read out used to measure neutralizing activity, the duration of the assay, etc. Many of the PRNT references used in the manuscript actually refer to the classical microneutralization assay. It is also important to note that these neutralization antibody assays, in particular those without complement, primarily detect neutralizing antibody directed to the F protein and not the G protein.</p>
