<p> What was the collection tube used to process plasma? Plasma collected in heparin coated tubes will inaccurately measure plasma samples with low neutralizing antibody activity to RSV because heparin containing plasma will act as an antiviral agent. The effect is to inhibit virus replication when in reality there is no neutralizing antibody activity. This is unlikely to have an effect with plasma samples with moderate to high levels of neutralizing antibody titers against because the effect is diluted out with increasing two-fold dilutions.</p>
