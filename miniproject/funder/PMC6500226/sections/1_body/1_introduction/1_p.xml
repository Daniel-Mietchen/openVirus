 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and the second common cause of cancer-related death, and which accounted for 788 000 deaths in 2015.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, while intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is a rarer form of the disease.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A wide range of environmental risk factors have been associated with liver cancer, such as viral factors (hepatitis B and hepatitis C) and non-viral factors (alcohol, aflatoxin, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity, diabetes and smoking).
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4â€“8</xref> Reducing exposure to these risk factors is the most effective way to minimise the risk of developing liver cancer.
