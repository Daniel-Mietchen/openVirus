<p>The average annual percent change (AAPC) and annual percent change (APC) were used to evaluate trends in disease burden and calculated using the Joinpoint Regression Program (V.4.5.0.1, June 2017). The values of AAPC and APC were calculated as [(Exp(bi) − 1)]×100, where bi represents the slope of the period segment. The Z test was used to assess whether an AAPC or APC was different from zero. The terms ‘increase’ and ‘decrease’ were used when the slope (AAPC or APC) of the trend was statistically significant, while ‘stable’ referred to a non-significant trend. A negative binomial regression model was utilised to identify potentially influential factors using the SAS V.9.4 software. The OR and its 95% CI were also calculated for each factor. Origin 2017 software (MicroCal Software, Northampton, Massachusetts, USA) was used to draw the figures. The significance level for the hypothesis tests was set at 0.05.</p>
