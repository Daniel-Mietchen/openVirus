<p>The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2016 incorporated data from a large number of sources to estimate mortality, causes of death and illness and risk factors in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The GBD 2016 used multiple methods to integrate a large number of available data sources with the specific epidemiology of each disease, and the Bayesian meta-regression tool DisMod-MR V.2.1 was used as the main method of estimation.
