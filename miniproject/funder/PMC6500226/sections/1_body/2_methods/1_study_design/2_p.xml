<p>We extracted GBD 2016 data on liver cancer in China from 1997 to 2016 using the Global Health Data Exchange.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The variables obtained from these data included year, age, gender and cause (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcohol use and other causes). The incidence, prevalence, mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were used as the primary metrics to assess the impacts on health within population. The total number of liver cancer cases and rates of each metrics were provided by the GBD 2016. Prevalence rate (per 100 000) was defined as aggregated cases (including new cases and previously diagnosed cases) divided by the population size; incidence rate (per 100 000) was defined as the number of new cases divided by the population size; mortality rate (per 100 000) was defined as the number of annual deaths divided by the total population size and DALYs were summed by the years of life lost and the years of life lived with disability. The age-adjusted rates (ARs) for each metric were adjusted to population of China in 2010.
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The mortality-to-incidence (MI) ratio was used as an indicator of disease severity and the efficacy of clinical treatment and management.
