<p>The incidence of liver cancer was different between males and females except in the youngest age group (0–14 years old).
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Previous studies observed sex-related disparities in incidence and found rates in males that were twofold to threefold higher than those observed in females,
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 25 28</xref> and this difference was greater in high-incidence regions.
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Males experienced a two-fold or higher risk than females across all metrics included in our study, and these disparities may be exacerbated by other characteristics. For example, higher positive rates of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were found in males than in females from multiple serological surveys across China, and the male to female ratio of HBsAg positive rate showed increasing (10.30% vs 7.29% in 1979
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and 8.6% vs 5.7% in 2006
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Males also had higher rates of drinking and alcohol consumption than females.
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> The male to female ratio of drinking (61.3% vs 11.6% in 1993 and 38.3% vs 8.1% in 2006) and alcohol intake (28.0 g/d vs. 12.9 g/d in 1997 and 33.1 g/d vs. 13.1 g/d in 2006) both showed increasing in adults.
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The above evidence could strengthen the explanations on the increasing male to female ratio among all metrics in this study.
