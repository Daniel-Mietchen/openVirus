<p>Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most important causes of liver cancer worldwide, especially in regions with highly endemic of HBV.
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Liver cancer typically develops after 25–30 years of HBV infection,
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and individuals with a chronic HBV infection are 20–100 times more likely to develop liver cancer than uninfected individuals.
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> In China, the weighted HBsAg-positive rate was 7.2%
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> which led to China being categorised as a high-intermediate HBV endemic area.
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Though there is a negative trend in the infection rate in China,
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> the number of HBV infections was still high due to the large population. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) can infect the immune system and endothelial cells, leading to immune dysfunction and chronic dysregulated angiogenesis.
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> There is a moderate association between HCV infections and liver cancer (OR: 4.28, 95% CI 3.30 to 5.56).
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The prevalence of anti-HCV is estimated to be approximately 1% in China.
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> As a result, HCV may have already contributed to a large number of liver cancer cases along with HBV. In our study, the proportions of viral factors (hepatitis B and C) in prevalence, incidence, mortality and DALYs were more than 60% and increased with age. The presence of these high-risk factors makes liver cancer a strong candidate for targeted prevention projects. A prior study concluded that the incidence of liver cancer had fallen dramatically as a result of promoting dietary interventions and implementing neonatal HBV vaccinations.
