<p>In this study, we found that the age-adjusted trends of incidence, mortality and rate of DALYs did not showed increasing, only the prevalence in the recent years was still increasing after age adjustment. Actually, the crude rates of prevalence, incidence and mortality presented increasing trends. As the rates were adjusted by the population of 2010, the trends could be influenced due to the significant change of age structure from 1997 to 2016. The ageing of the population in China could contribute to the increasing disease burden of liver cancer. The population of mainland China reached nearly 1.39â€‰billion at the end of 2016. And the proportions of those aged over 60 and over 65 accounted for 16.7% and 10.8% of the population, respectively,
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> which is higher than the proportions of 11.96% and 8.24% of the WHO world standard population.
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Consistent with previous reports, our study found that the proportion of those aged over 60 had risen from 9.5% in 1997 to 16.1% in 2016. Meanwhile, the proportion of those aged below 15 decreased from 25.7% to 15.1%.
