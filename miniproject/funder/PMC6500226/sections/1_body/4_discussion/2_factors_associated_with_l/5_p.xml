<p>Alcoholic beverages have previously been characterised as ‘carcinogenic to humans’.
 <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> In 2010, alcohol-attributable cancers were estimated to be responsible for 337 400 deaths worldwide, predominantly among men. Liver cancer was the largest contributor to alcohol-attributable cancer deaths (responsible for 23.9%) and the DALYs lost (responsible for 24.7%).
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The mechanism by which alcohol consumption increases the risk of HCC is primarily through the development of cirrhosis.
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 6</xref> A meta-analysis suggested a moderately detrimental role of alcohol consumption on liver cancer risk,
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> while heavy alcohol consumption of &gt;80 g/d of ethanol for at least 5 years increased the risk of HCC by nearly fivefold.
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Our study showed that the percentages of alcohol consumption as a cause of liver cancer in terms of prevalence, incidence, mortality and DALYs were greater than 10%. The per capita alcohol consumption (&gt;15 years of age) rose from less than 2 L in 1981 to approximately 6.7 L in 2010, and will reach 8.3 L in 2025.
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Collectively, alcohol consumption in China has increased over the past few decades leading to an increase in the risk of liver cancer.
