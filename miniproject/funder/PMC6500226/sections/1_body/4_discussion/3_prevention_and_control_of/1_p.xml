<p>Approximately one-third of cancer deaths can be attributed to the five leading behavioural and dietary risks: high body mass index, low fruit and vegetable intake, lack of physical activity, tobacco use and alcohol use.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Since there are no standard and effective screening methods available for liver cancer,
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> prevention is the most effective way for controlling the disease.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A previous study concluded that implementing HBV vaccination, controlling HCV transmission and reducing alcohol intake could avoid more than 90% of worldwide liver cancer cases.
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Hepatitis B immunisation to reduce the risk of liver cancer was also recommended by the WHO.
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> China had established an immunisation plan for hepatitis B in 1992 and has partnered with the Global Alliance on Vaccine and Immunisation since 2002.
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Strategies to address the other well-established risk factors such as promoting widespread public education, interrupting mother-to-infant transmission, monitoring of blood donors and blood products, improving the proportions of the age structure and implementing annual surveillance should be prioritised as well.
