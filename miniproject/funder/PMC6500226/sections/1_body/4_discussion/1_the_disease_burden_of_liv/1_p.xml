 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> We found that the prevalence, incidence, mortality and DALYs of liver cancer increased from 1997 to 2016, which indicates an increasing disease burden in China. Additionally, higher APCs in all metrics were observed in recent years. Similar increasing trends were previously reported from 2003 to 2007 in China,
