<p>The age-standardised 5-year net survival rate of liver cancer was generally low (10%–20%),
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and only 10.1% in China.
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Furthermore, there have been few improvements in the survival rate of liver cancer from 1995 to 2014 in most countries.
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The 5-year relative survival rates were 10.7% for those diagnosed at a regional stage and 2.8% for those diagnosed at a distant stage.
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Due to the difficulties of making an early diagnosis, most patients were diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease.
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Along with poor survival rates, the MI ratio of liver cancer was as high as 0.95
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 25</xref> indicating that the number of deaths were very close to the number of new cases and that the disease is difficult to cure. In China, the MI ratios were reported to be between 0.91 and 0.97 during 2005–2009.
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The ratios observed in our study remained high, but a decreasing trend was observed. This may due to the improvements in medical care. For example, liver transplantation is the optimal for liver cancer. The number of liver transplantation increased from 1993 to 2013 (totally more than 24 000) in China. Additionally, the 5-year survival rate among patients was as high as 80%.
