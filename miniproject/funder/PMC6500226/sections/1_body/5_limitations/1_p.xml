<p>Although the GBD 2016 provides the most comprehensive and consistent data for assessments of global descriptive epidemiology, the general limitations of the GBD approach have been described.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13â€“17</xref> Descriptive results may differ from reports by local raw data, especially for estimates that depended on sophisticated statistical modelling to address sparse and inconsistent data. Meanwhile, data collection and model selection may cause errors, and which may be addressed in future iterations by the GBD study. Additionally, our study does not include estimates of the subnational (provincial or regional) or other potential factors (economic status, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity and smoking). Analysis on birth-cohort effects and others were not involved. Better primary data from a national wide-coverage observational study or cancer registry on liver cancer burden are needed in the future.
