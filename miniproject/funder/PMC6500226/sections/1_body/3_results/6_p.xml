<p>Since the results of Lagrange multiplier test were significant for all metrics (all p&lt;0.0001), negative binomial regressions were applied for the risk factors analysis of the scaled dataset (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">table 2</xref>). The male odds for prevalence (OR: 2.98, 95% CI 2.68 to 3.30), incidence (OR: 2.45, 95% CI 2.21 to 2.71), mortality (OR: 2.36, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.59) and rate of DALYs (OR: 2.46, 95% CI 2.16 to 2.80) were more than two times higher than those of females. The fold change in ORs for every 5-year increase in age were 1.57 (95% CI 1.55 to 1.59) for prevalence, 1.58 (95% CI 1.56 to 1.60) for incidence, 1.57 (95% CI 1.55 to 1.59) for mortality and 1.42 (95% CI 1.39 to 1.44) for rate of DALYs. Hepatitis B and other causes led to a higher risk than alcohol use with the ORs ranging from 2.28 to 5.63 in prevalence, incidence, mortality and rate of DALYs (p&lt;0.0001).
