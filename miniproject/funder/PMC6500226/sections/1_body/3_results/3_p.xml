 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows the rates of liver cancer among different age groups. The prevalence was under 1.00/100 000 for individuals aged below 20 and increased rapidly between the ages of 40 and 70. The highest prevalence rate was observed in those aged 80–84. Similar tendencies were observed in incidence and mortality with rates that were consistently high among those aged over 90. A higher rate of incidence than that of prevalence was also observed among those aged over 90. The lowest rate of DALYs was over 1500/100 000 among those aged 50–84 which indicates that older individuals experience a heavier disease burden from liver cancer.
