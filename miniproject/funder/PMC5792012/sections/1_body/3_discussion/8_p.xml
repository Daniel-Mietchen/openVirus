<p>HIV induces early aging of the immune system, which likely contributes to reactivation of latent TB and therefore heightened risk of incident TB in older ages [

This is consistent with findings from a large cohort study of patients on ART in Nigeria that showed that gender is an effect modifier of the association between BMI and anemia with TB, suggesting that males may benefit from nutritional interventions to boost their immunity to TB [
