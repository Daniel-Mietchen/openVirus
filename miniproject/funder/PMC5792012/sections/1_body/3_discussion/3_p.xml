<p>In this study, patients with advanced immunodeficiency were recruited, reflecting the cART eligibility guidelines of the Botswana HIV Treatment Programme at the time. The risk of development of active TB is associated with lower nadir CD4 counts and those with suboptimal immunological responses have an increased risk of developing active TB. As we demonstrated, it is therefore time-updated and not baseline CD4, that is the strongest predictor of incident TB. In our study, patients who failed to achieve a 20% gain in baseline CD4 counts by 6 months on cART had a 2-fold higher risk of TB. Other studies have reported that patients with the lowest baseline CD4 counts remain at increased risk of TB for a longer period of time compared to those with high CD4 counts [
