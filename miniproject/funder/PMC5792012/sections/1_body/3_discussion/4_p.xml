<p>Immunological non-recovery is a known predictor of the immune reconstitution syndrome (IRIS) that complicates management of patients on cART [

 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Patients who fail to achieve at least a 20% increase in CD4 counts on cART are considered to be immunological non-responders [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The reasons for this non-response in the context of viral suppression are not well understood but may be linked to a lower CD4 nadir [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or the elevated levels of T-regulatory cells in circulating blood [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Previous work in our setting showed that immunological non-recovery in TB/HIV co-infected patients was a significant risk factor for TB-IRIS and early mortality and this was associated with elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6 [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Most of the patients analyzed in this study had low CD4 counts prior to cART initiation and this may account for the high incidence rate reported in this study, although our estimate is consistent with what has been reported in similar high burden settings [

 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In contrast, studies from other African countries have reported lower incidence rates in patients on cART [

 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This could possibly be a reflection of the lower background rates of prevalent TB or inadequate screening or documentation of TB cases in these settings [
