<p>We have shown in this study a TB incidence rate of 3.04/100py over a 2-year follow-up period of patients on a Truvada-based cART regimen. As is the case with ART programs in sub-Saharan Africa, 70% of the incident TB cases occurred within the first three months of cART initiation. Additionally, there was a significant association between anemia and incident TB, highlighting the need to identify biomarkers that will allow timing of appropriate interventions. Patients with poor immunologic recovery by one year on cART and those with low CD4 counts had an increased risk of and shorter time to incident TB disease.</p>
