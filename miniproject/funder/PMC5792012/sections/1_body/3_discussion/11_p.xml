<p>Our results should be interpreted in light of the strength and weaknesses of the study design. The main weakness of the study is the retrospective study design that has inherent weaknesses. Tuberculosis was not actively investigated in the main study and relied on clinical investigation as per the standard of care through the routine health system. Consequently, over half the incident cases had no laboratory confirmation, which may have introduced misclassification bias and overestimation of our incident cases. However, most TB cases are diagnosed empirically in Africa even in settings provided with the GeneXpert test [

 <sup>3</sup> so the findings of this analysis may not be generalizable to current guidelines. However, studies conducted in patients with CD4 count above 350cells/ mm
 <sup>3</sup> suggest that incident TB is still a problem [
