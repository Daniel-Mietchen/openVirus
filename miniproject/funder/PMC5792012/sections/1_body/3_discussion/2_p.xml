<p>The reduction in TB risk attributable to cART varies depending on the background risk of transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Studies have shown that cART reduces the individual risk of TB disease among HIV-infected persons by between 60 and 90% irrespective of CD4 count [

 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, this reduction is time dependent, decreasing from 3.6/100py in the first year to 1.0/100py by the fifth year on cART [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Furthermore, by year three on treatment, patients still have a 5â€“10 times higher risk of TB compared to HIV-uninfected [

 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A retrospective analysis of data from Wales confirmed these findings, concluding that the risk of TB in HIV infected patients does not reach background rates in black Africans [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is likely due to the fact that long-term restoration of immune phenotype and function is limited despite a long duration on cART [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], particularly in patients with low CD4 counts.
