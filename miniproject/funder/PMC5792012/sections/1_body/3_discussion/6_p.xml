<p>An interesting finding from this study is the heightened risk of incident TB in patients with severe anemia, defined as a hemoglobin level less than 8g/dl [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Anemia is a common comorbidity reported at TB diagnosis in 32â€“86% of patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Patients in our study were on a Tenofovir-based regimen, which does not induce anemia as is the case with zidovudine. This suggests there is another mechanism driving the intricate relationship between anemia and TB. It has been postulated that severe anemia in patients with undiagnosed TB is likely due to the pro-inflammatory cytokine activation that induces an anemia of chronic disease [

 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. IL-6 upregulates the transcription of hepcidin, the iron regulatory protein, which leads to reduction in iron absorption and sequestration of iron by macrophages and enterocytes [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], limiting iron delivery to erythroblasts thus causing a functional anemia. This increased iron storage in macrophages promotes replication of bacilli thus markers of iron homeostasis may be early markers of risk of progression from latency to active TB. Studies have also shown that time-updated anemia severity is an independent predictor of mortality in patients on ART [

 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which may suggest a role for iron biomarkers in screening strategies for TB prior to cART initiation. Iron biomarkers also have the potential to contribute to the development of risk profiles for the progression from latent TB infection to active disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], a current area of active research.
