<p>Incident TB may have been overestimated due to most cases appearing within the first 6 months of ART. Furthermore, some cases may have died before a TB diagnosis which may bias our estimates as we did not perform a competing risk analysis. However, our findings are similar to estimates reported from similar high-burden settings[

The combination of both a high rate of prevalent and incident TB in this study highlights the magnitude of the HIV-associated TB epidemic in ART programs in low-resource setting. While ART initiation at high CD4 counts is expected to reduce incident TB rates[
