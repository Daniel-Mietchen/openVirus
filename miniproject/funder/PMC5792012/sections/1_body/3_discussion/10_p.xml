<p>The combination of cART and isoniazid preventive therapy would be useful in reducing the burden of TB in ART programs in Africa[

 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. While it is not clear if these incident cases post-IPT represent a failure to sterilize latent infection at the time of IPT initiation or reinfection, it is generally accepted that these are a function of TB endemicity [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Nonetheless, there is no disputing the survival benefit of combined IPT and ART in high incidence settings. Multivariate algorithms that rely on accurate classification of latent infection and better treatment regimens for IPT are therefore urgently needed[
