 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], more than half of the incident cases occurred within 6 months of cART initiation. This possibly demonstrates the difficulty in screening patients for TB and highlights the need for biomarkers that can identify patients at increased risk of TB at the time of cART initiation. The TB symptom screen algorithm proposed by Cain and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] may be less sensitive and specific among individuals taking cART [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Cases were identified within a short period of cART initiation, thus likely represent subclinical disease [

 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The fact that this finding has also been demonstrated in a study that recruited patients with CD4 counts &gt;350cells/Î¼l [
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] shows that enhanced diagnostics and intensified case finding, in addition to early cART initiation, will be required to curb the challenge of incident TB in ART programs in Africa.
