 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192030.g001">Fig 1</xref>]. The remaining participants contributed 428 person-years of follow-up. Incident TB was diagnosed in 13 of 254 [5%, IR 3.04/100py (95% CI, 1.69â€“5.06)] participants within a median of 41 days (Q1, Q3:28, 78) from enrolment. Bacteriological confirmation was available in 6 (46%) of the incident cases. The remaining cases were placed on treatment based on abnormal chest radiology (23%) or clinical indication (31%).
