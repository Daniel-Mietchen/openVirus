<p>Person-time at risk was accrued from the date of cART initiation until death or study closeout or, in the case of those who developed incident TB, date of first recorded TB diagnosis. Incident TB rate was calculated as the number of new cases of TB divided by total person-years (PY) at risk and expressed per 100py. Kaplan-Meier estimator of the survivor function was used to generate a TB-free survival curve and to determine the impact of poor immunological response on TB incidence, adjusting for gender. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were generated adjusting for CD4, gender and age to evaluate risk factors for incident TB during ART. Variables with p-values &lt; 0.05 were included in the multivariate model. All statistical analyses were conducted in Stata version 14.2 (College Station, Texas, USA).</p>
