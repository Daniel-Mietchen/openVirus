<p>We conducted a retrospective analysis of data from 300 adults enrolled into an observational study, evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of a Truvada-based regimen in HIV-1C infected adults—“
 <italic>Bomolemo study</italic>”—conducted in Gaborone between November 2008 and July 2011[
 <xref rid="pone.0192030.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In 2008, Botswana adopted Tenofovir plus Emtricitabine (Truvada
 <sup>™</sup>) combined with either Efavirenz or Nevirapine as its first line ART regimen. The “
 <italic>Bomolemo study”</italic> was designed to demonstrate the tolerability, virologic and immunologic response of a Truvada-containing regimen for HIV-1 C infected adults in Botswana. Participants were HIV infected, ART-naïve and aged 18 years and older. Additional eligibility criteria included the presence of an AIDS defining condition or a CD4+ T-cell count &lt;250cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, consistent with WHO guidelines at the time. Female participants were asked to provide a urine specimen for pregnancy testing and were excluded if they were pregnant or had received single dose Nevirapine as PMTCT within the 6 months preceding enrollment. After study entry and ART initiation, participants were scheduled for evaluations at 1 month and then every 3 months until the final study visit at week 96. At these visits, physical examination and medical history was taken in addition to laboratory tests for CD4, viral load, hematology, and chemistry. This study received ethical approval from the Botswana Ministry of Health’s Health Research Development Committee (PPME-13/18/1) and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health IRB (16470–02). All participants provided a written informed consent including use of their collected data.
