<p>Tuberculosis was diagnosed and treated through the national programme per the Botswana National TB treatment guidelines. Briefly, tuberculosis diagnosis was based on either a positive sputum AFB or culture result, or abnormal chest radiology. Patients on TB treatment with neither abnormal chest x-ray nor microbiological confirmation were classified as “clinical TB”. Information on clinical diagnoses was collected at each study visit and documented on a case report form. For this analysis, any patient reported as having tuberculosis with a documented diagnosis date was recorded as a case. We also defined prevalent TB cases as those who had a TB diagnosis at baseline and incident TB cases as those diagnosed with TB after cART initiation.</p>
