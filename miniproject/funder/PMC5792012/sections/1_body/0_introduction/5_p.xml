<p>Understanding the context-specific incidence and predictors of TB during cART remain important keys to designing effective interventions to mitigate the ravenous effects of the syndemic. Furthermore, most studies describing burden of TB in ART programs have been in patients on zidovudine-containing regimens, there has only been one study conducted in patients on a Tenofovir-based ART regimen [

It is therefore critical to determine factors associated with risk of incident TB to allow early identification of patients that will benefit from isoniazid preventative therapy. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected during an observational study evaluating efficacy of a Truvada-based cART backbone in Botswana to determine the TB incidence and the associated predictive factors.
