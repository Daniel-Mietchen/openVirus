Recent estimates report that about a half of people with HIV remain unaware of their HIV status [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This is particularly disturbing in a context where the adoption of a <italic>Test and Treat</italic> approach&#x02014;implying frequent universal testing and immediate initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART)&#x02014;has been heralded as the solution to HIV transmission [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; and challenges the achievement of the ambitious 90-90-90 targets proposed by UNAIDS: by 2020, 90% of people with HIV should be aware of their infection, 90% of people diagnosed with HIV should be linked to antiretroviral treatment (ART), and 90% of those on ART should adhere and have undetectable levels of HIV in their blood [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The determination to increase HIV test coverage and to reduce missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis has lead to a major switch in HIV testing policies from the traditionally patient-initiated Voluntary Counselling and Testing approach (VCT) to Provider-Initiated Testing and Counselling (PITC) where health providers (HP) routinely offer an HIV test to all health service users (universal approach) or those meeting specific symptomatic, behavioural or country-of-origin criteria (targeted approach) [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>While most countries with generalised epidemics have quickly adopted universal PITC policies [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], in high income countries with concentrated epidemics, universal testing recommendations are being issued more progressively. The United States pioneered the approach with the revised 2006 <italic>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</italic> (CDC) HIV testing guidelines, calling for routine HIV screening amongst adults in all health care settings with HIV prevalence above 0.1% [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Two years later, UK guidelines recommended the systematic offer of an HIV test to patients aged 15&#x02013;59 years registering in general practice in areas with HIV prevalence above 0.2% [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In 2009, the <italic>French National Authority for Health</italic> recommended untargeted routine screening of the 15&#x02013;70 year-old population [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. More recently, the <italic>Spanish Ministry of Health</italic> has also issued recommendations to expand the systematic offer of HIV testing at health facilities beyond symptomatic and behavioural criteria [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The global switch from VCT to PITC approaches has been accompanied by some ethical controversy [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Besides the risk of undesirable social consequences derived from an HIV+ diagnosis, it has been argued that the social status of medical professionals and tendency to obey authority could compromise the voluntariness that should underpin informed consent procedures [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Targeted PITC for migrant populations disproportionally affected by HIV has also been questioned: the selective offer of an HIV test ultimately based on skin colour and/or other physiognomic characteristics may be &#x0201c;epidemiologically tempting&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] but there are worries that it is potentially discriminatory. For example, the <italic>African HIV Policy Network</italic> has raised concerns about the potentially stigmatising effects derived from screening populations for HIV on the basis of prevalence data [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the <italic>UK National AIDS Trust</italic> has highlighted the importance of scaling up HIV prevention for ethnic minorities, but in a way that prevents people from feeling &#x0201c;targeted&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;singled out&#x0201d; as a risk group for HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In Belgium, targeted PITC for sub-Saharan migrants was seen as discriminatory practice and HPs feared accusations of racism. Many reported that testing undocumented patients who would subsequently not be able to access treatment was unethical [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the UK, HPs thought that ethnic minority users would perceive their offer to test for HIV as a moral judgement if the universal nature of the approach was not clear [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Migrants often face overlapping vulnerabilities where ethnicity, socio-economic, and legal disadvantages operate synergistically to multiply the potential detrimental effects of a positive diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This can be further exacerbated in contexts of economic downturn, with shrinking health care and social services budgets. In Spain, as part of the austerity measures that accompanied the economic recession, a decree-law in 2012 excluded undocumented migrants from full healthcare entitlements [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], which raises concerns about the humanitarian and epidemiological consequences of restricting care for the most vulnerable at times when it is most needed [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. More recently, irregular migrants&#x02019; entitlements to health care have been partially reinstituted in this country [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>A significant percentage of MSM in Europe with HIV+ diagnoses are foreign-born [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Individuals affected by both ethnic and sexual orientation discrimination have been reported to &#x0201c;posses a dual minority status&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and may be particularly vulnerable to HIV infection [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, migrant MSM often remain &#x0201c;invisible&#x0201d; in discussions about HIV [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In Spain, Latin America is the most common region of origin amongst foreign-born HIV cases [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and LA transgender women (TW)&#x02014;often grouped as part of the broad MSM population but with distinctive characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]&#x02014;bear an extremely high burden of the disease [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], with prevalence rates above 17% [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>The success of PITC in identifying new HIV cases relies on its effectiveness in reaching individuals most at risk [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

Amidst concerns over the suitability and sustainability of PITC [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], careful assessments of users&#x02019; and providers&#x02019; views are needed to monitor adherence to the principles underpinning the rights-based response to HIV: Consent, Counselling, Connection to prevention, care and treatment, Correct test results, and Confidentiality. According to these principles, all HIV testing services should include pre-test information, post-test counselling, linkage to appropriate HIV prevention, care and treatment services, quality HIV testing, and accurate test results and diagnosis [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>This qualitative study examines HIV testing experiences and perceptions about PITC amongst MSM and transgender females of LA origin as well as HPs&#x02019; current practice offering HIV tests to migrants in Spain. We provide empirical qualitative data to contribute to current debates on the adequacy of PITC to identify new HIV cases with specific attention to the World Health Organisation&#x02019;s (WHO) essential 5Cs principles. Our aim is to inform HIV testing policies in Spain and other countries that are implementing PITC approaches where HIV disproportionally affects migrants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>This qualitative study consisted of 32 in-depth interviews and 8 group discussions with a total of 38 MSM and TW originating from 14 different Latin American (LA) countries, as well as 21 health professionals providing care to migrant populations.

These included lightly structured individual interviews that employed time-lines to recall testing trajectories, semi-structured interviews, and participatory group discussions that employed a matrix covering various dimensions of diverse testing modalities. The initial guidelines where developed by BA (for facility-based health workers) and BN/FB (for users and community-based professionals). The final guidelines were refined through several rounds of comments and various meetings with the whole data collection team.</p><p>Recordings of interviews and group discussions were transcribed and reviewed when necessary. All the field workers filled-in debriefing forms after each of the activities, which they then discussed with the principal investigator (MR). The team met periodically throughout the whole data collection process in order to identify timely emerging topics and subsequently adapt data collection tools within an iterative research design, in which the data collected informed subsequent stages of the research process. As the first transcripts became available the PI provided individualised feedback to each field-worker, fostering self-reflexivity and highlighting the importance of posing follow-up questions to allow for greater depth of data and further investigation of emerging hypothesis with due attention to disconfirming evidence. All the transcripts and notes were imported into the qualitative software package Nvivo-10. We developed a coding framework to systematically examine the pros and cons of different HIV testing dimensions and modalities. The dimensions analysed were based on the 5Cs WHO principles and included consent, counselling, connection to treatment, correctness of results and confidentiality. The modalities were PITC, VCT, community-based testing (mobile units), pharmacy-based and self-testing. The coding framework was systematically applied to all the data and flexibly adapted to account for emerging themes. The senior author (MR) coded and analysed the data, and interpreted the findings with input from the rest of the team.</p><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona Ethical Committee Board (CEIC). At the recruitment stage all prospective participants were informed in detail about the overall aim of the project, the approach used and their expected role. Because we recruited participants regardless of their HIV status there was no risk of involuntarily disclosing individuals' serological profiles (although some participants spontaneously disclosed to researchers their HIV+ status). We administered informed consent procedures in a language that suited the participants' level of understanding and verbal consent was obtained from all participants. When consent to record was not provided we took detailed notes. Sharing of personal information during group sessions was discouraged and we stated explicitly the boundaries of the potential support to be offered by the project. No photos of individuals were taken without consent. We did not provide any remuneration. Minors under the age of 18 were not included in the study population. As this study carried a minimal risk, verbal consent and/or attendance and participation in the activities was considered sufficient proof of consent by the ethical committee board.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec007"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Acceptability of PITC</title><p>The offer of an HIV test as part of routine medical encounters was generally perceived in positive terms.

For the majority of users interviewed, health facilities were convenient testing venues and the offer of an HIV test by a HP was appreciated. Many users reported that PITC was the testing modality that offered the greatest advantages in terms of convenience, reliability and confidentiality suggesting that it is a promising approach to promote testing amongst foreign-born sexual minorities who are reluctant to attend community-based services. However, HPs&#x02019; reports suggest that endorsement of and adherence to the 5Cs principles underpinning the WHO rights-based response to HIV varied widely across health settings. Counselling was often skipped, confidentiality could not be strictly safeguarded, and a few HPs acknowledged testing users for HIV without asking for consent. Linkage to treatment was a time-consuming process, further complicated by uncertainties and confusion in the case of undocumented migrants. In spite of&#x02014;and sometimes because of&#x02014;questionable adherence to some of the 5Cs principles, PITC continued to be acceptable for most users, suggesting that instances of poor adherence to ethical standards in HIV testing services could remain uncontested. Widespread claims that HIV testing should be normalised coexisted with blaming and moralising attitudes amongst both users and providers, which continued to frame HIV as an exceptional disease. The operational challenges identified point to shortcomings in the range of services that should be provided together with HIV testing [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and suggest a call for caution in the implementation of PITC in contexts were persisting and overlapping sources of HIV stigma coexist with partial endorsement of the core principles underpinning the rights-based response to HIV.</p><p>The majority of foreign-born sexual-minority participants consulted in our study appreciated a HPs&#x02019; offer to test for HIV as a way of avoiding the embarrassment of &#x0201c;asking for it&#x0201d; and being qualified as both &#x0201c;promiscuous&#x0201d; and an &#x0201c;abuser&#x0201d; of the entitlements granted to them as foreigners. Our findings suggest that PITC was often framed as &#x0201c;good care&#x0201d; and that the medical context inherent in PITC facilitated the uptake of HIV tests [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Other studies of patients&#x02019; perceptions also suggest that PITC is generally acceptable to migrants and ethnic minorities [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In the UK, black patients were more likely to accept a rapid HIV test offer as part of a new patient heath check-up than other users [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In Finland, 92% of migrants from various socio-demographic backgrounds accepted the offer [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and in Spain a PITC intervention that included migrants amongst other targeted populations was successful in reaching new foreign-born testers [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].</p><p>While generally acceptable, we identified a number of challenges in the operational implementation of PITC and varying degrees of adherence to the 5Cs principles that merit attention.</p><p>Informed consent procedures varied widely across health settings. In certain sites these seemed to be systematically applied while in others a <italic>culture</italic> of testing users for HIV without informing them seemed to prevail. Similar concerns have been raised in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A remarkable finding of our study is that PITC continued to be acceptable for many of the users interviewed in spite of this shortcoming. In fact, several deemed compulsory testing to be acceptable on public health grounds. Along similar lines, although pre-counselling and post-counselling sessions for HIV-negative cases were frequently skipped, failure to provide counselling was not judged negatively by users. On the contrary, many appreciated facility-based testing precisely because it allowed them to bypass counselling. However, we also identified important gaps in knowledge and some participants&#x02019; attempts to cover these through alternative and sometimes misguided sources of information derived from the internet. As HIV testing is increasingly offered, it is important to ensure that all testers are adequately informed about the disease and its treatment. Counselling formats, contents and procedures should be tailored to meet the needs of frequent testers and those of users who attend health facilities for reasons unrelated to HIV.</p><p>Communicating an HIV+ result posed a major emotional burden for many HPs. Linking HIV+ patients to care and treatment, especially undocumented migrants, was a time-consuming process that HPs navigated amidst confusion about actual health care entitlements for undocumented migrants in Spain. The costs in terms of the time that HPs need to successfully link patients to treatment should be accounted for as part of PITC programmes. Special attention should be paid to facilities in areas where the largest number of new HIV+ cases are likely to be identified. Clear information about migrants&#x02019; entitlements to treatment should be provided so that perceived barriers for accessing treatment do not hinder HIV test uptake.</p><p>For the majority of users interviewed, health facilities were trustworthy institutions that offered the best guarantee of accuracy and privacy. However, HPs acknowledged that it was impossible to guarantee strict confidentiality and some users feared the negative legislative, occupational or fiscal consequences of an eventual HIV+ result that was not kept confidential (&#x0201c;all the data is linked&#x0201d;). Our findings are consistent with a literature review showing that fears of confidentiality gaps are amongst the most common reasons for not testing for HIV in high income countries [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As PITC is more broadly implemented, it is of paramount importance to ensure sustained trust in the health care system. Strategies deployed to communicate test results that &#x0201c;cheat users a bit&#x0201d; (E.g. asking an HIV+ user for consent to test for HIV <italic>after</italic> the test has already been performed) could undermine this crucial factor to effectively promote HIV uptake amongst migrants [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p><p>Universal PITC policies were originally conceptualised to routinise and hence destigmatise the testing process through non-targeted testing but adherence to universal PITC guidelines is generally patchy [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. HIV test coverage remains low in many locations and the test offer is often targeted as opposed to routinely applied. Concerns that screening will still be targeted at certain groups based on HPs&#x02019; judgement of their behaviours, sexuality or ethnicity have been raised in previous qualitative studies [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In practice, a blurred line separates universal from targeted PITC approaches. While users in our study appreciated the offer of the test and were generally not concerned about &#x0201c;being targeted&#x0201d;, it is important to identify potential negative impacts on rates of acceptance of HIV test offers that may result from broader implementation of PITC approaches, and to monitor perceptions amongst other migrant populations whose views may differ. In some settings the offer of the test is generally accepted by migrant and ethnic minorities [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] but in others the suitability of the approach to reach ethnic minorities has been questioned. In a community health centre of the Bronx in New York, for example, 65% of the patients that had been offered a test&#x02014;mostly black and Hispanic&#x02014;declined the offer [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. If the persons most likely to be infected are also those most likely to refuse the offer to test for HIV, the suitability of PITC to reduce late diagnosis will be compromised. The failure to identify new HIV infections in the Bronx study, which is amongst the areas with the highest HIV prevalence in New York, illustrates the risk of failure of PITC approaches if individuals most at risk decline the offer to test, no new cases are identified, and HPs develop &#x0201c;testing fatigue&#x0201d; within a vicious circle that would make them reluctant to sustain the extra effort of continuing to offer the HIV test in accordance with the 5Cs [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Even in settings where high acceptance rates amongst migrants are reported, it should be considered that language barriers and scarcity of interpreters could partly explain the low HIV test refusal rates in populations with poor understanding of the local language [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The limited power that certain persons may have to decline HIV test offers fed the debate on the implementation of PITC in sub-Saharan African settings [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and should not be overlooked as a potential explanation in concentrated epidemics. Patient-provider power imbalances may be particularly relevant for sexual and ethnic minority users in contexts where health care entitlements are granted and retrieved by decree-law and their actual access to services ultimately depend on the good-will and perseverance of health professionals.</p><p>In our study widespread claims that HIV testing should be normalised coexisted with blaming and moralising attitudes that continued to frame HIV as an exceptional disease. This is in agreement with studies conducted in generalised epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The high levels of internalised sexual minority stigma that we identified have been associated with poor HIV test uptake in other settings [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and could explain the frequently reported preference for ordinary health venues as opposed to mobile HIV testing units or testing sites &#x0201c;for gays&#x0201d;. Still, it should be considered that many MSM prefer to test in community-based settings [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and mobile units are suitable testing sites for those less concerned about stigma [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], which calls for continued support for different HIV testing modalities.</p><p>As PITC is more broadly implemented, robust monitoring systems are needed to allow for an early identification of challenges and timely introduction of corrective measures. Key populations may be more susceptible to coerced testing so it is particularly important that HP emphasize the voluntary nature of HIV testing and the user&#x02019;s right to decline [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. As reiterated by WHO and UNAIDS, endorsement of PITC is not an endorsement of coercive HIV testing and all individuals should receive sufficient information to make an informed and voluntary decision to be tested [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Larger studies based on exit interviews with patients would help us to understand the extent to which consent is actually skipped and how procedures are applied in practice. The wide array of participatory process evaluation tools developed as a response to the HIV emergency in countries with generalised epidemics [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] could be adapted to inform HIV testing recommendations in Europe. The many-layered challenges faced by HPs should be considered for a better understanding of how they pragmatically manage the tensions between the theoretical constructs implicit in HIV testing guidelines and the day-to-day constrains they face, such as lack of time and insufficient preparation to deliver HIV+ test results. International guidance recommends that the counselling skills of HPs providing HIV testing services to foreign born vulnerable populations should be strengthened, together with their capacities to obtain informed consent, protect confidentiality and not discriminate [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. While guidelines and training programmes targeting professionals&#x02019; knowledge and skills are needed, it is also essential to address structural limitations and broader institutional cultures [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The exceptionalism of HIV testing was the response&#x02014;and not the cause&#x02014;of the exceptional stigma ascribed to the disease, so it should not be expected that normalising testing procedures would in itself normalise HIV. Ethical scrutiny and human rights monitoring is needed to warrant adequate implementation of the approach.</p><p>Our results should be interpreted with caution. Most participants had undergone HIV testing at health facilities or mobile units so we only gathered superficial data about other testing modalities, including testing at recreational venues and pharmacies, and self-testing. Complacency bias might have resulted from the association of this research to a major public institution providing medical services, including ART treatment. However this was minimised by recruiting participants through community associations and conducting the interviews away from health facilities and in two different towns. We did not provide any remuneration to study participants, which may have fostered the participation of persons holding more positive attitudes. The views of most vulnerable persons are under-documented, as they are probably less likely take part in time-consuming and demanding research. Nonetheless, few qualitative studies have so far focused on MSM from ethnic minorities, and in spite of the extraordinary HIV burden carried by transgender women, this is amongst the few studies that disaggregates this population from the broader MSM population. We acknowledge that we did not reach data saturation, mostly because recruiting and engaging TW was more time-consuming than initially envisaged and it was not feasible to continue to gather data within the time-scale of this study. Clearly, further studies are needed to gather additional insights into the specific needs of a neglected population whose needs are persistently overlooked in spite of their enormous vulnerability to HIV acquisition, and the detrimental social consequences related to it [<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0150223.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusion</title><p>PITC offers a good opportunity to reach sexual minority migrants holding high levels of internalised stigma during routine medical consultations but extra efforts are needed to safeguard the rights of the most vulnerable in contexts where overlapping stigmas coexist with limited endorsement of right-based principles.
