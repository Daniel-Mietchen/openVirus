<p>We developed five different field-work guidelines carefully tailored to gather insights from various types of participants (professionals working at health facilities, community-based workers, users) through different interview modalities. These included lightly structured individual interviews that employed time-lines to recall testing trajectories, semi-structured interviews, and participatory group discussions that employed a matrix covering various dimensions of diverse testing modalities. The initial guidelines where developed by BA (for facility-based health workers) and BN/FB (for users and community-based professionals). The final guidelines were refined through several rounds of comments and various meetings with the whole data collection team.</p>
