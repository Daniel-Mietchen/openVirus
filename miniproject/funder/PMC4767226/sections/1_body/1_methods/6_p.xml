<p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Hospital Clinic-University of Barcelona Ethical Committee Board (CEIC). At the recruitment stage all prospective participants were informed in detail about the overall aim of the project, the approach used and their expected role. Because we recruited participants regardless of their HIV status there was no risk of involuntarily disclosing individuals' serological profiles (although some participants spontaneously disclosed to researchers their HIV+ status). We administered informed consent procedures in a language that suited the participants' level of understanding and verbal consent was obtained from all participants. When consent to record was not provided we took detailed notes. Sharing of personal information during group sessions was discouraged and we stated explicitly the boundaries of the potential support to be offered by the project. No photos of individuals were taken without consent. We did not provide any remuneration. Minors under the age of 18 were not included in the study population. As this study carried a minimal risk, verbal consent and/or attendance and participation in the activities was considered sufficient proof of consent by the ethical committee board.</p>
