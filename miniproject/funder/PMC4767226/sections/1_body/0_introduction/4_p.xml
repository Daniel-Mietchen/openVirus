<p>The global switch from VCT to PITC approaches has been accompanied by some ethical controversy [

 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Besides the risk of undesirable social consequences derived from an HIV+ diagnosis, it has been argued that the social status of medical professionals and tendency to obey authority could compromise the voluntariness that should underpin informed consent procedures [

 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Targeted PITC for migrant populations disproportionally affected by HIV has also been questioned: the selective offer of an HIV test ultimately based on skin colour and/or other physiognomic characteristics may be “epidemiologically tempting” [

 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] but there are worries that it is potentially discriminatory. For example, the 
 <italic>African HIV Policy Network</italic> has raised concerns about the potentially stigmatising effects derived from screening populations for HIV on the basis of prevalence data [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and the 
 <italic>UK National AIDS Trust</italic> has highlighted the importance of scaling up HIV prevention for ethnic minorities, but in a way that prevents people from feeling “targeted” or “singled out” as a risk group for HIV infection [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In Belgium, targeted PITC for sub-Saharan migrants was seen as discriminatory practice and HPs feared accusations of racism. Many reported that testing undocumented patients who would subsequently not be able to access treatment was unethical [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the UK, HPs thought that ethnic minority users would perceive their offer to test for HIV as a moral judgement if the universal nature of the approach was not clear [
