<p>Despite progress towards universal HIV treatment access, the uptake of HIV testing has remained low in areas with generalised epidemics [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and high-income countries with epidemics concentrated in men who have sex with men (MSM), injecting drug users (IDU), sex workers (SW), and migrants [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recent estimates report that about a half of people with HIV remain unaware of their HIV status [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This is particularly disturbing in a context where the adoption of a 
 <italic>Test and Treat</italic> approach—implying frequent universal testing and immediate initiation of antiretroviral treatment (ART)—has been heralded as the solution to HIV transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]; and challenges the achievement of the ambitious 90-90-90 targets proposed by UNAIDS: by 2020, 90% of people with HIV should be aware of their infection, 90% of people diagnosed with HIV should be linked to antiretroviral treatment (ART), and 90% of those on ART should adhere and have undetectable levels of HIV in their blood [
