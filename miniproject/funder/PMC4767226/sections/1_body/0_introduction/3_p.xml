<p>While most countries with generalised epidemics have quickly adopted universal PITC policies [

 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], in high income countries with concentrated epidemics, universal testing recommendations are being issued more progressively. The United States pioneered the approach with the revised 2006 
 <italic>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</italic> (CDC) HIV testing guidelines, calling for routine HIV screening amongst adults in all health care settings with HIV prevalence above 0.1% [

 <italic>French National Authority for Health</italic> recommended untargeted routine screening of the 15–70 year-old population [
