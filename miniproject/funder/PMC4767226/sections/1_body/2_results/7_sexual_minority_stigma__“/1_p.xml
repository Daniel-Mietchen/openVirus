<p>Most study participants held ambivalent views and the widespread claim that HIV should be treated as a “normal” disease co-existed with explicit acknowledgement that it was exceptionally charged with stigma. A HP who said that HIV testing should be performed without asking for consent as a means to normalise the disease, later on explained that his HIV+ colleagues were treated in a different town for fear of stigma. Users originating from countries where “the government publicised that homosexuality was damaging for society” exhibited particularly high levels of self-stigma and often blamed sexual minorities for promiscuous and irresponsible sexual behaviour exacerbated by the use of sex-enhancement drugs. Many reported that HIV continued to be seen as a disease that affected “strange”, “careless” and “dirty-minded” people as a result of their free choice for deviant behaviours (“you get it if you want”). Several MSM participants referred to “fags” as “cochinos” (pigs), “disgusting”, and “irresponsible” people who spread the disease and prioritise their own sexual pleasure over others’ people’s rights to remain uninfected. Some foreign-born MSM severely criticised in moralising terms what they perceived as liberal sexual attitudes and openly effeminate manners of local MSM.</p>
