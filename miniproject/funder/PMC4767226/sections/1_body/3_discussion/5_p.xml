<p>Communicating an HIV+ result posed a major emotional burden for many HPs. Linking HIV+ patients to care and treatment, especially undocumented migrants, was a time-consuming process that HPs navigated amidst confusion about actual health care entitlements for undocumented migrants in Spain. The costs in terms of the time that HPs need to successfully link patients to treatment should be accounted for as part of PITC programmes. Special attention should be paid to facilities in areas where the largest number of new HIV+ cases are likely to be identified. Clear information about migrantsâ€™ entitlements to treatment should be provided so that perceived barriers for accessing treatment do not hinder HIV test uptake.</p>
