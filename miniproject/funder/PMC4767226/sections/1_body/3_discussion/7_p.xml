<p>Universal PITC policies were originally conceptualised to routinise and hence destigmatise the testing process through non-targeted testing but adherence to universal PITC guidelines is generally patchy [

 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. HIV test coverage remains low in many locations and the test offer is often targeted as opposed to routinely applied. Concerns that screening will still be targeted at certain groups based on HPs’ judgement of their behaviours, sexuality or ethnicity have been raised in previous qualitative studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In practice, a blurred line separates universal from targeted PITC approaches. While users in our study appreciated the offer of the test and were generally not concerned about “being targeted”, it is important to identify potential negative impacts on rates of acceptance of HIV test offers that may result from broader implementation of PITC approaches, and to monitor perceptions amongst other migrant populations whose views may differ. In some settings the offer of the test is generally accepted by migrant and ethnic minorities [

 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] but in others the suitability of the approach to reach ethnic minorities has been questioned. In a community health centre of the Bronx in New York, for example, 65% of the patients that had been offered a test—mostly black and Hispanic—declined the offer [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. If the persons most likely to be infected are also those most likely to refuse the offer to test for HIV, the suitability of PITC to reduce late diagnosis will be compromised. The failure to identify new HIV infections in the Bronx study, which is amongst the areas with the highest HIV prevalence in New York, illustrates the risk of failure of PITC approaches if individuals most at risk decline the offer to test, no new cases are identified, and HPs develop “testing fatigue” within a vicious circle that would make them reluctant to sustain the extra effort of continuing to offer the HIV test in accordance with the 5Cs [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Even in settings where high acceptance rates amongst migrants are reported, it should be considered that language barriers and scarcity of interpreters could partly explain the low HIV test refusal rates in populations with poor understanding of the local language [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The limited power that certain persons may have to decline HIV test offers fed the debate on the implementation of PITC in sub-Saharan African settings [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and should not be overlooked as a potential explanation in concentrated epidemics. Patient-provider power imbalances may be particularly relevant for sexual and ethnic minority users in contexts where health care entitlements are granted and retrieved by decree-law and their actual access to services ultimately depend on the good-will and perseverance of health professionals.
