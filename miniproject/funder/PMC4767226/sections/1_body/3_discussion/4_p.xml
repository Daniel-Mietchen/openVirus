<p>Informed consent procedures varied widely across health settings. In certain sites these seemed to be systematically applied while in others a 
 <italic>culture</italic> of testing users for HIV without informing them seemed to prevail. Similar concerns have been raised in other studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0150223.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A remarkable finding of our study is that PITC continued to be acceptable for many of the users interviewed in spite of this shortcoming. In fact, several deemed compulsory testing to be acceptable on public health grounds. Along similar lines, although pre-counselling and post-counselling sessions for HIV-negative cases were frequently skipped, failure to provide counselling was not judged negatively by users. On the contrary, many appreciated facility-based testing precisely because it allowed them to bypass counselling. However, we also identified important gaps in knowledge and some participantsâ€™ attempts to cover these through alternative and sometimes misguided sources of information derived from the internet. As HIV testing is increasingly offered, it is important to ensure that all testers are adequately informed about the disease and its treatment. Counselling formats, contents and procedures should be tailored to meet the needs of frequent testers and those of users who attend health facilities for reasons unrelated to HIV.
