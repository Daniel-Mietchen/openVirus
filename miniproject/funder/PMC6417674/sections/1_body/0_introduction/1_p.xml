<p>Influenza-like illnesses (ILI), often also called acute respiratory infection or flu-like syndrome, are acute viral infections of the respiratory tract with similar signs and symptoms to influenza. ILI is a syndrome and affected persons may become infectious before, during or after the onset of symptoms.
