<p>The ILI surveillance system aims to detect early unusual events indicating a change in circulating influenza sub-types, identify and monitor vulnerable groups for influenza, determine influenza thresholds and detect antiviral resistance.

This raised concerns about the effectiveness of the influenza surveillance system, particularly that in the Greater Accra region of Ghana, which recorded no alerts over the past five years. We evaluated the effectiveness of the ILI sentinel surveillance system to determine if its objectives are being met and to assess its attributes and usefulness. The findings of this study are important in order to give useful recommendations to improve the current system.
