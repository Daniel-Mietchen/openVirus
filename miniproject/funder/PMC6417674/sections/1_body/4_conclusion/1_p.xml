<p>In spite of the usefulness and fair performance of ILI surveillance in GAR on indicators evaluated, it is only partially meeting its set objectives. It is sensitive in detecting circulating influenza types, representative of the population under surveillance and timely. However, sentinel sites do not consistently meet annual case detection quotas. There is the need to address shortfalls in the system’s objectives as well as improving case detection at sentinel facilities. This would ensure that the successes chocked are not undermined, thereby preventing increasing morbidity and mortality related to influenza infections. Failure of the system to address these shortfalls would also affect Ghana’s contribution to the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System. Considering the zoonotic character of most influenza viruses, it is important that a One Health approach is adopted with influenza surveillance in Ghana. We propose strict adherence to case detection targets by individual sentinel sites and determination of alert thresholds for the system to allow for a more effective monitoring of influenza activity in the region for prompt public health actions.</p>
