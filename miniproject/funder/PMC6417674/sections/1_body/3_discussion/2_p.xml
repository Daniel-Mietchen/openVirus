<p>Our study provides evidence, that the ILI sentinel surveillance system in the Greater Accra Region (GAR), Ghana, is only partially meeting its objectives because it did not have thresholds for alerting the health system and does not perform antiviral resistance testing. It is sensitive and timely in detecting influenza cases but of low predictive value positive (PVP). It is representative of the population under surveillance and flexible to modifications. The system is fairly stable and acceptable to key stakeholders; the quality of data is relatively high. Predominant influenza subtype in circulation is influenza A (H3N2) virus. The sentinel sites consistently failed to meet their case detection quotas annually over the period evaluated. Despite these apparent weaknesses in the ILI system, the good performance of the laboratory component is commendable and key to detection of novel influenza viruses for prompt response. Even though the WHOâ€™s standards for influenza surveillance alluded to the possibility of resource limitation hindering achievement of all influenza surveillance system objectives, it advocates for influenza surveillance systems capable of collecting the minimum amount of data needed for decision making [
