<p>In Ghana, the timeliness of the system in case detection, laboratory confirmation and result dissemination is commendable. This strength may be as result of the weekly visits NIC makes to sentinel sites to collect specimen, supply virus transport media in specimen bottles and transfer results. The NIC should further take advantage of these visits and collaborative meetings to ensure each site meets weekly case detection quotas. Focal persons at the various sites must take the lead.</p>
