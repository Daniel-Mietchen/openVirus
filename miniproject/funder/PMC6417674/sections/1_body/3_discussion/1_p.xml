<p>Influenza causes considerable morbidity and about 500,000 deaths per year globally. The disease is highly infectious with high pandemic potential. Therefore, worldwide surveillance systems to record Influenza-like illnesses (ILI) in real time and detect possible influenza outbreaks are essential to prevent and control epidemics. Ghana’s ILI surveillance system since its inception in 2007, aims to early detect changes in circulating influenza, identify vulnerable groups to influenza infection, determine influenza thresholds and detect antiviral resistance to influenza viruses. The late detection of a pandemic influenza outbreak in Ghana raised doubts about the ILI surveillance system’s performance.</p>
