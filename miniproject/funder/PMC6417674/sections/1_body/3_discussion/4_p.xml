<p>Nevertheless, the unmet objectives, lack of thresholds and antiviral resistance testing, of the system require attention. The lack of antiviral resistance testing to detect the emergence of treatment resistant strains and the absence of thresholds preventing the issuing of alerts, are a major drawback. This situation is not specific to the GAR alone but is found in all sites in Ghana. In addition, the mainly conservative management of clinical signs and symptoms, of confirmed influenza cases in the health system, without the use of recommended antiviral agents, may partly explain the absence of antiviral susceptibility testing. These shortfalls may, however, be caused by a lack of capacity or resources (antiviral drugs and laboratory reagents) at the sentinel facilities to determine thresholds for influenza alerts and test for antiviral resistance, as was observed in evaluations done in other settings [
