<p>Even though implementing an integrated (human and animal) surveillance could be cost-effective and improve case detection and response [
 <xref rid="pone.0213627.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], discussions with ILI surveillance personnel at sentinel sites revealed the absence of a link between influenza surveillance in humans and animals. Human infection with zoonotic influenza strains is possible and may cause mild to severe form of the disease. There have been recorded episodes of pandemics in humans over a century due to cross-species transmission of zoonotic respiratory viruses including influenza viruses, notably Spanish flu (1918), severe acute respiratory syndrome (2003) and swine flu (2009), resulting in high morbidity and mortality globally [

Thus, the importance of a One-Health approach in the surveillance and response with control of pandemics in an increasingly globalized world is evident. Research findings in Africa, Europe and the Americas, have shown incremental gains derived when interventions are integrated between human and animal health systems [

The NIC and Veterinary Service Department in Ghana should collaborate to formalize protocols for engaging each other to integrate influenza surveillance systems in humans and animals, using a One Health approach, as this can provide additional key information on possible cross-species transmission in the country and enhance savings. The usage of one laboratory to test for both human and animal pathogens in Canada was shown to cost about 30% less than the combined original operational costs of testing individually in both laboratories [
