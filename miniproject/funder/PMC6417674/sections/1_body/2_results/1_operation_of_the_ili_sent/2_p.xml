<p>We found that data on patients meeting the ILI case definition (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213627.s002">S2 Table</xref>) from the sentinel sites are collected together with nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal specimen. Specimen are stored in sample bottles with Virus Transport Media (VTM) in a cold chain system and submitted to NMIMR for laboratory confirmation. Each site is required to suspect five cases weekly using the case definition. Thus, the expected annual total for each site is 260 suspected cases.
