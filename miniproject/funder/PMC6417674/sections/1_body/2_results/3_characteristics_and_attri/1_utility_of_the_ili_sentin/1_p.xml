<p>The ILI surveillance system has four objectives: early detect events that show change in severity or patterns of influenza infection or emergence of new strains, determine influenza thresholds, identify and monitor at risk groups and detect antiviral resistance in circulating strains. The system met two out of its four objectives over the period evaluated. It was able to detect and characterize influenza viruses in circulation, as from influenza A and B lineages, and established the groups of persons most at risk of influenza infection. It however did not set thresholds, which is the minimum number of suspected cases above which the system is alerted, and was not performing antiviral resistance testing.</p>
