 <bold>Data quality:</bold> Key surveillance information was completely provided in 76% (91/120) of case investigation forms sampled and data extracts were comparable at sentinel facilities and the NIC. In spite of this, only two sites: GARH and Achimota hospital, had 2017 influenza data entered in the DHIMS-2 platform and laboratory results were not entered in ILI registers at the three sites.
