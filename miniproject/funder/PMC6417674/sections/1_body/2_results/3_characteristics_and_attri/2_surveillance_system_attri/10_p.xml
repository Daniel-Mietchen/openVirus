 <bold>Stability:</bold> Data flow in the system conforms to set standards; testing is routinely done within 48 hours after case detection and results are released within 7 days to the sites on average. The system is sustainable with donors mainly funding its operation. There was not a time during the period evaluated when no site recorded cases, but all sites detected cases only for 60% of the period.
