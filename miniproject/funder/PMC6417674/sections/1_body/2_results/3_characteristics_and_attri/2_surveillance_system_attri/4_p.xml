 <bold>Simplicity:</bold> Surveillance personnel interviewed identified case definition to be simple. Only OPDs partake in ILI surveillance and follow-up of confirmed cases done within 5 days. However, specialized training is required for specimen collection and laboratory confirmation, data collected on each suspected case is comprehensive and laboratory testing is not done at sentinel sites.
