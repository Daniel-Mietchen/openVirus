<p>The evaluation was conducted using the CDCs guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0213627.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Nine attributes: simplicity, flexibility, data quality, acceptability, sensitivity, predictive value positive, representativeness, timeliness and stability, usefulness and the utility of the system to achieve its objectives were evaluated. The indicators for each attribute or characteristic measured were scored one point each. Based on the evaluatorâ€™s assessment, an indicator is scored zero (0) if the key finding from evaluation do not support the indicator assessed in relation to the attribute. A score of one (1) is given to each indicator that supports the attribute assessed. The assessment scores were then summed and divided by the total number of indicators used in evaluating each attribute. Attributes with relative scores of more than two-thirds of the total score, were considered as major strengths of the system and scored 3 overall. Those with less than one-third were major weaknesses (Overall score = 1). Scores between one-third and two-thirds were relative strengths (Overall score = 2). Scores were on a scale of 1 to 3: poorest to best performance, respectively.
