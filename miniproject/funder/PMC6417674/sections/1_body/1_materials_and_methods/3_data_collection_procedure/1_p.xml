<p>Data on ILI from all six sentinel facilities in GAR was extracted and abstracted from the NIC database into Microsoft Office Excel format. Additionally, we selected three sentinel facilities, based on the different levels of care they provided, and obtained permission for site visits. These sentinel sites; GARH, Achimota hospital and Manhean Health Center, were visited for at least one week each and their records were collected and reviewed. The researchers interviewed all personnel directly involved in ILI surveillance and also partook in surveillance activities while observing practices.</p>
