<p>An HIV testing algorithm in use by the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program to detect HIV infection in Nigeria was applied in this study. Blood was serially tested with two HIV rapid assays (Trinity Biotech Uni-Gold™ (Co Wicklow, Ireland) and Abbott Determine® (Illinois, USA)). To consider a sample positive for HIV, detection of HIV antibody in both is required. If one test was not conclusive, then a third tie-breaker assay, Chembio STAT-PAK® (New York, USA) diagnostic assay was used. A positive test with the third assay confirmed positive HIV status; otherwise, the case was regarded as HIV negative.</p>
