<p>The early morning smear positive and smear negative samples were cultured in Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tubes (MGIT) as previously described.[
 <xref rid="pone.0191387.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Samples that flagged positive were removed from the machine and inoculated on Blood Agar to check for contamination. Then, a Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) stain was performed to check for the presence of AFB followed by an SD-Bioline rapid test for the rapid identification of M. tuberculosis complex (TB). Samples that failed to show any growth after 42 days of incubation in the machine were removed and classified as negatives. Samples were considered positive for TB if in addition to the positive growth on the MGIT, they showed the presence of AFB on ZN stain and tested positive on the SD-Bioline.
