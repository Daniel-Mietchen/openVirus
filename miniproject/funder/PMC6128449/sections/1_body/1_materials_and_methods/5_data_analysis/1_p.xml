<p>Data from the survey, medical records and laboratory tests were captured into different tables in a Microsoft Access database and applicable error checking keys were enforced at the start of the entry. Statistical analysis software (SAS, version 9.2) was used in the analysis. Missing values and outliers were detected and relevant corrections effected. Frequencies and proportions were computed for the categorical variables. Associations between categorical variables were evaluated with Pearson’s Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test. T-test was used to evaluate differences in the mean between the population groups. P-values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant and all probabilities were two-sided. Effect measures were adjusted by logistic regression analysis in which Odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals were reported.</p>
