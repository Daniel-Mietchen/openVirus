<p>The assays were conducted at the TB reference laboratory established by the Institute of Human Virology, Nigeria (IHVN) at the NTBLTC, Zaria. Sputum samples from presumptive TB patients were evaluated with a testing algorithm that included sputum smear microscopy, cultures in liquid and broth media and then characterized with the Genotype MTBC (Hain) assay [

The smears were then stained with the Ziehl-Nielsen (ZN) technique [
