<p>A total of 1,657 patients presented to both clinics, and of those 1,603 (96.7%) subjects provided informed consent to participate in the study. There were no missing data for the key variables of age, gender, TB and HIV. The median age of the study population was 35 years, inter-quartile range (IQR) = 18. The prevalence of TB, HIV, and TB-HIV coinfection was 23.4% (375/1603), 23.6% (378/1603) and 6.3% (101/1603) respectively. Among the TB cases, 26.9% (101/375) were TB-HIV coinfected. The majority of participants were males, 901 (56.2%), and the TB prevalence was higher compared to females (27.6% vs. 18.0%, p &lt; .0001) while the converse was true for HIV: 29.6% vs 19.0%, p &lt; .0001 (females vs. males). The differences between males and females were statistically significant across other demographic and behavioral characteristics evaluated (
