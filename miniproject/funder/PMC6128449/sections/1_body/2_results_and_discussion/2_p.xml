<p>When the analysis was stratified by age, gender and absolute counts of infection type; differences in disease burden were larger in the younger age group of 25–29 years. Males had a higher burden of TB monoinfection compared to females in this age group: 17.5% vs. 5.5% but had a lower burden of HIV monoinfection: 3.6% vs 13.4% and TB-HIV coinfection: 6.9% vs. 11.9% compared to females (
 <xref rid="pone.0191387.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Females in the 25–29 age group accounted for the highest proportion of persons with dual TB-HIV infection in the study sample analyzed. Tests of significance for these differences in the age group 25–29 years (not shown in Table) showed that males were twice as likely to have TB (OR = 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3–3.9, p = 0.0032) while females were five times more likely to have HIV (OR = 4.8; 95% CI: 2.6–8.9, p &lt; .0001) and twice as likely to have TB-HIV coinfection (OR = 2.1; 95% CI: 0.8–5.4, p = 0.13).
