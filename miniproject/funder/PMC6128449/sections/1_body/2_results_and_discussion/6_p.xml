<p>The high prevalence of HIV monoinfection and TB/HIV coinfection in young females and the direction of the association between female gender and occurrence of TB and HIV towards statistical significance after adjusting for potential confounders could be a reflection of how these two diseases are now spreading rapidly among young females in this setting. It seems probable that TB prevalence among young females is largely driven by HIV. Notification of TB without associated HIV in this group is 16% lower compared to the young males. The findings underscore the importance of provider initiated HIV testing services (HTS) to all presumptive TB cases. The yield of TB-HIV coinfection and the magnitude of the difference across age and gender might have been under reported if HTS was offered only to patients after their TB status was confirmed.</p>
