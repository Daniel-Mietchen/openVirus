<p>Our study has certain limitations, including the cross-sectional design which cannot determine temporal occurrences of TB and HIV in the coinfected subjects; our HIV testing algorithm might have missed cases of acute infections in discordant samples and the findings may only represent TB patients seen at facilities. However, we did not find any subject with discordant HIV tests and the facilities remain the source of primary data for global TB reports and decision making in Nigeria. The major strengths of this study are the large sample size, the utilization of a clearly defined TB testing algorithm that included testing of three separate sputum samples using smear microscopy, cultures in liquid and broth media followed by a genotyping assay; and for detecting HIV, the use of two rapid HIV tests and a third tie-breaker HIV assay if there was discordance between the first two HIV tests.</p>
