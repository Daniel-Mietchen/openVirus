<p>The age distribution of HIV and TB infections is significantly different for males and females. Before the emergence of the HIV epidemic, young females (15 to 34 years) in industrialized countries had higher TB rates than males of the same age.

The objective of this study is to provide insight into age-gender differences in the distribution of TB and HIV among presumptive TB patients in Nigeria.
