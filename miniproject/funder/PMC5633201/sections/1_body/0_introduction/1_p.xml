<p>Arboviruses have become important and constant threats in tropical regions, due to rapid climate change, deforestation, population migration, disorderly occupation of the urban areas, and precarious sanitary conditions that favor viral amplification and transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005959.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Climate fluctuations produce conditions that accelerate arbovirus epidemics, directly affecting global public health [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005959.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Abnormally high temperatures for example, affect populations of insect vectors, and arboviral diseases, by influencing: the survival and replication of the virus, susceptibility of the vector to viruses, distribution of vectors, extrinsic incubation period of a virus in the insect, and seasonality of virus transmission patterns [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005959.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Besides that, arboviruses are highly spreadable because their vectors can be carried long distances, and even between countries or continents, which can lead to pandemics.
