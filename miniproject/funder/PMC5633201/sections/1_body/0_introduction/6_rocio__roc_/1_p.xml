<p>The ROC virus was first isolated in 1975 from a fatal case of encephalitis in a restricted area of the Atlantic Forest (Ribeira River Valley Sao Paulo) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005959.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The case was detected during the 1973â€“1980 outbreak which caused an estimated 1,000 cases of encephalitis in more than 20 municipalities. The mortality rate was 10%, and among the survivors, about 200 suffered balance or mobility sequelae [
