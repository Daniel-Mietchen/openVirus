<p>Despite the availability of a comprehensive record in the literature for these relevant diseases, to the best of our knowledge, no predictive models have been developed in this context. In this study, we analyze and illustrate how these four mosquito-borne diseases can have serious public health implications, or increase their relevance in the future. Thus, the study’s goals were: (a) to obtain the probability of occurrence of ORO, MAY, ROC and SLE in Brazil, based on environmental conditions corresponding to the periods of occurrence of the outbreaks; (b) to describe the macroclimatic scenario in Brazil in the last 50 years, evaluating any detectable tendency to increase temperatures and (c) to predict future expansion of ORO, MAY, SLE and ROC in Brazil, based on future temperature projections for 2046–2065 and 2071–2100, using two different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
