<p>This virus is transmitted among vertebrate hosts, such as marsupials, sloths, primates, and birds, through a generally wild transmission cycle by the 
 <italic>Ochlerotatus serratus</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> mosquitoes. Notably, this arbovirus has adjusted to an urban transmission cycle with humans as the main reservoir and 
 <italic>Culicoides paraensis</italic> (Ceratopogonidae) as the main vector. Thus, there is a worrisome risk of ORO emergence in the densely populated coast of Brazil, which cover the northeastern and southeastern regions, considering that vector 
 <italic>C</italic>. 
 <italic>paraensis</italic> is present in low-altitude areas of the entire Brazilian territory [
