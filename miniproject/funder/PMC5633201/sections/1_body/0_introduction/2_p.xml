<p>Brazil is the largest South American country and has a population of approximately 207 million in an area of 8,514,215 km

For example, approximately 200 different arbovirus species have been isolated in Brazil, including 40 species that can cause human diseases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005959.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although it is acknowledged that dengue, zika, chikungunya, and recently, yellow fever, are today the most important emerging and re-emerging arboviral diseases in Brazil, in this study we focused on others that have been neglected and consequently, are less discussed in medical literature. These include Oropouche (ORO), Mayaro (MAY), Saint Louis (SLE), and Rocio (ROC). Besides the lack of specific tests to identify these diseases, the similarities among the symptoms are very high; fever, for example, is common to all of them. This makes the correct diagnosis very difficult and in most cases may have been underreported.
