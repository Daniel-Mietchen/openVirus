<p>In summary, environmental factors can directly affect the distribution of ORO, MAY, SLE and ROC. Among them, temperature is a central variable that determines the distribution of high-risk areas. As the average temperature of some Brazilian areas has augmented significantly over the last 50 years, a better understanding of the biology of neglected arboviruses, their interactions and consequences in the ecosystem and climatic factors is needed. The four diseases addressed in the present work are clearly a latent menace to the public health and thus should be promptly included in the health programs agenda. Accurate detection and diagnosing are fundamental steps for developing efficient control measures. These four apparently similar arboviruses are differently affected by environmental factors, and these differences are probably linked to the vectorâ€™s lifecycle or associated with the virus itself. We can also conclude that our mathematical and statistical approach allowed us to further describe peculiar environmental elements in the epidemiology of these neglected diseases. Even though, the approach is limited and we suggest that next studies should be multidisciplinary and comprehensive so that they include vector distribution, components of natural cycle and actual disease incidence.</p>
