<p>Overall, this work provides useful indications about the dynamics of those arboviruses across the country. Our results suggest that high-risk areas may change in the coming years, being more pronounced with high GGE rates in the northern region of the country. This is the first spatio-temporal study of these arboviral diseases. However, there are gaps in available knowledge to scientifically predict future occurrences of large epidemics. Due to the epidemiological and entomological situation of several continents, there is evidence of aggravation of this current scenario, because there is great difficulty in eliminating or controlling the risk factors of the diseases.</p>
