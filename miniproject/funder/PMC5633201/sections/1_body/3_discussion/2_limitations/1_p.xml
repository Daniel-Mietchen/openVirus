<p>This study has limitations, since the projections presented here are processed on the assumption that the other variables remained stable. The human population size, for example, was considered as constant in our models. Moreover, we did not consider host migration (of both birds and humans), and the deforestation rate, which are important factors in determining the outbreaks of ORO and SLE. Yet, other factors that were not part of our model could change over the given time period: For example, the quality of vector surveillance, clinical case detection, and the development of some vaccine. Besides that, we did not take into account the distribution areas of the vectors, which are essential for the transmission, but very difficult to estimate. Another point is we used linear extrapolation to predict the distributions of each disease, and our model did not account for non-linear phenomena. For example, the models would fail if temperature increased to the point that it changed the vector transmission rates.</p>
