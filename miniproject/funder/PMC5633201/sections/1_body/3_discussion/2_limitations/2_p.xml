<p>Another limitation is the supposed underreporting of cases and the confusion with other diseases. These neglected arboviruses may be circulating in asymptomatic patients or misdiagnosed and it is not possible to know their exact distribution; this affects directly the predictive power of our model. The model itself also has an intrinsic limitation, because it assumes that the increase in temperature can only be owing to GGE. We know that this is not the only possibility in nature, so this is a simplified premise that limitates interpretations. Although there are a number of constraints to our model, it is an important first step in trying to predict the emergence of these neglected arboviruses. It also serves to warn the vigilant surveillance health that arboviruses may remain longly underestimated before outbreak arises.</p>
