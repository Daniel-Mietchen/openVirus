<p>Our analysis showed that the occurrence of outbreaks of ORO, MAY, SLE and ROC is affected differently by environmental variables, although temperature seems to be strongly associated with all of them. Theses information is quite alarming, since the temporal analyses have shown that the average temperature of some Brazilian areas has been increasing over the decades (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005959.g004">Fig 4</xref>). This variable presents an important constraint on the extent of expansion of these diseases throughout the country, mainly because these changes are intimately linked to vector lifecycle development and associated with the virus itself [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005959.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. In addition, the IPCC report [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005959.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] points out that heat waves are more prone to occur in the next years with more frequency and duration. Furthermore, events of extreme precipitation are also most likely to be more frequent and intense on the continental surfaces, in humid tropical regions such as the North of Brazil. Consequently, climate changes may directly interfere with the distribution of the diseases evaluated in this study, particularly ORO and MAY.
