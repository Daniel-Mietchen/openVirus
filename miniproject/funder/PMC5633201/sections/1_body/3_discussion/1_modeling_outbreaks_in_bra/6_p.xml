<p>By analyzing the distribution maps of the diseases generated by Maxent it was observed that the probable high-risk areas were much larger than those in which the cases were detected. For example, ROC cases were reported only in the Sao Paulo state, but it is possible that there are other areas suitable for other outbreaks, such as a small region observed between the Rondonia and the Mato Grosso states (see

This discrepancy between the reported cases and the existing cases is due mainly to the similarity of the clinical symptoms among those arboviruses, leading to an underestimation of the occurrence of ORO, MAY, SLE and ROC in Brazil. This scenario is aggravated by the lack of accurate diagnostic methods that identify which virus is acting. In cases of acute febrile illness outbreaks of MAY, SLE and ORO, for example, the laboratory procedures for diagnosing suspected cases is indispensable because these pathogens cannot be differentiated from other viral diseases, such as dengue or chikungunya, and may remain unknown [
