<p>By analyzing the results of PCA, it was observed that diseases were grouped into three main clusters: SLE, ROC and ORO+MAY (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005959.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The relationship between ORO and MAY occurred because both diseases are influenced by similar climatic factors, such as seasonality of temperature. Both have high-risk areas in the Northern and Central regions of the country, where the Amazonian biome predominates [

 <italic>paraensis</italic> (Ceratopogonidae) for ORO [

Furthermore, although restricted to the Amazon region, these diseases have the potential to spread throughout the country and around the world, since they affect birds that can move long distances by migration or by illegal wildlife trafficking, which is very common in this region.
