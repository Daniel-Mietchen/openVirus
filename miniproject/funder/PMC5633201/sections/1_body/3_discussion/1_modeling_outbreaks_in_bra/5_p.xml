<p>Similarly, the SLE virus can also be found in migratory birds, and it is believed to be responsible for the spread of the virus throughout the Americas, as well as other encephalitis. However, there are biological and genetic differences between isolates from North and South America [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005959.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The present study revealed that the most important factors for SLE were annual RAIN and DTV, which can also affect the life cycle of the 
 <italic>Culex</italic> vector. For example, greater rainfall results in increasing vegetation coverage, which is the primary food source of many vertebrates that are potential hosts for the mosquitoes. However, decreased precipitation can reduce vegetation and drive both the vertebrate hosts and the mosquitoes towards human settlements, which can increase vector-human contact [
