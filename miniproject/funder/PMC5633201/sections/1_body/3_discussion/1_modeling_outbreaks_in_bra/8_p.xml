<p>According to the predictive model HadGEM2-ES, high-risk areas for all diseases may change in the next decades. For MAY, for example, practically the whole country will have adequate climatic conditions for virus transmission (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005959.g005">Fig 5</xref>). In some cases, such as ORO, total areas of infection will decline, but those that remain, such as the Northwestern and Northeastern regions of the country will be at increased risk. For ROC, there will be an emergent high-risk area in the South of the country, while for SLE the southern areas will become less susceptible to outbreaks. This scenario can be more or less dramatic, and depends on the levels of greenhouse gas emissions. However, this difference in emission rates will most strongly affect ORO and MAY distribution, precisely because they occupy the Northern areas of Brazil and are more susceptible to temperature changes (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005959.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Climatic change also affect human activity and the migration of the people, as well as the redistribution of the vectors, and a more favorable environment for the propagation of arboviruses [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005959.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] and to determine the most efficient technique(s) for protecting humans from these viruses. However, our findings indicate that temperature-related variables appear to play a central role in the epidemiology of culicid-vectored arboviruses.
