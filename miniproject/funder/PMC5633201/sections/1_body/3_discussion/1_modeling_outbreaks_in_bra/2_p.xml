<p>The increase in temperature may also change the distribution of virus vectors, because they may migrate to other areas where conditions are favorable for proliferation. In some cases, the elevation has an inverse effect on the temperature, because generally, higher altitudes correspond with lower temperatures; nevertheless, some vectors are adaptable. In Mexico, the vector 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> for example, has been found at an elevation of 2,000 meters whereas previously, it was only found in places up to 1,000 meters high [

Following deforestation in the Amazon, and subsequently, the cocoa plantation and others cultivated in the region, the vectors found an ideal spot for reproduction in the cocoa shells, and, expanded their population, spreading the virus to humans along the Amazonian roads [

Therefore, ORO and MAY outbreaks appear to be the result of a strong relationship between the virus and its environment, with human activity (colonization, cocoa cultivation, and subsequent environmental changes) resulting in the proliferation of the Culicidae and Ceratopogonidae mosquito families, and subsequently increasing their human contact [
