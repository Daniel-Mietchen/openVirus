<p>To determine the ecological and climatic conditions associated with ORO, MAY, SLE, and ROC mosquito-borne disease outbreaks, we examined the relationships between the locations of the outbreaks and seven variables: annual rainfall (RAIN, mm), annual temperature (TEMP, °C), elevation (ELEV, m), seasonality of temperature (SEA-TEMP), seasonality of precipitation (SEA-RAIN), thermal amplitude (THER-AMP), and daytime temperature variation (DTV). The SEA-TEMP value was calculated as the standard deviation of the average monthly temperatures. The THERM-AMP value was calculated by subtracting the minimum temperature during the coldest month from the maximum temperature during the hottest month. The SEA-RAIN value was calculated as the coefficient of variation for average monthly precipitation. The mean DTV value was calculated by subtracting the mean minimum temperature from the mean maximum temperature. All weather data were obtained in ASCII-raster format files and using the "LAT/LONG" geodetic coordinate system (Datum WGS-84). These data were obtained from the WorldClim—Global Climate Data database, which contains representative observational data for 1950–2000 that were interpolated to a resolution of 30 arc-seconds (approximately 1 km). As the environmental variables were expressed in various units, the principal components analysis (PCA) was performed after standardizing the variables using a Pearson correlation matrix. The temperature layers for 1970–2010 were obtained from the National Institute of Meteorology [
