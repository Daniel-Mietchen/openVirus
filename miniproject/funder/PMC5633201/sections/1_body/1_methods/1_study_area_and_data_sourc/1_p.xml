<p>The approximate locations of human ORO, MAY, SLE, and ROC cases were determined using sites that were identified in the literature between 1961 and 2012 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005959.t001">Table 1</xref>). Data were exhaustively collected using searches of the PubMed and Google Scholar databases (search term: “Oropouche” OR “Mayaro” OR “Saint Louis” OR “Rocio” AND “Brasil” OR “Brazil”) and the library of University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We have included all records of diseases in Brazilian municipalities reported in epidemiological bulletins since the very first record up until 2012. The criterion for inclusion of a municipality in the analysis was presence ≥ 1 of ORO, MAY, SLE or ROC case. This is because the World Health Organization has stated “
 <italic>a single case of a communicable disease long absent from a population</italic>, 
 <italic>or caused by an agent (e</italic>.
 <italic>g</italic>. 
 <italic>bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area</italic>, 
 <italic>or the emergence of a previously unknown disease</italic>, 
 <italic>may also constitute an outbreak</italic>” [
