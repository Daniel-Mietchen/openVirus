<p>Our analysis included all probable (clinically diagnosed) and confirmed (serological) cases of persons with the onset of the disease from 1961 through to 2012. For each disease, the environmental variables analyzed were those that corresponded with the years of outbreaks: ORO (between 1961 and 2006), MAY (between 1977 and 2012), SLE (between 2004 and 2007) and ROC (1975 and 1976). The database was developed based on the presence and absence of arboviroses. We considered value 
 <bold>1</bold> for years with at least one case (or more) of ORO, MAY, SLE or ROC, and value 
 <bold>zero</bold> for other years (no occurrence), during the period studied (1961 to 2012). 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005959.t001">Table 1</xref> shows the municipalities that had cases of these arboviruses and the years in which they occurred.
