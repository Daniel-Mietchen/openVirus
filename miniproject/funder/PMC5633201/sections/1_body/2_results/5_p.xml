<p>In the case of continuity of this scenario of temperature increase, we generated probability maps with two different climate future projections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005959.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The results reveal a progressively expanding areas with an increased likelihood of ORO, MAY, SLE and ROC cases, especially at the edges of the transmission areas. In scenario of high GGE it was possible to observe the increase of high risk areas for ORO and MAY, while for SLE and ROC there were no drastic changes. This fact is in agreement with our observations of temperature increase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005959.g004">Fig 4</xref>), which the greatest changes occurred precisely in the North region of the country, affecting mainly the distribution of ORO and MAY. We also performed these same analyzes with the GCM MIROC-5 and the results were essentially the same (
