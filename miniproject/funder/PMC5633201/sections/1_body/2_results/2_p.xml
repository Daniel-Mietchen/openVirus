<p>Analyzing each disease separately (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005959.g002">Fig 2</xref>), according to PCA it was possible to perceive that the most influential factors were distinct for each arbovirus. With respect to ORO cases, the most important variables were TEMP and SEA-TEMP; for MAY: THERM-AMP and SEA-TEMP, which was similar to ORO; for SLE: RAIN and DTV, and finally for ROC, the most important variables were THERM-AMP and ELEV. Details are described in
