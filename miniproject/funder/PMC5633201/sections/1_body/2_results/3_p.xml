<p>As some variables co-varied (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005959.g002">Fig 2</xref>), we selected only the non-covariant variables as input for analysis in Maxent software. The cut-off was four variables and was based on ROC, which presented the lowest number (four) of non-covariant variables. After selecting the four most important variables for each disease, we constructed a predictive model in Maxent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005959.g003">Fig 3</xref>), in order to determine what areas were most likely to present outbreaks. The contribution of each variable for each model is described in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0005959.t003">Table 3</xref>. The final model for ORO, MAY, SLE and ROC had an area under the curve of 0.79, 0.76, 0.85 and 0.99, respectively, significantly better than the random prediction (p = 0.001), indicating good performance of the model. The Maxent outputs and receiver operating characteristic curves [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005959.s002">S2 Fig</xref>. We observed that there is a concentration of ORO and MAY in the Northern region of Brazil, while SLE and ROC are mainly present in the South region and coastal region.
