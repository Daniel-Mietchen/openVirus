<p id="Par50">It is increasingly apparent that emergency preparedness and response is best achieved within strong health systems for universal health coverage(UHC) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In countries with weak health systems, response to health emergencies is slow or inadequate, and outcomes are poorer. Indeed, the JEE index scores correlate with various health metrics, including: life expectancy, under-five year old mortality, disability-adjusted life years, and other measures of social and economic development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Consequently, efforts to strengthen health security should be integrated within health system strengthening. This would prevent duplication of efforts and wastage. However, how best to achieve or measure this integration is not clearly defined [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The ability of deadly pathogens to exploit weak health systems was clearly demonstrated in the Ebola outbreak of 2013â€“2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, there is paucity of data on the benefits of integrating health security with health system strengthening. Several components are cross cutting and improvements or deficiencies in one, often impact the other. Nevertheless, evidence on the public health, economic, social and political dividends to support the integration of these two approaches is urgently needed and would be insightful to policy makers and funders. We are investigating the potential dividends of investing in an integrated approach to UHC and health security.
