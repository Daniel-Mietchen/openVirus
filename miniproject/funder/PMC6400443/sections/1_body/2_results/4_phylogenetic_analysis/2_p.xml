<p>A phylogenetic tree representing the full coding region of the envelope protein from the DENV-1 strains was constructed. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, four strains from Guangzhou belong to genotype V and two isolates from Xishuangbanna sub-cluster with genotype I. These four strains from Guangzhou are 100% identical to the KT827377 strain obtained from Guangdong in 2014 and are closely related to isolates obtained in India from 2009â€“2011, suggesting that this isolate was possibly imported into China. The two isolates from Xishuangbanna each display high similarity to the isolates sporadically found in Zhejiang and Guangdong Province and are identical to the KX056459 isolate from Yunnan.
