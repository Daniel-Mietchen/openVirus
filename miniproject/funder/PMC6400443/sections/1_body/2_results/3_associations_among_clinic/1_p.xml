<p>A comparative analysis was conducted on the demographic data, laboratory parameters, infection types (serotypes of DENV, primary or secondary DENV infections), and the clinical manifestations of the disease. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g005">Fig 5</xref>, the patients with primary infections had a median age of 36 years (range, 11–75), while the median age for secondary infections was 38 years (range, 18–81). The age distributions showed that the commonest age group for primary and secondary DENV infection cases were 40–49 years and 20–39 years, respectively. The relationships among the clinical and laboratory parameters and the infection serotypes are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0213353.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. There were significant differences between the clinical features and the serotypes of DENV infected, even though there were no differences in age, gender, occupation for patients infected with DENV-1 versus DENV-2 (
 <xref rid="pone.0213353.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Those patients who were infected with DENV-2 or with a mixed infection containing this serotype had significantly higher rates of headache, anorexia and nausea, vomiting and debilitation and significantly higher rates of abnormal liver function values. There were no significant differences among white blood cell count, platelet count and infection type (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g006">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>), but a decline was observed from days four to nine after onset of fever and then recovered to the normal level at ten to thirteen days. No significant associations among the demographics and clinical signs for primary versus secondary infections were noted, except that a higher bleeding rate was observed for the secondary infections (
