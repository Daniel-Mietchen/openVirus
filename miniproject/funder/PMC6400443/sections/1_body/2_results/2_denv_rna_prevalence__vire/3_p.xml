<p>To find out the relationship of viral load with IgM positivity, infection type and serotypes of DENV in different study areas, we analyzed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g004">Fig 4</xref>. The results revealed the IgM positive cases is always associated with lower virus load (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) and patients with primary infection with DENV-2 had significantly higher viral titer than those with secondary infection with DENV-2 (P&lt;0.01) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). However, such a difference was not observed in the patients with DENV-1 infections or for those with mixed DENV-1+DENV-2 infections(P&gt;0.05)(
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213353.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In addition, the mean viral titer for DENV-1 among patients in Guangzhou was one log higher than those in Xishuangbanna(p = 0.012)(
