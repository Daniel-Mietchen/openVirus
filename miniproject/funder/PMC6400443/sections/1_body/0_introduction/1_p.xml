<p>Dengue virus (DENV), a 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus member of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, is transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. The virus is endemic in many tropical and subtropical countries where it is associated with outbreaks of dengue disease. Globally, approximately 390 million people are estimated to be infected with DENV each year, and disease manifestations occur in around 96 million people [

Currently, the CYD-TDV vaccine (dengvaxia) is licensed since 2015 in 20 countries with low efficacy and increased risk of severe disease among na√Øve individuals [
