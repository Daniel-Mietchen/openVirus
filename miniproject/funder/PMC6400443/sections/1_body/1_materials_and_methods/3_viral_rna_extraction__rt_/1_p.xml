<p>Total RNA was extracted from the serum samples using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Virus serotyping and genome copy numbers for each sample were determined using the DENV general-type real-time RT-PCR Liferiver kit (Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co, China). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from 140μl of human serum using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), as per manufacturer's protocol. RNA was eluted in 50μl of AVE buffer provided with the kit. 5μl of RNA was then added to the RT-PCR mix. The kits can detect 10
 <sup>3</sup> copy/ml. Gene-specific primers were designed to amplify and sequence the envelope gene sequence from the virus. The D1-863F/2462R primer set (
 <monospace>5’-TGCCATAGGAACATCCATCAC-3’</monospace> and 
 <monospace>5’-TCCCAATGGCTGCTGATAGTC-3’</monospace>) was used for RT-PCR amplification of the DENV-1 sequences and D2-556F/2160R (
 <monospace>5’-GACCTTGGTGARTTGTGTGAAG-3’</monospace> and 
 <monospace>5’-CARTCTTGTTACTGAGCGGA-3’</monospace>) was used for RT-PCR amplification of the DENV-2 sequences. Both primer sets were also used for DNA sequencing of the viruses. The PrimeScript RT Reagent kit (TaKaRa) was used for reverse transcription and the PrimeSTAR GXL DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa) was used for PCR. Reverse transcription was conducted at 37°C for 15 min, 85°C for 5 s, followed by PCR amplification at 94°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min, with a final extension of 72°C for 5 min.
