<p>Serum samples from the suspected dengue patients, collected during the 1–14-day after onset of fever, were subjected to serological testing and dengue antigen detection. The preliminary screening for the presence of DENV NS1 protein in patients’ sera was performed using the Panbio Dengue Early ELISA kit (Alere, Brisbane, Australia) to detect the NS1 according to the manufacturer's instructions. A positive NS1 result (&gt; 11 Panbio units) is considered to be indicative of an active primary or secondary dengue infection. Anti-dengue IgG and IgM detection was performed using the Panbio Dengue IgM and IgG Capture ELISA kit, which was also used to determine the infection status (primary or secondary infection) of a sample according to manufacturer’s protocol. In essence, a positive IgM result (&gt; 11 Panbio units) indicated an active primary or secondary infection, if a positive IgG result (&gt; 22 Panbio units) was defined as an active secondary infection, which could be accompanied by elevated IgM levels.</p>
