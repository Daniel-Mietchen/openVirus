<p>The whole envelope protein gene from all the isolated viral strains was PCR-amplified using gene-specific primer sets. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the full envelope gene region of the viral strains isolated in this study and from those previously isolated in China and its neighboring countries, and from other regions of the world. The sequences obtained were aligned with other DENV sequences available in the GenBank database (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213353.s004">S2 Table</xref>) for DENV-1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0213353.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and 55 sequences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213353.s005">S3 Table</xref>) for DENV-2, all of which belong to different genotypes and come from different samples. Bootstrap values were set at 1000 reiterations.
