  <title>DENV phylogenetic trees.</title>
  <p>(A) The DENV-1 tree was constructed using the whole nucleotide envelope protein gene sequences from DENV-1 and shows the relationships of 50 strains from different sources including 10 DENV-1 strains isolated in China. (B) The DENV-2 tree was constructed using the whole nucleotide envelope protein gene sequences from DENV-2 and shows the relationships of 55 strains from different sources including 12 DENV-2 strains isolated in China. The sequences of this study were indicated as red diamonds (Guangzhou) and blue circles (Xishuangbanna).</p>
