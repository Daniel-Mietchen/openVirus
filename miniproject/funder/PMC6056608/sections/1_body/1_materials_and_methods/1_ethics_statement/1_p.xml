<p>The permission to import the human isolates of avian virus strains for research purposes was obtained from the Finnish Food Safety Authority (permission no 8634/0527/2012). Infective H5N1 and H7N9 viruses were handled strictly under Biosafety Level (BSL) 3 laboratory conditions at the National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL), Finland. Different virus subtypes were always handled in separate biosafety cabinets to avoid any possible creation of recombinant viruses. Adult human blood was obtained from anonymous healthy blood donors through the Finnish Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service (permission no 37/2016, renewed annually). Animal immunizations related to this study were approved by the Ethical Committee of the National Institute for Health and Welfare (permission no. KTL 2008-02).</p>
