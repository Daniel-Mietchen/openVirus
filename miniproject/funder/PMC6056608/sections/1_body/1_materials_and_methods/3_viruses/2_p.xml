<p>The infectivity of the viruses was determined in Mɸs by immunofluorescence microscopy and in moDCs by flow cytometry. The number of infected cells with different virus dilutions was counted to obtain the concentration of infective virus particles as focus forming units per milliliter (FFU/ml). The multiplicity of infection (MOI) in Mɸs or moDCs is given according to the titers determined in Mɸs or moDCs, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
