<p>Macrophages were differentiated on glass coverslips, infected with different influenza A viruses at MOI values as indicated in the figures, incubated for 1 h at 37°C, washed with PBS, fresh Mɸ medium was added and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. At different times after infection, cells were washed, fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature, washed, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed, and blocked with 0.5% BSA for 30 min. A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2) virus-infected cells were stained with guinea pig antibody against influenza A virus H3N2 nucleoprotein (NP) (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). To visualize A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus-infected cells, guinea pig antibodies against H5N1 viral glycoproteins were used. Antibodies were prepared by immunizing guinea pigs and rabbits for four times every 2 weeks with A/Indonesia/5/2005 vaccine antigen (2 + 6 in PR8) (4 µg of HA/immunization) mixed with AS03 adjuvant (GlaxoSmithKline, Rixenart, Belgium) according to the instructions by the manufacturer. Secondary antibodies were fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-guinea pig antibodies. In infectivity experiments, NucBlue Fixed Cell Ready Probes reagent (Life Technologies, DAPI) was added to secondary antibody staining solutions. Incubation time in every staining was 30 min in 0.5% BSA in PBS at 37°C and coverslips were washed three times with 0.5% Tween 20 (VWR) in PBS in every step. Finally, cells were washed with water and mounted in 25% Mowiol (Polysciences) in a solution containing 25 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 50% glycerol, and 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane. The cells were imaged with Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope with a 63 1.40-numerical-aperture (NA) oil objective maintaining the same image acquisition settings for all acquired images. In the infectivity experiments, the cells were imaged with a Zeiss Stallion fluorescence microscope with a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 LT sCMOS camera and a 20 0.4-NA objective by using Slidebook 6 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). In the productivity assay, cells were calculated with 20 0.6-NA air objective with Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope.
