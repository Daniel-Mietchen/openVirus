<p>For protein analysis, Mɸs or moDCs from four blood donors were harvested and pooled. We pooled the donors to be able to analyze higher amount of donors to get a more global and general view of the protein expression changes. Cell pellets were lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega) containing 1 mM Na
 <sub>3</sub>VO
 <sub>4</sub>. Total cellular proteins were boiled in a Laemmli sample buffer, proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk protein (Valio Co., Helsinki) in PBS. Anti-influenza A virus NP and M1 and MxA protein-specific antibodies were prepared as described previously (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Monoclonal anti-influenza A virus H7 HA antibody was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH and anti-H3N2 glycoprotein antibodies and anti H5N1 virus antibodies were produced as described above. Antibody stainings for phosphorylated form of IRF3 (P-IRF3), P-STAT2, STAT2, and GAPDH proteins (Cell Signaling Technology) were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP-conjugated antibodies (Dako) were used. Protein bands were visualized on HyperMax films using a Pierce
 <sup>®</sup> ECL Western Blotting substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
