<p>For determining the infectivity of viruses in moDCs, the cells were differentiated on 6-well plates. Cells were infected with different virus dilutions and times as indicated in the figures. After different times of infection, cells from four different blood donors were harvested and handled separately. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and stored with 0.5% BSA in PBS. A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2) virus-infected cells were stained with rabbit antibodies against H3N2 glycoproteins (

To visualize A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus-infected cells, antibodies against A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) vaccine antigen were used (see above). The secondary antibody was FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Invitrogen, #F2765). In all antibody stainings, the cells were stained at RT for 1 h and washed twice with 0.5% BSA in PBS. The samples were analyzed with a FACSCanto II (BD) device using FACSDiva software.
