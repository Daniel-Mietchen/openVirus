<p>Macrophages were grown on glass coverslips and infected with MOI of 0.01. After 1 h incubation, virus dilution was removed, and cells were washed with PBS. Cells were overlaid with 1.2% Avicel in E-MEM (containing 2 µg/ml TPCK-trypsin, 0.3% BSA, 60 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and 20 mM HEPES) and incubated for 15 h. After incubation, the cells were washed two times with PBS, fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min, washed with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% triton X-100 for 5 min, and stained with antibodies of different specificity (above-mentioned) followed by immunofluorescence analysis [adapted from Ref. (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)]. The percentage of productive vs. total infection events was determined by eye using confocal microscope with 20× objective and cells were imaged with 40× objective (Figures 7A,B).
