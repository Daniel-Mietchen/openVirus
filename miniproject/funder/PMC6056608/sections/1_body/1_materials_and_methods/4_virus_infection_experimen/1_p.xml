<p>Macrophages and moDCs were infected with different MOI values of virus for different times, as indicated in the figures. Mɸs were differentiated on glass coverslips or cell culture plates, growth medium was removed, and virus dilution was added on cells. After 1 h at 37°C incubation, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh medium was added. For infection experiments in moDCs, the virus dilutions were added into cell cultures medium without changing the growth medium. For 6 h infectivity experiments in Mɸs and moDCs, cells were incubated with neuraminidase inhibitor, 20 nM oseltamivir carboxylate which is an active metabolite of oseltamivir phosphate (#RO0640802-002, Roche). All infection experiments with H5N1 and H7N9 viruses were performed in BSL-3 facility and only samples inactivated with validated methods were brought out from the BSL-3 laboratory.</p>
