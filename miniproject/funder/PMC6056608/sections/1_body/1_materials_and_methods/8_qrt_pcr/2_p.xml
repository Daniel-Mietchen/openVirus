<p>To quantify viral RNA from the supernatant samples, moDCs and Mɸs were infected as described above and the supernatant samples were collected at 1 and 24 h after the infection. RNA was isolated using RNEasy Mini kit (Qiagen) with Qiacube (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was done with RevertAid H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions with RiboLock RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and random hexamers (Roche) as primers. qRT-PCR was performed using QIAGEN
 <sup>®</sup> QuantiTect™ Multiplex PCR NoRox Kit (Qiagen) with the same influenza A virus M1 primer–probe pair as above. The relative viral gene expression in relation to a 1-h sample was calculated with the ΔCT method according to the instructions provided by Applied Biosystems.
