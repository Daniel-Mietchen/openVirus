<p>Infected Mɸs or moDCs from four blood donors were pooled (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), and total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNEasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and DNase digestion was performed with RNasefree DNase kit (Qiagen). 0.5 µg of total cellular RNA was transcribed to cDNA using TaqMan Reverse Transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems) with random hexamers as primers. cDNAs were amplified by PCR using TaqMan Universal PCR Mastermix and Gene Expression Assays for IFN-λ1 (Hs00601677_g1), IFN-α1 (Hs00256882_s1), IFN-β1 (Hs00277188_s1), TNF-α (Hs01113624_g1), IL-1β (Hs00174097_m1), CXCL10 (Hs00171042_m1), CCL5 (Hs00174575_m1) (Applied Biosystems) or with primers and probes for influenza A virus M1 (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The data were normalized to 18S rRNA with TaqMan Endogenous Control kit (Applied Biosystems). The relative gene expression in relation to an unstimulated sample was calculated with the ΔΔCT method according to instructions provided by Applied Biosystems.
