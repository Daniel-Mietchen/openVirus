<p>To obtain monocytes for Mɸ differentiation, mononuclear cells were allowed to adhere onto plates or glass coverslips for 1 h at +37°C in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 0.6 µg/ml penicillin, 60 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and 20 mM HEPES. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the remaining monocytes were cultured in Mɸ serum-free medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with streptomycin and human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) (10 ng/ml; Nordic Biosite). The cells were differentiated into Mɸs for 7 days, with a change to fresh culture medium every 2 days.
