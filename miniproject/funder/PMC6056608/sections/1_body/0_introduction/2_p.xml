<p>After infecting the epithelial cells of respiratory tract, influenza A viruses can spread to alveolar dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (Mɸs) which reside in the immediate proximity of the epithelium (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). DCs and Mɸs are the key cell types to orchestrate host immune responses (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Typically influenza A virus induces antiviral responses in immune cells by inducing type I and III interferons (IFNs) which are known to inhibit virus replication and propagation (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Both alveolar and monocyte-derived Mɸs as well as DCs, including monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), express receptors for both avian-adapted (α-2,3-linked sialic acids) and human-adapted (α-2,6-linked sialic acids) influenza A viruses (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The viral HA binds to sialylated host cell surface receptor molecules and mediates virus entry. Influenza viruses enter the cells mainly 
 <italic>via</italic> endocytosis and the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. For the fusion to happen the precursor form of the HA, HA0 has to be cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits by host cells proteases. The membrane fusion mediated by the mature form of the HA occurs at low pH which enables the release of the segmented viral genome into the cytoplasm. The genome of the influenza virus is structured in eight separate viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes which are transported into the nucleus for the transcription and replication of the virus. The viral proteins are translated in the cytoplasm but the viral proteins are assembled into vRNPs in the nucleus. Newly synthesized vRNPs are exported to the cytoplasm, virus particles are assembled at the cell membrane, and progeny virus particles bud out of the cell. All eight vRNAs have to be packed into a virion to produce infective progeny viruses and the infection to be productive. The mechanism behind the genome packaging is not fully understood but it is believed that influenza A virus packs its vRNAs in a specific manner by a selective packaging mechanism (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Some studies suggest that most influenza A virus particles are noninfectious since they express incomplete set of viral gene segments and are incapable of inducing a secondary infection (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, three-dimensional analysis of the virions has shown that at least 80% of virions have all eight RNPs packaged (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition, it is known that there are differences between various seasonal influenza virus strains in their ability to cause a productive infection (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) but the comparison between avian influenza and seasonal influenza virus strains in primary human cells have remained poorly characterized.
