<p>Influenza A viruses are one of the most important viral pathogens annually infecting even 5–10% of the human population and causing an estimated 250,000–500,000 deaths worldwide. Occasionally, influenza A viruses cause global pandemics of which the most devastating one was the pandemic caused by Spanish flu in 1918 leading up to 50 million deaths (

The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have caused almost 900 human infections from 2003 until today and the mortality among humans has been over 50% (

The H7N9 virus, which emerged in humans in 2013, has a surprising character as it causes only a mild infection in domestic poultry but an HPAI-like disease in humans. In the beginning of 2017, a human infection was detected with H7N9 virus possessing a multi-basic HA1-HA2 cleavage site motif in the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule characteristic of HPAI viruses (
