<p>Previously, we have shown that human moDCs are susceptible to the avian influenza virus infection (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In this study, we show that the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses can efficiently replicate and produce new infective particles in human primary moDCs and Mɸs and, despite the strong IFN-mediated antiviral responses induced by the infection, be able to spread throughout the whole immune cell culture. These results suggest that the excessive cytokine production (“cytokine storm”) induced by H5N1 infection may in fact be due to extremely efficient spread of the virus infection in the infection site leading to greatly enhanced cytokine gene expression.
