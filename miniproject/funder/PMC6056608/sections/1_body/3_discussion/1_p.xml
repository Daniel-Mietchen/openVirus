<p>In 1997, a direct transmission of an avian influenza H5N1 virus from poultry to humans was documented for the first time (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). After that many subtypes of avian influenza A viruses have been reported to cause infections in humans, among them the H7N9 influenza type (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). High prevalence of influenza viruses in birds, the possibility of formation of new highly pathogenic reassortants and the ability of these viruses to spread to humans makes avian influenza A viruses of great global concern and emphasize the importance of virusâ€“host cell interaction studies in human cell systems. In this study, we wanted to characterize different steps of H5N1 virus infection in human immune cells to reveal potential mechanisms explaining the severe clinical outcome of the H5N1 virus infection. In our previous study, we have shown that the avian H5N1 and H7N9 viruses can replicate in human moDCs (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Here, we show that, unlike the H7N9 or seasonal influenza A viruses, the H5N1 virus is efficiently spreading in human immune cell cultures leading to a productive infection and robust IFN response. The remarkable ability of H5N1 virus to spread in human immune cells and likely other human cell types can be one explanation for the severe disease seen in humans with H5N1 virus infection. Here, we show that this ability is associated with at least two different HPAI H5N1 virus strains, and it may be a universal feature for all highly pathogenic avian-origin influenza A virus subtypes. There may be other viral or host factors regulating avian influenza pathogenicity in humans, since the LPAI H7N9 virus (LPAI in birds) has caused more human infections and deaths than the H5N1 subtype (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In addition, there is now evidence that the H7N9 subtype has evolved to a HPAI H7N9 strain in birds, and this type of virus has already caused infections in humans (
