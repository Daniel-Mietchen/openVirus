<p>It is commonly thought that the IFN system is the key factor regulating the efficacy of host antiviral responses and the clearance of the virus. However, the high mortality in H5N1 infection has been associated with an excessive inflammatory response in the lungs of virus-infected individuals (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Our study shows that the H5N1 virus grows extremely well in human immune cells and it induces strong IFN responses (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A–C and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>A–C), both of which may contribute to the clinical outcome of the H5N1 infection. Our data show that IFN and also pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses are higher in infection with H5N1 than with H3N2 or H7N9 viruses at low MOI at the 24 h time point after infection. At the same time, we see that after 24 h infection with the H5N1 virus all cells are infected whereas with the H3N2 or H7N9 virus only proportion of the cells is infected. This suggests that there is a positive correlation between the spread of infection and the cytokine responses. Thus, the strong IFN responses and virus replication are not exclusive of each other; for instance, Ngunjiri et al. (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) have shown that the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus is sensitive to the antiviral actions of IFNs. There is also evidence that H5N1 viruses with high replication competency can ultimately overcome the antiviral effects induced by IFN-α and IFN-β (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Bordi et al. (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) have shown that IFN-λ and IFN-α have antagonistic antiviral activity against Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. However, in our previous study (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) in influenza A virus infection, we did not see any antagonistic activity between IFN-α and IFN-λ, or IFN-λ and IFN-γ, or IFN-α and IFN-γ. We have shown that in H5N1 virus infection IFN-α is produced leading to strong MxA protein expression in the cells which proves that IFN signaling is intact in H5N1-infected cells (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Still, in this study, we clearly show that HPAI H5N1 virus can replicate and spread extremely efficiently in human innate immune cells despite of strong activation of IFN gene expression and MxA protein expression (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). This indicates that due to efficient spread of H5N1 virus and high infectivity in the cell cultures there are more cells which can produce IFNs leading to a cytokine storm associated with H5N1-infected patients. This may in part explain the fatal outcome of a H5N1 virus infection in humans. Although the clinical outcome in humans is similar in H5N1 and H7N9 virus infections, surprisingly the antiviral IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression is impaired in H7N9 virus-infected immune cells (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Thus, it seems that the mechanism behind the pathogenicity is different in H5N1 and H7N9 virus infection which still demands further investigations.
