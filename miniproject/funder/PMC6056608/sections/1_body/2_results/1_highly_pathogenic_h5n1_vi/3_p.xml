<p>Besides primary infectivity in Mɸs and moDCs, we investigated the replication of these viruses in Mɸs and moDCs by analyzing the expression of viral M1 RNA with qRT-PCR. During the first 6 h of infection, we did not observe any clear differences in M1 gene expression between H3N2, H5N1, or H7N9 viruses, which indicate that the rate of viral replication is similar between the viruses during the primary infection. In the secondary infection phase (24 h time point) in H5N1-infected cells, the expression of M1 gene reached the same submaximal levels regardless of the MOI values used (0.01–10) (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B). In H3N2 and H7N9 virus-infected cells, instead, there was a clear dose-dependent expression of viral M1 RNA in different time points (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B). In addition, there was a clear difference in the production of viral NP and M proteins between H5N1 and H7N9 or H3N2 virus-infected cells. In H5N1 virus-infected cells viral protein expression was high, independent of the MOI value used in the beginning of the infection, while in H3N2 or H7N9-infected cells viral protein levels depended on the virus dose at the beginning of the infection (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C,D).
