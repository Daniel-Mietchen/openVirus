<p>All virus stocks were propagated in low passages in chicken eggs and the stock virus infectivity titers in different cell types were assessed. To determine the titers of infective units in the virus stocks, we performed a plaque forming assay in MDCK cells. In these cells, the H5N1 strain from 2004 gave the lowest titers when compared with those of H7N9 and H3N2 viruses (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The reason for this could be that the H7N9 virus has a high affinity to both α-2,3- (avian type) and α-2,6-linked (human type) sialic acids whereas usually the avian type H5N1 viruses prefer the α-2,3-type receptor (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). However, in moDCs and Mɸs where both α-2,3- and α-2,6-linked sialic acids are expressed (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), the infectivity titer of H5N1 stock was the highest when compared with H3N2 or H7N9 viruses. Moreover, it seems that human Mɸs are more permissive than moDCs to all of these viruses (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
