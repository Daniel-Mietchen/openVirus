<p>To determine the infectivity of influenza A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2), A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), and A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) viruses in human Mɸs and dendritic cells (moDCs), we infected the cells with different virus doses for 6 h. We determined the number of infective units [focus forming units per milliliter (FFU/ml), Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>] in virus stocks for both cell models separately from the dilution where approximately 50% of the cells were infected (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,C,E). We used the FFU/ml values to determine the actual MOI. In the single-cycle infection (6 h), the infectivity curves with different doses of H5N1, H7N9, or H3N2 viruses both in Mɸs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A) and moDCs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C) corresponded well to the determined FFU/ml values. However, during a multi-cycle infection (24 h), H5N1 virus was able to efficiently spread in the culture and the virus infected all cells even with the very low MOI value in the beginning of the infection (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B,D).
