<p>For the newly produced viruses to be infective, their HA precursor (HA0) has to be cleaved to HA1 and HA2 subunits by cellular proteases. Thus, we next analyzed how efficiently the HA molecule of H5N1, H7N9, and H3N2 viruses is cleaved in human immune cells. As visualized by immunoblotting in H3N2 virus-infected Mɸs, there was only some or none of the HA2 subunit detectable (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). The A/Vietnam/1194/04 (H5N1) strain has multiple arginine and lysine residues at the HA1–HA2 cleavage site as a marker for a highly pathogenic form of an avian influenza virus. This multi-basic cleavage site can be cleaved by ubiquitous cellular proteases and, indeed, we noticed that in H5N1-infected human Mɸs a great amount of the HA0 protein produced at 24 h even with very low MOI was efficiently cleaved to HA1 and HA2 subunits (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B). However, like in H3N2 infection, in H7N9 virus-infected Mɸs, there was only some or none of the HA2 subunit detectable (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C). The HA of the different viruses was cleaved in similar fashion also in moDCs (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>D–F).
