<p>Next, we analyzed how low amount of the H5N1 virus was sufficient to infect the whole immune cell culture. To do this, we made dilutions series of the stock virus and infected moDCs with MOI values ranging from 1 to 10
 <sup>−12</sup> for 48 h. Interestingly, most moDCs were infected even at a MOI 10
 <sup>−5</sup> of H5N1 virus and the infectivity decreased to background levels at a MOI of 10
 <sup>−8</sup>, where there should not be any viral particles left (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The findings suggest that the H5N1 virus is able to start a productive infection and spread eventually to the whole cell culture even from one infectious virus particle.
