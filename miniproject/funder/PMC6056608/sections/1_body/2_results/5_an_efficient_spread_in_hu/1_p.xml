<p>Our next question was, whether the ability to spread in human immune cells is only associated with this specific HPAI H5N1 strain A/Vietnam/1194/04 or whether it is a more universal feature of all highly pathogenic avian-origin H5N1 viruses. Thus, we included another highly pathogenic H5N1 strain into the study. This A/Hong Kong/156/1997 H5N1 virus gave almost an equally high titer in MDCK cells than the H7N9 virus, whereas the other H5N1/2004 strain gave the lowest PFU titer (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It may be that the H5N1/1997 virus is already adapted to the mammalian MDCK cells, because H5N1/1997 virus has been cultivated at least four passages in MDCK cells before the propagation in chicken eggs. This likely explains the high PFU/ml titer of H5N1/1997 virus. The infectivity of A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) virus was also determined in Mɸs and moDCs at 6 and 24 h by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A,B), and calculated the FFU/ml values (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) for virus stocks as was done for H3N2, H5N1/2004, and H7N9 viruses (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,C). In multi-cyclic infection at 24 h, H5N1/1997 virus was spreading efficiently in Mɸs and moDCs (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A,B) in a similar fashion as the H5N1/2004 virus (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B,D). Infection with H5N1/1997 virus at MOI value of 10
 <sup>−5</sup> reached over 60% infection rate in moDCs at 48 h. In addition, 10% of the cells got infected from the virus dose of MOI 10
 <sup>−6</sup> where theoretically only one infectious virus particle was added into the culture (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C). Furthermore, the HA of the H5N1/1997 virus was efficiently cleaved from HA0 to HA1 and HA2 subunits as was also the case with the HA of the H5N1/2004 virus (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>D). These data show that the H5N1/1997 virus has a similar ability to spread in human Mɸs and moDCs as the H5N1/2004 virus and the cleavage of HA is extremely efficient in these cell types suggesting that these features are general to HPAI H5N1 viruses.
