<p>Influenza virus infection induces type I and III IFN production in response to the recognition of viral RNAs by host receptors. We and others have previously shown that IFN-α can inhibit H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 virus replication (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Here, we show that the H5N1/2004 avian influenza strain replicates and spreads efficiently in Mɸs and moDCs even at very low multiplicity infection (MOI 0.01) (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B), although the host cells respond to the infection with maximal cytokine gene expression (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The H5N1/2004 virus induced strong IFN-λ1, IFN-α1, and IFN-β gene expression in Mɸs (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A–C). This suggests that the H5N1 virus is able to spread irrespective of the activation of antiviral immune responses since otherwise IFNs should inhibit virus replication. Lower virus doses in H3N2 or H7N9-infected moDCs led to clearly weaker IFN responses when compared with H5N1-infected cells at the 24 h time point (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A–C) suggesting that there are likely less infected cells that produce IFNs. To get further view of H5N1/2004 virus induced “cytokine storm,” we investigated the expression of chemokine CXCL10 and CCL5 and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and TNF-α genes in H3N2, H5N1/2004, or H7N9 virus-infected Mɸs (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>D–G). Like IFN responses, with low MOI value, also CXCL10, CCL5, and TNF-α responses were higher in H5N1-infected Mɸs with low MOI value than with low MOI values in H3N2 or H7N9 virus infection. Induction of IL-1β gene expression is very low with H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 viruses (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>F) as we have also previously shown in moDCs (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). IFN-λ1, IFN-α1, IFN-β, CXCL10, CCL5, IL-1β, and TNF-α gene expression was also investigated in H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 virus-infected moDCs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Data from moDCs correlate with the data from virus-infected Mɸs though CXCL10 mRNA induction was clearly higher in moDCs than in Mɸs, whereas CCL5 gene was expressed in higher levels in Mɸs. Thus, we next analyzed the expression of antiviral proteins in H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9-infected Mɸs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>A) and moDCs (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>B). With all analyzed viruses, the expression of IFN-induced antiviral MxA protein was the strongest at the 24-h time point (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>A,B). We also analyzed the expression of phosphorylated transcription factors IRF3 (P-IRF3) and STAT2 (P-STAT2) and noticed that the protein expression of these proteins was weaker in H7N9-infected cells compared with those seen in H5N1 or H3N2 infected cells (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>A,B) which correlates well with the gene expression of IFNs (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>) as well as with our previous study (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The data show that in a multi-cyclic infection the H5N1 virus is able to induce very strong IFN gene expressions and antiviral MxA protein expression.
