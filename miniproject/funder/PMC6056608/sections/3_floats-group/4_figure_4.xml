  <p>Infectivity of the H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 viruses in the presence of trypsin. Monocyte-derived macrophages (Mɸs) 
   <bold>(A)</bold> or monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) 
   <bold>(B)</bold> were infected with externally added TPCK-trypsin with A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2), A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), and A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza viruses with indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) values and the samples were collected at 24 h after infection. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The proportion of infected Mɸs was analyzed with immunofluorescence microscopy by staining the cells with antibody against respective virus proteins. From each donor at least 300 cells (average ca. 550) were counted. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> moDCs were stained with antibody against virus proteins and infected cells were analyzed with flow cytometry. From each donor 10,000 events were analyzed.
