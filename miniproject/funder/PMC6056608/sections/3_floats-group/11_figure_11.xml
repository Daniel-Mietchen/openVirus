  <p>Activation of transcription factors and expression of antiviral MxA protein in H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 influenza virus-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (Mɸs) and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Mɸs and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> moDCs were infected with A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2), A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza viruses at multiplicity of infection (MOI) values of 1. Cellular protein lysates were collected at 3, 6, and 24 h after infection, samples from four donors were pooled and P-IRF3, MxA, P-STAT2, STAT2, and viral NP and M1 protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting using specific antisera. GAPDH protein expression was analyzed to control equal loading of the samples. A representative experiment out of two (Mɸs) or three (moDCs) is shown.
