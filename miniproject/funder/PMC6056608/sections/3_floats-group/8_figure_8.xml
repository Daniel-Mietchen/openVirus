  <p>The productivity of H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 infections in human innate immune cells. Monocyte-derived macrophages (Mɸs) or monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) from four different donors were infected with A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2), A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza viruses at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 and after 1 and 24 h of infection the supernatant samples were collected. 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> The infective viral titers produced from Mɸs 
   <bold>(A)</bold> or moDCs 
   <bold>(B)</bold> were determined by plaque assay in Madin–Darby Canine Kidney cells. The relative virus titers were calculated over 1 h samples. The horizontal lines represent the geometric means of the results from four blood donors. 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> The RNA was isolated from the supernatant samples from Mɸs 
   <bold>(C)</bold> and moDCs 
   <bold>(D)</bold> and the viral RNA levels were detected by qRT-PCR. The relative viral RNA expressions were calculated over 1 h samples with ΔCT method. The horizontal lines represent the geometric means from different donors. The statistical significance of differences between H5N1 and H3N2 or H7N9 was determined by Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test, *&lt;0.05.
