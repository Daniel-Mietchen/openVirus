  <p>Innate immune responses in H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 influenza virus-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (Mɸs). Mɸs were infected with A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2), A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), or A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza viruses at multiplicity of infection (MOI) values of 10 to 0.01 for 24 h. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Cells from four donors were collected at different time points after infection as indicated in the figure, cells from different donors were pooled and total cellular RNA was isolated. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> IFN-λ1, 
   <bold>(B)</bold> IFN-β, 
   <bold>(C)</bold> IFN-α1, 
   <bold>(D)</bold> CXCL10, 
   <bold>(E)</bold> CCL5, 
   <bold>(F)</bold> IL-1β, and 
   <bold>(G)</bold> TNF-α gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Gene expression &lt; 1 is defined as not detected (ND). A representative experiment out of two is shown.
