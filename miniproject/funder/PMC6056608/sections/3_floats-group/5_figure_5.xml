  <p>Infectivity of H5N1 virus with serial dilutions in monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). To titrate the infectivity and the spread of infection, A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1) virus stock was diluted in 1:10 series from multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1 to MOI 10–12 and moDCs from 3 different donors were infected for 48 h. Cells were collected and the percentage of infected cells was analyzed with flow cytometry. From each donor 10,000 events were analyzed.</p>
