  <p>Viral RNA expression and protein synthesis in H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 virus-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (Mɸs) and monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). Mɸs and moDCs from four different blood donors were separately infected with A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2), A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), and A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza viruses at different multiplicity of infection (MOI) values for up to 24 h. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Mɸs and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> moDCs were collected at 1, 3, 6, and 24 h after infection, cells from different donors were pooled and total cellular RNA was isolated for measuring of viral M1 RNA expression by qRT-PCR. The fold induction was calculated over mock sample. The data shown are representative of three independent experiments. 
   <bold>(C,D)</bold> Cellular protein lysates from 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Mɸs or 
   <bold>(D)</bold> moDCs were collected at 24 h after infection, samples from different donors were pooled and viral NP and M1 protein expression was analyzed using Western blotting. GAPDH levels were analyzed to control the equal loading of the samples. A representative experiment out of two (Mɸs) or three (moDC) is shown.
