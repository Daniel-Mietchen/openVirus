  <p>Cleavage of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the influenza viruses in infected 
   <bold>(A–C)</bold> monocyte-derived macrophages (Mɸs) and 
   <bold>(D–F)</bold> monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs). Mɸs and moDCs from four blood donor were infected with A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2), A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (H5N1), and A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) influenza viruses at indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) values for 24 h. Cellular lysates for protein samples were collected, the samples of different donors were pooled, and HA proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. The membranes were stained 
   <bold>(A,D)</bold> with antibodies against glycoproteins of H3N2 virus to detect the HA0, HA1, and HA2 of the H3N2 virus, 
   <bold>(B,E)</bold> against the glycoproteins of H5N1 virus to detect the HA0, HA1 and HA2 of the H5N1 virus, or 
   <bold>(C,F)</bold> against the HA of H7 virus to detect HA0 and HA2 of the H7N9 virus. In panels 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold>, HA1 and NA co-migrate and thus the heterologous signal is due to cross-reactivity of the NA protein. The levels of GAPDH were used as an internal loading control. A representative experiment out of two is shown.
