Wild birds are the natural reservoir of influenza A virus from where the virus can be transmitted to poultry or to mammals including humans. Mortality among humans in the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus infection is even 60%. Despite intense research, there are still open questions in the pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus in humans. To characterize the H5N1 virus infection in human monocyte-derived macrophages (M&#x00278;s) and dendritic cells (DCs), we used human isolates of highly pathogenic H5N1/2004 and H5N1/1997 and low pathogenic H7N9/2013 avian influenza viruses in comparison with a seasonal H3N2/1989 virus. We noticed that the H5N1 viruses have an overwhelming ability to replicate and spread in primary human immune cell cultures, and even the addition of trypsin did not equalize the infectivity of H7N9 or H3N2 viruses to the level seen with H5N1 virus. H5N1 virus stocks contained more often propagation-competent viruses than the H7N9 or H3N2 viruses. The data also showed that human DCs and M&#x00278;s maintain 1,000- and 10,000-fold increase in the production of infectious H5N1 virus, respectively. Both analyzed highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses showed multi-cycle infection in primary human DCs and M&#x00278;s, whereas the H3N2 and H7N9 viruses were incapable of spreading in immune cells. Interestingly, H5N1 virus was able to spread extremely efficiently despite the strong induction of antiviral interferon gene expression, which may in part explain the high pathogenicity of H5N1 virus infection in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>avian influenza</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>viral replication</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="43"/><page-count count="19"/><word-count count="10585"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A viruses are one of the most important viral pathogens annually infecting even 5&#x02013;10% of the human population and causing an estimated 250,000&#x02013;500,000 deaths worldwide. Occasionally, influenza A viruses cause global pandemics of which the most devastating one was the pandemic caused by Spanish flu in 1918 leading up to 50 million deaths (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The segmented genome of influenza A viruses confers evolutionary advantages and influenza A viruses have a great ability to evolve by two different mechanisms, antigenic drift and shift. All pandemics in the twentieth century have been of avian origin (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Avian influenza A viruses circulate continuously in birds and occasionally they have caused infections in humans. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have caused almost 900 human infections from 2003 until today and the mortality among humans has been over 50% (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The H7N9 virus, which emerged in humans in 2013, has a surprising character as it causes only a mild infection in domestic poultry but an HPAI-like disease in humans. In the beginning of 2017, a human infection was detected with H7N9 virus possessing a multi-basic HA1-HA2 cleavage site motif in the hemagglutinin (HA) molecule characteristic of HPAI viruses (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Thus far, there have been over 1,500 human infections caused by the H7N9 virus with a mortality rate reaching 40% (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Therefore, these avian influenza virus strains pose a serious risk for a pandemic. Despite active research, it is not completely clear which factors in H5N1 or H7N9 viruses or in host responses contribute to a severe disease in humans.</p><p>After infecting the epithelial cells of respiratory tract, influenza A viruses can spread to alveolar dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (M&#x00278;s) which reside in the immediate proximity of the epithelium (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). DCs and M&#x00278;s are the key cell types to orchestrate host immune responses (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Typically influenza A virus induces antiviral responses in immune cells by inducing type I and III interferons (IFNs) which are known to inhibit virus replication and propagation (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Both alveolar and monocyte-derived M&#x00278;s as well as DCs, including monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs), express receptors for both avian-adapted (&#x003b1;-2,3-linked sialic acids) and human-adapted (&#x003b1;-2,6-linked sialic acids) influenza A viruses (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The viral HA binds to sialylated host cell surface receptor molecules and mediates virus entry. Influenza viruses enter the cells mainly <italic>via</italic> endocytosis and the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. For the fusion to happen the precursor form of the HA, HA0 has to be cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits by host cells proteases. The membrane fusion mediated by the mature form of the HA occurs at low pH which enables the release of the segmented viral genome into the cytoplasm. The genome of the influenza virus is structured in eight separate viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes which are transported into the nucleus for the transcription and replication of the virus. The viral proteins are translated in the cytoplasm but the viral proteins are assembled into vRNPs in the nucleus. Newly synthesized vRNPs are exported to the cytoplasm, virus particles are assembled at the cell membrane, and progeny virus particles bud out of the cell. All eight vRNAs have to be packed into a virion to produce infective progeny viruses and the infection to be productive. The mechanism behind the genome packaging is not fully understood but it is believed that influenza A virus packs its vRNAs in a specific manner by a selective packaging mechanism (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Some studies suggest that most influenza A virus particles are noninfectious since they express incomplete set of viral gene segments and are incapable of inducing a secondary infection (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, three-dimensional analysis of the virions has shown that at least 80% of virions have all eight RNPs packaged (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In addition, it is known that there are differences between various seasonal influenza virus strains in their ability to cause a productive infection (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) but the comparison between avian influenza and seasonal influenza virus strains in primary human cells have remained poorly characterized.</p><p>Previously, we have shown that human moDCs are susceptible to the avian influenza virus infection (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In this study, we show that the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses can efficiently replicate and produce new infective particles in human primary moDCs and M&#x00278;s and, despite the strong IFN-mediated antiviral responses induced by the infection, be able to spread throughout the whole immune cell culture. These results suggest that the excessive cytokine production (&#x0201c;cytokine storm&#x0201d;) induced by H5N1 infection may in fact be due to extremely efficient spread of the virus infection in the infection site leading to greatly enhanced cytokine gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The permission to import the human isolates of avian virus strains for research purposes was obtained from the Finnish Food Safety Authority (permission no 8634/0527/2012).

The reason for this could be that the H7N9 virus has a high affinity to both &#x003b1;-2,3- (avian type) and &#x003b1;-2,6-linked (human type) sialic acids whereas usually the avian type H5N1 viruses prefer the &#x003b1;-2,3-type receptor (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

Thus, we included another highly pathogenic H5N1 strain into the study. This A/Hong Kong/156/1997 H5N1 virus gave almost an equally high titer in MDCK cells than the H7N9 virus, whereas the other H5N1/2004 strain gave the lowest PFU titer (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). It may be that the H5N1/1997 virus is already adapted to the mammalian MDCK cells, because H5N1/1997 virus has been cultivated at least four passages in MDCK cells before the propagation in chicken eggs. This likely explains the high PFU/ml titer of H5N1/1997 virus. The infectivity of A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) virus was also determined in M&#x00278;s and moDCs at 6 and 24&#x02009;h by immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A,B), and calculated the FFU/ml values (Table <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) for virus stocks as was done for H3N2, H5N1/2004, and H7N9 viruses (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A,C). In multi-cyclic infection at 24&#x02009;h, H5N1/1997 virus was spreading efficiently in M&#x00278;s and moDCs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A,B) in a similar fashion as the H5N1/2004 virus (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B,D). Infection with H5N1/1997 virus at MOI value of 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> reached over 60% infection rate in moDCs at 48&#x02009;h. In addition, 10% of the cells got infected from the virus dose of MOI 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> where theoretically only one infectious virus particle was added into the culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>C).

These data show that the H5N1/1997 virus has a similar ability to spread in human M&#x00278;s and moDCs as the H5N1/2004 virus and the cleavage of HA is extremely efficient in these cell types suggesting that these features are general to HPAI H5N1 viruses.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Infectivity and the cleavage of the HA protein of A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) virus. <bold>(A)</bold> Monocyte-derived macrophages (M&#x00278;s) or <bold>(B)</bold> monocyte-derived DCs (moDCs) were infected with different doses of a human isolate of avian influenza A/Hong Kong/156/1997 (H5N1) virus for 6 or 24&#x02009;h.

Infection events were considered productive when three or more adjacent cells were infected. Our results show that significantly more infection events were productive with H5N1 virus, with almost 30% of the total infection events being productive, when compared with the 12 and 8% of events with H3N2 and H7N9 viruses, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A).

Next, we analyzed whether the H3N2, H5N1, or H7N9 virus infections were productive by propagating new infectious virions in human M&#x00278;s and moDC. For that, we performed plaque assays from the supernatant samples collected at 1 or 24&#x02009;h after the infection. We noticed that the amount of infectious virus in the M&#x00278; cell culture supernatant was increased with all the studied viruses but H5N1 was superior, producing approximately 1,000-fold higher virus titers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A).

We and others have previously shown that IFN-&#x003b1; can inhibit H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 virus replication (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Here, we show that the H5N1/2004 avian influenza strain replicates and spreads efficiently in M&#x00278;s and moDCs even at very low multiplicity infection (MOI 0.01) (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A,B), although the host cells respond to the infection with maximal cytokine gene expression (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). The H5N1/2004 virus induced strong IFN-&#x003bb;1, IFN-&#x003b1;1, and IFN-&#x003b2; gene expression in M&#x00278;s (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A&#x02013;C). This suggests that the H5N1 virus is able to spread irrespective of the activation of antiviral immune responses since otherwise IFNs should inhibit virus replication. Lower virus doses in H3N2 or H7N9-infected moDCs led to clearly weaker IFN responses when compared with H5N1-infected cells at the 24&#x02009;h time point (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A&#x02013;C) suggesting that there are likely less infected cells that produce IFNs. To get further view of H5N1/2004 virus induced &#x0201c;cytokine storm,&#x0201d; we investigated the expression of chemokine CXCL10 and CCL5 and pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; genes in H3N2, H5N1/2004, or H7N9 virus-infected M&#x00278;s (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>D&#x02013;G). Like IFN responses, with low MOI value, also CXCL10, CCL5, and TNF-&#x003b1; responses were higher in H5N1-infected M&#x00278;s with low MOI value than with low MOI values in H3N2 or H7N9 virus infection. Induction of IL-1&#x003b2; gene expression is very low with H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 viruses (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>F) as we have also previously shown in moDCs (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). IFN-&#x003bb;1, IFN-&#x003b1;1, IFN-&#x003b2;, CXCL10, CCL5, IL-1&#x003b2;, and TNF-&#x003b1; gene expression was also investigated in H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 virus-infected moDCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Data from moDCs correlate with the data from virus-infected M&#x00278;s though CXCL10 mRNA induction was clearly higher in moDCs than in M&#x00278;s, whereas CCL5 gene was expressed in higher levels in M&#x00278;s. Thus, we next analyzed the expression of antiviral proteins in H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9-infected M&#x00278;s (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>A) and moDCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>B). With all analyzed viruses, the expression of IFN-induced antiviral MxA protein was the strongest at the 24-h time point (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>A,B). We also analyzed the expression of phosphorylated transcription factors IRF3 (P-IRF3) and STAT2 (P-STAT2) and noticed that the protein expression of these proteins was weaker in H7N9-infected cells compared with those seen in H5N1 or H3N2 infected cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>A,B) which correlates well with the gene expression of IFNs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>) as well as with our previous study (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). The data show that in a multi-cyclic infection the H5N1 virus is able to induce very strong IFN gene expressions and antiviral MxA protein expression.</p><fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p>Innate immune responses in H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9 influenza virus-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (M&#x00278;s).

After that many subtypes of avian influenza A viruses have been reported to cause infections in humans, among them the H7N9 influenza type (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). High prevalence of influenza viruses in birds, the possibility of formation of new highly pathogenic reassortants and the ability of these viruses to spread to humans makes avian influenza A viruses of great global concern and emphasize the importance of virus&#x02013;host cell interaction studies in human cell systems. In this study, we wanted to characterize different steps of H5N1 virus infection in human immune cells to reveal potential mechanisms explaining the severe clinical outcome of the H5N1 virus infection. In our previous study, we have shown that the avian H5N1 and H7N9 viruses can replicate in human moDCs (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Here, we show that, unlike the H7N9 or seasonal influenza A viruses, the H5N1 virus is efficiently spreading in human immune cell cultures leading to a productive infection and robust IFN response. The remarkable ability of H5N1 virus to spread in human immune cells and likely other human cell types can be one explanation for the severe disease seen in humans with H5N1 virus infection. Here, we show that this ability is associated with at least two different HPAI H5N1 virus strains, and it may be a universal feature for all highly pathogenic avian-origin influenza A virus subtypes. There may be other viral or host factors regulating avian influenza pathogenicity in humans, since the LPAI H7N9 virus (LPAI in birds) has caused more human infections and deaths than the H5N1 subtype (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In addition, there is now evidence that the H7N9 subtype has evolved to a HPAI H7N9 strain in birds, and this type of virus has already caused infections in humans (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Human infections with the HPAI H5N1 viruses are associated with a high viral load (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), and our data presented in this study confirm that the ability of the H5N1 virus to replicate and spread in immune cell culture is completely different from those of the LPAI H7N9 and seasonal H3N2 influenza A virus infections (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>A,B). The efficacy of systemic spread of influenza viruses depends on the cleavage of HA0 into HA1 and HA2 subunits and the distribution of appropriate proteases in host tissues. We noticed that the HA0 of H5N1 virus is cleaved very efficiently in human immune cells while the cleavage of the HA0 of H3N2 or H7N9 viruses is inefficient (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>D). However, externally added TPCK-trypsin, which cleaves the HA0 precursor to HA1 and HA2 subunits, increases the proportion of infected cells in H3N2 and H7N9 infection (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A,B). There is clear evidence that the multi-basic HA1&#x02013;HA2 cleavage site constituting of several lysine or/and arginine residues in the HA molecule of the HPAI strains, in contrast to a mono-basic cleavage site in LPAI and seasonal influenza viruses, regulate the pathogenesis of influenza A viruses. The multi-basic cleavage site in the HA has been shown to be a critical determinant of systemic spread of HPAI H5N1 virus (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The emerged HPAI form of the H7N9 virus expressing the multi-basic site in HA is showing mammalian adaptation with increased pathogenicity and respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Yet, there must be other factors besides the multi-basic cleavage site that contribute to virus replication and spreading in mammals. Schrauwen and coworkers (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) have shown that the insertion of a multi-basic cleavage site in the HA of H3N2 virus enhances the cleavage of HA and replication in MDCK cells, but it did not increase the pathogenicity in ferrets. In addition, the study by Matthaei et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) shows that the human H5N1 isolates replicate more efficiently in human epithelial cells than the avian H5N1 isolates, suggesting that there must be other differences in addition to multi-basic HA0 cleavage site between human and avian isolates that contribute to the pathogenicity of the virus. Zhao and coworkers have shown that a G158N mutation in HA (H3 numbering) of an avian HPAI H5N1 isolate enhanced viral production and induced stronger host immune responses in mammalian cells (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) which indicates that multi-basic HA1&#x02013;HA2 cleavage site is not the only factor affecting virulence. Also, our results are consistent with this study of Zhao et al. since both A/Hong Kong/156/1997 and A/Vietnam/1194/2004 H5N1 viruses have asparagine residue at position 158.</p><p>It is generally accepted that influenza A virus infection in epithelial cells is productive leading to the release of a great number of progeny viruses from these cells. There is, however, a controversy whether human DCs and M&#x00278;s can efficiently produce infectious influenza A viruses. Bender and coworkers showed that a seasonal H1N1 influenza A virus infection in human DCs is abortive (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Tate et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) and Ioannidis et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) obtained very similar results in mouse M&#x00278; and DC model systems with both seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses. On the other hand, the study by Yu et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) indicates that the HPAI H5N1 virus can replicate productively in human alveolar M&#x00278;s but the infection with seasonal H1N1 virus was abortive. Also, several other studies show that an infection in monocyte-derived M&#x00278;s with seasonal H3N2 or HPAI H5N1 viruses seems to be productive (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). In conclusion, it seems that a H1N1 type influenza A virus infection is likely abortive and, consistent with our results, HPAI H5N1 virus infection is productive (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A,B) in human immune cells. Nonetheless, there are inconsistent results on the productivity of seasonal H3N2 influenza A virus infection in human cells. In our analyses, a H3N2 influenza A virus as well as the LPAI human isolate of H7N9 virus appeared to cause abortive infection in human moDCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>B). Instead, H3N2 and H7N9 virus infections seemed to be productive in M&#x00278;s (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A). However, the productivity of these viruses was clearly lower when compared with that of the HPAI H5N1 virus. We used another way, namely analyzing the relative amount of virus-specific RNA from cell culture supernatants, to indirectly quantitate the amount of secreted influenza virus into cell culture supernatant. Based on this analysis, there was a good correlation between the amount of infectious virus and the viral RNA levels in the supernatants of H3N2, H5N1, and H7N9-infected M&#x00278;s and moDCs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>C,D). A technical detail may, however, confound the results since in moDC infections the input virus was not washed away. It may be that, since in the plaque assay of the supernatant samples the background is relative high and H3N2 or H7N9 infections are only weakly productive, we are unable to clearly see an increase in the virus titers. The productivity of influenza virus infections in human DCs and M&#x00278;s have remained poorly investigated and thus our result is a significant addition to the present knowledge.</p><p>There is limited amount of information of how many new influenza virus particles or infective units a single-infected cell can produce. Baccam et al. (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) estimated that a single H1N1 virus-infected cell of the upper respiratory tract can produce up to 22 new infectious virus particles leading to a productive infection. It is possible that a single H5N1 virus-infected cell produces even more infective progeny viruses, which may explain the fast and efficient spread of the H5N1 virus in our experimental systems. This study shows that in human immune cells the HPAI H5N1 virus can spread faster than the H3N2 or H7N9 viruses. This may contribute to the ability of H5N1 virus to cause a systemic infection associated with a fatal outcome in H5N1 virus-infected humans.</p><p>It is commonly thought that the IFN system is the key factor regulating the efficacy of host antiviral responses and the clearance of the virus. However, the high mortality in H5N1 infection has been associated with an excessive inflammatory response in the lungs of virus-infected individuals (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Our study shows that the H5N1 virus grows extremely well in human immune cells and it induces strong IFN responses (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A&#x02013;C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>A&#x02013;C), both of which may contribute to the clinical outcome of the H5N1 infection. Our data show that IFN and also pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses are higher in infection with H5N1 than with H3N2 or H7N9 viruses at low MOI at the 24&#x02009;h time point after infection. At the same time, we see that after 24&#x02009;h infection with the H5N1 virus all cells are infected whereas with the H3N2 or H7N9 virus only proportion of the cells is infected. This suggests that there is a positive correlation between the spread of infection and the cytokine responses. Thus, the strong IFN responses and virus replication are not exclusive of each other; for instance, Ngunjiri et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) have shown that the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus is sensitive to the antiviral actions of IFNs. There is also evidence that H5N1 viruses with high replication competency can ultimately overcome the antiviral effects induced by IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Bordi et al. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) have shown that IFN-&#x003bb; and IFN-&#x003b1; have antagonistic antiviral activity against Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. However, in our previous study (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) in influenza A virus infection, we did not see any antagonistic activity between IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003bb;, or IFN-&#x003bb; and IFN-&#x003b3;, or IFN-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;. We have shown that in H5N1 virus infection IFN-&#x003b1; is produced leading to strong MxA protein expression in the cells which proves that IFN signaling is intact in H5N1-infected cells (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Still, in this study, we clearly show that HPAI H5N1 virus can replicate and spread extremely efficiently in human innate immune cells despite of strong activation of IFN gene expression and MxA protein expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). This indicates that due to efficient spread of H5N1 virus and high infectivity in the cell cultures there are more cells which can produce IFNs leading to a cytokine storm associated with H5N1-infected patients. This may in part explain the fatal outcome of a H5N1 virus infection in humans. Although the clinical outcome in humans is similar in H5N1 and H7N9 virus infections, surprisingly the antiviral IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression is impaired in H7N9 virus-infected immune cells (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). Thus, it seems that the mechanism behind the pathogenicity is different in H5N1 and H7N9 virus infection which still demands further investigations.</p><p>In this study, we have shown that different types of influenza A viruses may behave very differently in immune cells, primary human monocyte-derived M&#x00278;s and DCs functioning as our model cell systems. While HPAI H5N1 virus efficiently replicated and spread in immune cell cultures seasonal H3N2 and surprisingly LPAI H7N9 viruses showed reduced ability to establish a productive infection. More studies are clearly warranted to further reveal the mechanistic details regulating the ability of HPAI avian influenza viruses to replicate in human primary immune cells and to understand the relationship between the virus and host innate immune system.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>VW performed most of the experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript.
