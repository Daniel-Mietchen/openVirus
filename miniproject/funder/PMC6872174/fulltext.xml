Concurrently, emerging viral diseases, particularly those that are mosquito-borne, have spread dramatically in the past several decades, culminating in outbreaks of several viruses worldwide. Both forms of malnourishment are known to lead to an aberrant immune response, which can worsen disease outcomes and reduce vaccination efficacy for viral pathogens such as influenza and measles. Given the increasing rates of malnutrition and spread of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), there is an urgent need to understand the role of host nutrition on the infection, virulence, and transmission of these viruses. To address this gap in knowledge, we infected lean, obese, and undernourished mice with arthritogenic arboviruses from the genus Alphavirus and assessed morbidity, virus replication, transmission, and evolution. Obesity and undernourishment did not consistently influence virus replication in the blood of infected animals except for reductions in virus in obese mice late in infection. However, morbidity was increased in obese mice under all conditions. Using Mayaro virus (MAYV) as a model arthritogenic alphavirus, we determined that both obese and undernourished mice transmit virus less efficiently to mosquitoes than control (lean) mice. In addition, viral genetic diversity and replicative fitness were reduced in virus isolated from obese compared to lean controls. Taken together, nutrition appears to alter the course of alphavirus infection and should be considered as a critical environmental factor during outbreaks.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Over- and undernutrition, collectively known as malnutrition, affect over 2.5 billion people worldwide. Associations between malnutrition and mosquito-borne virus infection and resulting disease have been identified in epidemiological studies but have not been explored in controlled studies.

We found that markers of disease, namely weight loss and footpad swelling, were increased in obese mice. We also found that replication differences between mice fed different diets were minimal except late in infection for obese mice when levels of virus dropped significantly. When mosquitoes were allowed to feed on mice fed different diets, we observed reduced infection and transmission rates, depending on the diet. Finally, we found reduced genetic diversity and replicative fitness of virus isolated from obese mice.

Notably, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) re-emerged in 2004 to cause a massive outbreak in the Indian Ocean region [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], which subsequently spread to the Americas in 2013, resulting in millions of cases [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Ross River virus (RRV) causes thousands of cases a year in Australia [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and has previously caused outbreaks in the Pacific Islands [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Mayaro virus (MAYV), traditionally confined to sylvatic transmission in South America, was recently isolated in Haiti for the first time, serving as a warning that urban transmission can occur [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Arthritogenic alphaviruses produce a disease that is characterized by fever, myalgia, and polyarthralgia, which can last for months or even years [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recent CHIKV epidemics have been associated with an increased number of deaths, suggesting that severe disease may be more common than is typically thought [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While the rise in global travel, the spread of mosquito vectors, and climate change are likely involved in the expansion of these viruses, it is conceivable that changes in human health have also facilitated spread. Specifically, worldwide obesity has tripled since 1975, and the World Health Organization (WHO) currently estimates that 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Concurrently, roughly 10% of the adult population worldwide is considered underweight [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Over- and underweight, along with nutrient deficiencies, can be classified together as malnutrition and commonly occur in the same country or even within the same family [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Both obesity and undernutrition are known to alter immunity and can lead to an increased risk of infection from several pathogens (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). Additionally, obesity and undernutrition have been shown to increase disease severity and decrease the protective immune response for influenza virus [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), some epidemiological reports suggest that obesity is associated with a higher likelihood of being seropositive for CHIKV [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Sindbis virus (SINV) [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and dengue virus (DENV) [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In contrast, several reports suggest that undernourishment may result in a decreased risk of contracting dengue fever [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition to susceptibility to infection, obesity has been identified as a risk factor for greater disease severity following infection with CHIKV [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and DENV [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Undernourishment, in contrast, has been associated with protection from severe DENV disease [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, these data are not conclusive as other studies have found either no association with DENV disease severity [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or an increased risk of severe disease [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Depending on how malnutrition was defined, infants in the same study were found to have both an increased or decreased risk for severe DENV disease [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While the epidemiological data are quite clear that obesity is associated with more severe disease outcomes for various arboviruses, this connection is not so clear for undernutrition.</p><p>To our knowledge, no studies have directly assessed the role of nutrition in arbovirus infection using animal models. Given the worldwide prevalence of these forms of malnutrition and arbovirus disease, it is essential to understand how these comorbidities interact. We sought to determine what role both over- and undernutrition play in alphavirus disease, replication, transmission, and virus evolution in a mouse model. To accomplish this, we fed mice different diets; a high-fat overnutrition diet (HFD) with 45% fat; a low-protein undernutrition diet (5% protein); and a control diet with similar characteristics to the other diets except for macronutrient content. Following a sustained feeding period, we infected mice with either CHIKV, MAYV, or RRV and followed infection. We observed altered virus replication and transmission to mosquitoes in obese mice. Furthermore, we noted a reduction in genetic diversity in virus isolated from obese mice. Our findings illustrate the importance of nutrition on virus infection and suggest that nutritional status may be an underappreciated host factor in arbovirus disease, transmission, and evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal work was performed in accordance with the Animal Committee regulations of the Institut Pasteur in Paris, France, in accordance with the 2010/63 EU directive adopted on 22 September 2010 by the European Parliament and the European Union Council.

The MAYV infectious clone used in this study has been described previously [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The RRV infectious clone will be described further in a separate manuscript. A modified version of the MAYV plasmid that contained the nanoLuc (nLuc) reporter gene in the nsp3 protein was constructed as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

For experiments involving CHIKV and MAYV, 10<sup>4</sup> PFU of virus in 50 &#x003bc;l was used for infections. For experiments involving RRV, 10<sup>3</sup> PFU of virus in 50 &#x003bc;l was used for infections. All virus dilutions were performed in RPMI-1640 media with 10 mM HEPES and 1% FBS. Mice were weighed daily following infection and monitored for morbidity. Inflammation at the site of injection was assessed by measuring the width of the infected footpad using a digital caliper. Blood collections were performed using the submandibular route with a 5 mM lancet (Goldenrod) into a gold-top microtainer tube (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ USA). Serum was separated via centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 10 minutes and transferred to a fresh tube before storage at -80&#x000b0;C. For infections and blood collections, mice were anesthetized using either isoflurane inhalation or a ketamine/xylazine (10 and 1 mg/ml, respectively) mix introduced by intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Infection of RRV in Balb/c mice varied slightly.

Readings to measure amplification were taken after the combined annealing/extension step. The number of genomes/mL was calculated based on a series of dilutions of RNA that was generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription from the full-length infectious clones mentioned previously to generate a standard curve. The Ct values of the samples were then fit to the standard curve to calculate the genomes/mL (GE/mL).

To generate a consensus sequence for comparisons, we aligned the fastq files from the MAYV stocks that were used for infection to a MAYV TRVL 4675 reference sequence (Accession MK070492.1) using BBMap. We next called variants using LoFreq and filtered the resulting vcf file to contain only variants above 50% [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Finally, we used vcftools to generate a new consensus fasta file based on the variants above 50% [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The trimmed reads were then used as an input for analysis using the ViVAN pipeline [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with a coverage cutoff of &#x0003e;100x and a p-value filter of 0.05. The ViVAN outputs provide an array of genetic diversity indices, including Shannon entropy, region variation, and region heterogeneity. Analysis with Vivan was performed as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Briefly, for each position throughout the viral genome, base identity and their quality scores were collected. Each variant was determined to be valid using a generalized likelihood-ratio test (used to determine the total number of minority variants) and its allele rate was modified according to its covering read qualities based on a maximum likelihood estimation. Additionally, a confidence interval was calculated for each allele rate. In order to correct for multiple testing, the Benjamini-Hochberg false-discovery rate was set at 5%. Shannon entropy provides a measure of genetic diversity associated with the uncertainty of sampling a given genomic position; higher Shannon entropy indicates higher genetic diversity. The region variation is affected by selective pressures on the virus; a high variation rate suggests the accumulation of variant alleles which may be caused by positive selective pressures. Region heterogeneity, in contrast, measures replication fidelity; a virus with a more error-prone polymerase will have higher region heterogeneity. The equations for Shannon Entropy, region variation, and region heterogeneity are presented in our previous publications [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Quantitative <italic>in vivo</italic> competition assay for empirical virus fitness measures</title><p>Relative fitness was measured using a qRT-PCR based direct competition assay previously described in [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] with some modifications.

At the same time, roughly 10% of adults globally are underweight [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Obesity has been associated with increased disease severity upon infection with CHIKV in humans [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In contrast, no information exists regarding the relationship between alphavirus infection/disease and undernutrition. In this study, we sought to clarify the relationship between nutrition and alphavirus infection. More explicitly, we aimed to examine the role of both obesity and undernutrition on infection, transmission, and evolution of arthritogenic alphaviruses, focusing on MAYV but including other important human pathogens, CHIKV and RRV. We fed mice different diets leading to either obesity or undernutrition and compared them to lean control mice. Obese mice experienced more severe morbidity upon infection for all three arthritogenic viruses tested. These results are consistent with previous studies showing an association between body-mass index (BMI) and more severe disease sequelae in humans following CHIKV infection [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In these studies, undernutrition did not result in more severe morbidity in acute arthritis models of infection with either CHIKV or MAYV. Our use of only one type of undernutrition, protein-energy malnutrition, limits our ability to generate definite conclusions on undernutrition generally since undernutrition also includes micronutrient deficiencies or general energy deficits. It is possible that other forms of undernutrition alter infection differently than protein-energy malnutrition. To our knowledge, no studies have specifically looked at the relationship between undernutrition and alphavirus disease severity. However, several conflicting studies with dengue virus (DENV) have shown that undernutrition may be associated with both protection [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] or increased susceptibility to [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] DENV disease.</p><p>We next showed that obesity alters viral replication. For MAYV and CHIKV infection, we observed increased early viral replication in the blood of obese mice compared to lean controls. It is unlikely that this was due to faster local replication at the injection site (hind left footpad) since we observed no differences in viral replication on day 2 post-infection in obese mice footpads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). These results suggest that diet did not alter early replication in the joint. Given the inflammatory nature of obesity (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]) and the fact that obesity alters epithelial cell permeability [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], it is possible that the difference in early virus replication may reflect faster escape from the tissues, resulting in a more rapid systemic spread. No clear, repeatable differences in viral replication were observed between LP mice and lean controls. It is possible that the diet used in these studies was not sufficiently low in protein and, as such, the mice were not fully malnourished. We used a 5% protein diet for these studies. Previous studies using a 2% protein diet found increased viral replication with both influenza virus [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Sendai virus [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, this was not the case with respiratory syncytial virus, as no differences in viral replication were observed in 2% protein fed mice compared to lean controls [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. According to Abrahams et al. [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], the range of energy from protein in forty Sub-Saharan African countries as a percentage is 6.08&#x02013;13.47 &#x000b1; 1.6, suggesting our use of 5% was more reflective of the current reality than 2%.</p><p>We next assessed the genetic diversity of virus isolated from mice fed different diets. Virus isolated from obese mice had both significantly lower total and non-synonymous Shannon entropy, a measure of information content that is maximum when all alleles are equifrequent, compared to lean mice. Furthermore, obese mice displayed a significantly lower variation rate, which identifies the specific accumulation of mutations in a population that may be associated with selective pressures, than lean controls. The difference between virus isolated from undernourished and lean mice approached but did not meet statistical significance for these metrics. Finally, we assessed region heterogeneity, a marker of replication fidelity not associated with selection, and found no differences among any of the groups. Collectively, these observations led us to hypothesize that there may be some selective pressure in obese mice that reduces viral genetic diversity. A previous study with Sendai virus in mice fed different diets found no differences in genetic diversity in virus isolated from bronchiolar lavage fluid [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. It is possible that differences between Sendai virus, which is negative-sense, and MAYV, which is positive sense, account for this. For example, positive sense viruses have greater variability in mutation rates than negative sense counterparts [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that codon usage in positive sense viruses matches their hosts more closely than negative sense viruses, possibly because the genome acts as an mRNA [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Therefore, evolution likely differs significantly between negative and positive sense RNA viruses.</p><p>Since we sequenced virus from the blood from mice infected in the footpad, it is also conceivable that bottlenecks within the mice accounted for the observed differences. It is plausible that the virus replicated in the blood of obese mice more slowly later in infection due to the host immune response or other factors, which could account for both the reduction in viral titer on day 3 post-infection and the reduced genetic diversity. Obesity is known to alter the relative amounts of different leukocytes, potentially altering the availability of susceptible cells during infection or leading to a skewed cytokine response [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It is possible that differences in the immune status of mice from each group result in different selective pressures on the virus population. Several studies have shown that the innate immune system is involved in viral evolution [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Finally, obese mice are expected to have more adipocytes (i.e., fat cells) while undernourished mice are expected to have fewer. Adipocytes secrete a variety of cytokine-like molecules called adipokines that alter immune response and energy utilization [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Furthermore, adipocytes differentiate from fibroblasts [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], which are known targets of alphavirus replication [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], potentially making them targets for alphavirus replication. Future studies will aim to uncover the mechanism behind the differences in viral genetic diversity observed in mice fed different diets.</p><p>Previous studies from our group have shown that sufficient genetic diversity and replication fitness is required to maintain adaptability, dissemination, and efficient transmission [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that virus isolated from obese mice might have reduced fitness and adaptability in a new environment. To test this, we first individually mixed MAYV isolated from the serum of mice fed different diets with a genetically marked reference virus and exposed them to a new environment by infecting new lean mice with this mix. Virus isolated from obese mice was found to have reduced fitness at the site of injection in the new environment compared to virus derived from lean mice. However, viral fitness was able to recover in the serum, as we observed no differences on days one or two post-infection. Future studies should probe fitness changes after multiple passages in hosts with different nutritional status, which might occur during an actual outbreak.</p><p>We next performed a mosquito transmission experiment by exposing mosquitoes to viremic mice previously fed different diets. For arboviruses, most transmission cycles require both the vertebrate and invertebrate host, which are highly divergent environments, a fact that restricts arbovirus evolution [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Mosquitoes that fed on obese mice displayed reduced infection and transmission rates compared to mosquitoes fed on lean control mice, despite no differences in viremia at the time of bloodmeal acquisition. These results point towards the decreased adaptability of virus isolated from obese mice, possibly due to the reduced genetic diversity observed in sequencing data. It is also possible that lipids or other factors in the blood that are altered in obesity or lipid changes in the virions themselves altered rates of transmission to mosquitoes in obese mice. Only mosquitoes that were fully bloodfed were selected for testing, and viremia levels were not different between the groups, so each mosquito likely received roughly the same amount of infectious virus. These data suggest that obese individuals may provide a certain level of refractoriness against subsequent viral transmission. Nutrition has been linked previously to virus fitness in mice fed either a selenium or vitamin E deficient diet and then infected with Coxsackie B3 virus; the virus was found to evolve quickly to a more virulent genotype [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Nelson et al. observed similar results in selenium-deficient mice infected with influenza virus, as a new virulent strain emerged from a previously low virulence progenitor strain in selenium-deficient but not selenium-adequate mice [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Finally, 10 passages of Sendai virus in mice fed a control, high-fat, or low-selenium diet did not result in differences in genetic diversity (as measured by Shannon entropy) in the virus population. However, the virus populations displayed phenotypic differences upon infection of a new host, suggesting that nutritional status influenced the virus population and resulting transmission. It is possible that their sequencing approach was not sensitive enough to detect genetic differences within the population. Given the prevalence of obesity, undernutrition, and nutrient deficiencies, future studies should elucidate the influence of nutritional status on virus fitness and adaptation to novel environments.</p><p>Arthritogenic alphaviruses are known to cause chronic inflammation, and CHIKV RNA and protein have been found in an infected human up to 18-months post initial infection [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Furthermore, CHIKV has been found in the infected joints of mice up to 16 weeks post-infection [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Therefore, we sought to assess whether nutrition influences persistent alphavirus replication in the joints of mice. We found that obese mice had significantly lower levels of RNA for both MAYV and RRV 65 days post-infection compared to lean controls. However, it is unclear what role persistent viral replication plays in chronic alphavirus disease, as long-term disease in humans is strongly associated with the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines but not necessarily viral RNA [<xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref074" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Therefore, obesity may be involved in persistent alphavirus replication, which may be involved in chronic disease.</p><p>These studies highlight the importance of nutrition in alphavirus infection and provide further support for the need to consider this population in epidemiological studies and vaccine trials. Furthermore, malnutrition represents a simple way to alter the immune landscape of an animal, making it possible to identify host factors involved in virus replication, transmission, evolution, and pathogenesis. Future studies with additional medically relevant arboviruses should continue to probe this relationship.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1008089.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Removing the RNA extraction step increases the quantity of RNA detected from serum samples.</title><p>Serum samples from mice infected with Mayaro virus (MAYV) were used to assess the necessity for an RNA extraction step before one-step quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). qRT-PCR was performed using the NEB Luna Universal Probe kit with MAYV specific primers. For RNA extractions, the Zymo Viral DNA/RNA extraction kit was used. For testing without extraction, the samples were diluted 1:5 in PBS and then used directly for qRT-PCR. Viral RNA prepared from an infectious clone was serially diluted in ten-fold dilutions and used to generate a standard curve. The sample values were then fit to this standard curve and the volumes normalized to calculate the number of genome copies per mL of serum (genomes/mL).

The effects of host nutrition on virus infections in general is an understudied and under appreciated area. Therefore this paper has important implications for human health in an increasingly obese environment. However, there are some concerns with the paper that need to addressed.</p><p>Reviewer #2: In their manuscript, Weger-Lucarelli et. al. describe their study of nutritional influences on alphavirus infection mouse models. The authors find some interesting correlations between obesity/undernutrition and alphavirus infection. The paper is well written and clear and, overall, very good work. The topic is extremely novel and timely, especially with the global syndemic of malnutrition and endemic and emerging infectious diseases. However, some questions/issues exist and should be addressed in the context of these studies.</p><p>Reviewer #3: This study attempts to identify an important and previously unexplored link between host nutritional status and alphavirus infection. The study is straightforward and clearly outlined. The results are well presented. Statistics are acceptable. The discussion is well done with the exception of lines 400-409 which is essentially a repeat of the results. See below for specific comments:</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Part II &#x02013; Major Issues: Key Experiments Required for Acceptance</bold></p><p>Please use this section to detail the key new experiments or modifications of existing experiments that should be <underline>absolutely</underline> required to validate study conclusions.</p><p>Generally, there should be no more than 3 such required experiments or major modifications for a "Major Revision" recommendation. If more than 3 experiments are necessary to validate the study conclusions, then you are encouraged to recommend "Reject".</p><p>Reviewer #1: 1. Supplementary Table 1 was not included with the manuscript. This table described the nutrient content of the diets, so this is critical missing piece. I am assuming this was just an oversight by the authors</p><p>2. In the introduction, the authors state that they fed mice two high fat diets-45% and 61%, but the data presented only includes 45% high fat diets. Did they use the 61% diet? And if so, did the results mirror the 45% diet? This would be important information to know.</p><p>3. Authors should present actual weights (figures 1 and 2) of mice rather than just percent loss or percent gain of weight. It can be added as supplementary data, but it needs to be there. The readers have no idea if the starting weights were identical, and how much weight in grams were lost or gained. How many grams were the obese mice?</p><p>4. The authors mention diabetes in the discussion, but no metabolic markers were provided. What were the glucose levels of the mice? Were they, in fact, diabetic?</p><p>5. The authors measure leptin, but it&#x02019;s unclear what the point is. It&#x02019;s well known that leptin levels increase with adiposity. They did not see a leptin difference between low protein and control diet-what is the significance of this finding? Does it matter? This data could be removed, unless the authors provide more context. It seems to be just &#x0201c;thrown in&#x0201d; as a piece of data.</p><p>6. The legend for the stats on figure 1A is not clear. You have to read the text to understand the purpose of the one star that is shown on the data. The stats information should be clearly stated in the figure legend.</p><p>7. With the CHIKV challenge, why were weight actually increasing after infection for the non-obese groups?</p><p>8. For the pathology slides in Supp Fig 2, it would be helpful for the readers to use arrows to point out the inflammation, and to provide what histopathological score the photos represent.</p><p>9. The authors wanted to see if their results would be similar using a strain of mouse different from the B6 mice. This is a logical step, however, they also had to treat the mice with antibody to block type-I IFN-again, a major departure from the B6 mice. So this is not a good comparison between strains.</p><p>10. In the discussion section, they claim that the model of RRV led to 60% of the undernourished mice and 40% of the obese died from the infection, yet all the lean mice lived. However, in the results section, they state that 2 mice from the obese group and 3 mice from the LP group died-out of a total of 7 mice. This is not 60% mortality. And, they also state that the results were not statistically significant, so this does not rise to a level that needs to be discussed.</p><p>Reviewer #2: 1) Type of fat included in the diet can be very influential on the outcomes of experimental infection. How was this particular diet chosen as a proxy for biological relevance? Also, it may be good include a genetically obese model in the experimentation to show that obesity itself and not diet, can result in similar changes as observed in these studies. This would also be a very interesting question to help cover the influence of leptin on outcomes of these experiments as the authors have chosen to use this measure as a proxy of nutritional status.</p><p>2) Since adipose tissue is a highly vascularized organ, it is possible that the virus is being trapped in the extra adipose and that is why the authors do not observe differences (or even lowered) viremia? Was any attempt made to measure viral particles in other tissues (especially adipose) aside from the footpad and serum? Similar studies would be interesting for the persistence of viral RNA. Please consider doing this experimentation.</p><p>Reviewer #3: None</p><p>**********</p><p><bold>Part III &#x02013; Minor Issues: Editorial and Data Presentation Modifications</bold></p><p>Please use this section for editorial suggestions as well as relatively minor modifications of existing data that would enhance clarity.</p><p>Reviewer #1: Some paragraphs in the discussion need to be broken up for better readability.</p><p>Reviewer #2: 1) In the introduction, the authors refer to four different diets (Line 90), but only discuss three diets in the feeding methodology described on lines 140-141. Please consider revising for consistency. The remainder of the paper only refers to the 45% diet. If data is available for the 61% diet, please include in the paper.</p><p>2) Please give references in the methodology text for successful employment of these diets in previous studies.</p><p>3) Was any kind of clinical score (semi-quantitiative) taken during the mouse infections to monitor health of the animals? Hunching, coat quality, etc all could be monitored to increase knowledge of morbidity in these animals.</p><p>4) Lines 256: &#x0201c;weight gain&#x0201d; should just be &#x0201c;weight&#x0201d;?</p><p>5) Please show all data from C57 versus Balb/c experimentation, including leptin measurements. This data is especially important as these animals are generally less susceptible to dietary treatment that the more widely used C57Bl/6 mice.</p><p>6) The data from the serological viral titer determination and the luminescence studies seems to be contradictory. Was viremia/RNAemia measured at day 6 between obese and healthy models?</p><p>7) Is 2 days generally accepted as the period of time with the most changes in the viral quasispecies? This would be especially important to ask if a virus from a LP or obese mouse cause differential morbidity or mortality in a lean host aside from changes in fitness?</p><p>8) How do the genetic changes in the viruses correlate to pathogenicity of the viral species themselves aside from fitness?</p><p>9) While the LP diet is interesting (as it represents one of the main types of malnutrition, kwashiorkor), other types of malnutrition exist in areas endemic for these virsues including complete marasmus, caloric restriction, and micronutrient deficiencies. Can the authors further comment on how different types of undernutrition could further change the results of this study?</p><p>Reviewer #3: How much Protein is in the control diet? Currently, only obese and lean are described.</p><p>Figure 2: There is an interesting bi- or tri-phasic behavior in the foot pad swelling. Is there an explanation for this? It seems consistent in MAYV and CHIKV both. Also, line 255 says CHIKV and RRV, but only CHIKV is discussed. Was the data and discussion for RRV missed? It would be important to mention since E and F have a different mouse with RRV. Readers may be interested in the RRV C57bL/6 data for comparison.</p><p>Figure 4: B,C and D, labels difficult to see. What A represents is unclear. What &#x02018;flux&#x02019; are we measuring?</p><p>**********</p><p>PLOS authors have the option to publish the peer review history of their article (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/s/editorial-and-peer-review-process#loc-peer-review-history">what does this mean?</ext-link>).

</p><p>Dear Dr. Weger-Lucarelli,</p><p>We are delighted to inform you that your manuscript, "Host Nutritional Status Affects Alphavirus Virulence, Transmission, and Evolution," has been formally accepted for publication in PLOS Pathogens.</p><p>We have now passed your article onto the PLOS Production Department who will complete the rest of the pre-publication process. All authors will receive a confirmation email upon publication.</p><p>The corresponding author will soon be receiving a typeset proof for review, to ensure errors have not been introduced during production. Please review the PDF proof of your manuscript carefully, as this is the last chance to correct any scientific or type-setting errors. Please note that major changes, or those which affect the scientific understanding of the work, will likely cause delays to the publication date of your manuscript. Note: Proofs for Front Matter articles (Pearls, Reviews, Opinions, etc...) are generated on a different schedule and may not be made available as quickly.</p><p>Soon after your final files are uploaded, the early version of your manuscript, if you opted to have an early version of your article, will be published online. The date of the early version will be your article's publication date. The final article will be published to the same URL, and all versions of the paper will be accessible to readers.</p><p>Thank you again for supporting open-access publishing; we are looking forward to publishing your work in PLOS Pathogens. </p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Kasturi Haldar</p><p>Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p>&#x0200b;<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5065-158X">orcid.org/0000-0001-5065-158X</ext-link></p><p>Grant McFadden</p><p>Editor-in-Chief</p><p>PLOS Pathogens</p><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2556-3526">orcid.org/0000-0002-2556-3526</ext-link></p></body></sub-article></article>
