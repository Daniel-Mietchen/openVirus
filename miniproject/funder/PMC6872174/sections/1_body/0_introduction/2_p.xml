<p>Both obesity and undernutrition are known to alter immunity and can lead to an increased risk of infection from several pathogens (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). Additionally, obesity and undernutrition have been shown to increase disease severity and decrease the protective immune response for influenza virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. For arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), some epidemiological reports suggest that obesity is associated with a higher likelihood of being seropositive for CHIKV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Sindbis virus (SINV) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and dengue virus (DENV) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In contrast, several reports suggest that undernourishment may result in a decreased risk of contracting dengue fever [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition to susceptibility to infection, obesity has been identified as a risk factor for greater disease severity following infection with CHIKV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and DENV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Undernourishment, in contrast, has been associated with protection from severe DENV disease [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, these data are not conclusive as other studies have found either no association with DENV disease severity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] or an increased risk of severe disease [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Depending on how malnutrition was defined, infants in the same study were found to have both an increased or decreased risk for severe DENV disease [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. While the epidemiological data are quite clear that obesity is associated with more severe disease outcomes for various arboviruses, this connection is not so clear for undernutrition.
