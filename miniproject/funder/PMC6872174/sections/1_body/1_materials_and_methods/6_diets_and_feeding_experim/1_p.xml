<p>All diets used in this study were obtained from SAFE diets (Augy, France). These custom diets were designed to vary as little as possible from one another except for macronutrient ratios. The obesogenic diet was a slightly modified version of a standard high-fat diet that has been used previously [

 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Mice were weighed weekly or biweekly prior infection to monitor the effect of diet on weight. All groups of mice were maintained on the specified diet for the entire duration of the experiment, including after infection. Before infection, mice were fed for 8â€“10 weeks on the different diets; a 45% fat obesogenic diet, a 5% protein undernourishment diet, and a control diet. Throughout the rest of the manuscript, we will refer to mice fed these diets as obese, LP, and lean, respectively.
