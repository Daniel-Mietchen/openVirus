<p>Mice were infected intradermally via the hind left-footpad as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For experiments involving CHIKV and MAYV, 10
 <sup>4</sup> PFU of virus in 50 μl was used for infections. For experiments involving RRV, 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of virus in 50 μl was used for infections. All virus dilutions were performed in RPMI-1640 media with 10 mM HEPES and 1% FBS. Mice were weighed daily following infection and monitored for morbidity. Inflammation at the site of injection was assessed by measuring the width of the infected footpad using a digital caliper. Blood collections were performed using the submandibular route with a 5 mM lancet (Goldenrod) into a gold-top microtainer tube (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ USA). Serum was separated via centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 10 minutes and transferred to a fresh tube before storage at -80°C. For infections and blood collections, mice were anesthetized using either isoflurane inhalation or a ketamine/xylazine (10 and 1 mg/ml, respectively) mix introduced by intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Infection of RRV in Balb/c mice varied slightly. Mice were treated with 0.1 mg in 100 μL of IFNAR1 blocking antibody (MAR1-5A3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]) via the intraperitoneal route one day before infection to increase their susceptibility to infection. Viremia was measured in all studies by plaque assay unless otherwise noted.
