 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> female mosquitoes belonging to the 7th generation of a colony coming from wild mosquitoes collected in Kamphaeng Phet Province (Thailand) were used for these studies. The mosquitoes were reared at 28°C, 70% relative humidity, under a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle, and fed with 10% sucrose 
 <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Groups of female mosquitoes were separated into cartons and eight days post-eclosion were allowed to feed on ketamine/xylazine anesthetized mice, which had been infected with MAYV 2 days previously, for 30–45 minutes. Fully engorged females were separated into new cartons and placed at 28°C, 70% humidity, under a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle with freely available sucrose. After ten days, the mosquitoes were anesthetized using Triethylamine (Sigma-Aldrich) and bodies and saliva were collected to assess infection and transmission, respectively. Bodies were homogenized using the TissueLyser II (QIAGEN) for 2 minutes at 30 cycles per second in RPMI containing 20% FBS, antibiotic/antimycotic mix, and 10 mM HEPES (herein called mosquito diluent). Saliva was collected by placing the proboscis in a barrier pipette containing 10μL mosquito diluent for 30 minutes. Following completion, the contents of the tip were pipetted into a tube containing 50μL mosquito diluent. The presence of virus was assessed by plaque assay and qRT-PCR.
