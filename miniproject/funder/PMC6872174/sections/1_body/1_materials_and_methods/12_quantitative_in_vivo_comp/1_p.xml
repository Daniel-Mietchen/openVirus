<p>Relative fitness was measured using a qRT-PCR based direct competition assay previously described in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] with some modifications. Serum was taken two days post-MAYV infection from mice fed either the control, 45% fat, or 5% protein diet to compete against a genetically marked reference virus with seven synonymous changes in the hypervariable portion of the nsp3 protein, which has previously been shown to tolerate modifications [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. 30,000 PFU from each serum sample was mixed with 30,000 PFU (1:1 ratio) of the marked virus and then used to infect female 6-week old lean C57BL/6 mice in the hind left footpad. Serum was taken one and two days post-infection and left footpads were harvested following euthanasia on the second day post-infection.
