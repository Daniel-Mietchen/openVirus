<p>We next showed that obesity alters viral replication. For MAYV and CHIKV infection, we observed increased early viral replication in the blood of obese mice compared to lean controls. It is unlikely that this was due to faster local replication at the injection site (hind left footpad) since we observed no differences in viral replication on day 2 post-infection in obese mice footpads (

 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], it is possible that the difference in early virus replication may reflect faster escape from the tissues, resulting in a more rapid systemic spread. No clear, repeatable differences in viral replication were observed between LP mice and lean controls. It is possible that the diet used in these studies was not sufficiently low in protein and, as such, the mice were not fully malnourished. We used a 5% protein diet for these studies. Previous studies using a 2% protein diet found increased viral replication with both influenza virus [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. However, this was not the case with respiratory syncytial virus, as no differences in viral replication were observed in 2% protein fed mice compared to lean controls [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. According to Abrahams et al. [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], the range of energy from protein in forty Sub-Saharan African countries as a percentage is 6.08–13.47 ± 1.6, suggesting our use of 5% was more reflective of the current reality than 2%.
