<p>Previous studies from our group have shown that sufficient genetic diversity and replication fitness is required to maintain adaptability, dissemination, and efficient transmission [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that virus isolated from obese mice might have reduced fitness and adaptability in a new environment. To test this, we first individually mixed MAYV isolated from the serum of mice fed different diets with a genetically marked reference virus and exposed them to a new environment by infecting new lean mice with this mix. Virus isolated from obese mice was found to have reduced fitness at the site of injection in the new environment compared to virus derived from lean mice. However, viral fitness was able to recover in the serum, as we observed no differences on days one or two post-infection. Future studies should probe fitness changes after multiple passages in hosts with different nutritional status, which might occur during an actual outbreak.
