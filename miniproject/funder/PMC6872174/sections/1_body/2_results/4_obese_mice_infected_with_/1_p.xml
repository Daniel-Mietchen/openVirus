<p>To visualize local replication at the site of infection, we infected mice fed different diets with a MAYV expressing the nano luciferase protein (nLuc). Obese mice displayed a significant increase in luminescence in their hind-left footpads 6 days after infection compared to lean controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, p = .0022). We did not observe differences in luminescence between the groups on day 2 or day 13 post-infection. Furthermore, at 15 seconds of exposure time on day 6 post-infection, nLuc expression was observed in the bodies of obese mice but not in the other groups. Representative images of each group on day 6 post-infection are presented for the obese (
