<p>Arthritogenic alphaviruses can cause chronic infection, and viral RNA has been detected up to 18 months post-infection in humans [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, we next assessed whether nutrition affects viral RNA persistence in mice. We collected footpads from obese, LP, and lean mice 65 days post MAYV (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008089.s009">S9 Fig</xref>) infection to test for viral RNA levels. Obese mice had significantly lower levels of MAYV RNA in their footpads compared to lean mice (p = 0.0476). Obese mice also had lower levels of RRV RNA in their footpads 65 days post-infection compared to controls (p = 0.0470). No infectious virus was observed in any of these samples.
