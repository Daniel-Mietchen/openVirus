<p>To determine whether these results were specific to C57BL/6 mice, and could be further expanded to another arthritogenic alphavirus, we next infected adult Balb/c mice with RRV. Since previous reports found that these mice are refractory to RRV infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], we treated the mice with an anti-IFNAR antibody (MAR1-5A3) to block type-1 interferon signaling one day before infection, as this is known to increase susceptibility to viral infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008089.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Both obese and LP mice experienced significantly increased weight loss after RRV challenge compared to lean control mice (
