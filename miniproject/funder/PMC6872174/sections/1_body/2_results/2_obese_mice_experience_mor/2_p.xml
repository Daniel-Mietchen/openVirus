<p>We next sought to determine if the differences in morbidity observed following MAYV infection were true for another arthritogenic alphavirus, namely CHIKV. Obese mice lost significantly more weight following CHIKV challenge compared to lean mice (

However, despite the differences in footpad swelling, we did not observe differences in histopathology between any of the groups following CHIKV infection (

We observed infiltration of histiocytes in all the infected footpads, and overall scores of pathology were similar among the groups (
