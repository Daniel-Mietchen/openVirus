<p>When we combined all mosquitoes for all mice in each group, we found that infection rates were significantly lower for mosquitoes fed on both obese and LP mice compared to lean control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, p = 0.0001 and 0.0005, respectively). Only 2% of all mosquitoes exposed to obese mice contained infectious virus in their saliva. In contrast, 7.3% of LP mice and 8.3% of lean mice contained infectious virus in their saliva. However, the difference between obese and lean mice did not reach significance for transmission in all mosquitoes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g007">Fig 7E</xref>, p = .10). Finally, we compared the number of viral genomes in the saliva of mosquitoes fed on each group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008089.g007">Fig 7F</xref>), which is a proxy for the ability of an individual mosquito to transmit to a new host. No significant differences were observed between any of the groups.
