<p>Reviewer #2: In their manuscript, Weger-Lucarelli et. al. describe their study of nutritional influences on alphavirus infection mouse models. The authors find some interesting correlations between obesity/undernutrition and alphavirus infection. The paper is well written and clear and, overall, very good work. The topic is extremely novel and timely, especially with the global syndemic of malnutrition and endemic and emerging infectious diseases. However, some questions/issues exist and should be addressed in the context of these studies.</p>
