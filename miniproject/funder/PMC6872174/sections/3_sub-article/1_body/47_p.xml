<p>Reviewer #2: 1) Type of fat included in the diet can be very influential on the outcomes of experimental infection. How was this particular diet chosen as a proxy for biological relevance? Also, it may be good include a genetically obese model in the experimentation to show that obesity itself and not diet, can result in similar changes as observed in these studies. This would also be a very interesting question to help cover the influence of leptin on outcomes of these experiments as the authors have chosen to use this measure as a proxy of nutritional status.</p>
