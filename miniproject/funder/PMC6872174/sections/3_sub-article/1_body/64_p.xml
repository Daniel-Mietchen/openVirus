<p>Figure 2: There is an interesting bi- or tri-phasic behavior in the foot pad swelling. Is there an explanation for this? It seems consistent in MAYV and CHIKV both. Also, line 255 says CHIKV and RRV, but only CHIKV is discussed. Was the data and discussion for RRV missed? It would be important to mention since E and F have a different mouse with RRV. Readers may be interested in the RRV C57bL/6 data for comparison.</p>
