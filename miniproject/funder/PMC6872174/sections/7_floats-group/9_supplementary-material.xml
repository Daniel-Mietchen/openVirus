  <title>Weights of mice following feeding on different diets.</title>
  <p>Groups of C57BL/6N (A-B, 7–14 mice per group) or Balb/c (C, 5 mice per group) were fed a 45% fat (Obese), 5% protein (LP), or a control (Lean) diet for 8–10 weeks. Weights were measured weekly or bi-weekly following the initiation of feeding. Weights are plotted in grams. Statistical comparisons were made using a two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction compared to the control group. The level of significance is represented as follows–ns (not significant) p&gt;0.05, * P&lt;0.05, **** p&lt;0.0001. The **** represents the comparison between the lean and obese groups. The * represents the comparison between the lean and the low protein groups. The error bars represent standard error. Each graph represents data obtained from at least two independent experiments except for C, which was performed once. The results from one representative experiment are presented.</p>
