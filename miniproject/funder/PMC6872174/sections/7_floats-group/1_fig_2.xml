  <title>Mice with differing nutritional status have altered morbidity following alphavirus infection.</title>
  <p>Groups of C57BL/6N mice (A-D) or Balb/c (E-F) were fed either a 45% fat (Obese), 5% protein (LP), or control (Lean) diet for 8–10 weeks. Mice were then infected with 10
   <sup>4</sup> PFU of either Mayaro virus (MAYV, 7 mice per group) or chikungunya virus (CHIKV, 14 mice per group) or 10
   <sup>3</sup> PFU of Ross River virus (RRV, 5 mice per group) in the hind left footpad and monitored for weight change (A, C, and E), footpad swelling (B, D), and, for RRV, mortality (F). For A-E, statistical analyses were performed by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction compared to the control group. For F, statistical analysis was performed by the Mantel-Cox test. The error bars represent standard error. The level of significance is represented as follows—* p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001. Besides E-F, each graph represents data obtained from at least two independent experiments. The results from one representative experiment are presented.
