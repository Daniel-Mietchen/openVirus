  <title>Weights of mice following infection with different alphaviruses.</title>
  <p>Groups of C57BL/6N (A-B, 7–14 mice per group) or Balb/c (C, 5 mice per group) were fed a 45% fat (Obese), 5% protein (LP), or a control (Lean) diet for 8–10 weeks. Mice were then infected with Mayaro virus (MAYV, A), chikungunya virus (CHIKV, B), or Ross River virus (RRV, C). Weights were measured daily following infection. Weights are plotted in grams. The error bars represent standard error. Each graph represents data obtained from at least two independent experiments except for C, which was performed once. The results from one representative experiment are presented.</p>
