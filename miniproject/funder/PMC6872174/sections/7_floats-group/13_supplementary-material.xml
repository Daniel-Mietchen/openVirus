  <title>Organ titers of mice fed different diets.</title>
  <p>Groups of C57BL/6N mice (9–10 mice per group) were fed either a 45% fat (Obese), 5% protein (LP), or control (Lean) diet for 8–10 weeks. Mice were then infected with Mayaro virus (MAYV) and 2-days post-infection the liver (A) and spleen (B) were collected. Viral titer was measured in the tissue homogenates by plaque assay. The whiskers represent the minimum and maximum points, the box limits represent the 25
   <sup>th</sup> and 75
   <sup>th</sup> percentile, and the horizontal line represents the median. Statistical analyses were performed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction compared to the control group. No statistically significant differences were found.
