  <title>Virus isolated from obese mice reduced early 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> fitness.
  </title>
  <p>Relative fitness of Mayaro virus (MAYV) isolated from mice fed different diets was tested by measuring an indirect measurement, genome to PFU ratio (GE:PFU), and an 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> direct competition assay. Groups of C57BL/6N mice (5 mice per group) were fed either a 45% fat (Obese), 5% protein (LP), or control diet (Lean) for 8–10 weeks. Mice were then infected with Mayaro virus (MAYV) and bled at different time points post-infection. GE:PFU ratios were calculated by dividing the number of RNA genomes present in the serum of mice by the number of PFUs in the same sample (A). Statistical comparisons were performed using a two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction compared to the control group. For direct 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> competition assays, serum containing MAYV collected on two days post-infection of individual mice fed different diets were mixed at a 1:1 ratio with a genetically marked reference virus and then this mixture was used to infect new, lean C57BL/6N mice. For each mouse tested, one new mouse was infected (n = 7). Following infection of mice with the mixtures, serum samples were collected for two consecutive days, the mice were euthanized, and footpads were collected. Fitness was measured using a multiplex qRT-PCR developed in-house to discriminate between the wild-type MAYV sequence and the marked reference virus. Fitness is shown for each group in the footpad (B) and serum for one (C) and two-days (D) post-infection. The whiskers represent the minimum and maximum points, the box limits represent the 25
   <sup>th</sup> and 75
   <sup>th</sup> percentile, and the horizontal line represents the median. Statistical analyses were performed by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction compared to the control group. The level of significance is represented as follows—* p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01.
