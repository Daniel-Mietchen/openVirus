  <title>Nutrition alters viral replication kinetics.</title>
  <p>Groups of C57BL/6N (A-C, 7 mice per group) or Balb/c mice (D, 5 mice per group) were fed either a 45% fat (Obese), 5% protein (LP), or control (Lean) diet for 8–10 weeks. Mice were then infected with either Mayaro virus (MAYV, A-B), chikungunya virus (CHIKV, C), or Ross River virus (RRV, D). At different times post-infection, the virus was quantified either by plaque assay (A, D) or qRT-PCR (B, C). GE = genome equivalents. Statistical analyses were performed by two-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction compared to the control group. The level of significance is represented as follows—* p&lt;0.05, ** p&lt;0.01, *** p&lt;0.001, **** p&lt;0.0001. The whiskers represent the minimum and maximum points, the box limits represent the 25
   <sup>th</sup> and 75
   <sup>th</sup> percentile, and the horizontal line represents the median. Except for D, each graph represents data obtained from at least two independent experiments. The results from one representative experiment are presented.
