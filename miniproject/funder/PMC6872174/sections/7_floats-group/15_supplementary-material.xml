  <title>Wild-type and marked reference virus fitness qRT-PCR is highly specific and sensitive.</title>
  <p>10-fold dilutions of RNA derived from either wild-type (WT) or the marked reference (REF) Mayaro virus (MAYV) infectious clone plasmids were made. RNA was then mixed at a 1:1 ratio between WT MAYV and REF MAYV to simulate a mixed infection. Probe-based qRT-PCR was then performed with either a probe specific for WT MAYV (A) or REF MAYV (B). Forty cycles of PCR were performed. The dotted line represents the limit of detection. Any point that did not produce a Ct value was given an arbitrary Ct value of 41.</p>
