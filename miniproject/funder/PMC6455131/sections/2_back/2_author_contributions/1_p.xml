<p>R.L.O. and F.V.S.A. conceived the study. M.Q.G., J.L.S., R.G.C., R.F.C.S, R.C.L.J., F.V.S.A. were involved in mosquito samplings. C.P. and T.P.S. designed mosquito collection in transects with traps. M.I.L.B. M.A.M., M.S.A.S.N. and I.S.B.A. identified mosquitoes. M.G.C., R.M.M., I.S.B prepared mosquito pools and extracted RNA. R.L.O., F.V.S.A, R.G.C., R.F.C.S, R.C.L.J., A.F, A.P.M.R., E.O.L.F. and M.S.R. organized field collections and defined sampling areas. A.F.B., A.A.C.S., A-B.F., S.M., F.V.S.A., I.P.R. and M.G.C. were involved in virus screening in mosquitoes. M.C.B, M.M.G., A.F.B., I.P.R., A.A.C.S. sequenced and analyzed viral genomes. F.V.S.A, I.P.R. and R.L.O. wrote the manuscript. All authors reviewed the paper.</p>
