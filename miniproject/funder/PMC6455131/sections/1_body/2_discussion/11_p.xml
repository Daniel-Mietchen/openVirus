<p>The 2016â€“2018 sylvatic outbreak was the most severe in the last eight decades. Understanding the causes of this severity needs virological, primatological, ecological, epidemiological and immunological studies [

YFV transmission is a complex and multifactorial phenomenon involving social, ecological and biological issues, among which the entomological component is crucial. Here, by describing the distribution and abundance of potential transmitters and defining the primary vectors throughout the region touched by the outbreak, we could advise proper control measures as well as assemble essential knowledge on this intricate epidemiological event.
