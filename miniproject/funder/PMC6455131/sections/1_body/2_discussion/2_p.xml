<p>Our results were based on extensive mosquito sampling, which covered approximately 1300 km between the northernmost and southernmost surveyed municipalities (Salvador – BA and Paraty – RJ), in the four most affected states, through a combined analysis of mosquito distribution, abundance and YFV natural infections before and during the outbreak. Although there had been no evidence of YFV circulation for nearly 80 years at 28 municipalities where we sampled mosquitoes before the outbreak, traditional YFV vectors were alarmingly detected in most of them (82%), revealing the high local receptivity to sylvatic YFV transmission. Therefore, its establishment in the coastal Atlantic Forest was only a matter of time.</p>
