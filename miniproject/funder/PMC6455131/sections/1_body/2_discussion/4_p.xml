 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> has been found several times infected with YFV in Brazil and other American countries and is considered the primary vector across Brazilian biomes for the last decades, namely the Amazon endemic region, the emergence zones in the transition between Amazonia and 
 <italic>Cerrado</italic>, as well as in the 
 <italic>Cerrado stricto sensu</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]
 <italic>.</italic> It had been also recognized as primary vector in the 1930–1940s epidemics in the Atlantic Forest [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Our current data reinforce the key role of 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> in the 2016–2018 outbreak, that is: density, abundance and distribution increasing during the outbreak (3.0 fold), highest displayed infection rates and favorable behavior, as discussed hereafter. 
 <italic>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</italic>, whose role in sylvatic YFV transmission in the Americas was almost neglected until last decade, is herein considered as primary vector due to its very high distribution and abundance in surveyed municipalities during the outbreak as well as the noteworthy natural infection rates. During the investigation of YFV epidemics in inland southern Brazil, where 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> was not found [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> was considered to play an important role in the transmission, although still regarded as secondary vector. The species was also found naturally infected in São Paulo during the sylvatic YF outbreak in 2009, when 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> and 
 <italic>Sa. chloropterus</italic> were tested negative [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Although, 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> had higher infection rate values than 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> in most surveyed YFV foci as it is usually described in the literature [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the latter occurred in greater abundance and was more distributed across the southeastern YFV transmission territory, which reinforces its importance in the maintenance and dissemination of YFV in this region. In all municipalities where YFV was detected in mosquitoes, 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> or both 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> and 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> (56%) were found infected, except for Ilha Grande where only 
 <italic>Sa. chloropterus</italic> was found carrying the virus. Curiously, natural infections of both species in the same transmission area was described in one RJ site during the 1930s [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. This suggests that the concurrence of the two species in YFV transmission may be typical and recurrent in the coastal Atlantic Forest, distinctly from other YFV endemic or epidemic South American biomes like the Amazon and 
 <italic>Cerrado</italic>.
