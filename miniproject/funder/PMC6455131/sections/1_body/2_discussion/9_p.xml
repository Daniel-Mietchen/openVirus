<p>We did not find any natural infection when analyzing numerous 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> from areas with large numbers of human cases and/or confirmed epizootics (e.g. Ilha Grande, Valença and Juiz de Fora). Brazilian 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> may experimentally transmit YFV of the South American genotype, and it has been shown that YFV has the potential for adaptation to this mosquito with augmentation of virus titers in the saliva following successive contacts [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49–51</xref>]. Additionally, this species was the most disseminated in the municipalities sampled during the outbreak in the southeast, the Brazilian region most infested by this mosquito [
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Several authors warn that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> may act as bridge vector and would represent a threat of YFV reurbanization or facilitating enzootic spillovers with establishment of YFV into an intermediate/rural cycle due to its ecological plasticity and ubiquitous environmental distribution [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. An important overlap of expanded niches of the sylvatic primary vectors, 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> and 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus,</italic> and the anthropic ones, like 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus,</italic> in the Atlantic Forest biome has been observed in the last decades [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, it is advised to urgently design and apply surveillance and control measures concerning this mosquito in areas with transmissions and at risk.
