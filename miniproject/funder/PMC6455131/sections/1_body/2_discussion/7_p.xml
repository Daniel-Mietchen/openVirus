<p>In contrast to the above-mentioned 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> mosquitoes
 <italic>, Aedes scapularis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> are opportunistic mosquitoes, whose biting peak occurs primarily in twilight at ground level of fragmented forest, the forest edge and open fields [
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, the opportunities of these 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes to bite NHPs in the forest canopy are limited. 
 <italic>Aedes scapularis</italic> is experimentally competent to transmit YFV [
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and occasionally becomes infected in nature [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Nevertheless, its role in the current outbreak, even as a secondary vector, seems to be little relevant as we found only one positive pool despite this speciesâ€™ great abundance and distribution across YFV foci, both in the lowlands and mountain slopes. We believe our report of YFV natural infection in 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> is novel. However, as we examined whole bodies of non-blood-fed mosquitoes, we cannot ensure whether YFV replication would be only limited to the midgut or already present in the salivary glands of the infected specimens. While YFV outbreak affected sites of various reliefs including mostly mountain valleys and slopes, the distribution of 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> is limited to the coastal lowlands. Its competence to experimentally transmit YFV is controversial to null [
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our detections of natural infections in these 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species occurred exclusively in a forest fragment undergoing a sylvatic transmission of great force illustrated by records of very recently confirmed epizootics in howler-monkeys and human fatal cases nearby and where we collected 40 positive pools of 
 <italic>Hg. janhtinomys</italic> and 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> in one week
 <italic>.</italic> So, it is likely that 
 <italic>Ae. scapularis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> only become infected in environments and moments when the availability of viremic hosts infected by the bite of 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> mosquitoes is very high. Thus, natural infections in these mosquitoes, especially in 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus,</italic> should be considered with caution as they do not assure this species playing any important role in the spread of YFV.
