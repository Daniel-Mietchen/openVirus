<p>Altogether, results obtained during the outbreak indicate 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> and 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> as the main sylvatic YFV vectors in the region. The genome sequencing of viral RNA detected in these mosquitoes (e.g. GenBank accession numbers MF423373 and MF423374) confirmed the occurrence of a unique molecular signature of fixed amino acid mutations in highly conserved positions at NS3 and NS5 proteins in YFV causing the current Brazilian outbreak [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Other taxa found naturally infected, such as 
 <italic>Sa. chloropterus</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. scapularis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> appear to have a local or secondary role and, therefore, low epidemiological importance either because of reduced abundance and distribution (
 <italic>Sa. chloropterus</italic>), or as for the low infection rates (
 <italic>Ae. scapularis</italic>) combined with distribution limited to coastal lowlands (
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic>). Noteworthy, natural infections were detected only in mosquitoes captured between 3 and 24 days after glimpsing the first signal of YFV circulation (mostly epizootics) in the respective area, and no vertical transmission in mosquitoes was detected. A total of 5,703 mosquitoes belonging to 84 other species tested negative and showed no obvious role in YFV transmission in this outbreak.
