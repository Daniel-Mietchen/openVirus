<p>This is the first time that 
 <italic>Sa. chloropterus</italic> is found infected with YFV in the Atlantic Forest biome. The infected 
 <italic>Sa. chloropterus</italic> was recovered when the outbreak reached a large island around 2â€…km apart from the continent (Ilha Grande, in Angra dos Reis) where we did not find any 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys,</italic> both before and during the outbreak. At the time of mosquito collection, we found 10 carcasses and 5 dying howler-monkeys on the inspected trails. Interestingly we had found 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> in collections made before the outbreak. 
 <italic>Sabethes chloropterus</italic> showed low abundance and was limited in distribution throughout the sampled area and time, a characteristic previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Its canopy-feeding behavior and essentially sylvatic distribution may facilitate the contact with infected NHPs. But, our findings suggest a secondary role of 
 <italic>Sa. chloropterus</italic> as YFV vector in this region of the country.
