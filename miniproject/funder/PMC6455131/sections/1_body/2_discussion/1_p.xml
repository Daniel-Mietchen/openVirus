<p>At the beginning of 2017, YFV reached Brazilian coastal states both in the southeast and northeast (BA), Atlantic Forest regions considered YFV-free and without vaccine recommendation for decades [

 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], causing a major sylvatic outbreak and devastating epizootics among NHPs in 2017â€“2018. During almost 80 years without YFV circulation, the southeast region under influence of the Atlantic Forest underwent significant environmental changes and a remarkable 368% increase in human population density that potentially influenced mosquito fauna distribution, diversity and abundance [
