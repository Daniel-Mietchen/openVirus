<p>Urban YF has not been recorded in Brazil since 1942. However, there is a great concern about urban YFV reemergence due to high infestation indices of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in periurban and urban areas very close to the sylvatic cycles in the low vaccination coverage municipalities, such as those affected by the outbreak in southeastern Brazil [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. All 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> specimens we captured during the outbreak, including those sampled around houses inhabited by viremic humans infected in the sylvatic cycle, tested negative for YFV. However, the low vaccination coverage, the presence of 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> in several urban parks, the proximity of NHPs in several cities with the arrival of YFV-viremic humans seeking medical care in urban centers infested with 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> are among the factors that may increase the risks of YFV reurbanization in the south and southeast, the most populated region of the country [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Most surveyed municipalities in southeastern Brazil have frequently endured urban epidemics of other 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti-</italic>transmitted viruses, including dengue, chikungunya and Zika. It fact, YFV circulated intensely in 2017â€“2018 where 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> is very active. Together, these facts indicate that reducing 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations and vaccinating urban populations near sylvatic outbreaks is more critical than ever.
