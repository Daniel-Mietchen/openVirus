<p>Despite our large sample effort, species considered as potential vectors and found naturally infected with YFV in other areas (e.g. 
 <italic>Ae. serratus</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], 
 <italic>Sa. albiprivus</italic> and 
 <italic>Psorophora</italic> species [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45â€“48</xref>]) were negative in the present study, even when captured in large quantities and in sympatry with the infected 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic>. 
 <italic>Sa. albiprivus</italic> was the most abundant and well distributed species of 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic>, both in arid areas of 
 <italic>Cerrado</italic>, in dense Atlantic Forest as well as in transition between these biomes, and has proved to be competent to experimentally transmit YFV [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, 
 <italic>Sa. albiprivus</italic> may play a very secondary role on YFV maintenance, even if not detected in the present study.
