<p>Species of 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> exhibit primatophilic habits [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], which facilitates their contact with YFV infected NHPs and virus transmission to both human and NHPs. Collectively, their competence to amplify, disseminate and transmit the virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28–30</xref>] as well as the high abundance, distribution, primatophilic behavior, arboreal feeding habits and large flight range may have contributed to the magnitude, severity and rapidity of spread of the 2016–2018 outbreak in this region [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. 
 <italic>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</italic> seems to exhibit greater plasticity of habitats and blood feeding patterns than 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. 
 <italic>Haemagogus leucocelaenus</italic> may colonize secondary and modified forest patches, while 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> would be more stringent in terms of climatic and environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> bites much more frequently at the canopy level, 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> usually attacks on lower forest strata, although both mosquitoes may disperse vertically in the forest [
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Indeed, we captured an impressive number of 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> (4th most abundant species during the outbreak) at the ground level in the forest, as well as in the forest fringe and in open fields. The lower mean tree canopy height and vegetation density in most surveyed municipalities may sustain less amount and diversity of vertebrate hosts, which may have forced 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> to explore the ground level and the open fields. In addition, the topography of forest fragments in most YFV affected municipalities in the southeast may further influence this behavior, as previously suggested to occur with the canopy feeder mosquito 
 <italic>Anopheles cruzii</italic> in the region [
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The combination of behavioral and biological characteristics of these two 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> species may also help to understand the estimates of virus spread of 3.5–5 km/day in this Brazilian outbreak [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In fact, 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> and 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> have high dispersion capacity between forest fragments, and may bite distant from the woods and even indoors [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. It is important to mention that we found infected 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> in forest fragments as small as 7 hectares, some of which are contiguous to urban neighborhoods and remote urbanized high income borough settled in recently cut forest valleys. The growth of cities and the search for a more bucolic life have put people closer to fragments of forest increasing the exposure of people to the sylvatic mosquito bites in this region [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, taking into account the estimated flight range of these main vectors [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], vaccination campaigns in affected municipalities must consider not only people visiting or living in the close vicinity of forest, but also those who live or circulate at distances as large as 12 km from early detected epizooty.
