<p>Since the 1930s, two main YFV transmission cycles have been described: the sylvatic, in which the virus is transmitted by arboreal mosquitoes between non-human primates (NHP) in the forest and where humans can be incidentally infected [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6–8</xref>] and the urban, maintained between 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and humans [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. An intermediate/rural cycle has been so far described only in Africa [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. While the transmitters in the sylvatic and intermediate cycles in Africa are 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes of the subgenera 
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic> and 
 <italic>Diceromyia</italic>, this role is played by species of genus 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> and 
 <italic>Sabethes</italic> in the New World
 <italic>,</italic> considered the primary and secondary sylvatic vectors respectively [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. If the elimination of the urban cycle is feasible as it has occurred very rarely in the Americas since 1942, the enzootic sylvatic one is considered ineradicable [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The sylvatic cycle consists of a permanent threat both for its spillover to an urban cycle in the nearby of highly 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> infested locals as well as for the emergency of epidemics where vaccination coverage in risk areas is inadequate [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This was the case of the severe outbreak recorded in southeastern Brazil in 2016–2018 [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].
