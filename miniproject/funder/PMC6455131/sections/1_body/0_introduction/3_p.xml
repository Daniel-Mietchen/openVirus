<p>Intriguingly, no record of YFV circulation had been detected since the 1930s in the Atlantic Forest zone in Brazil, the biome where sylvatic transmission was first discovered [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hence, in contrast with the perennial transmission focus represented by the endemic/enzootic Amazon region and epizootic/YFV emerging areas in the 
 <italic>Cerrado</italic> biome, the Brazilian health authorities have excluded this east-coastal zone from the YFV national vaccination program for decades [
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Between the mid-twentieth century and 1999, YFV expansion and retraction waves originated in the Amazon have spread southward across the 
 <italic>Cerrado</italic>, but extra-Amazon epizootics and epidemics were essentially limited to the Central-West region. However, from 2000 on, YFV expansion waves have reached the pampa biome in the southernmost Brazilian state and progressively spread eastward across the 
 <italic>Cerrado</italic>. In late 2016, it spilled over from the 
 <italic>Cerrado</italic> into transition zone between this biome and the Atlantic Forest in Minas Gerais state (MG) and rapidly spread across this last biome in the southeast. This region records the highest population densities in the country, but vaccination coverage against YFV was almost null at that moment. Then, the country’s largest outbreak of sylvatic YF erupted, and rapidly spread in the southeast states of MG, Espírito Santo (ES), Rio de Janeiro (RJ) and São Paulo (SP) [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In less than two years, it has caused 2,058 confirmed human cases and 689 deaths, rates not observed since the first half of the twentieth century. It also caused a huge impact on NHP biodiversity as consequence of thousands of epizootic events [
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The outbreak spread more than 900 km at an estimated speed of around 3 km a day [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The movement of paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic viremic humans and displacement of infected mosquitoes has been suggested as the main factors inducing this rapid spatial spread [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, defining the main vectors involved in the sylvatic transmission is critical in understanding the main ecological risk factors driving this unprecedented outbreak and guiding public health measures.
