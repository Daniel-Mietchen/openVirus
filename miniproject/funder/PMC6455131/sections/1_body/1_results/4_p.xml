 <italic>Collections during the yellow fever outbreak:</italic> In this epidemiological context, 10,057 mosquitoes were collected in 21 municipalities, five of which (20%) had also been sampled before YFV transmission. Remarkably, the density and abundance of 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> tripled in relation to the pre-epidemic period, while that of 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> continued to be high (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, S1 ad S2). These 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> species were detected in 57% and 71% of municipalities with local active YFV transmission, respectively. Intriguingly, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was the most widespread (present in 95% of municipalities) and the fifth most abundant species (relative abundance = 4.75%) during the outbreak (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and S1). Although 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> was the most abundant species in the total collections made during the outbreak (24.1%), its distribution was restricted to five coastal lowland municipalities under influence of the Atlantic Forest biome. 
 <italic>Sabethes albiprivus</italic> was the most widespread and abundant species of the genus, while 
 <italic>Sa. petrocchiae</italic> although abundant, was collected in only one affected municipality (Simonésia – MG) located in the transition between the Atlantic Forest and 
 <italic>Cerrado</italic> biomes (
