 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> and/or 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> were the species found infected in all localities where positive mosquitoes were detected, except in Angra dos Reis – Ilha Grande, RJ, where 
 <italic>Sa. chloropterus</italic> was the only positive species although 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> was present (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>). 
 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic> displayed higher infection rates (MIR and MLE) than 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> in most localities (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic>Aedes scapularis</italic> (MIR = 2.1, MLE = 2.1) and 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> (MIR = 0.6, MLE = 0.6) were found infected only once, coincidently in the same municipality (Maricá, RJ), where 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus</italic> (MIR = 81.9, MLE = 101.6) and 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic> (MIR = 142.8, MLE = 153.5) were also detected naturally infected (
