 <italic>Virus detection:</italic> RNA of 2,738 pools, containing 10,537 adult mosquitoes from 85 species, was extracted and tested for YFV. Virus genome was detected in 64 pools (2.3%) containing 323 mosquitoes belonging to five species: 
 <italic>Hg. janthinomys</italic>, 
 <italic>Hg. leucocelaenus, Sa. chloropterus, Ae. scapularis</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. taeniorhynchus</italic> (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Tables 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Positive mosquitoes were detected in 42.8% of surveyed municipalities (9/21) in three Brazilian states: 6 out of 17 from RJ (59 positive pools), two out of five from MG (3 positive pools) and one out of four from ES (2 positive pools) (
 <xref rid="T0002" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref> and S3). Positive pools were found in mosquitoes captured in 2017 and 2018. No positive mosquito was found prior the detection of signals of YFV circulation in the respective municipalities. Also, YFV was not found in any pool of mosquitoes caught in Salvador (BA) where YFV epizootics were confirmed just prior collection (
