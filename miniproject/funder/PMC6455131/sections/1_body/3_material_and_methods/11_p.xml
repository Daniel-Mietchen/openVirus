<p>Standardization of RT-qPCR assays was done from serial dilutions (10
 <sup>−1</sup> to 10
 <sup>−10</sup>) of one confirmed wild mosquito positive sample, mixed or not with homogenates of negative 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> from our laboratory colony. The sensitivity of the test was compared in triplicate with that of conventional RT-PCR. Conventional RT-PCR and RT-qPCR detected the virus genome until 10
 <sup>−7</sup> and 10
 <sup>−9</sup> dilution, respectively.
