 <italic>Study chronology</italic>: Mosquitoes collections were performed in 44 municipalities in two distinct epidemiological situations: before and during the YFV outbreak. From May/2015 to June/2017, 12–15 days mosquito samplings were carried out in 28 municipalities before any local identification of YFV transmission, in order to evaluate receptivity for YF reemergence and early detect this arbovirus circulation. From Jan/2017 to May/2018, 1–8 days mosquito collections were conducted in 21 municipalities with suspected or confirmed YFV foci, i.e. where human cases or epizootic events had just been locally recorded. Among these 21 municipalities, 16 were surveyed for the first time and 5 had already been sampled before the outbreak (
