<p>Ovitraps baited with an infusion of dry leaves found on forest ground and three wooden paddles each were settled for 7–12 days at the canopy of 15–30 trees per area. Paddles found with eggs were immerged in dechlorinated water for egg hatching, and larvae were reared until adult stage in the laboratory. Larvae were also sampled from all detected natural larval habitats (e.g. bromeliads, trees-holes, bamboo internodes) and reared until adult.</p>
