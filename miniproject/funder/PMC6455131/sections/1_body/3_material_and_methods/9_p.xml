 <italic>Virus detection</italic>: After centrifugation (9600 
 <italic>g</italic>, 10  min, 4°C), RNA was extracted from 140 µL of supernatant using the Qiagen RNA Viral Kit following the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA from mosquitoes obtained in the first half 2017 were screened by conventional RT-PCR while the remaining samples were examined by RT-qPCR. Details for RT-PCR protocol were previously described [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, the set of primers utilized in the conventional PCR were 5′-CTGTGTGCTAATTGAGGTGCATTG-3′ and 5′-ATGTCATCAGGCTCTTCTCT-3′, targeting nucleotides 9 to 663, between 5′ and PrM regions of the YFV genome. Infections were diagnosed by the specific detection of this single amplicon with the likely YFV amplicon size of 650 bp. Obtained amplicons were purified using Qiagen QIAquik PCR purification kit following the manufacturer’s recommendation. For confirmation, the amplicons were directly sequenced without molecular cloning. Nucleotide sequencing reactions were performed using the ABI BigDye terminator V3.1 Ready Reaction Cycle Sequencing Mixture (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Nucleotide sequence was determined by capillary electrophoresis at the sequencing facility of Fiocruz-RJ (RPT01A – Sequenciamento de DNA – RJ). Raw sequence data were aligned and edited using the SeqMan module of LaserGene (DNASTAR Inc.). Edited nucleic acid sequences were compared to other YFV strains available at the Gen-Bank database using The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (url:
