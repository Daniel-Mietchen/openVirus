<p>In the laboratory, field and laboratory emerged adult mosquitoes were identified under a stereomicroscopy on a cold table [
 <xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Voucher specimens were deposited at the CCuli Collection, at IOC (url:

 <italic>Haemagogus janthinomys</italic>, a common species widely distributed across South America, and 
 <italic>Haemagogus capricornii</italic> are sympatric in southeast Brazil. Their adult females and immature forms are morphologically indistinguishable, the few distinctive characters are in male genitalia [
 <xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. When available, male genitalia of 
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> collected in all municipalities were examined. However, males with the phenotype corresponding to 
 <italic>Hg. capricornii</italic> were found only in Valen√ßa (RJ). Therefore, we used the name 
 <italic>janthinomys</italic> to refer to specimens potentially belonging to either taxa.
