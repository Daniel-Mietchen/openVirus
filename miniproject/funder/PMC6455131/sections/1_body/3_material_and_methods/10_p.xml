<p>For RT-qPCR, viral RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified using the TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Instrument. For each reaction we used 300 nM forward primer (5′-GCTAATTGAGGTGCATTGGTCTGC-3′, genome position 15–38), 600 nM reverse primer (5′-CTGCTAATCGCTCAACGAACG-3′, genome position 83–103) and 250 nM probe (5′FAM-ATCGAGTTGCTAGGCAATAAACAC-3′TAMRA, genome position 41–64). Samples were run in duplicate, with deionized water serving as negative control for extraction and PCR reactions. The reverse transcription was performed at 50°C for 5  min. The qPCR conditions were 95°C for 20 s, followed by 40 amplification cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1  min. Copy numbers of YF genomic RNA were calculated by absolute quantitation using a standard curve for each run. To construct the standard curve, an amplicon was cloned comprising the genomic region 1 to 865 of the isolate ES-504 (GeneBank accession number: KY885000) using pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega) to serve as a template for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription. The RNA was transcript with mMessage mMachine High Yield Capped RNA Transcription Kit (Invitrogen) using SP6 enzyme and purified using MEGAclear Kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The purity of the transcript was verified using NanoDrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and the concentration of the RNA was determined using Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen). The standard curve was generated by serial ten-fold dilution (ranging from 10 to 10
 <sup>9</sup> copies/reaction) of the transcript. The limit of detection under standard assay conditions was approximately 40 viral RNA copies/mL. Confirmation of YFV diagnose was done by amplifying and sequencing the 650 bp amplicon as described above.
