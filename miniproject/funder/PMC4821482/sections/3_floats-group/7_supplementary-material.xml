  <title>Evolution of error in estimates of the probability of a major outbreak as the outbreak persists.</title>
  <p>A. Error in estimates of the probability of a major outbreak as a function of the age of the outbreak (
   <italic>x</italic> deaths). Inset: Probability of an individual outbreak persisting until at least 
   <italic>x</italic> deaths. B. Average number of 
   <italic>E</italic> and 
   <italic>I</italic> after 
   <italic>x</italic> deaths in simulated outbreaks in which at least 
   <italic>x</italic> deaths occur. Each boxplot in A and bar in B is obtained from 100,000 simulations of the stochastic SEIR model in which at least 
   <italic>x</italic> deaths occur. Each bar in the inset to A is obtained from 100,000 simulations of the stochastic SEIR model.
