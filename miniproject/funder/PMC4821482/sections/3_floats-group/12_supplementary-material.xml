  <title>Estimating the probability of a major outbreak with gamma distributed incubation and infectious periods.</title>
  <p>The incubation and infectious periods are both split into three classes, each with exponentially distributed waiting times. Since the true probability of a major outbreak is no longer restricted to discrete values, we classify the true probabilities into bins. The bins are of size 0.1 for true probabilities greater than 0.3. Since lower true probabilities occur infrequently, for computational efficiency we then consider true probabilities equal to 0, and true probabilities greater than zero but less than 0.3, in their own bins.</p>
