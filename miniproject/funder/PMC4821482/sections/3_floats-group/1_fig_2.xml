  <title>Uncertainty in the probability of a major outbreak when presymptomatic infection cannot be detected.</title>
  <p>A. Given the true probability of a major outbreak, what point estimate for the estimated probability of a major outbreak might be obtained? (100,000 simulated datasets using the SEIR model for each true probability). For clarity, true probabilities greater than 0.97 are classified into bins of size 0.01. B. How does the true probability of a major outbreak vary between outbreaks with the same point estimate for the probability of a major outbreak? Estimated probabilities are classified into bins of size 0.1 (100,000 simulated datasets per bin). Circle areas are proportional to the number of outbreaks at each true probability, normalized for each bin of estimated probabilities of a major outbreak, so that the sum of the areas of the circles along each horizontal line is constant.</p>
