  <title>Using a single simulated dataset to compare the exact probability distribution for the current epidemic size given idealized data, as used in our paper, with approximations of this distribution obtained using back-calculation (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004836.s014">S4 Text</xref>).

  <p>A. The dataset used for estimating 
   <italic>E</italic> (the true value of 
   <italic>E</italic> at the time of estimation is 2). B. Estimation of 
   <italic>E</italic> using simple back-calculation. As can be seen, simple back-calculation does not discriminate well between different small values of 
   <italic>E</italic>, which is important in estimating the probability of a major outbreak when the first few symptomatic cases occur. C. Estimation of 
   <italic>E</italic> using extended back-calculation (with the full 
   <italic>I(t)</italic> curve observed, and population size and transmission parameters known). Extended back-calculation captures the exact distribution used in our manuscript.
