  <title>Error in estimating the probability of a major outbreak using the SEIR model when asymptomatic individuals are tested for infection.</title>
  <p>A. The mean error in the probability of a major outbreak, as a function of the percentage of asymptomatic individuals tested and the probability that presymptomatic infection is correctly identified (calculated from 10,000 simulations for each (percentage,

   </sub>) pair). B. Variation in estimates of the probability of a major outbreak when 95% of asymptomatic individuals are tested and the test is perfectly reliable. C. Variation in estimates of the probability of a major outbreak when 50% of asymptomatic individuals are tested and presymptomatic infection is correctly identified 50% of the time.
