  <title>Estimating the probability of a major outbreak when the total number of infected individuals is known (i.e. the number of presymptomatic infecteds is known exactly).</title>
  <p>When the total number of infected individuals is known, the probability of a major outbreak can be estimated accurately. The boxplots reduce to a horizontal line for each true probability of a major outbreak. Data obtained from 100,000 simulated SEIR model datasets for each true probability of a major outbreak; this is the case for all Supporting Information figures containing box plots.</p>
