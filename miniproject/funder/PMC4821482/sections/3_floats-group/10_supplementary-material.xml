  <title>Error in the probability of a major outbreak when the infection rate is estimated.</title>
  <p>If the probability of a major outbreak is estimated with 
   <italic>β</italic> unknown but the number of presymptomatic infected individuals at the time of estimation known, then there can be less error than due to presymptomatic infection alone. Here, 
   <italic>β</italic> is estimated via maximum likelihood estimation, and constrained to within 
   <italic>x</italic>% of the true value (representing prior knowledge about the value of 
   <italic>β</italic>). Constructed from 10,000 outbreaks simulated until four deaths have occurred using the SEIR model.
