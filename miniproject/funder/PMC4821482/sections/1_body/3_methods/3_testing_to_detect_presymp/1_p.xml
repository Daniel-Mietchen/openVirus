<p>To illustrate the principle that diagnostic tests can improve forecasts, the sampling of asymptomatic individuals and testing to find presymptomatic infection is modeled by choosing individuals at random out of the 
 <italic>S</italic> or 
 <italic>E</italic> classes without replacement. If the individual is susceptible, then infection is not detected (i.e. the test produces no false positives), whereas if the individual is presymptomatic infected, the pathogen is detected with probability 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>

 </sub>. The results of the sample can then be integrated into the estimate of the probability distribution of the number of presymptomatic infected individuals, which therefore becomes more precise (
