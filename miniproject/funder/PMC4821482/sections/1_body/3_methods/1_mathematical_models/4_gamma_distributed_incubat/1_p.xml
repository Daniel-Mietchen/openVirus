<p>We consider a model that uses the so-called “method of stages” [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref077" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>] to replace exponential distributions for the incubation and infectious periods with gamma distributions, by replacing the 
 <italic>E</italic> and 
 <italic>I</italic> classes in the SEIR model with three 
 <italic>E</italic> and 
 <italic>I</italic> classes (each with period one third of the respective original class). Gamma distributions are more realistic for a number of infectious diseases [
