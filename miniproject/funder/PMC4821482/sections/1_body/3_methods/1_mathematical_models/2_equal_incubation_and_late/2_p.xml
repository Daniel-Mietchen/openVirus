<p>Here, 
 <italic>S</italic> is the number of individuals susceptible to the pathogen, 
 <italic>E</italic> the number latently and presymptomatically infected, 
 <italic>I</italic> the number of symptomatic infectious individuals, and 
 <italic>R</italic> the number of dead or recovered individuals. We conduct our analysis starting from one initial presymptomatic infected (with the rest of the population of size 1,000 susceptible), using the analogous stochastic model, and generate simulations using the Gillespie direct method [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The model is parameterized for Ebola [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]: 
 <italic>β</italic> = 3.83 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> days
 <sup>−1</sup>, 1/
 <italic>γ</italic> = 3.35 days and 1/
 <italic>μ</italic> = 3.5 days (so that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> ≈ 1.34). However, we also test the robustness of our results to these choices. The World Health Organization states that the incubation period is usually between 2 and 21 days [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. The mean value from the fitted model we have used is at the lower end of this interval and therefore provides a particularly stringent test of the possible effects of presymptomatic infection on forecasting major outbreaks of disease.
