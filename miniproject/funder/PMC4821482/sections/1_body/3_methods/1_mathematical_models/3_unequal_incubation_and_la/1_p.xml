<p>The SEIR model assumes that the incubation and latent periods coincide exactly, so that individuals in the 
 <italic>I</italic> class are both infectious and symptomatic. For Ebola, there is debate as to whether the onset of symptoms and infectiousness coincide [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] or not [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]; however models usually assume that they do [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. This assumption is certainly untrue for numerous other diseases [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. We therefore also consider models in which the incubation and latent periods are unequal, thereby allowing for asymptomatic infectious or symptomatic uninfectious individuals. To examine the case where symptoms appear before infectiousness, we use the stochastic SEUIR model, in which individuals in the 
 <italic>U</italic> (i.e. Uninfectious symptomatic) class are symptomatic but not yet infectious. To illustrate the effects of this extra compartment, we make the representative choice that the average time spent in the 
 <italic>E</italic> class in the SEIR model case is now split between 1/
 <italic>γ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>1</italic>
 </sub> = 2.35 days in the 
 <italic>E</italic> class and 1/
 <italic>γ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sub> = 1 day in the 
 <italic>U</italic> class. To consider potential effects of individuals becoming infectious before symptoms appear, we use the stochastic SEAIR model, in which individuals in the 
 <italic>A</italic> (i.e. Asymptomatic infectious) class are asymptomatic but infectious. In this case, we assume that the average time spent in the equivalent of the 
 <italic>I</italic> class in the SEIR model is now split between 1/
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>1</italic>
 </sub> = 1 day in the 
 <italic>A</italic> class and 1/
 <italic>μ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sub> = 2.5 days in the 
 <italic>I</italic> class.
