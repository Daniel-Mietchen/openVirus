<p>We perform our analyses using stochastic compartmental models of disease spreading in a small population. Here we outline the three types of model we use: the standard SEIR model, which assumes that symptoms and infectiousness coincide; more complex models that relax this assumption; and a model that assumes that the incubation and infectious periods follow gamma, rather than exponential, distributions.</p>
