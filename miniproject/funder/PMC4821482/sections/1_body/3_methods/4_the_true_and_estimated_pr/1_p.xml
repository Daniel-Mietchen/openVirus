<p>We estimate two probabilities using data from individual simulated epidemics at the time of the fourth death: the true probability of a major outbreak, and the best point estimate of this probability consistent with the transmission data. Specifically, we calculate the true probability of an outbreak by “freezing” the infection status of all individuals at the time of four deaths, simulating a very large number of outbreaks (100,000) using these data as initial conditions, and finding the proportion of simulations in which a major outbreak occurs (defined as more than 10% of the population ever becoming infected,
