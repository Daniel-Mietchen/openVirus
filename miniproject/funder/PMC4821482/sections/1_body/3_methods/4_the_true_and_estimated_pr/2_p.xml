<p>To calculate the estimated probability of a major outbreak, we instead imagine that the exact infection statuses of individuals that are asymptomatic (i.e. susceptible individuals and presymptomatic infected individuals) are unknown, as would be the case in practice. We use the data on symptomatic cases up to the time of the fourth death to infer the probability distribution of the number of presymptomatic infecteds. We then calculate the estimated probability of a major outbreak by running an ensemble of simulations that sample initial conditions from this distribution on each forward run.</p>
