<p>Since our concern is quantifying uncertainty caused by presymptomatic infection alone, we assume that the parameters controlling disease transmission are known, and that complete data are available from the very beginning of the epidemic for changes in the number of symptomatic infected individuals over time. These data can be used to construct the probability distribution for the number of presymptomatic infected individuals at the time of estimation (

For the SEIR model, the data on symptomatic cases are used to estimate the probability that an asymptomatic individual is infected, which feeds into a binomial distribution to estimate the number of presymptomatic infected individuals. The approach can readily be adapted for the SEUIR and gamma-distributed incubation and infectious periods cases. In the SEAIR model case, the 
 <italic>A</italic> class causes the complete time series of infectious individuals to be unobserved, so that the required probability cannot be calculated. Instead reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (
