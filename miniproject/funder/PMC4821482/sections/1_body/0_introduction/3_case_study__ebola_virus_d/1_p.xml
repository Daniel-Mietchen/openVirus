<p>As an example of a disease for which initial cases are frequently not followed by major outbreaks, and with a significant delay between infection and emergence of symptoms, we consider Ebola virus disease. All five strains of the genus 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> cause severe acute illness, with early non-specific symptoms including asthenia and myalgia typically followed by nausea, vomiting, hemorrhagic symptoms and, in a significant proportion of cases, death [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], hypothesized to be initiated by spillover from reservoirs of infection in wild animal populations, with fruit bats most often implicated as the reservoir host [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Often there is no sustained human-to-human transmission, and initial cases do not lead to large outbreaks. However, since 1976 there have been twenty-five distinct reports of primary infection in humans, of which sixteen have led to epidemics causing more than twenty deaths. The largest ever Ebola outbreak started in Guinea in December 2013 and subsequently spread to and caused widespread transmission in Liberia and Sierra Leone, with additional cases in Nigeria, Mali, Senegal, Spain, USA, UK and Italy. This epidemic caused more than 11,000 fatalities before it was declared officially over by the World Health Organization on 14
 <sup>th</sup> January 2016, although an additional death was confirmed the following day and additional small flare-ups are still possible [
