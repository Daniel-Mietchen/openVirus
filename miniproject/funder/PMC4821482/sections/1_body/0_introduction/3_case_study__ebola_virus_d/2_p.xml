<p>Modeling studies of Ebola have tended to focus on parameter estimation [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Here, we instead focus on using an existing epidemiological model fitted to data from the outbreak in Uganda that killed 224 people in 2000 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] to show how presymptomatic infection affects our ability to predict whether or not reports of initial cases will go on to cause a major outbreak. Ebola is therefore a motivating example for our investigation into how presymptomatic infection affects the predictability of infectious disease epidemics. However, since presymptomatic infection is ubiquitous, our conclusions are applicable to a wide range of pathogens.
