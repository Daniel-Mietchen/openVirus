<p>A principal challenge in infectious disease epidemiology is quantifying the threat posed by disease early in emerging outbreaks [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. During the earliest stages of infectious disease outbreaks, two main questions are i) will a major epidemic occur, and ii) what will the final size of the outbreak be [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]? Answering the second of these questions is impossible without understanding the answer to the first. We therefore focus on predicting whether or not reports of initial cases will be followed by a major outbreak of disease, in which a large number of individuals become infected [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Accurate real-time forecasts at the start of emerging outbreaks are essential for efficient deployment of limited resources for control [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, the dynamics of infectious disease outbreaks are influenced by the incubation period, within which hosts are infected but do not yet show symptoms [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We use mathematical modeling to investigate how the consequent ambiguity in the number of hosts that are currently infected confounds prediction in the earliest stages of a potential major outbreak.
