<p>In practice, however, the distribution of possible current outbreak sizes would have to be estimated from incomplete data on symptomatic cases and deaths, without exact knowledge of parameter values and sometimes without even knowing the total population size precisely. One method for doing this is back-calculation, as originally designed by Brookmeyer and Gail for HIV-AIDS [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which provides an estimate for the distribution of possible current outbreak sizes. Although, to the best of our knowledge, back-calculation has not been used to estimate the probability of a major outbreak, such a forecast using back-calculation as an input would necessarily be less precise than those used in our analyses here, since we have used the exact distribution of current outbreak sizes given presymptomatic infection. Indeed, by restricting our attention to the case in which there are sufficient data that the number of presymptomatic individuals is the only quantity being estimated, our results provide an upper bound on the ability of any method that seeks to predict major outbreaks from data on symptomatic cases alone. In fact, given the extensive knowledge of the epidemic assumed here, the basic formulation of back-calculation can be extended in a natural fashion to obtain the exact probability distribution of the current size of the outbreak that we use to generate our estimates for the probability of a major outbreak (
