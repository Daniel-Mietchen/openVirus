<p>Prediction during the recent Ebola outbreak has been criticized for overestimating the total number of cases that actually occurred [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Similarly, modeling studies during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak typically overestimated the total number of cases [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In contrast with investigations that attempt to predict the final epidemic size, we differentiated only between “minor” and “major” outbreaks. Our focus was prediction during the very early stages of an outbreak, before a major outbreak is underway, rather than forecasting the final extent of a major outbreak once the epidemic has taken off. This very initial phase of outbreaks is particularly important given the recent interest in rapid detection of disease outbreaks [
