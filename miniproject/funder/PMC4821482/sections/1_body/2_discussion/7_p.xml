<p>Our conclusions are robust to various characteristics of the disease, and so apply to all infectious diseases. We chose to use Ebola as a representative case study, but our results are in fact generic. In particular, our key message that presymptomatic infection drives uncertainty in whether an emerging outbreak will become major holds throughout the early stages of the outbreak (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004836.s003">S3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004836.s004">S4</xref> Figs), as well for a number of values of the basic reproduction number of the pathogen (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004836.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). For Ebola, there is debate as to whether the onset of symptoms and infectiousness coincide [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] or not [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. However, symptoms and infectiousness are certainly not always concurrent: HIV is a high profile example, for which the time between infection and recognizable symptoms can take years [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], whereas individuals are infectious within months of acquiring the virus [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. We have considered different models in which symptoms and infectiousness are not assumed to coincide (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004836.g004">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004836.s008">S8</xref>). While we showed prediction is most reliable for diseases for which the incubation period is shorter than the latent period, even very short incubation periods can generate significant uncertainty in the number of presymptomatic infecteds, and therefore the probability of a major outbreak (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004836.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This means that our conclusions even hold for diseases such as influenza and norovirus, which have incubation periods of only a few days [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The messages we have set out are also robust to different distributions of the incubation and infectious periods, as we showed by considering models for which these periods follow gamma rather than exponential distributions (
