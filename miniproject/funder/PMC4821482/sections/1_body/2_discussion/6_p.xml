<p>Our work shows rigorously, for the first time, that no matter how accurately disease transmission parameters are estimated, precise estimates early in outbreaks of whether a major epidemic will occur will remain unavailable without data about presymptomatic infection. This is still the case even if significant resources are devoted to recording symptomatic cases accurately. Consequently, diagnostic tests that can identify presymptomatic infecteds [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] are extremely important for improving forecasts of epidemic outbreaks. While our simulations consider random testing of asymptomatic individuals, in practice testing is costly [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], so it is vital that predictability is further improved in a cost-effective way by careful selection of individuals to test. This could be done by contact tracing [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] or using statistical methods to identify individuals with the highest risk of being infected [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], although of course effective and cheap diagnostics are still required. A systematic investigation into which asymptomatic individuals ought to be tested, accounting for the specificity of the tests as well as the sensitivity, would be a valuable extension to our work. A recent analysis of Ebola [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] has considered testing of individuals already exhibiting symptoms to confirm whether the patients have Ebola or a different disease with similar symptoms. That study shows that using rapid diagnostic tests in combination with slower but more accurate diagnostic tests could have significantly reduced the number of cases in Sierra Leone in the recent outbreak.
