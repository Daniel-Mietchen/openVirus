<p>Of course, our conclusions are relevant to pathogens of agricultural and wild animals and plants, as well as humans. 
 <italic>Xylella fastidiosa</italic> is a plant pathogen that is currently invading southern Italy, causing devastating damage to olive groves [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Containment and surveillance zones have been set up in an attempt to find the pathogen and subsequently mitigate spread via control interventions. Surveys in the containment zone do include some laboratory testing for presymptomatic infection, with the surveillance zone solely relying on diagnosis from visual inspection [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. We have shown that consideration of presymptomatic infection is extremely important when forecasting the spread of pathogens, and so it is also likely to be important when planning interventions that attempt to slow or prevent spread. Studies examining the impacts of presymptomatic infection on forecasting and control of specific pathogens would represent valuable applied extensions to this publication.
