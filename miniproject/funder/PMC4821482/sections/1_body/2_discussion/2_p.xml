<p>To focus entirely on the uncertainty caused by presymptomatic infection, we worked in an idealized setting in which symptomatic cases and deaths were recorded perfectly and in which the values of disease transmission parameters were known exactly. This allowed us to calculate the exact probability distribution of the current size of the outbreak, i.e. the total number of individuals currently infected, given that presymptomatic infection causes some infected individuals to be unobservable. This distribution drives the estimated probability of a major outbreak.</p>
