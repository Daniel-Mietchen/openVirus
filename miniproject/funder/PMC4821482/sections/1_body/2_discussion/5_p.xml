<p>We assumed that the parameter values controlling disease spread are unchanged throughout the early stage of the outbreak, whereas in reality these parameters might vary temporally in response to changing contact networks and control interventions [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, any such variations will only exacerbate the uncertainty that we have shown exists. Other sources of uncertainty such as under-reporting, which has posed a challenge to forecasting during the recent Ebola outbreak [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], will also decrease predictability further, although as we have shown presymptomatic infection alone is sufficient to make precise prediction impossible. A systematic investigation of the errors in forecasting caused by under-reporting in comparison to those due to other features such as presymptomatic infection or epidemiological parameter uncertainty is a possibility for a future study.
