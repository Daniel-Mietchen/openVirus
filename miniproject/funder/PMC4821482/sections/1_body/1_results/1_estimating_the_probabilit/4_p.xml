<p>Our initial analysis considers a simplified, SEIR model with exponential waiting times in each compartment. In the SEIR model, presymptomatic infecteds are confined to the uninfectious, latently infected (
 <italic>E</italic>) class. We relax this assumption later, and also consider the case where the waiting times follow gamma, rather than exponential distributions. Recent modeling work, focused on the recent outbreak of Ebola, often includes considerable epidemiological detail [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], although there are some exceptions [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="pcbi.1004836.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Here we take advantage of a previous parameterization of the SEIR model for Ebola, noting that the SEIR model is widely-used for a number of diseases and captures what we want to investigate here—i.e. the effect of presymptomatic infection on major outbreak forecasting—in the simplest possible way.
