<p>We use simulations of stochastic compartmental epidemic models to drive our analyses. The models assume that, at any time, every member of the population belongs to a compartment describing their infection and symptom status. In a single realization of the model, whether or not an individual becomes infected is a random process. If an individual does become infected, then the model generates the time at which the individual is first infected, the time at which symptoms first appear and the time at which the individual either dies or recovers. These times are simply those at which the individual passes into the relevant compartments of the model.</p>
