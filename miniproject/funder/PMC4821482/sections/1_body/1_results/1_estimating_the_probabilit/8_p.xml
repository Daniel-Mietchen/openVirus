<p>The problem of practical interest for an emerging epidemic is inferring the true probability of a major outbreak. For an individual outbreak, a (often imprecise) confidence interval can be constructed around the point estimate as we described above. However, we characterize the implications of presymptomatic infection more generally by examining many simulated outbreaks, inverting our point estimate of the probability of a major outbreak to consider the range of true probabilities that are possible for each estimated value. Similar estimated probabilities of a major outbreak can correspond to a remarkably wide range of true probabilities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004836.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For example, for outbreaks in which the estimated probability is between 0.5 and 0.6, the true probability can lie between 0.23 and 0.83. We note the extreme values are themselves quite likely: in 13% of these simulated outbreaks, the true probability is in fact either 0.23 or 0.83.
