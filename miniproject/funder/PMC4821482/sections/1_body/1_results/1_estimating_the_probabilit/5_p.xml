<p>The true and estimated probabilities of a major epidemic are calculated for many simulated outbreaks, to investigate how presymptomatic infection affects the ability to predict major epidemics early in outbreaks (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004836.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The probability of a major outbreak depends on the number of infected individuals at the time of estimation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004836.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), and hidden presymptomatic infection therefore frustrates prediction. This is even the case when there are actually no presymptomatic infected individuals in the population, since the distribution that estimates the number of presymptomatic individuals will include values other than zero.
