<p>We therefore produce a “dataset” for the start of an outbreak by running a simulation model. We “freeze” the outbreak at the time of the fourth death, and calculate two quantities using the model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004836.g001">Fig 1</xref>): the probability of a major outbreak given complete observation of presymptomatic cases (hereafter referred to as the “true” probability of a major outbreak), and the estimate of this probability that only uses data on the timings of symptoms and deaths and not the times at which individuals are initially infected. In this estimated probability, the presymptomatic cases remain hidden and the number of presymptomatic infected individuals is estimated from the data on symptoms and deaths.
