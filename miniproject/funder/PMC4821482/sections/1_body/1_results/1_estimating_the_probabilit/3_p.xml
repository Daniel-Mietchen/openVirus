<p>For an individual outbreak, a confidence interval can be constructed around the point estimate that we consider. For the outbreak in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004836.g001">Fig 1</xref>, the distributional estimate of the number of exposed individuals leads to a 95% confidence interval for the current number of infected individuals of [1,6], which corresponds to an extremely wide 95% confidence interval for the probability of a major outbreak of [0.24,0.78]. The point estimate corresponds to a weighted sum over the distributional estimate of the probability of a major outbreak.
