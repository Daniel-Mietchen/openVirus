<p>In the SEIR model, only discrete values of the true probability of a major outbreak are possible, since the true probability is entirely controlled by the total number of infected individuals at the time of estimation. However, each individual dataset, corresponding to a separate realization of an outbreak, consists of the times that individuals become symptomatic. Slight variations in these times lead to different probability distributions of the number of presymptomatic infecteds. These differences are reflected in the estimated probability of a major outbreak. Consequently, the estimated probability for each true value is effectively a continuously varying quantity.</p>
