<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004836.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, the variable heights of adjacent boxplots indicate that the distribution of infected individuals between the asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious classes affects the estimated probability of a major outbreak. For example, the heights of the second and third boxplots from the left can be explained as follows. Consider two outbreaks, each with only a single infected individual at the time that the chance of a major outbreak is being estimated. Suppose that in the first outbreak (“outbreak one”, say), the infected individual is presymptomatic, but in the second outbreak (“outbreak two”) the infected individual is symptomatic. In outbreak two, because disease is observed since the infected individual is symptomatic, the estimated probability of a major outbreak will be high compared to outbreak one. However, whilst the estimated probability of a major outbreak is higher for outbreak two, the true probability of a major outbreak is in fact higher for outbreak one. This is because, in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004836.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, individuals can be infectious both when they are presymptomatic and when they are symptomatic. A presymptomatic individual is therefore likely to be infectious for a longer period in future than a symptomatic individual. A longer time infectious corresponds to (on average) more infections, and therefore a higher true probability of a major outbreak.
