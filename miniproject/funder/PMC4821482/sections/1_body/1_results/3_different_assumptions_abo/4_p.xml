<p>The default assumption for compartmental models is that incubation and infectious periods are exponentially distributed. We relax this assumption, and draw periods instead from two-parameter gamma distributions to reflect the observed incubation and infectious periods for a number of diseases [

Recently-infected individuals are more likely to remain infectious for a long period beyond the time of estimation than individuals that have already been infected for a long time. Consequently, outbreaks with many presymptomatic infecteds have a high true probability of a major outbreak. However, because presymptomatic individuals are unobserved, the estimated probability of a major outbreak is low in these outbreaks.
