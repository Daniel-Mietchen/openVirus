<p>The emergence of symptoms and the emergence of infectivity are assumed to coincide in the SEIR model. We relax this assumption by considering two other models. In the first, individuals display symptoms before becoming infectious (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004836.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). When symptoms appear before individuals are infectious, the incubation period is reduced, so more infected individuals can be detected. As a result, predictions of major outbreaks become more accurate, although some systematic ambiguity nevertheless remains (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004836.s008">S8A</xref>). Conversely, if the incubation period is instead longer than the latent period, as is the case for many human diseases [
