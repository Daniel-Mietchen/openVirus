<p>Estimation of the chance of a major outbreak can be improved by the use of diagnostic tests to determine whether asymptomatic individuals are susceptible or presymptomatic infected. Since the reliability of diagnostic tests affects the extent to which forecasting is improved (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004836.g003">Fig 3</xref>), it is not only important to develop diagnostic tests but also to ensure their continued refinement. To illustrate the general principle that diagnostic tests could be used to improve prediction, we simply choose individuals to test at random from the asymptomatic individuals in the population. With random selection, the diagnostic test must be deployed widely to reduce the error in estimates significantly, although of course careful choice of which individuals to test (e.g. via contact tracing) would reduce the need for such widespread deployment in practice.
