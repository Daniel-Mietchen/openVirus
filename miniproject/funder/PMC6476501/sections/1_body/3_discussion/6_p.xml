<p>IgM Abs to Flu A remained less than 2% in five pediatric groups and then reached to the peak in the 18â€“35-year-old group, subsequently showed a gradual decrease with age. The low positivity rate of IgM Abs to Flu A in children deserved further study to clarify. Our speculations to this result are, comparing with adults, children live in a relatively simple and secure environment, so the transmission route may be cut off; the immune response to Flu A virus is relatively week in children so less antibodies produced; some ILI symptoms in children are result of other respiratory virus infection. However, comparison of the frequency between antigen and IgM Abs may provide other insights. In both adults and children, antigen to Flu A was detected with a substantially higher rate in 2016 (23.68%) and 2017 (10.62%) winter flu seasons. This is in controversy to the considerably low rates of IgM Abs to Flu A in children (0.16% in 2016 and 1.37% in 2017). Of the 923 children with paired detection results of both antigen and IgM Abs, similar disagreement results were observed, antigen to Flu A was detected with 7.32% in 2016 and 15.84% in 2017 winter flu seasons, but the IgM Abs to Flu A were less than 2% in children. Flu weekly report from Chinese National Influenza Center had it that subtype H3N2 of Flu A was the major circulating strain in 2016 and 2017 winter flu seasons in China [
 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The antigen result indicates the severity of the Flu A epidemic was equivalent or more severe in children than adults. The disproportionately low IgM Abs to Flu A in children is worthy of attention. The results support the conclusion that currently used IgM Abs assays might miss detecting IgM Abs to Flu A in these children, or in the early stage of diseases.
