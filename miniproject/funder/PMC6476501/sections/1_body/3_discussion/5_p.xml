<p>The IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B was related to ages. Notably, the rate of IgM Abs was very low in children less than 1 year old, whereas IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B both increased significantly with aging. IgM Abs to Flu B peaked (51.07%) at 4–5 years and then declined gradually with age, while a considerably high frequency (14.79%) was maintained in over-60-years group. Children under 1 year age live in a relatively closed and safe environment and keep neutralizing antibodies from their mothers, thereby avoiding influenza virus infection. On other hand, children ages 4–5 years old attend kindergarten and usually they are active to public facilities and therefore have more exposure to influenza viruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Studies have indicated that Flu B detection rates among ILI pediatric cases ranged from 9.5% to 56.4% during 2006 to 2017 in China [

 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This proportion was similar to those observed in the United States (0.1–44.6%) [

 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but was higher than those in Europe (0–16.4%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. So far, mismatches between the circulating strains and the type B strains in the trivalent vaccine were observed, suggesting higher clinical disease burden [
 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Oseltamivir, which is recommended the main antiviral drug for treatment of Flu A virus infection, has been shown to be less effective in shortening the duration of viral shedding and febrile illness in children with Flu B [
 <xref rid="pone.0215514.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Such a high incidence of IgM Abs to Flu B indicates the severe disease burden and we should pay more attention to choosing screening methods.
