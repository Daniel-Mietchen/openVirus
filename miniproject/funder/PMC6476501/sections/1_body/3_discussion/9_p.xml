<p>There were some limitations of the present study. To determine the presence of influenza infection, the standard method should be virus culture combined with IIFA or hemagglutination inhibition tests in cultured cells. However, in this study, we compared IgM Abs screening data with antigen tests. We could not determine whether vaccination had an effect on IgM Abs detection. According to a survey, the general influenza vaccination rate in China is less than 3%, but approximately 10% in Beijing [

Also, the duration from getting infected to blood taking could not be confirmed, some negative results could be attribute to the window period of IgM Abs production.
