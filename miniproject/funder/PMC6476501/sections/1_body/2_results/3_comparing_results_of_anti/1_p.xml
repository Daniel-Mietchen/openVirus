<p>Considering that contemporaneous antigen results, which were detected at random, may indicate the epidemic intensities of certain pathogens, we compared the influenza antigen and IgM Abs results during the 2016 and 2017 winter flu seasons (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215514.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Results indicated that the positive rate of antigen and IgM Abs was not consistent for both Flu A and Flu B. In winter of 2016, the positivity rate of Flu A antigen in children was 23.68%, whereas IgM Abs to Flu A was 0.16% (p &lt;0.01). In winter of 2017, the positivity rate of Flu A antigen in children was 10.62%, whereas that of IgM Abs to Flu A was 1.37% (p &lt;0.01). Generally in children, the detection rate of Flu A antigen was significantly higher than the IgM Abs to Flu A in two consecutive winter flu seasons. The situation was conversed in adults. During the 2016 winter season, the positive rate of Flu A antigen was 7.25%, and that of IgM Abs to Flu A was 20.56% (p &lt;0.01). During the 2017 winter season, the positivity rate of Flu A antigen was 5.59%, and that of IgM Abs to Flu A was 11.53% (p &lt;0.01). The lower frequency of antigen and higher IgM Abs for Flu A in adults seems to indicate that adults are more inclined to develop IgM Abs for Flu A by an occult infection [
