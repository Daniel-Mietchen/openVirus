<p>There were 923 hospitalized pediatric patients with ILI simultaneously analyzed for influenza antigen and IgM Abs (519 in the 2016 and 404 in the 2017 flu seasons). Significant differences between antigen and IgM Abs distribution were observed. The positivity rates of Flu A antigen were 7.32% in the 2016 winter season and 15.84% in the 2017 winter season (p &lt;0.01), whereas in both seasons, the detection rate of IgM Abs to Flu A was less than 2%. The positivity rates of Flu B antigen were 0.39% in 2016 and 8.66% in 2017, whereas those of IgM Abs to Flu B were 18.69% in 2016 and 9.41% in 2017. Antigen detection of Flu B in the 2017 flu season was higher than the 2016 flu season (p &lt;0.01); on the contrary, IgM Abs to Flu B in the 2017 flu season were even lower than those in the 2016 flu season (p &lt;0.01;
