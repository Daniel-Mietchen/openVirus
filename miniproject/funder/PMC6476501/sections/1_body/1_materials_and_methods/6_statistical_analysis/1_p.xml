<p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (version 19.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For comparisons of categorical data, χ
 <sup>2</sup> tests and Fisher’s exact tests were used as appropriate. To compare trends of monthly distributions of IgM Abs between children and adults, Spearman tests were performed for the correlation. All tests were two-tailed, and results with p values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically significant.
