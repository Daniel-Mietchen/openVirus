<p>A Respiratory Tract Profile (IgM) kit (EUROIMMUN, Germany) was adopted by the two hospitals. Based on the titer plane technique using infected cells/cultured bacteria, this test kit is designed for the in vitro determination of human IgM Abs to Flu A, Flu B, and another six atypical respiratory pathogens, including adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, chlamydia pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, and mycoplasma pneumoniae using serum/plasma samples. Detections were performed qualitatively according to the manufacturer’s instruction: Apply 30 μl of diluted serum or plasma samples to each reaction field of the reagent tray, incubate for 30 mins at room temperature, then rinse the BIOCHIP slides with a flush of phosphate buffer solution (PBS) -Tween, followed by applying 25 μl of fluorescein labeled anti-human globulin to each reaction field, Incubate for 30 mins again, then wash with the new PBS-Tween for at least 5 mins, Place embedding medium onto a cover glass to read the fluorescence with the microscope. Fluorescence results were read by experienced technicians.</p>
