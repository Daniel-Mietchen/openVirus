Samples from 36,792 patients, aged 0&#x02013;98 years, were collected and tested. Among the patients, 923 children from two winter flu seasons were assayed with both antigens and IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B and assigned as paired groups. Another 2,340 adults and 1,978 children with only antigen tested in the 2016 and 2017 winter flu seasons were named as unpaired groups. IgM Abs-positivity rates in children were 0.80% and 36.57% for Flu A and Flu B, respectively, peaking at 4&#x02013;5 years of age. For adults, the Flu A and Flu B IgM Abs-positivity rates were 10.34% and 21.49%, respectively, peaking at 18&#x02013;35 years of age. The trend of temporal distribution between the children and the adults was significantly correlated for IgM Abs to Flu B, but not for Flu A. Compared with unpaired groups, the detection rate of Flu A antigen was significantly higher than IgM Abs in children, whereas frequencies of IgM Abs were higher than antigen in adults. Incidence of Flu B antigen was sharply increased in 2017 winter than in the 2016 winter in both children and adults, but no concomitant increase was observed in IgM Abs to Flu B. For paired children groups, incidence of Flu B antigen in the 2017 flu season was significantly higher than that in the 2016 flu season; in contrast, positive rates of IgM Abs in the 2017 flu season were even lower than those in 2016. Considering antigen detection may reflect the Flu A/Flu B epidemic, our results indicate single-assayed IgM Abs were less effective in the diagnosis of acute influenza virus infection, and the use of this assay for epidemiology evaluations was not supported by these findings.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Beijing Municipal Science &#x00026; Technology Commission Program of China</institution></funding-source><award-id>grant no.

Influenza virus genera A (Flu A) or B (Flu B) infections account for a vast majority of influenza cases in humans [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Most of these infections are asymptomatic or exhibit relatively mild symptoms, presenting as influenza-like illnesses (ILI). However, some patients with influenza exhibit severe symptoms, leading to hospitalization or even death, particularly in children, the elderly, and those with underlying chronic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Seasonal influenza results in approximately 250,000&#x02013;500,000 deaths worldwide in each year [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Flu A has been isolated from various species, including humans, contributing to substantial viral heterogeneity, resulting in the production of various subtypes with the potential to cause human pandemic [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In contrast, Flu B evolved almost exclusively as a human pathogen, limiting the generation of new strains by reassortment [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Two major subtypes of Flu A and two lineages of Flu B viruses co-circulate and cause annual epidemics. In China, since the spread of swine-origin H1N1 in 2009 [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], most outbreaks of seasonal flu have been trigged by the transmission of pdmH1N1/2009 (pH1N1) and seasonal A (H3N2) (sH3N2), as well as the type B influenza virus Victoria lineage (B/Victoria) [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, low immunization coverage and lack of type B influenza viruses of the Yamagata lineage (B/Yamagata) in the current trivalent influenza vaccine in China would promote its prevalence [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Indeed, during the 2017&#x02013;2018 winter season, China experienced a national wide influenza epidemic. Reported influenza cases throughout the entire nation in winter of 2017 (December 2017 to February 2018) increased 5.7 times as compared with that in winter of 2016 (December 2016 to February 2017). According to unpublished data acquired from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of China, at least half of the identified viruses belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage during the 2017 winter flu season [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The epidemics have highlighted the need for simpler and rapider assays to facilitate the diagnosis of influenza infections and differentiate the subtypes/lineages of the viruses. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests, influenza rapid diagnostic test (IRDT), and serological detection of specific antibodies (IgM Abs and IgG Abs) targeting the viruses were recommended to assist with influenza diagnosis from ILI cases in the clinical setting [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Developed since early 1980s, most publications about serum IgM Abs assay were based on complement-fixation tests [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], while the distribution and diagnostic features of IgM Abs in ILI cases are still unclear [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B in two tertiary hospitals in Beijing during the period from December 2016 to February 2018, covering 15 months and two winter flu seasons. Frequencies of IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B were compared with the findings of contemporary antigen tests, providing insights into the use of IgM Abs for influenza diagnosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Data were analyzed anonymously.

However, no proportionate increase in IgM Abs to Flu B was found (<xref rid="pone.0215514.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215514.g004">Fig 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Comparison of antigen and IgM Abs distributions in paired pediatric groups</title><p>There were 923 hospitalized pediatric patients with ILI simultaneously analyzed for influenza antigen and IgM Abs (519 in the 2016 and 404 in the 2017 flu seasons). Significant differences between antigen and IgM Abs distribution were observed. The positivity rates of Flu A antigen were 7.32% in the 2016 winter season and 15.84% in the 2017 winter season (p &#x0003c;0.01), whereas in both seasons, the detection rate of IgM Abs to Flu A was less than 2%.

Rapid and reliable pathogens screening is important for diagnosis and prevention of influenza virus infection. Common detecting methods include IRDT for Flu A and Flu B virus, single or multiplex nucleic acid assays for viral RNA, and serum-specific IgM or IgG Abs to influenza virus [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To date, many reports have described the development, evaluation, and application of the first two methods, but few reports have documented IgM Abs detection [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Detection of specific IgM Abs against viruses and other atypical pathogens has been widely applied for the diagnosis of respiratory infection [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or profiled immunofluorescent assays, specific IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B can be detected.</p><p>However, the assay is widely taken advantage for single detection use in the clinical setting. The improper use may lead to clinical misdiagnosis and mistreatment. A study once indicated that IgM Abs to Flu A, as determined by the IIFA method, could be used for diagnosis in 64% of single sera with complement-fixation Abs titred between 32 to 256 [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Another study indicated that using ELISA to detect IgM, IgG, and IgA Abs responses to influenza p(H1N1) hemagglutinin in infected persons during the 2009 pandemic exhibited lower sensitivity compared with hemagglutination inhibition and microneutralization assays. Cross-reactive Abs against homologous and heterologous subtypes did exist in serologic Abs studies [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], it is necessary to eliminate IgG Abs by immunoadsorption before the IgM Abs assay using profiled IIFA. Other Abs tests for H5N1 and H7N9 using ELISA also indicated limited sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we reviewed and summarized the results of single serum IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B viruses in 36,792 ILI cases, and compared IgM Abs with unpaired and paired antigens tests over the same period, with purpose to offer insights on rational screening methods selection facing the epidemic of Flu A and Flu B viruses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the correlation of IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B with influenza antigen detection. Beijing Children&#x02019;s Hospital and Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital are two tertiary hospitals in Beijing; one is located at the south end of the city, and the other is located at the north end of the city. As a result, patients are representative of the epidemiology of the whole city. All IgM Abs had been screened using the IIFA product by EUROIMMUN at two hospitals.</p><p>The IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B was related to ages. Notably, the rate of IgM Abs was very low in children less than 1 year old, whereas IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B both increased significantly with aging. IgM Abs to Flu B peaked (51.07%) at 4&#x02013;5 years and then declined gradually with age, while a considerably high frequency (14.79%) was maintained in over-60-years group. Children under 1 year age live in a relatively closed and safe environment and keep neutralizing antibodies from their mothers, thereby avoiding influenza virus infection. On other hand, children ages 4&#x02013;5 years old attend kindergarten and usually they are active to public facilities and therefore have more exposure to influenza viruses [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The incidence of IgM Abs to Flu B in children was significantly higher than that to Flu A, consistent with reports demonstrating that children are more likely to acquire Flu B infection [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Studies have indicated that Flu B detection rates among ILI pediatric cases ranged from 9.5% to 56.4% during 2006 to 2017 in China [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. This proportion was similar to those observed in the United States (0.1&#x02013;44.6%) [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but was higher than those in Europe (0&#x02013;16.4%) [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. So far, mismatches between the circulating strains and the type B strains in the trivalent vaccine were observed, suggesting higher clinical disease burden [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Oseltamivir, which is recommended the main antiviral drug for treatment of Flu A virus infection, has been shown to be less effective in shortening the duration of viral shedding and febrile illness in children with Flu B [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Such a high incidence of IgM Abs to Flu B indicates the severe disease burden and we should pay more attention to choosing screening methods.</p><p>IgM Abs to Flu A remained less than 2% in five pediatric groups and then reached to the peak in the 18&#x02013;35-year-old group, subsequently showed a gradual decrease with age. The low positivity rate of IgM Abs to Flu A in children deserved further study to clarify. Our speculations to this result are, comparing with adults, children live in a relatively simple and secure environment, so the transmission route may be cut off; the immune response to Flu A virus is relatively week in children so less antibodies produced; some ILI symptoms in children are result of other respiratory virus infection. However, comparison of the frequency between antigen and IgM Abs may provide other insights. In both adults and children, antigen to Flu A was detected with a substantially higher rate in 2016 (23.68%) and 2017 (10.62%) winter flu seasons. This is in controversy to the considerably low rates of IgM Abs to Flu A in children (0.16% in 2016 and 1.37% in 2017). Of the 923 children with paired detection results of both antigen and IgM Abs, similar disagreement results were observed, antigen to Flu A was detected with 7.32% in 2016 and 15.84% in 2017 winter flu seasons, but the IgM Abs to Flu A were less than 2% in children. Flu weekly report from Chinese National Influenza Center had it that subtype H3N2 of Flu A was the major circulating strain in 2016 and 2017 winter flu seasons in China [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The antigen result indicates the severity of the Flu A epidemic was equivalent or more severe in children than adults. The disproportionately low IgM Abs to Flu A in children is worthy of attention. The results support the conclusion that currently used IgM Abs assays might miss detecting IgM Abs to Flu A in these children, or in the early stage of diseases.</p><p>Analysis of monthly distribution of IgM Abs indicated that both IgM Abs increased from autumn to winter and decreased from spring to summer. The trends of IgM Abs to Flu B were consistent between children and adults [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, two waves of discordance for Flu A between children and adults were observed, one in December 2016 (increased in adults but smooth in children) and another in November of 2017 (increased in children but stable in adults). This could be explained by the erratic epidemic of Flu A especially with the subtype changing and diverse susceptibilities of adults and children to viruses. Studies had indicated that various subtypes of Flu A tend to infect people of different age. For example, p(H1N1) preferentially infects children under 14 years of age, whereas sH3N2 preferentially infects patients between 30 and 39 years of age, and sH1N1 infects patients more than 70 years of age [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>There was an epidemic of the B/Yamagata strain in winter of 2017 in Beijing [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], the epidemic was also confirmed by our group using RT-PCR and by data from China CDC [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. By analyzing unpaired and paired data of antigen to IgM Abs, we found that antigen to Flu B was significantly increased in 2017 winter compared with that in 2016, while there was no simultaneous increase in IgM Abs to Flu B. Since sensitivity of antigen detection by IRDT is lower than by RT-PCR [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], the actual Flu B infection should be severer than that indicated by antigen-positivity rate. Thus, some IgM Abs to Flu B in the 2017 winter flu season should have been present, but not detected by the single assay. Additionally, vaccinations [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and immune memories in patients with sub-clinical infection [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] may also be contributed to higher IgM Abs detection. As a result, it is still unclear whether the positivity rate of IgM Abs to Flu B detected at a high frequency from 4&#x02013;5 years old is a symbol of true infection or a reminiscent response. As China CDC administered a trivalent vaccine that does not include the B/Yamagata strain in 2017, we suspect that the IgM Abs to Flu B in 2017 winter might be true reflection of the Flu B virus infection.</p><p>There were some limitations of the present study. To determine the presence of influenza infection, the standard method should be virus culture combined with IIFA or hemagglutination inhibition tests in cultured cells. However, in this study, we compared IgM Abs screening data with antigen tests. We could not determine whether vaccination had an effect on IgM Abs detection. According to a survey, the general influenza vaccination rate in China is less than 3%, but approximately 10% in Beijing [<xref rid="pone.0215514.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Therefore, the influence of vaccination on antibody detection could not be ignored. Also, the duration from getting infected to blood taking could not be confirmed, some negative results could be attribute to the window period of IgM Abs production.</p><p>In conclusion, we retrospectively reviewed the presence of IgM Abs to Flu A and Flu B in ILI cases from December 2016 to February 2018. The results indicated that IgM Abs were distributed across different age groups, with Flu A peaking in the 18&#x02013;35-year-old group and Flu B peaking in the 4&#x02013;5-year-old group. Seasonal distribution was also observed. Of clinical significance, single assayed IgM Abs were less effective for the diagnosis of acute influenza virus infection owing to lack of detection of IgM Abs to Flu A in two winter flu seasons in children and IgM Abs to Flu B in the 2017 winter flu epidemic in both children and adults. These results do not support the use of single IgM Abs assay for diagnosis and epidemiological evaluations. Thus, further studies are needed to develop new broad spectrum of influenza diagnostic assays based on serum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0215514.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><p>P values of comparing the positive detection rate of IgM Abs between age groups for Flu A and Flu B.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0215514.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the staffs in the department of clinical laboratory from Beijing Children&#x02019;s Hospital and Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital.
