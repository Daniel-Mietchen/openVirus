<p>We compared the frequency and recency of prior HIV testing among MSM&amp;TW classified as newly diagnosed (n = 80; 43.7%) vs. previously diagnosed (n = 103; 56.3%). In univariate analyses, being older and reporting more prior HIV tests (3 or more) were associated with lower odds of newly being diagnosed (
 <xref rid="pone.0217501.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Significantly higher odds of being newly diagnosed were observed among participants who reported that their last HIV test was less recent; and among participants who lived in Blantyre (Malawi), Cape Town or Soweto (South Africa), compared to living in Kisumu (Kenya). (P&lt;0.05 for all four variables.)
