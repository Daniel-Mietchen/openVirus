<p>We compared the 47 (7.8%) MSM&amp;TW who had no prior HIV test with the 554 (92.2%) MSM&amp;TW who had a prior HIV test (
 <xref rid="pone.0217501.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In univariate analyses, older age (21–25 years and 26–44 years) compared to younger age (18–20 years) was significantly associated with lower odds of never having had an HIV test. Living in Cape Town (South Africa) compared to living in Kisumu (Kenya) was significantly associated with higher odds of no prior HIV testing. (P&lt;0.05 for all bivariate associations.) In multivariate analysis, older age (21–25 years and 26–44 years) compared to younger age (18–20 years) remained significantly associated with lower odds of no prior HIV testing (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 0.23, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.11, 0.50; and AOR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.65, respectively).
