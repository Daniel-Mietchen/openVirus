<p>Even though there was no significant difference between TW and cis-gender MSM, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217501.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> shows that these groups differed in terms of the number of prior HIV tests and the self-reported result of their last HIV test. TW were less likely than MSM to have had 3 or more prior HIV tests. Despite this lower testing frequency, TW were more likely than MSM to report that their last HIV test was positive.
