<p>We compared characteristics of the 183 (30.4%) HIV-infected MSM&amp;TW and the 418 (69.6%) HIV-uninfected MSM&amp;TW (
 <xref rid="pone.0217501.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). In univariate analyses, older age (26–44 years) was significantly associated with higher odds of being HIV infected compared to younger age (18–20 years). Identifying as female or transgender (compared to identifying as male), reporting having had an HIV test more than 6 months to one-year or ≥1 year prior to screening (compared to having had a test in the previous 6 months), and living in Cape Town or Soweto (South Africa; compared to living in Kisumu, Kenya) were significantly associated with higher odds of being HIV infected. Ever having had sex with women or having had sex with women in the past 3 months were significantly associated with lower odds of being HIV infected. (P&lt;0.05 for all five variables.)
