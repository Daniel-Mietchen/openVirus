<p>Our findings have several implications for programming and further research. These implications apply to both MSM and TW. However, implementation of these implications should acknowledge the differences between these populations. Furthermore, with the emerging transgender organizations in SSA [

In addition to promotion of safer sex practices and improved PrEP access and use, a critical step in preventing the further spread of HIV among MSM&amp;TW in SSA is to ensure that persons are aware of their HIV status. Given the high prevalence of HIV infection among MSM&amp;TW in this region and the various circumstances promoting risky sexual behavior, frequent repeat HIV testing is needed in this population. This is critical for all MSM&amp;TW, but especially for younger MSM&amp;TW. A second critical step in curbing the HIV epidemic in this population is to improve linkage to care for HIV-infected MSM&amp;TW. Both steps require an understanding of barriers that operate on a personal and social level, such as anxiety about a positive diagnosis and HIV related stigma [

 <xref rid="pone.0217501.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Our findings suggest that once in care, gaps in the care continuum are less severe, but still need improvement. Several strategies have been proven effective for addressing these issues in other populations and settings [

 <xref rid="pone.0217501.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]; adaptation of these strategies and evaluation of their effectiveness among SSA MSM&amp;TW is urgently needed.
