<p>Although the proportion of MSM&amp;TW who reported no prior HIV test was low, there was a substantial number of previously undiagnosed HIV infections in this cohort. HIV prevalence among MSM&amp;TW in this study was higher than reported HIV prevalence among men in the general African population in the same age group [

 <xref rid="pone.0217501.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Awareness of oneâ€™s positive HIV status appears to be a major gap in the HIV care continuum in this population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217501.g001">Fig 1</xref>), especially for younger MSM&amp;TW, who were the least likely to report having had a prior HIV test [
 <xref rid="pone.0217501.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. That participants who reported that their last HIV test was less recent had significantly higher odds of being newly diagnosed; this not surprising given the longer time interval, and indicates the importance of frequent and repeat testing in this population. The second biggest gap appears to be linkage to care among those with a prior HIV diagnosis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217501.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The remaining gaps were smaller in this study: many of those in care were on ART, and most of those on ART were virally suppressed. The differences we observed between study sites for HIV prevalence and prior HIV testing could reflect actual population differences (e.g., a higher general HIV prevalence in South Africa compared to Malawi); these differences may also reflect variations in the way persons were recruited at each study site.
