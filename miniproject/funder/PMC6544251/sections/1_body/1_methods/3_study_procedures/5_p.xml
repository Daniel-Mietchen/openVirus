Participants who reported having had a prior HIV test were subsequently asked about the number of prior HIV tests, the time since their last HIV test, and their last HIV test result. Participants who reported having had a prior positive HIV test were asked about their engagement in HIV care. Participants who reported that they were in care were asked if they had ever been prescribed ARV drugs.</p>
