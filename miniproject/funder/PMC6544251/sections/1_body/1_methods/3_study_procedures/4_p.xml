If you choose to skip a question, it might make you ineligible to participate. Do you have any questions before we begin?” The first question that followed asked: “In your life, have you had sex with women only, with men only, or with both?” Subsequently, persons were asked: “When is the last time that you had sex with somebody?” and “In the past three months, have you had sex with men or with women?” To assess whether persons had had anal sex, the interviewer read the following instruction: “Men can have different kinds of sex with men. Men can masturbate each other. Men can have oral sex; that is when one man takes the penis of another man in his mouth. And men can have anal sex; that is when one man puts his penis in the anus of the other man.” Subsequently, persons were asked: “In the past three months, which kinds of sex have you had with men? You may indicate more than one.”</p>
