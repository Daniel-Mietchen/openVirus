<p>Participants were classified as HIV-infected or HIV-uninfected based on the results of HIV testing using samples collected at the screening visit. Data from both self-report and retrospective ARV drug testing were used to classify HIV-infected participants as: (1) having had a prior HIV test vs. not having had a prior HIV test; (2) being in care vs. not in care; and (3) being on ART vs. not on ART. Detection of ARV drugs in study samples was considered to indicate prior HIV testing, care engagement, and ART, even if these were not reported to study staff. Data from self-report alone was used to assess the frequency of prior HIV testing and the time since the last HIV test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to compare (1) persons who never had an HIV test with those who had one or more HIV tests; (2) persons who tested HIV positive with those who tested HIV negative; and (3) persons who were newly diagnosed with those who were previously diagnosed. Co-variates included age, immigration status, sexual history, HIV testing practices, and current sexual activity. Multivariate models included variables that had an odds ratio with a p-value &lt; 0.1 in the univariate analysis, as a conservative cut-off point. For one model a p-value &lt; 0.05 was used to prevent overspecification. For some multivariate analyses, participants were excluded because 'testing history' and 'testing frequency' were not known (these data were only collected for participants who reported having had a prior HIV test).</p>
