<p>This study evaluated MSM&amp;TW who were screened for participation in HPTN 075. Included in the current analysis were persons who were 18 to 44 years of age, were assigned male sex at birth, ever had sex with a man, and had two concordant rapid HIV test results at screening. HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons were eligible for participation. Participation was open to persons who were assigned male sex at birth but identified as female or transgender. The reason for including TW in this study was based on the experience that some TW in SSA identify with or see themselves as part of gay communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0217501.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], and that HPTN 075 was designed to be inclusive and respect communities. Furthermore, inclusion of TW would allow for the collection of exploratory information about this critical high-risk population. In this report, MSM&amp;TW refers to all persons in the study population, including MSM and persons who identified as female or transgender. More than 1 in 5 persons who screened for the study identified as female or transgender. Of the 624 persons screened for HPTN 075, 601 were included in this study.
