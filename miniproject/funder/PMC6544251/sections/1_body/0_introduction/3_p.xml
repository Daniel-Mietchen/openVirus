We evaluated these issues using data collected from persons who were screened of for participation in the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) 075 study. The overall aim of this multi-country prospective study was to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting and retaining MSM&amp;TW for HIV prevention studies in SSA. In this report, we explored factors associated with prior HIV testing, HIV infection, awareness of HIV positive status, engagement in care, ART, and viral suppression. Findings from this study help identify critical gaps in the HIV care continuum among MSM&amp;TW in SSA.
