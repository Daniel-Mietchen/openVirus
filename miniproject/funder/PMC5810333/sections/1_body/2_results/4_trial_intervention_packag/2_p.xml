<p>As displayed in Table 
 <xref rid="jia225048-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap">4</xref>, the administration of universal ART is randomized at the community or clinic‐level in all trials. Participants in the intervention arms are offered ART initiation regardless of immunological status or clinical stage. Initially BCPP participants were offered ART if CD4 count ≥350 cells/μl and HIV‐1 RNA ≥10,000 copies/ml, or if CD4 count &lt;350 cells/μl regardless of HIV‐1 RNA. However, with emerging data and evolving WHO recommendations, all HIV‐infected participants are now offered ART. In the control arms of all trials, ART initiation follows national guidelines. In the intervention arms of some trials, additional services are provided, enhanced and/or delivered according to the principles of differentiated care

These intervention packages emphasize the key role of an early ART initiation in a wider combination prevention strategy. Furthermore, only a small proportion of those activities is offered in the national standard of care (or offered on a much smaller scale); thus the overall quality and in some cases, efficiency of care delivered to study participants is increased relative to the general population.
