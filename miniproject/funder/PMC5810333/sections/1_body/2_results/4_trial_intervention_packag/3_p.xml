<p>Health services are delivered through three main means. First, each trial community is serviced by clinics that provide most of the conventional health activities including HIV care and treatment. In BCPP, 
 <italic>Max</italic>ART, PopART and SEARCH, the trial clinics are government‐led (with strengthening of government staff by some trials), whereas in TasP, the clinics are built for the purpose of the trial to bring services closer to people's homes. Second, health services are also delivered through community‐based activities like home visits (BCPP, PopART, ANRS TasP, SEARCH), HIV testing in mobile units (BCPP, ANRS TasP), and/or health campaigns (SEARCH). Finally, in some instances, trial participants are referred to government‐led health facilities to receive standard of care services that the trials do not provide (e.g. VMMC, sexually transmitted infections care, tuberculosis treatment). The models of care provide examples of how to adapt services to meet the specific needs of patients and the local capacity of the health systems.
