 <xref rid="jia225048-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref> characterizes the trial population and their contexts at baseline (See Table 
 <xref rid="jia225048-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> for national indicators). The trials vary in terms of the demographic composition. For example in SEARCH, half of the population living in the trial area is less than 15 years old (unpublished trial data), whereas in the South African study sites of PopART,26% of people are aged ≤15 years old (unpublished trial data). The trial contexts also differ in the economies involved (e.g. unemployment, poverty) as well as the education level of their populations. The proportion of adults who had no secondary school education ranged from 13% in the South African communities of PopART (unpublished data) to 71% in the SEARCH communities

 <italic>Max</italic>ART and BCPP trials are being implemented in areas characterized by a relatively high ART coverage with, respectively, 85% 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref> and 73% 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> of the adult population over 15 years old on ART. In SEARCH, an estimated 57% of people ≥15 years old are on ART at baseline 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>. TasP and PopART trials accounted for the smallest ART coverages with less than half of the population on ART in their study sites (38% among &gt;15 years old in TasP 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>, 30% and 39% among 18 to 44 years old in the South African and Zambian PopART communities (unpublished work)). Despite significant progress of the local governments in fighting the epidemics through a series of strategic and operational plans, the overall health sector response and capacity have not yet met the needs of the local population in all these settings. The epidemics continue to spread along socio‐economic development fault lines such as poverty, gender inequality, unemployment and lack of adequate social protection among others
