<p>As presented in Table 
 <xref rid="jia225048-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap">2</xref>, the five UTT trials share a common primary aim, which is to assess the impact of UTT on the HIV epidemic. Each trial compares outcomes between communities where all HIV‐infected persons are offered ART regardless of immunological status or clinical stage (among other interventions) and communities where HIV‐infected persons receive ART according to the national guidelines. All trials examine the long‐term benefits and sustainability of the UTT intervention with their extended observation periods (≥3 years). With this common framework, the trials differ somewhat in their designs, with four adopting a community‐randomized design and one adopting a stepped‐wedge clinic‐randomized design. The trials also differ in the number of study arms, with four trials designed with two arms and one trial with three arms.
