<p>With study‐specific definitions of residency, Table 
 <xref rid="jia225048-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap">3</xref> shows that the selection of the trial clusters (i.e. communities or clinic‐catchment areas) were based on diverse criteria. All trials made efforts for their clusters to be large (to ensure that most sexual contacts occur within the cluster) and dispersed (to minimize contamination and overlapping catchment of different health facilities). Two out of the five trials are implementing a pair‐matched design, and one trial is triplet‐matched. With study‐specific definitions of residency, the trial population and eligibility criteria and sizes varied greatly between studies. All trials carefully defined the population that was eligible for the trial interventions (intervention population) which ranged from 4000 to a million of individuals. They collect specific information on selected samples (research study population) and measure the primary outcome through more intensive observations (evaluation population). The study settings are all characterized by some degrees of mobility in and out of the study communities. (Migration rates and characteristics of migrants will be reported in trial‐specific publications.)
