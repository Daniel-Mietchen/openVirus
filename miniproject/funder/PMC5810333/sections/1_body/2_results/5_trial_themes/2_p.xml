 <xref rid="jia225048-tbl-0005" ref-type="table-wrap">5</xref> outlines the main themes that are explored in the trials. The scope of the data collected underlines the trials' potential to explore a range of issues including and beyond HIV incidence. All trials carefully monitor the uptake of trial services and the implementation of the HIV care cascade 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref>: HIV testing, linkage to care activities, treatment initiation, adherence, and/or viral suppression. Such data will help to assess the trial's success in reaching the UNAIDS 90‐90‐90 targets for 2020. In addition, all trials document individual health outcomes (some through accessing routine programmatic clinical data). At least a subset of trial participants is observed via repeated screening and diagnostic tests, which may occur in the clinic (BCPP, 
 <italic>Max</italic>ART, PopART, ANRS TasP), at home (BCPP, PopART, ANRS TasP) or at community health campaigns and home (SEARCH). Data such as individual CD4 counts, HIV RNA metrics and results of HIV drug resistance tests, are being accumulated on more than a million people across the trials. Some studies are also using HIV viral phylogenetics to investigate transmission patterns at baseline and over time (BCPP, PopART, SEARCH and ANRS TasP). Importantly, the trials also record the costs of the interventions implemented, and will model their cost‐effectiveness, and assess their impact on the operating health systems. The collection of data on human resources, programmatic costs or length of waiting time in clinics will aid in the assessment of the feasibility of integrating universal ART in local health systems. Finally, all trials are investigating social outcomes including facilitators and barriers to accessing HIV care. Besides characterizing the trial populations with standard socio‐demographic information, these trials also collect experiences and perceptions of a sample of trial participants, community members and services providers. Such qualitative research provides evidence to understand the acceptability of the UTT strategies by the general population
