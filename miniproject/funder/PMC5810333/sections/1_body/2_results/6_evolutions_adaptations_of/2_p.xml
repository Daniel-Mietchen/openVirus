<p>Over the past several years, the HIV policy landscape has been in constant evolution, prompting the on‐going trials to modify their interventions and strategies. In particular, the trials responded to the WHO recommendations related to ART initiation, preventing mother‐to‐child transmission and pre‐exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and considered the UNAIDS 90‐90‐90 targets for 2020. In all studies, the control arms immediately followed the national guidelines. Figure 
 <xref rid="jia225048-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the integration of the 2013 WHO ART recommendations in the arms of each trial, with the threshold for ART initiation changing in the control arms from ≤350 CD4 cells/μl to ≤500 CD4 cells/μl: in 2014 for Zambia (PopART), Uganda and Kenya (SEARCH), and in 2015 for South Africa (ANRS TasP, PopART) and Swaziland (

In 2016, the national guidelines moved to universal ART in Botswana (BCPP), Uganda (SEARCH), Kenya (SEARCH) and South Africa (PopART) and both the intervention and control trial arms switched to universal ART in all of these studies. In the same period, other parameters were altered in the trial protocols, especially to adapt to operational challenges (e.g. simplification of procedures of ART delivery, targeting of the most‐at‐risk population for HIV infection). All PopART communities in Zambia shifted to universal ART as part of a pilot for national roll‐out. SEARCH became a two‐phase trial; in the second phase, all communities were provided with universal treatment with streamlined care, and communities were re‐randomized for targeted PrEP and targeted enhanced testing and care. The BCPP trial started delivering streamlined ART initiation and follow‐up in the intervention arm (with same‐day ART initiation and fewer clinical visits for stable, virologically suppressed patients on ART). Overall, the five trials have proved to be extremely adaptive to the moving sub‐Saharan African political, economic and public health environment, preserving their ability to generate rigorous scientific evidence on UTT effectiveness.
