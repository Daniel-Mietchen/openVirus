<p>This analysis has several limitations. First, differences in the trials' design and data collection schemes (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225048-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap">3</xref>) prevented direct comparison of several indicators at baseline (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225048-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap">1</xref>). To improve comparison, we provided statistics from both data collected at baseline as well as national indicators (Table 
 <xref rid="jia225048-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>).
