<p>Second, the methods applied are not based on a consensual methodology which would allow a standardized and thus validated direct comparison of the trials. Because no such methods exist yet, we developed, as a consortium, a simple way to comparatively assess all trials. The expertise and experience of the researchers was central to decide which trial components should be compared, at what level of detail, and how to interpret their differences across trials. We opted for a comprehensive description of the trials. We acknowledge that more information on the modelling, economic or social perspectives of the UTT strategies is needed to better understand the trials' interim and final results. Such analyses will be the focus of future collaborative work within our consortium.</p>
