<p>To our knowledge, this is the first detailed exploration of the trials evaluating UTT strategies in sub‐Saharan Africa. This 
 <italic>a priori</italic> exercise, i.e. before the individual study findings are released, is not usually performed by investigators. By providing detailed qualitative and quantitative insights about the different trial approaches, our analysis was intended to prospectively build the foundation for more collaborative research on UTT. It also aimed at providing valuable information as the trials are underway and starting to publish process data and findings, to guide as rapidly as possible the strengthening of services for testing and treatment in sub‐Saharan Africa, for both individual and public health benefits.
