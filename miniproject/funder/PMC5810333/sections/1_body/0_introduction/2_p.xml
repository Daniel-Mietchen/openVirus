Indeed, the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) was shown to be associated with a 93% reduction in HIV sexual transmission in HIV serodiscordant stable couples in whom the HIV‐positive partner was randomized to immediate initiation of ART irrespective of his/her individual clinical needs

In 2015, two randomized clinical trials showed that initiating ART as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis (regardless of disease stage) also yielded strong clinical benefits to the individual
