<p>Mathematical models have sought to predict the long‐term population‐level impact of UTT strategies on the epidemic

 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>. Furthermore, these models vary greatly in structure and in parametric assumptions and rely on context‐specific variables, such as eligibility criteria for ART initiation, uptake and coverage of HIV testing, linkage to care, treatment initiation and adherence

Modelling the potential impact of UTT offered necessary but insufficient data points for national policy makers trying to determine how to successfully take UTT to scale in their unique contexts. As noted by the HIV Modelling Consortium, modelling is used to investigate the 
 <italic>potentia</italic>l impact of UTT; empirical evidence from large randomized trials is needed to further assess the feasibility of rolling out UTT to whole communities
