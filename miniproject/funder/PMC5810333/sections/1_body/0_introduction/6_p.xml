<p>Although the data collection of four out of five trials is not completed yet, the ongoing UTT trials have accumulated practical experience and data which could prove vital to large‐scale rollout of UTT strategies. The investigators of the five ongoing UTT randomized population‐based studies have agreed to collaborate as the Universal Test and Treat Trials Consortium (UT
 <sup>3</sup>C). This group shares protocols, field experiences and early data, to generate consensus statements when appropriate, and ultimately to facilitate joint analyses that can inform public policy and resource allocation.
