<p>The aim of this first paper is to describe, compare and contrast the contexts, research designs, intervention packages, themes explored and adaptations, that characterize these five ongoing large‐scale studies on UTT in Southern and Eastern Africa. This comparison will facilitate a better understanding of the results of these studies, when they are available, and may assist in understanding any differences found.</p>
