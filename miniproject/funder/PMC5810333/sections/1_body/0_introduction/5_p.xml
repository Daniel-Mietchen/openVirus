<p>As such, in a context where HIV funding is flat, obtaining evidence‐based data on UTT long‐term impact, cost‐effectiveness, feasibility, sustainability and acceptability at local and national levels is critical

 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. To fulfil this need, five community‐based trials were designed and implemented in the past five years in Southern and Eastern Africa. They were initiated before the WHO issued its recommendation for universal treatment

In addition to measuring effects of UTT on HIV incidence, the studies are expected to provide critical data on the feasibility and cost of implementation of UTT (as well as more vs. less successful approaches to implementation), and thus to guide future policy and practice, by providing evidence for optimal scale‐up approaches
