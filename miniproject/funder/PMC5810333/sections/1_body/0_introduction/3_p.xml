<p>The concept of TasP has been replaced by that of universal HIV testing and treatment (UTT), which offers HIV counselling and testing to an entire population and ART to all those HIV‐infected 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that ART should be offered to all individuals diagnosed with HIV regardless of their CD4 count and clinical staging 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, and the Joint United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) proposed their 90‐90‐90 targets for HIV treatment scale‐up by 2020 (namely, that 90% of HIV‐infected persons know their status; that 90% of those who know their positive HIV status continue on an efficacious ART regimen; and that 90% of those on ART have undetectable HIV‐1 RNA) 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. Thus, the remaining research questions are “What are the feasibility, effects and costs of UTT on a population level, and how do we best implement this strategy?” Maximizing the coverage of HIV testing, effective linkage and retention in care, rapid access to and initiation of ART, and strong adherence for viral suppression are required to achieve the full potential impact of UTT
