<p>In the HIV/AIDS field, models of care have constantly evolved and adapted to the changing needs of communities, patients and to new scientific evidence 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">79</xref>. Recently, a flurry of new, more‐efficient HIV care models has been proposed which challenges the classic standard facility‐based model. Among them, the scale‐up of ART is leading to one of the most sweeping changes in health care delivery, especially in sub‐Saharan Africa 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">80</xref>, 
 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">81</xref>. In this comparative analysis, we document the pragmatic systems and processes of UTT care models that are being field‐tested in sub‐Saharan Africa and are thus on the forefront of large‐scale practice. The trials showcase key interventions which could be integrated in the new models of care, namely community‐based approaches for HIV testing with the use of point‐of‐care HIV tests, rapid facility‐based provision of ART, community ART delivery, active follow‐up activities, integrated chronic care model with HIV and non‐communicable diseases, effective community engagement and close collaboration with the existing health services.
