<p>The trials deliver a wide range of biomedical, behavioural and structural interventions services to the communities. These strategies build on the plea for combination efforts for HIV prevention and care, which have progressively been gaining influence among scientists and policy makers

While the UTT interventions have been designed to both lessen the burden of HIV infection and reduce vulnerability to HIV acquisition, their effect in real‐world situations remains to be proven. The ANRS TasP trial, the first UTT trial to yield final results, did not demonstrate an effect of offering immediate ART on HIV incidence

The SEARCH trial, still ongoing, recently reported having nearly doubled HIV viral suppression within their study population over two years (from 44.7% to 80.2%), surpassing the UNAIDS 90‐90‐90 targets

Our appraisal therefore emphasizes the critical monitoring of all the trial services, in order to understand gaps and support the implementation of combination interventions.
