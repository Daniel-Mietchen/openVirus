<p>All trials also consider the optimization of the whole HIV care cascade as key for a successful UTT strategy. Even though the overall trial attention remains on HIV incidence, key secondary outcomes related to the HIV care cascade components have progressively shown their significance when interpreting the trial impact on the HIV epidemic

As a consequence, even though the trials were underway before the release of the UNAIDS targets, their results may make an important contribution in demonstrating if and how UTT can help to reach those targets and to what degree those targets might prompt a reduction of new HIV infections, in somewhat different HIV epidemic contexts.
