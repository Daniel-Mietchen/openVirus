<p>We identified study characteristics that were deemed essential for comparing the UTT trials and organized them in five categories: (1) Trial contexts: key demographic and socio‐economic characteristics of the populations living in the trial areas, health services available in the trial areas, and their HIV epidemiological profiles; (2) Trial research methodologies: trial design, primary outcome, populations and other methodological considerations; (3) Trial intervention packages: services delivered in the trial intervention and control arms as well as national standard of care; (4) Trial themes: areas of interest of the trials and data collected for secondary outcomes; (5) Trial adaptations: modifications of the trial designs and interventions during the conduct of the trials, especially in response to evolving treatment guidelines. The identification of those five categories as well as the interpretation of the results was done collectively, until a consensus was reached within the cross‐study collaboration.</p>
