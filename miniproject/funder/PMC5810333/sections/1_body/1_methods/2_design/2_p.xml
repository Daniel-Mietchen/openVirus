<p>We conducted a comparative assessment of the five large‐scale UTT randomized studies conducted in sub‐Saharan Africa: the ANRS 12,249 TasP (ANRS TasP) trial in South Africa

 <xref rid="jia225048-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>. UTT trials gathered as a consortium (UT
 <sup>3</sup>C) constituted of two to three representatives per trial, including a trial principal investigator. After sharing trial protocols, we screened for essential study characteristics and consensually decided which should be compared and at what level of detail. Then we highlighted and interpreted differences and commonalities across the trials. Over a year and a half period, information was exchanged via emails (twice monthly), teleconferences (once monthly) and a half‐day meeting held prior to the manuscript submission. The first and last authors of the present manuscript led this collaborative work.
