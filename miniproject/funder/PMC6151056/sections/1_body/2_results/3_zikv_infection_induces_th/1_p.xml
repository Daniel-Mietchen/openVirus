<p id="Par64">To determine whether the IRE-XBP1 pathway is activated in response to ZIKV infection in human neural cells, 
 <italic>xbp1s</italic> was detected via RT-PCR. Similar to that induced by tunicamycin, the spliced 
 <italic>xbp1s</italic> was detected at 24 and 48 hpi. The ratios of 
 <italic>xbp1s</italic>/t-
 <italic>xbp1</italic> between mock and ZIKV infection were 15.8-fold (24 hpi) and 32.6-fold (48 hpi) in CCF-STTG1 cells, and 3.1-fold (24 hpi) and 10.9-fold (48 hpi) in SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>,
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref>). RT-qPCR results indicated that 
 <italic>xbp1s</italic> significantly increased during ZIKV infection. It implied that ZIKV infection induced the splicing of 
 <italic>xbp1</italic>.
