<p id="Par67">To deal with ER stress, the activated UPR causes translation attenuation, cellular apoptosis, and protein degradation. CHOP is one of the components of the ER stress-mediated apoptotic pathway. Activated CHOP further induces apoptotic markers, such as Bcl-2, Caspase-9, and Caspase-3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Its expression is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. The transcriptional level of 
 <italic>chop</italic> increased significantly in the nervous tissues of the mouse brain (1.65-fold) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and at 24 hpi (1.6-fold) and 48 hpi (1.8-fold) in CCF-STTG1 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>e), and at 24 hpi (1.5-fold) and 48 hpi (4.2-fold) in SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>f). The transcription of 
 <italic>chop</italic> was regulated by both ATF4 and XBP1s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, ATF4 was weakly activated during ZIKV infection. The changing trends of 
 <italic>chop</italic> were consistent with 
 <italic>xbp1s</italic>. Thus, activated 
 <italic>chop</italic> may be mainly regulated by XBP1s. ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like protein (EDEM) family proteins are the main members of ERAD activated during ER stress. XBP1 is involved in ERAD by the induction of EDEM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Many studies demonstrated that EDEM-1 increases during virus infection or directly interacts with the viral proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The transcriptional level of 
 <italic>edem-1</italic> significantly increased in the nervous tissues of the mouse brain (1.76-fold) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), but no change was detected in neural cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7g</xref>,
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">h</xref>). Therefore, the results implied that ZIKV infection mediates XBP1s to activate CHOP and may mediate cell apoptosis, but not EDEM-1 to activate protein degradation.
