<p id="Par66">Phosphorylated PERK mediates eIF2α phosphorylation and regulates many ER stress-related genes through ATF4, such as amino acid metabolism, 
 <italic>gadd34</italic>, and cell apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Our results indicated that ZIKV infection induced eIF2α phosphorylation in human neural cells which is similar with the previous study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. ATF4 is regulated by phospho-eIF2α, and its activation results in the function of the PERK-eIF2α pathway [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. To determine whether the increasing amount of phospho-beIF2α in ZIKV infection is sufficient to induce ATF4 translation, the mRNA level of 
 <italic>atf4</italic> was measured using RT-qPCR. The results indicated that 
 <italic>atf4</italic> significantly increased in the nervous tissues of the mouse brain (1.60-fold) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and at 48 hpi in CCF-STTG1 cells (1.40-fold) but not in SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>,
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">b</xref>,). Although the mRNA level of 
 <italic>atf4</italic> increased slightly, the fold change was negligible. This result suggests that phospho-eIF2α weakly activates ATF4. GADD34 is a negative feedback loop that restores protein translation by targeting PP1 to phosphor-eIF2α and making it dephosphorylate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. RT-qPCR results demonstrated that the mRNA level of 
 <italic>gadd34</italic> significantly increased in the nervous tissues of the mouse brain (1.86-fold) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) and at 48 hpi (2.6-fold) in CCF-STTG1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7c</xref>) cells and at 48 hpi (1.9-fold) in SK-N-SH cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d). Those results suggest that GADD34 expression is increased to restore protein translation during ZIKV replication, implying that ZIKV may take advantage of the protein synthesis of the host cell.
