<p id="Par59">IRE1-XBP1 is an important arm of the UPR. Phospho-IRE1 splices a 26-nt intron from full-length 
 <italic>xbp1u</italic>, resulting in the formation of 
 <italic>xbp1s</italic>. 
 <italic>Xbp1s</italic> encodes the transcription factor XBP1s which activates the expression of genes involved in chaperone and protein degradation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Phospho-IRE1 and XBP1 were analyzed by western blot. Compared with mock-infected samples, the ZIKV-infected nervous tissues of the mouse brain exhibited an upregulation of phospho-IRE1 and XBP1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). The genes encoding IRE1 and XBP1 were also analyzed via RT-qPCR. As there are two forms of 
 <italic>xbp1</italic>, primers that specifically amplified 
 <italic>xbp1s</italic> and total 
 <italic>xbp1</italic> (
 <italic>t-xbp1</italic>, including both 
 <italic>xbp1u</italic> and 
 <italic>xbp1s</italic>) were used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. We found that the expression of 
 <italic>ire1</italic> increased. The ratio of 
 <italic>xbp1s</italic>/t-
 <italic>xbp1</italic> between mock-infected and ZIKV-infected was 2.08-fold (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Collectively, the findings demonstrated that ZIKV infection in the nervous tissues of the mouse brain activated phospho-IRE1 and induced the post-transcriptional cleavage of 
 <italic>xbp1</italic>.
