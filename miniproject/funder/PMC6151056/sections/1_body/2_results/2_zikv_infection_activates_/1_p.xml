<p id="Par62">In order to verify the ER stress at the cellular level which occurred on the nervous tissues of the mouse brain during ZIKV infection, we selected two representative neural cells, neuroblastoma cell line (SK-N-SH), and astrocytoma cell line (CCF-STTG1), to perform experiments. Neural cells were infected with ZIKV at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell. Viral growth was analyzed at different hours post infection (hpi) via RT-qPCR for the quantification of the viral nucleic acid (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: a, b). The maximum virus RNA copies of SK-N-SH and CCF-STTG1 were 1.103 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> copies/μg RNA at 48 hpi and 1.201 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> copies/μg RNA at 36 hpi respectively. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy also revealed the presence of envelope protein at 24 hpi (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: c, d). The results indicated that ZIKV could infect and replicate in SK-N-SH and CCF-STTG1 cells. These results offered a model to study the ER stress of ZIKV at the cellular level.
