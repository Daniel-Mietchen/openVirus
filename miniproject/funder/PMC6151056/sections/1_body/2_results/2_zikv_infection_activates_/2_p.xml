<p id="Par63">To determine whether ZIKV infection in human neural cells also activates cellular ER stress, we detected the expression of ER stress sensors. Comparison of ZIKV infection with mock infection showed that the expression of BIP, phospho-elF2α, phospho-IRE1, and ATF6n significantly increased at 48 hpi in CCF-STTG1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). However, only phospho-elF2α significantly increased at 48 hpi in SK-N-SH (Fig 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The expression change of BIP, phospho-IRE1, and ATF6n was not significant in SK-N-SH. The results indicated that ZIKV infection strongly activated the UPR in CCF-STTG1 and slightly activated in SK-N-SH.
