  <p>ZIKV infection stimulates ATF6n and XBP1s to translocate into the cell nuclei of neural cells in the mouse brain. Three-week-old AG6 mice were infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/mouse (each dose, 
   <italic>N</italic> = 3) via intraperitoneal injection. 
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold> The whole brain sections of AG6 mice were stained with DAPI (blue), anti-ZIKV envelope protein antibody (red), and anti-XBP1 (
   <bold>a</bold>) or anti-ATF6 (
   <bold>b</bold>) antibody (green) and were used for immunohistofluorescence assay at 5 dpi. Images of the whole brain were captured by using a digital slice scanning analysis system (Pannoramic MIDI). A representative sub-area of mesocephalon is shown. Positive cells marked by white squares were magnified nine times and shown on the top-right corner. 
   <bold>c</bold> Positive rates of nuclear localization were counted. Data represent three area of mesocephalon through random selection and 
   <italic>error bars</italic> indicate mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple 
   <italic>t</italic> tests (
   <italic>N</italic> = 3) (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 or 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01)
