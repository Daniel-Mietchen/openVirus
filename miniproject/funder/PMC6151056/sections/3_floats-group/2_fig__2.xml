  <p>ZIKV infection upregulates the expression of phospho-IRE1, XBP1, and ATF6 in the mouse brain. Three-week-old AG6 mice were infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/mouse (each dose, 
   <italic>N</italic> = 3) via intraperitoneal injection. 
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold> Sections of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and mesocephalon were obtained at 5 dpi, and anti-phospho-IRE1 antibody (
   <bold>a</bold>), anti-XBP1 antibody (recognizing both non-spliced and spliced isoforms of XBP1) (
   <bold>b</bold>), and anti-ATF6 antibody (recognizing both cleaved and full forms of ATF6) (
   <bold>c</bold>) were used for immunohistochemistry assay. Purple dots represent the cell nucleus. Brown spots represent the ZIKV envelope protein. A representative of three independent experiments is shown. Positive cells marked by white squares were magnified nine times and showed on the top-right corner. 
   <bold>d</bold>, 
   <bold>e</bold>, 
   <bold>f</bold> Aperio ImageScope viewing software was used to analyze the percentage of positivity (algorithm, positive pixel count). Data represented three independent experiments and 
   <italic>error bars</italic> indicate mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple 
   <italic>t</italic> tests (
   <italic>N</italic> = 3) (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 or
