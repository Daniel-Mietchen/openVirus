   <p>Immunohistochemistry assay for ZIKV infection in the mouse brain. a Three-week-old AG6 mice were infected with 1 × 10
    <sup>5</sup> PFU/mouse (each dose, 
    <italic>N</italic> = 3) via intraperitoneal injection. Sections of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and mesocephalon were obtained at 5 dpi, and anti-ZIKV envelope protein antibody was used for immunohistochemistry assay. Purple dots represent the cell nucleus. Brown spots represent the ZIKV envelope protein. Shown is representative one of three independent experiments. b Aperio ImageScope viewing software was used to analyze the percentage of positivity (algorithm, positive pixel count). Data represented three independent experiments and 
    <italic>error bars</italic> indicate mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple 
    <italic>t</italic> tests (
    <italic>N</italic> = 3) (
    <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 or 
    <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). (EPS 474 kb)
