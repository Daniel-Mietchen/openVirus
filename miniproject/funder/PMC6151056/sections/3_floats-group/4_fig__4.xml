  <p>ZIKV infection increases the expression of ER stress sensors in human neural cells. 
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold> CCF-STTG1and SK-N-SH were infected with ZIKV at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell, and cellular lysates were obtained at 24 and 48 hpi. An equal amount of cell lysates were analyzed with anti-BIP antibody, anti-phospho-eIF2α antibody, anti-total-eIF2α, anti-phoshpo-IRE1 antibody, anti-ATF6n antibody, anti-ZIKV envelope protein antibody, and anti-β-actin antibody. The bands were analyzed by using Image Lab 4.0.1. The fold change of 
   <italic>target protein</italic>/
   <italic>β-actin</italic> was calculated. The protein level between mock-infected and ZIKV-infected compared with internal control β-actin. Data represented three independent experiments and 
   <italic>error bars</italic> indicate mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple 
   <italic>t</italic> tests (
   <italic>N</italic> = 3) (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 or 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01)
