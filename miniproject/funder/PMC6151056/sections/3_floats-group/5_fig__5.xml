  <p>ZIKV infection induces the splicing of xbp1 and the translocation of XBP1s into the nuclei of human neural cells. 
   <bold>a</bold>, 
   <bold>b</bold> CCF- STTG1 and SK-N-SH were infected with ZIKV at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell. Positive control (Tm) was treated with 2 μM tunicamycin. RNA was extracted at 24 and 48 hpi and the first strand cDNA was synthesized. Primers that specifically amplified 
   <italic>xbp1s</italic> and total 
   <italic>xbp1</italic> (including both 
   <italic>xbp1u</italic> and 
   <italic>xbp1s</italic>) were used to analyze 
   <italic>xbp1s</italic> via RT-qPCR. The relative expression levels of the 
   <italic>xbp1s</italic> and 
   <italic>t-xbp1</italic> were calculated according to the 2
   <sup>−∆∆
    <italic>Ct</italic>
   </sup> method. The ratios of 
   <italic>xbp1s</italic>/
   <italic>t-xbp1</italic> between mock-infected and ZIKV-infected were calculated. Data represented three independent experiments and 
   <italic>error bars</italic> indicate mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple 
   <italic>t</italic> tests (
   <italic>N</italic> = 3) (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 or 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). 
   <bold>c</bold>, 
   <bold>d</bold> CCF- STTG1 and SK-N-SH were infected with ZIKV at an MOI of 5 PFU/cell and fixed at 24 hpi at which time 
   <italic>xbp1</italic> starts to be spliced. Cells were stained with Goat anti-Rabbit IgG secondary antibody, FITC (green) against anti-XBP1 antibody (recognizing both non-spliced and spliced isoforms of XBP1) and Goat anti-Mouse IgG secondary antibody, Texas Red®-X (red) against anti-ZIKV envelope protein antibody. Cell nucleus was visualized using Hoechst 33258 (blue). Positive control (Tm) was treated with 2 μM tunicamycin. The results represent three independent experiments and one of three experiments is shown. 
   <bold>e</bold> Positive rates of nuclear localization were counted. Data represent three independent experiments and 
   <italic>error bars</italic> indicate mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple 
   <italic>t</italic> tests (
   <italic>N</italic> = 3) (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 or 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01)
