  <p>ZIKV infection activates UPR downstream genes in the mouse brain. Three-week-old AG6 mice were infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/mouse (each dose, 
   <italic>N</italic> = 3) via intraperitoneal injection. The total RNA was extracted from the nervous tissues of the mouse brains. Following the synthesis of the first strand cDNA, RT-qPCR assay was performed to assess the transcriptional levels of downstream genes of ER stress, namely, 
   <italic>atf4</italic>, 
   <italic>gadd34</italic>, 
   <italic>chop</italic>, and 
   <italic>edem-1</italic>. The relative expression levels of genes were calculated according to the 2
   <sup>−∆∆
    <italic>Ct</italic>
   </sup> method. Data represent three independent experiments and 
   <italic>error bars</italic> indicate mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple 
   <italic>t</italic> tests (
   <italic>N</italic> = 3) (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 or 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01)
