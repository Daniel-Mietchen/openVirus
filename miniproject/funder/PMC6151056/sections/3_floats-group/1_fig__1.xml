  <p>ZIKV infects the nervous tissues of the mouse brain and activates the ER stress markers
   <bold>.</bold> Three-week-old AG6 mice were infected with 1 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> PFU/mouse (each dose, 
   <italic>N</italic> = 3) via intraperitoneal injection. 
   <bold>a</bold>. The total mRNA of the mouse brain was extracted, and ZIKV mRNA was detected at 2 dpi and 5 dpi via RT-qPCR. 
   <bold>b</bold>, 
   <bold>c</bold> The total lysates of mouse brain were analyzed at 5 dpi via western blot. An equal amount of lysates were analyzed with anti-ZIKV envelope protein antibody (
   <bold>b</bold>), anti-BIP antibody, anti-ATF6n antibody, anti-phoshpo-IRE1 antibody, and anti-XBP1 antibody (
   <bold>c</bold>). 
   <bold>d</bold>. The band was analyzed by using Image Lab 4.0.1. The fold change of the 
   <italic>target protein</italic>/
   <italic>β-actin</italic> was calculated. The protein expression of mock-infected and ZIKV-infected samples were normalized with the internal control β-actin. 
   <bold>e</bold>. Primers that specifically amplified 
   <italic>bip</italic>, 
   <italic>ire1</italic>, 
   <italic>atf6</italic>, 
   <italic>t-xbp1</italic>, and 
   <italic>xbp1s</italic> were used. The relative expression levels of the genes were calculated according to the 2
   <sup>−∆∆
    <italic>Ct</italic>
   </sup> method. Data represented three independent experiments and 
   <italic>error bars</italic> indicate mean ± SD. Statistical analyses were performed using multiple 
   <italic>t</italic> tests (
   <italic>N</italic> = 3) (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 or 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01)
