<p>Research over the past decade has repeatedly verified the association between HFMD epidemics and climatic factors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008085.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, due to rapid urbanization and climate change in recent years, severe and sustained air pollution has also led to an increase in morbidity and mortality [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008085.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the past, research on the adverse health effects of air pollution has focused on the relationship between air pollution and chronic noncommunicable diseases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008085.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, recent studies have shown that air pollution may affect the incidence of infectious diseases [

 <sub>2</sub> in the respiratory tract may promote the occurrence of infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008085.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, there have been few studies of the relationship between air pollution and HFMD thus far. Understanding the influence of air pollution factors, social factors and their combined effects on HFMD will help the relevant departments formulate more accurate and practical preventive measures.
