<p>In the past, most studies have used time-series models (SIR, ARIMA) to estimate the impacts of variables [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008085.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In recent years, since the discovery that logistic regression cannot explain spatial heterogeneity and spatial correlation well, it is recommended that the Bayesian spatiotemporal model be used to identify spatiotemporal variations and the effects of potential predictors [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008085.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The method uses Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the posterior distribution of random variables and to identify the relative risks in different districts. As a result, the relevant departments can adequately implement preventive measures in high-risk areas, reduce the harm of HFMD and protect public health.
