<p>Studies have confirmed that socioeconomic factors and air pollution factors have an impact on the incidence of HFMD in Shenzhen, China. Among these factors, the population, the population density, the concentration of SO
 <sub>2</sub> and the concentration of NO
 <sub>2</sub> were positively correlated with the risk of HFMD, and the per capita GDP, the number of public kindergartens, the concentration of PM
 <sub>10</sub> and the concentration of O
 <sub>3</sub> were negatively correlated with the risk of HFMD. According to the map of relative risk obtained from the Bayesian spatiotemporal multifactor model, the risk of Longgang district and Pingshan district decreased, while the risk of Baoan district increased. The results will have important practical implications for local authorities, which is conducive to accurate prevention and can be used to formulate targeted disease intervention measures.
