<p>The study found that SO
 <sub>2</sub> increased the risk of HFMD, with an RR of 1.00215 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 1.00170â€“1.00232). However, we still do not know the exact mechanism by which exposure to SO
 <sub>2</sub> increases the risk of HFMD in children. However, from a biological point of view, HFMD can be transmitted through the respiratory tract, and SO
 <sub>2</sub> also has a strong stimulating effect on the respiratory mucosa, which can induce oxidative stress and systemic inflammation or increase the permeability of the solute [

 <sub>2</sub> increased the risk of HFMD, which was consistent with the results of another Shenzhen air pollution study [

 <sub>2</sub> on enterovirus, it has been confirmed that the NO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration was positively correlated with the incidence of rotavirus [

 <sub>2</sub> may have direct effects on epithelial cells, cause systemic inflammation and immune activation and modulate the intestinal microbiota [
