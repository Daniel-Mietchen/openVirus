<p>As a highly developed first-tier city in China, Shenzhen is also a hub linking mainland China and Hong Kong. The city belongs to the subtropical climate region, and it is highly populated, highly mobile, and crowded from housing and traffic and has a shrinking living space. These characteristics cause Shenzhen to have a high frequency of infectious diseases, such as HFMD [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008085.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This study included 171,210 cases of HFMD in Shenzhen from 2012 to 2015. The Bayesian spatiotemporal model was used to analyze the factors that influenced the incidence of HFMD in Shenzhen, including the population factors (population and population density), economic factors (GDP and GDP per capita), educational resource factors (public, private and total numbers of kindergartens), and environmental pollution factors (the concentrations of SO
 <sub>2</sub>, NO
 <sub>2</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, and O
 <sub>3</sub>). By testing the optimal model, the relative risk map of each district was drawn to predict the high-risk areas of HFMD and the future trend of the disease in Shenzhen.
