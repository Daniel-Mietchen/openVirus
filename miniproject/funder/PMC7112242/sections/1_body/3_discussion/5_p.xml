<p>The study also found that high concentrations of ozone play a protective role. At present, research on the relationship between ozone concentration and infectious diseases is still limited. Although some of the basic mechanisms of action of ozone in pulmonary toxicology and in medicine have been clarified, and the absolute view of ozone toxicity (that ozone is toxic and harmful to humans) is incorrect [

To judge its toxicity, it is necessary to consider the exposure dose, molecular structure and the susceptibility of individuals to exposure at the same time. At present, some studies have been based either on lungs or on studies performed in artificial environments that do not correspond to the real antioxidant capacity of the body compartments [
