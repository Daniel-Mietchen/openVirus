<p>In addition, the study found that the concentration of PM
 <sub>10</sub> was inversely related to the risk of HFMD, and this result was consistent with the research results of the relationship between PM
 <sub>10</sub> and HFMD in Yuexiu district from 2010 to 2011 [

 <sub>10</sub> and the risk of HFMD in children is still unknown. However, studies in Nanjing, Beijing, and Guangzhou have shown that public perception and acceptable risk levels of air pollution can prompt individual behavioral changes (risk reduction behaviors) [

When the haze weather is severe or the AQI (air quality index) is large, the public might reduce the number of outings, wear masks when going out, use air purifiers, reduce the number of open windows, and increase the frequency of cleaning mouths and noses. These behaviors reduce exposure to environmental pollution, thus reducing the risk of HFMD [

 <sub>10</sub> may also be related to the special geographical environment of Shenzhen. Shenzhen is located between 113°46’-114°37’ east longitude and 22°27’-22° north latitude. It is close to the sea, has a warm climate, and is humid and rainy. Warm and humid sea breezes are very beneficial to the diffusion and deposition of pollutants [
