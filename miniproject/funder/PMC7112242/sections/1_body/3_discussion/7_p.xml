<p>This study is the first a Bayesian spatiotemporal model has been used to analyze the impact of socioeconomic factors and air pollution factors on the risk of HFMD from urban spatial dimensions. Second, this study established a more mature Bayesian spatiotemporal prediction model for HFMD that can calculate the risk of HFMD in each area, to identify high-risk areas. However, these high-risk areas are not fixed, and as long as the original data are updated, the relative risk of each district will be updated, resulting in changes in the high-risk areas. However, for the predicted high-risk areas, we can implement preventive measures in a timely manner to reduce the harm of the disease. Therefore, early discovery, early prevention and effective protection of childrenâ€™s health are needed.</p>
