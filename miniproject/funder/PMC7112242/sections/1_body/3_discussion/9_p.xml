<p>There were some limitations to our research. First, some patients have mild symptoms and do not go to the hospital for treatment. Our reporting system does not record such self-treating individuals, so the incidence may be underestimated. The use of clinical diagnosis rather than laboratory diagnosis in most cases is another source of reporting bias. Second, only 4 years of data were analyzed in this study, and there was a certain degree of collinearity between the variables, both of which may reduce the stability of the model. Third, the purpose of this study was to explore the relationship among the socioeconomic factors, the air pollution factors and the incidence of HFMD, which cannot be used as evidence to judge a causal relationship. Further studies are needed to explore the physiological mechanisms of the effects of air pollution on HFMD and whether other air pollutants may affect the incidence of HFMD in children.</p>
