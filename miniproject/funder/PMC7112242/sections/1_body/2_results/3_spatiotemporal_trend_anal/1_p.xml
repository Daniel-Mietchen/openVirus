<p>We use the spatiotemporal effect estimation model (without explanatory variables) to estimate the risk of HFMD in various districts in Shenzhen and map the relative risk (RR), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008085.g005">Fig 5</xref>. Compared with the direct use of the incidence of HFMD in each district, the Bayesian spatiotemporal model considered the proximity information, and its estimation results were more representative. It can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008085.g005">Fig 5</xref> that the relative risk (RR) value of Yantian district was the highest when only considering the spatiotemporal effects, and the areas with higher relative risk were mainly concentrated in the eastern part, while the risk in the western region was relatively low.
