<p>Due to the significant differences in the numbers of cases of HFMD and the populations in different areas, to spatially describe the areas with a higher risk of HFMD, we made a gradient diagram of the average incidence of HFMD in the various districts of Shenzhen (the number of cases of HFMD per 100000 people). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008085.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows the spatial distribution of the standardized incidence rates of HFMD in Shenzhen. The spatial distribution of the disease was mainly concentrated in northeastern Shenzhen city. According to the comparison of the standardized incidence rate of each region, the incidence rate of Longgang district was the highest, followed by Pingshan district and Guangming district.
