<p>The variation between Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008085.g004">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008085.g006">6</xref> shows that the model was gradually optimized or the prediction accuracy was improved. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008085.g004">Fig 4</xref>, we hope to judge the future incidence trends by comparing the average incidences of each district of Shenzhen from 2012â€“2015. However, such a prediction was not sufficiently accurate. Therefore, we considered the effects of the spatiotemporal interactions of the disease (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008085.g005">Fig 5</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008085.g005">Fig 5</xref> showed slight changes in the tendency of the disease and high-risk areas compared to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008085.g004">Fig 4</xref>. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008085.g006">Fig 6</xref>, we not only retained the spatiotemporal interaction effect but also added the effects of the influencing factors.
