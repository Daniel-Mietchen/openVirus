<p>To demonstrate the validity of the model, we obtained the RR values (RR
 <sub>ik</sub>) for each area of each year through the model. Then, we made the point diagram of the RR values (RR
 <sub>ik</sub>) of each region over the four years (2012â€“2015) to reflect the change during the time scale. On this basis, the fitting trend line of each region was increased (the goodness of fit R
 <sup>2</sup> was more than 0.8), and the RR values of each region in 2016 were estimated. Finally, the ranking of the RR values were compared with the ranking of the incidence of each region in 2016.
