<p>From 2012–2015, the relative risk factors of HFMD were as follows: population, population density, per capita GDP, number of public kindergartens, concentration of SO
 <sub>2</sub>, concentration of NO
 <sub>2</sub>, concentration of PM
 <sub>10</sub>, and concentration of O
 <sub>3</sub>. GDP and the number of private kindergartens had no significant effect on the risk of HFMD. The population, population density, concentration of SO
 <sub>2</sub> and concentration of NO
 <sub>2</sub> were positively correlated with the risk of HFMD. The relative risks were 1.00473 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 1.00059–1.00761), 1.00010 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 1.00002–1.00016), 1.00215 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 1.00170–1.00232) and 1.00058 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 1.00028–1.00078), respectively. The per capita GDP, number of public kindergartens, concentration of PM
 <sub>10</sub> and concentration of O
 <sub>3</sub> were negatively correlated with the risk of HFMD. The relative risks were 0.98840 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 0.98660–0.99026), 0.97686 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 0.96946–0.98403), 0.99108 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 0.98551–0.99840) and 0.99587 (95% 
 <italic>CI</italic>: 0.99534–0.99610), respectively.
