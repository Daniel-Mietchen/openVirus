<p>As seen from 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008085.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>, during the period from 2012â€“2015, the factors related to the risk of HFMD included the population, population density, GDP, per capita GDP, number of private kindergartens, number of public kindergartens, concentration of SO
 <sub>2</sub>, concentration of NO
 <sub>2</sub>, concentration of PM
 <sub>10</sub>, and concentration of O
 <sub>3</sub>. We input the 10 variables that were meaningful according to the univariate Bayesian model analysis into the model for the next multivariate analysis. The DIC value of the model was 234.2. The smaller the value of DIC is, the better the goodness of fit of the model. The results of the multivariate analysis are shown in
