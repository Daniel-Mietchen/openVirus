<p>Due to the multicollinearity between the variables, multicollinearity analysis was used to calculate the variance inflation factor (VIF) between the 11 initial variables, and the variables with serious collinearity were excluded. It can be seen from 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008085.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> that the number of kindergartens (C) showed serious collinearity and were excluded from the model, so we cannot calculate its VIF value. Since the multicollinearity analysis only examined the integral correlation between the explanatory variables, the results were only used as a preliminary reference for the screening variables. The Bayesian model univariate regression results (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008085.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>) should be further selected as the criterion for selecting explanatory variables.
