 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008085.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the variation in the pollutants over the 4-year period. In addition to the peak concentration of ozone in October, the peak concentrations of SO
 <sub>2</sub>, NO
 <sub>2</sub> and PM
 <sub>10</sub> were mainly during the winter from December to January. In the high incidence period of HFMD (May to July), they maintained a low concentration or showed a downward trend.
