  <p>Because the populations of each district in Shenzhen were different from 2012 to 2015, it was necessary to standardize the annual incidence of each district. Finally, the average value was used as an index to evaluate the incidence of disease in each district for 4 years. The average incidence rate (
   <italic>p</italic>) in Shenzhen city from 2012 to 2015 was used as the standard;

  <p>The expected number of cases were calculated as follows: 
   <italic>p</italic> *n
   <sub>i,k</sub> (n
   <sub>i,k</sub> represents the corresponding population, where index i represents the different districts, and index k represents the different years);
  </p>

 <list-item>
  <p>The standardized rate was calculated as follows: (P
   <sub>i,k</sub> / 
   <italic>p</italic> *n
   <sub>i,k</sub>)* (n
   <sub>i,k</sub> /N
   <sub>k</sub>), where P
   <sub>i,k</sub> represents the actual number of cases and N
   <sub>k</sub> represents the population of Shenzhen.
