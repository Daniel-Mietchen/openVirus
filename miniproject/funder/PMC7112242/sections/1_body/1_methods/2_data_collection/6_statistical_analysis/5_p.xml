<p>We used the OpenBUGS software version 3.2.3 (MRC, UK, 2015) to develop a Poisson regression model under the region-level Bayesian framework to assess the spatial sociological effects of HFMD in Shenzhen city. The basic principle was to use Gibbs sampling to sample from the complete conditional probability distribution to generate the Markov chain. Then, through iteration, the model parameters were finally estimated. After running 1000 iterations of this experiment as the burn-in, a total of 15,000 iterations were run. To obtain a steady distribution, the convergence was evaluated by examining the trace plot of the samples for each chain. The deviance information criterion (DIC) values were used to compare the pros and cons of the different models and select the optimal model. The smaller the DIC value was, the better the goodness of fit of the model.</p>
