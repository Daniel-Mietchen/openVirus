Abstract</div> <div class="background" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Background</div> <p id="Par1">Non-government, not-for-profit community health centres (CHCs) play a crucial role within healthcare systems in fostering equity, acting both as direct providers of services and as sentinels of health and social inequity. In a study of an intervention to promote equity-oriented health care, we enlisted four diverse primary healthcare clinics with mandates to serve highly marginalized populations. All of these CHCs operate as not-for-profit, non-government organizations (NGOs), and have a marginal relationship financially and socially to other parts of the system. The purpose of this paper is to provide an analysis of the factors that shape how CHCs are able to carry out an equity mandate and, from this, to identify what is required at the level of policy to enhance capacity to provide equity-oriented health care.</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p id="Par2">We systematically examined the clinics‚Äô policy and funding contexts, and identified influences on the clinics‚Äô capacities to promote equity-oriented health care.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results</div> <p id="Par3">We identified three key mechanisms of influence, each playing out against the backdrop of a contested and marginal position of CHCs within the health care system: a) accountability and performance frameworks; b) patterns of funding and allocation of resources, and c) pathways for emergent priorities. We examine these mechanisms, considering how each influenced the pursuit of equity, and propose policy directions to optimize the primary health care sectors‚Äô capacity to support equity-oriented health care.</p> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="Par4">Although this analysis is based on a study within a high-income country, we argue that because the dynamics between community health centres and broader healthcare systems are similar across national boundaries, the implications have applicability to low and middle-income countries.</p> </div> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Background</div> <p id="Par11">Healthcare systems are composed of multiple organizations (Health Departments, Regional Health Authorities, hospitals, independent for-profit services providers, corporations and non-government not-for-profit organizations), each with its own governance structure, priorities, accountabilities, mandates and budgetary constraints. Legislation, policies and contractual obligations link these organizations together to create a system where discontinuities of care can become visible and hopefully remedied. Where these links are lacking, relationships that depend on the will of individuals can act as short-lived patches across gaps in the system.</p> <p id="Par12">In both higher, and lower and middle income countries (referred to as HIC and LMIC respectively), two problems persist: i) inverse care (that is, those who are most Marginalized<a href="#Fn1">1</a> and have the greatest health problems have the least access to care), and ii) fragmentation and under-resourcing of care for marginalized populations [<a href="#CR2">2</a>]. In most healthcare systems, non-government not-for-profit organizations (NGOs) such as community health centres (CHCs) fill service gaps left by other providers. The Canadian Association of Community Health Centers (2016) defines CHCs as "multi-sector health and healthcare organizations that deliver integrated, people-centred services and programs that reflect the needs and priorities of the diverse communities they serve. A Community Health Centre is any not-for-profit corporation, co-operative, or government agency which adheres to all five of the following domains: </p><ol> <li> <p id="Par14">Provides interprofessional primary care.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par15">Integrates services/programs in primary care, health promotion, and community wellbeing.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par16">Is community-centred.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par17">Actively addresses the social determinants of health.</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par18">Demonstrates commitment to health equity and social justice.</p> </li> </ol> <p /> <p id="Par19">While we agree that CHCs could possibly be government agencies, the CHCs with which we worked emerged as a result of government services‚Äô failure to meet the needs of vulnerable populations [<a href="#CR3">3</a>‚Äì<a href="#CR5">5</a>]. A key component of the success of CHCs in meeting needs has been attributed to their community-grounded governance structure, which ensures pathways for community feedback on the performance of the CHCs and their programs to meet community needs [<a href="#CR6">6</a>‚Äì<a href="#CR8">8</a>]. Other studies have shown that CHCs that become government agencies eventually lose some of their connection to community needs [<a href="#CR9">9</a>‚Äì<a href="#CR11">11</a>].</p> <p id="Par20">In LMIC, CHCs are remarkably diverse: they span the for-profit to non-profit continuum, can be religious or secular, may offer a narrow or broad scope of services, may be larger or quite small, may employ professionals or depend on volunteer, may exist to fulfil short or long term objectives, and may be single or multisector focused [<a href="#CR12">12</a>]. Funding for their existence may be from international secular or faith-based organizations, from philanthropic foundations, from membership, and/or a combinations of these. In their scoping review of non-governmental organization‚Äôs contribution to global health, Anbazhagan and Surekha highlighted the following strengths: great variety of programs to meet local needs; flexible and agile to ensure a quick response to emerging needs; generally have low operating costs; depend on staff and/or volunteers with a high level of commitment; community-embedded; often less tainted by association with the local or national government; and less likely to fall to corruption [<a href="#CR12">12</a>]. Their distancing from local and national government also means that their accountability to the national health authorities vary [<a href="#CR13">13</a>‚Äì<a href="#CR15">15</a>]: this can be a strength or a concern, depending on context.</p> <p id="Par21">In HIC, CHCs emerge out of two separate processes. In some cases, national and/or regional healthcare authorities promote the creation of CHCs to take on predefined tasks: services for a selected population such as Indigenous populations in Canada, Australia and New Zealand [<a href="#CR16">16</a>, <a href="#CR17">17</a>] or selected services such as HIV counselling [<a href="#CR18">18</a>]. The push for smaller government and interest in harnessing competition among providers to stimulate innovation can act as an added incentive for governments to transfer healthcare responsibilities onto the NGO sector [<a href="#CR19">19</a>]. In other cases, however, CHCs surface primarily in urban areas where surplus capacity (underemployed community-engaged professionals) exists and where unmet needs persist [<a href="#CR5">5</a>], to complement services provided by for-profit providers (providers in private practice) and governmental not-for-profit providers. Although histories vary, in either case, these CHCs generally emerge as a result of social activism, to meet the unique, and unmet or poorly met, healthcare needs of marginalized populations.</p> <p id="Par22">We argue that CHCs in HIC and LMIC implicitly or explicitly operate with an equity mandate, leading them to prioritize the development of services and programs that can best improve the health and social care needs of the population(s) they serve. However, as we discuss in this paper, the capacity to provide health care that is equity-oriented can be undermined by policy and funding contexts. In resource-stretched healthcare systems, these factors are important to understand and address.</p> <p id="Par23">The CHCs we engaged with for this study were funded primarily through public money and occupy a potentially ambiguous place in the healthcare systems, as they operate semi-autonomously. We have observed the same situation in other CHCs across Canada, Colombia, Australia and New Zealand [<a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR20">20</a>‚Äì<a href="#CR24">24</a>]. Whereas government employees can be directly controlled through firing and other mechanisms in government-owned and operated services, governmentfunders hold CHCs accountable for their use of public finances through accountability frameworks focused on contractually defined outputs and outcomes [<a href="#CR8">8</a>, <a href="#CR25">25</a>]. However these may lead to tension between the CHCs and their funders: CHCs‚Äô accountability to their service communities often leads them to advocate for those communities to government agencies, which may themselves be the CHCs‚Äô funders [<a href="#CR5">5</a>, <a href="#CR8">8</a>] or the policy-makers who create or prune the space CHCs can occupy. Funders who can also be service providers, have a dual role in this dynamic: they can be both the source of unmet needs (since the services they provide are failing to meet these needs) and the solution (through their funding of CHCs, albeit at modest levels compared to government delivered services). Little is known about how to create a policy-entrenched environment that would support CHCs in creating and operationalizing effective and equity-informed health services, when the policy-makers are also those who may be falling short of meeting needs. A detailed understanding of the factors enabling and constraining the capacity of CHCs to enact an equity mandate would optimize the effectiveness of their advocacy roles and aid funders and policy makers in designing better approaches.</p> <p id="Par24">This paper discusses policy implications stemming from a program of research examining an innovative primary healthcare (PHC) intervention ‚Äì EQUIP Primary Healthcare ‚Äì designed to enhance capacity for equity-oriented health care (EOHC) at PHC clinics serving marginalized populations [<a href="#CR1">1</a>, <a href="#CR26">26</a>‚Äì<a href="#CR29">29</a>]. One aspect of this research focuses on the policy environment required to support EOHC, defined as care that aims to mitigate the negative health effects of structural inequities and structural violence [<a href="#CR1">1</a>]. Our work has contributed to international conversations focused on the provision of trauma- and violence- informed, culturally safe and equitable PHC services to populations affected by health inequities and marginalizing social conditions [<a href="#CR30">30</a>]. In this paper, we identify the policy level requirements to expand the capacity for equity within healthcare systems, including enhancing the role of CHCs as "<i>sentinels of inequity</i>ÔøΩ?. We highlight key mechanisms that facilitate or impede the ability of CHCs to realise their equity mandate, and illustrate how these mechanisms operate in the context of four Canadian CHCs that provide PHC for populations living in marginalizing conditions, who are generally underserved by other sectors of the healthcare system. These findings have implications for improving equity across Canada‚Äôs healthcare systems and have relevance more widely.</p> </div> <div class="theoreticalfoundations" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Theoretical foundations</div> <p id="Par25">The CHCs discussed in this study are not-for-profit NGOs. A large body of literature, primarily from the field of economics, focuses on the role the NGO sector plays in the provision of public goods. Of relevance, the theoretical literature offers explanations as to why NGOs emerge to provide public goods in parallel to public institutions, and how these organizations are positioned in relation to public institutions. Salamon and Anheier [<a href="#CR31">31</a>] noted six broad theories that aim to explain this phenomenon, briefly described as follows. Weisbrod‚Äôs <i>government failure or heterogeneity theory</i> [<a href="#CR10">10</a>, <a href="#CR11">11</a>] suggests that government provision of public goods becomes homogenous over time in response to the needs of the majority. The NGO sector emerges to meet unmet needs: it is a response to demand for both enhanced quantity and range of public goods. Thus, this theory implies that NGOs are created to provide goods for populations whose needs and preferences are not met by government and other providers (e.g. through family physicians in private practice). Heterogeneity of needs and preferences is thus key. Somewhat interrelated is Hansmann‚Äôs <i>trust theory</i> [<a href="#CR32">32</a>] that posits that information asymmetries between providers and consumers create distrust about the quality of the product being procured. NGOs, being by definition not-for-profit, may be (or at least may be assumed to be) more trustworthy. Thus, distrust in government providers or markets is key to the emergence of NGOs.</p> <p id="Par26">James‚Äô <i>supply-side theory</i> [<a href="#CR33">33</a>] suggests demand alone is not sufficient, and that social entrepreneurs must exist in order for NGOs to emerge. James argues that this is particularly true in areas where religious competition exists, resulting in religious-based NGOs organizing for the delivery of public goods as a mechanism to attract adherents. The surplus delivery capacity that exists in many urban centres can also explain the proliferation of NGOs providing social goods to underserved populations. In their discussion of <i>welfare state theory</i>, Salamon and Anheier [<a href="#CR34">34</a>] suggest that the literature treats the NGO sector as a residue from imperfectly developed welfare states. Thus, it is assumed that greater involvement of the state in social welfare services leads to a smaller NGO sector. Finally, Valentinov [<a href="#CR35">35</a>] developed a <i>rurality theory</i>, arguing that NGOs emerge in rural settings to bridge inequities in services experienced in those areas.</p> <p id="Par27">The theories discussed above tend to position the state as in conflict with the NGO sector. In contrast, the <i>interdependence theory</i> suggests that conflict coexists with interdependence and partnership [<a href="#CR34">34</a>]. For example, the NGO sector can be mobilized more readily than government, and can secure political support to ensure that government engagement occurs in areas of public interest. Salamon and Anheier further argue that, along with government and market failure, "NGO failureÔøΩ? also exists in that NGOs depend, to a greater or lesser degree, on government funding for their existence. Finally, they articulate a <i>social origins theory</i> that recognizes that NGOs do not "float freely in social spaceÔøΩ? ([<a href="#CR34">34</a>], p. 18.) but are rather products of, and embedded in, social and economic structures.</p> <p id="Par28">These theoretical perspectives suggest that NGOs have a unique and valuable role to play in the pursuit of transforming health systems towards increased equity. Although helpful lens, they focus on the mergence of NGOs but fail to adequately position NGOs within the healthcare system in which they operate. It is our observation that government-funders have an ambiguous relationship with NGOs, including CHCs. Government-funders promote CHCs as a viable extension of healthcare systems, recognizing their unique role in the provision of needed services. At the same time, CHCs are not simply extensions of government-funded services, since they often fall outside traditional accountability relationships. This autonomy can be framed as being at odds with the push to increase accountability across healthcare systems. New systems of accountability have shifted from being based on trust, to those that emphasize oversight and control [<a href="#CR16">16</a>, <a href="#CR36">36</a>], which can undermine the sustainability and equity contributions of the NGO sector [<a href="#CR6">6</a>, <a href="#CR8">8</a>], for example by setting onerous reporting requirements, setting targets for specific screening tests or requiring measurement against certain indicators in ways that shape practice toward such activities rather than the most pressing patient needs.</p> <p id="Par29">Our program of research is informed by an equity lens, based on an understanding that all policy is value laden and all policy work, since it involves decisions that affect populations who have little involvement in policy decision-making [<a href="#CR37">37</a>], is ethical work. In developing this lens, we drew upon intersectional theory to guide our examination of how different forms of structural oppression are constructed, affecting individuals, organizations, and broader social systems in complex and interdependent ways. Because intersectional scholarship, driven by the pursuit of social justice [<a href="#CR38">38</a>], is oriented beyond descriptive analyses toward eradicating inequities, it provides an ideal foundation for work aimed at moving policy towards equity. An equity lens directs attention to the role of policy in shaping the relationship between social conditions and health inequities, and related health system responsibilities, in four key areas: 1) the contexts and conditions that shape access to healthcare and health outcomes; 2) structural determinants of health; 3) a wide range of evidence related to social, historical and cultural roots of disadvantage; and 4) distribution of power in both the production of inequities and policy processes (Pauly B, Varcoe C, McPherson G, Lalibert√© S, Reimer J, Ponic P, Hancock T, Kenny N: Conceptualizing an equity lens for public health: The contribution of health policy ethics, in review). In this paper, we apply an equity lens to examine the policy and funding contexts of four diverse CHCs. We draw on interdependence theory to frame the role of the CHCs as being that of <i>sentinels of inequity</i>,<a href="#Fn2">2</a><i>leading</i> the development of responses to current and emerging unmet needs, <i>advocating</i> to other service providers and health departments, and <i>educating</i> the healthcare system.</p> <p id="Par31">There are significant gaps in knowledge concerning how to: make services as responsive as possible for marginalized populations; address the health effects of structural inequities and structural violence; make PHC service delivery reforms more socially relevant; and create policy and funding environments to support these aims [<a href="#CR39">39</a>]. Our analysis considers the latter: how might policy decisions better promote EOHC throughout healthcare systems through supporting CHCs? We sought to understand how contemporary and emerging political climates shape equity agendas and to identify opportunities to enhance equity both locally and across sites.</p> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Methods</div> <p id="Par32">This analysis was conducted as part of a larger study, entitled EQUIP Primary Healthcare, aimed at developing new knowledge regarding how PHC services can serve as a key pathway to health equity at a population level. The study received ethical approval from the Behavioral Research Ethics Boards of the University of British Columbia (H12‚Äì02994) and The University of Western Ontario (103357). All participants completed an informed consent process.</p> <p id="Par33">Using a mixed methods, multiple case study design within a participatory framework, we developed and implemented an equity-oriented intervention in four PHC clinics and examined changes in key outcomes for patients, staff and the organizations. Drawing on multiple sources of data, case study method is suited to studying the structures and processes of bounded systems in context. In multiple case study, the emphasis is placed on generating both a detailed understanding of each case <i>and</i> a broader understanding of commonalities that exist across cases [<a href="#CR1">1</a>]. In our study, the PHC clinics served as the cases. We interpreted the impacts of the intervention within a broad understanding of the process of implementation at each site, including how the policy context shaped their ability to implement and/or improve their equity-oriented models of care.</p> <p id="Par34">For the analysis presented in this paper, three types of data were used. First, we developed a socio-historical narrative regarding each clinic, detailing its history, the history of the communities each clinic served, and its contemporary profile, including its position within the wider healthcare system. To construct these profiles, we drew on the clinic‚Äôs own historical and current records, and historical accounts of the communities. These narratives were used in multiple ways, including as a tool to build consensus among different stakeholders (e.g., between staff and community organizations, staff and board members) as to the history of, and challenges facing, the clinics. Second, following a method developed by Lavoie [<a href="#CR3">3</a>], we reviewed and analyzed the minutes of Board meetings along with funding contracts for each clinic for a 5-year period (2011‚Äì2016) to construct a profile of each clinic‚Äôs contractual environment. Minutes were reviewed to identify internal pressures (e.g. lack of resources, relationship with staff, tensions) and external pressures (e.g. new policies, relationship with funders and the community, emerging unmet needs). Contracts were analyzed to assess funding stability over time, budgetary line flexibility, alignment between contractual obligations and the clinics‚Äô day-to-day operation, as well as reporting burden. Third, we conducted in-depth interviews with leaders (administrative and clinical leads, Board members) at each of the clinics (<i>n</i>‚Äâ=‚Äâ7) specifically focused on the policy/funding context and its impact on the clinic. These interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim.</p> <p id="Par35">To analyze this data, the team assigned one research lead per CHC to collate the information available and conduct a preliminary analysis of Board minutes and financial records and contracts. Missing documents and gaps in knowledge were systematically identified, and shared with the team (the four leads) in regular meetings. Once major gaps were filled, focused interviews were conducted to address any remaining gaps in knowledge. A cross-case analysis was then undertaken to identify commonalties and differences.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Results</div> <p id="Par36">The CHCs we studied emerged in areas with unmet PHC needs. Importantly, these needs were unmet because the people being underserved faced complex challenges in terms of both their health status, socioeconomic conditions, and their ability to access quality and responsive healthcare. The particular unmet needs to which they responded initially set the course for each clinic‚Äôs development. Each of the four CHCs in our study arose through their own unique sets of circumstances, needs and opportunities, and as shown in Table <a href="#Tab1">1</a>, have been described in more detail in a prior publication [<a href="#CR40">40</a>].

Accountability and performance frameworks are not matched to an equity mandate</div> <p id="Par41">In an equity-oriented healthcare system, where different populations are served by a variety of service providers (e.g. fee-for-service family physicians, salaried nurse practitioners, CHCs), indicators of performance monitoring must reflect the populations served, and be benchmarked appropriately to reflect patient complexities. The CHCs we studied, however, reported that the performance indicators they report on fail to appropriately or completely reflect their population‚Äôs needs and services provided. </p><div class="disp-quote" title="disp-quote"> <p id="Par42">[S]o we‚Äôve been operating this, this service for X amount of years and then all of a sudden the contract this year stipulates these different [performance indicators], you know, in terms of measurements‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just all of a sudden they‚Äôre going to start measuring these indicators so I mean we‚Äôll see how that goes.

So there also has been some discussion about using that type of a scoring mechanism with [our clinic] to adjust our‚Ä¶ panel size or an expectation based on complexity which for [our clinic] would be a helpful thing because we‚Äôre a bit of an odd duck.

Initial meetings with the CHC‚Äôs primary government funder, who also, through the provincial health insurance plan, funds family physicians being paid on a fee-for-service basis, seemed promising. However, after over a year of discussions, including the CHC developing a business plan, the funder decided to transfer the funding to another fee-for-service based provider group: </p><div class="disp-quote" title="disp-quote"> <p id="Par59">So why is the [CHC] not an option, why are we just thrown away again and the [family health team] will get the money because that‚Äôs what they always do?

While competition is not necessarily problematic, it does pit NGOs against NGOs and can undermine relationships among those who also must collaborate to ensure that community members can access a broad range of services that fit their needs. A competition-based process also leads NGOs, and in this case CHCs, to spend considerable time on writing proposals that may not be funded. Finally, many calls for proposals relevant to NGOs and CHCs are for relatively small pots of funding. </p><div class="disp-quote" title="disp-quote"> <p id="Par64">[W]e‚Äôre very deliberately not looking for a lot of proposals or one time funding due to our [in]ability to manage that.

Contracts that frame the funded services as essential may support the retrofitting of facilities, and provide upkeep funding. This was the case when the funders clearly saw the CHC as an extension of the local healthcare system. In contexts where this was not the case (three out of four sites in our study), fundraising was key to survival.

This redirection may be financially advantageous to service providers, and problematic for the CHC, unless associated with adequate resourcing. Redirection is at times also actively and explicitly pursued by government-funders, requiring CHCs to redesign programs and processes to adapt to new locales or populations (Clinic Z-001). Rarely is the redirecting bi-directional, in part because there is no incentive for family physicians and other providers to take on complex patients, and in part because the role of the CHCs in sharing how the models of care they develop can be adopted by other providers is not recognized, funded nor systematized. For example, one of our partners discussed how the introduction of a new service in an urban area near the original, rurally-based, CHC was initially intended to be a sharing of approaches that would be implemented by other providers, and how this focus shifted over time, leaving then inappropriately funded to operate multiple communities: </p><div class="disp-quote" title="disp-quote"> <p id="Par74">So we‚Äôre very small staff as you know...

The ambiguous and underdeveloped role of CHCs within healthcare systems</div> <p id="Par81">Our findings show that CHCs have an essential role to play in increasing equity in the broader healthcare system, pointing to four key roles: first, CHCs are <i>sentinels of inequity</i>. Their commitment to meeting the needs of the community makes them more likely to become aware of inequities, or emerging vulnerable populations, and of healthcare crises. Second, CHCs are better equipped to <i>develop care responses</i> that fit with the evolving needs and contexts of local populations. This is partly due to their agility (i.e., ability to respond quickly) but also to their connection with the community, which can result in community-driven or at least community-informed innovations. Once new needs have been identified, CHCs are (or at least should be) able to <i>advocate</i> to the larger healthcare system to ensure that emerging needs are recognized and met. Finally, CHCs are well equipped to <i>educate</i> the healthcare system in the development of a system-wide response to new needs. Our data also show that this last role is rarely enacted, because of lack of recognition, resources and time. Other roles remain under-operationalized.</p> <p id="Par82">The CHCs we studied saw their populations shift and expand, at times through choices made by the clinics (such as a recognition of the need to include people with disabilities) but often out of necessity (such as in response to an influx of newcomers, and in the absence of other health care sector responses). While they were able to develop some responses to meet emerging needs, they did so with limited resources, which strained their ability to deliver current services, and protect staff and leaders from burnout. Our analysis shows that the CHCs were not in a position to educate the broader system regarding the system-level responses to the needs of vulnerable and underserved populations. If this happened, the CHCs could play an essential transformative role in the healthcare system. This role was unrealized largely because CHCs are positioned in the healthcare system as "lesser thanÔøΩ? formal care structures. As a result, opportunities to exchange ideas simply did not exist.</p> <p id="Par83">The CHCs we studied fit well within a number of theories discussed earlier in this paper, namely, </p><ul> <li> <p id="Par84">heterogeneity theory: all 4 CHCs emerged to provide services that complemented those that existed but served specific populations poorly;</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par85">trust theory: all 4 CHCs developed relationships with the communities they served and legitimately claimed a closer, trust-based relationship with their clients;</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par86">supply-side theory: the urban-based CHCs were able to draw on a skilled workforce to meet their human resource needs; and</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par87">welfare state and rural theories: all were filling important service gaps left by government-sponsored services.</p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p id="Par88">While a good explanatory fit, these theoretical framings provide little direction on how to operationalize and promote CHCs‚Äô equity role in healthcare systems. Salamon‚Äôs interdependency theory [<a href="#CR41">41</a>] offers some promise. Three decades ago, Salamon framed the relationship between the US welfare state and the NGO sector as a partnership, where governments are best positioned to provide a steady stream of resources, set priorities, articulate high-level values for which systems must strive, and institute quality control standards. In contrast, NGOs are better able to personalize services, operate on a smaller scale, and adjust care to needs rather to the structure of government agencies ([<a href="#CR41">41</a>], p. 42). These roles are inherently incomplete in themselves, hence complementary.</p> <p id="Par89">More recently, Svidro≈àov√° and colleagues‚Äô study of 60 NGOs in Slovakia concluded that interdependency theory best explains the role the NGO sector plays in the delivery of social goods [<a href="#CR42">42</a>], including the enhancement of equity. An empirical study by Lecy and van Slyke [<a href="#CR43">43</a>] which tested Weisbrod‚Äôs <i>government failure or heterogeneity theory</i> against Salamon‚Äôs <i>interdependency theory</i> found that the NGO sector is stronger when NGOs have a robust interdependent relationship with government-funders. State-NGO interdependence requires a facilitating relationship. An important body of literature has emerged reporting on the nature of this relationship (see for examples, [<a href="#CR44">44</a>‚Äì<a href="#CR46">46</a>]), but this literature remains largely descriptive and has not yet addressed the following question: <i>given interdependence, how should the relationship be structured to ensure that the NGO sector can achieve its equity mandate?</i> Brinkerhoff [<a href="#CR47">47</a>] has argued that State-NGO relationships require a high degree of mutuality, manifested by coordination, joint decision-making and mutual accountability, and the maintenance of organizational identity. This in our view requires a policy enabling environment.</p> <p id="Par90">It is our position that, in order for healthcare systems to fully realize CHCs‚Äô equity potential, five policy conditions must be met: </p><ol> <li> <p id="Par91">System-wide recognition of the unique equity-enhancing role that CHCs play, including understanding how they complement other state-sponsored services;</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par92">Availability and use of performance indicators that map onto the needs and issues most salient to local populations to ensure accountability for the use of public funds;</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par93">Resourcing to support innovation and responsiveness to community needs, to capitalize on CHCs‚Äô agility;</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par94">Feedback pathways to ensure a system-wide understanding of emerging needs; and</p> </li> <li> <p id="Par95">System uptake of appropriate models of care for specific populations.</p> </li> </ol> <p /> <p id="Par96">We recognize some obvious limitations to our study. We studied 4 CHCs operating it the Canadian context. Although we are aware of the generalizability of our findings to other settings (elsewhere in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Colombia, and to a lesser extent, Niger), we cannot claim generalizability across the full diversity of CHCs. We recognize that a key feature discussed in this paper is the role of the government-funder which shapes accountabilities of the CHCs. Arguably, CHCs funded through philanthropic means, by their membership, faith-based organizations or other means will face different power relations with their funders, and different forms of accountabilities. Still, we believe that CHCs operating in LMIC, which are less likely to be government-funded and therefore closely regulated, are likely be undermine by a lack of system-wide recognition, are vulnerable if unable to track their performance in the delivery of social goods, require adequate funding to deliver on their mandate, can play an invaluable role in providing up to date information to government on emerging issues, and are fertile ground for the development of innovations that might benefit other providers. We however recognize that these propositions are at this point speculative, and require testing in LMIC.</p> </div> </div> <div class="conclusion" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusion</div> <p id="Par97">The NGO sector, including the CHCs that we studied, has been shown effective at addressing inequities through innovation [<a href="#CR48">48</a>]. CHCs are an integral part of health systems design, and require a policy enabling environment to achieve their equity potential. To date, in the Canadian context, the federal and provincial governments have promoted the CHC model as key to addressing the healthcare and social care needs of vulnerable populations, and of those poorly served by other service providers, but have not provided adequate mechanisms to support CHCs in achieving this mandate.</p> <p id="Par98">The situation is not unique to Canada. We and others have document have similar issues in other contexts (Australia, New Zealand, Colombia). We believe that although there may be some nuances, this is also the case in many other HICs and LMIC. We believe that CHCs have an invaluable goal in the pursuit of equity, and in the pursuit of some if not all Millennium Development Goals [<a href="#CR49">49</a>].<a href="#Fn3">3</a> Their role must however be supported by policy. A supportive policy environment has yet to emerge. The recommendations we offer are a starting point governments and funders can use to develop a more supportive policy environment for CHCs, in the pursuit of health equity.</p> <p id="Par100">More research is however needed to develop better typologies of CHCs across HICs and LMICs. Further, additional work is required to refine our recommendations to ensure a good fit with this complex context.</p> </div> </div> <div class="back" title="back"> <div class="glossary" title="glossary"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
