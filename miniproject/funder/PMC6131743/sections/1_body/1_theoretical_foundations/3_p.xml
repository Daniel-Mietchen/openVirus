<p id="Par27">The theories discussed above tend to position the state as in conflict with the NGO sector. In contrast, the 
 <italic>interdependence theory</italic> suggests that conflict coexists with interdependence and partnership [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. For example, the NGO sector can be mobilized more readily than government, and can secure political support to ensure that government engagement occurs in areas of public interest. Salamon and Anheier further argue that, along with government and market failure, “NGO failure” also exists in that NGOs depend, to a greater or lesser degree, on government funding for their existence. Finally, they articulate a 
 <italic>social origins theory</italic> that recognizes that NGOs do not “float freely in social space” ([
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], p. 18.) but are rather products of, and embedded in, social and economic structures.
