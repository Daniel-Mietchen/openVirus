 <italic>supply-side theory</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] suggests demand alone is not sufficient, and that social entrepreneurs must exist in order for NGOs to emerge. James argues that this is particularly true in areas where religious competition exists, resulting in religious-based NGOs organizing for the delivery of public goods as a mechanism to attract adherents. The surplus delivery capacity that exists in many urban centres can also explain the proliferation of NGOs providing social goods to underserved populations. In their discussion of 
 <italic>welfare state theory</italic>, Salamon and Anheier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] suggest that the literature treats the NGO sector as a residue from imperfectly developed welfare states. Thus, it is assumed that greater involvement of the state in social welfare services leads to a smaller NGO sector. Finally, Valentinov [

 <italic>rurality theory</italic>, arguing that NGOs emerge in rural settings to bridge inequities in services experienced in those areas.
