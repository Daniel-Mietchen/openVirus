<p id="Par89">More recently, Svidroňová and colleagues’ study of 60 NGOs in Slovakia concluded that interdependency theory best explains the role the NGO sector plays in the delivery of social goods [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] which tested Weisbrod’s 
 <italic>government failure or heterogeneity theory</italic> against Salamon’s 
 <italic>interdependency theory</italic> found that the NGO sector is stronger when NGOs have a robust interdependent relationship with government-funders. State-NGO interdependence requires a facilitating relationship. An important body of literature has emerged reporting on the nature of this relationship (see for examples, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]), but this literature remains largely descriptive and has not yet addressed the following question: 
 <italic>given interdependence, how should the relationship be structured to ensure that the NGO sector can achieve its equity mandate?</italic> Brinkerhoff [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] has argued that State-NGO relationships require a high degree of mutuality, manifested by coordination, joint decision-making and mutual accountability, and the maintenance of organizational identity. This in our view requires a policy enabling environment.
