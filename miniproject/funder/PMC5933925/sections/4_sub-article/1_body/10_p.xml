<p>The comment seems to suggest that the data presented in Figure 2â€”figure supplement 1A and elsewhere were based on only one of two samples processed in duplicate. The data are from serial samples (on the same day separated by time) in which variants were ascertained based on duplicate RT-PCR and sequencing libraries for each of the two samples.</p>
