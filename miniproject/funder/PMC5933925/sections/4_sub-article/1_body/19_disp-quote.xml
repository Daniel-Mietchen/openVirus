 <p>Reviewer #2:</p>
 <p>In this manuscript, McCrone and coauthors use deep sequencing data from a prospective community-based cohort study to estimate the transmission bottleneck size for seasonal influenza viruses H1N1 and H3N2, as well as the effective population size of the viral population within acutely infected individuals. In contrast to the only other dataset used in quantifying transmission bottleneck sizes for influenza circulating in natural human populations (Poon et al.), they find evidence for a remarkably small bottleneck size of 1-2 influenza virions using two distinct methods. Further, they estimate small within-host effective population sizes of 30-40 virions using a number of different methods. With both small transmission bottleneck sizes and small within-host population sizes, they conclude that genetic drift and stochastic processes are important factors influencing influenza virus dynamics. Finally, they do find some evidence for purifying selection going on within infected hosts, given observed patterns of nonsynonymous versus synonymous nucleotide variation.</p>
 <p>In general, this manuscript is very clearly written, is very thorough in applying different methods to arrive at robust conclusions and presents interesting results. One concern is of course the disparity between the results this manuscript presents for transmission bottleneck sizes in flu (1-2 virions) relative to the previous literature estimate of 100-200 virions, based on the data presented in Poon et al. It is clear from the variant frequency plot shown in Figure 3C that these differences in estimated bottleneck sizes are based on differences present in the data themselves, rather than the specifics of the methods applied to the data.</p>
 <p>I have several concerns, but none that are sufficiently major to keep this paper from being considered for publication in eLife.</p>
 <p>If the within-host effective population size is very small (~35 virions), then it seems to me that the timing of transmission should matter for determining the transmission bottleneck size. Have you looked to see how much the estimates differ from one another based on whether the first or second sampling timepoint in a donor was used? (The data might not be available to conduct this analysisâ€¦)</p>
