 <p>A more systematic investigation of whether antigenic sites tend to segregate within individuals seems possible and important. Why not compare distributions of variant frequencies at sites with global variation in the respective season with those that are globally monomorphic? Similar comparisons could be done for epitope vs non-epitope, or syn vs non-syn.</p>
