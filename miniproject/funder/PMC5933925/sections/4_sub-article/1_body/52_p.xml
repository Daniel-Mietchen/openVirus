<p>In addressing this comment and those above, we noticed a “bug” in our code for plotting the β-binomial model in Figure 4E (now Figure 3E). The estimates and model fit as reported in the text were correct, but the plot was not. We have replaced this panel with the correct plot and apologize for our error. Consistent with the similarities in the results obtained through the presence-absence and β-binomial models, this plot is quite similar, but not identical to the one in Figure 3D.</p>
