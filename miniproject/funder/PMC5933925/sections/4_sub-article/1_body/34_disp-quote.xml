 <p>This paper is a resubmission of a previously rejected version and was reviewed by the same reviewers. All reviewers agreed (as before) that the results on the transmission bottleneck are important, but two major concerns remain.</p>
 <p>1) Limited power to characterize within-host selection. Since most infections seem to be dominated by a single founder virus, the power to detect within-host selection during a few days of observation is very low. Selection would need to amplify a novel beneficial variant (produced at rates of about 1e-5 per day) to above 1% within 3-4 days in order to be detected in this study. Given the difficulty to call variants below 2%, even strong positive selection (s~10%) remains undetectable. Despite this lack of power, the authors make strong claims about the absence of positive selection and often make semi-quantitative statements without a proper comparison to an expectation.</p>
