<p>There is no consensus on the right way to analyze a bottleneck. We performed both, not because we pursued a “democratic vote,” but as a way to ensure that our estimates are robust to the assumptions of each model. We are aware of issues regarding presence absence vs. β binomial. The presence-absence model actually provided a marginally better fit for our data. We suspect that if we didn’t present the β binomial, a reviewer would ask that we analyze our data under that model (given the time between transmission and sampling).</p>
