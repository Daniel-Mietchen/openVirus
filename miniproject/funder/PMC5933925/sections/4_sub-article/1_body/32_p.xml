<p>The reviewer is correct, and this is a challenging aspect of studies in natural infections with acute respiratory viruses. The standard deviation in variant frequency is indeed from a benchmarking experiment with in vitro material. However, given that viruses were diluted at set frequencies in media similar to the universal transport media used in clinical specimens and at genome equivalents similar to the range used in the study, we think that this provides a reasonable estimate of error. We struggle to come up with a better experiment that would provide some sort of estimate of precision given the lack of an in vivo “gold standard” for comparison. We acknowledge that there could certainly be spatial stratification as the reviewer suggests. However, as above, we note that Figure 2—figure supplement 1 shows that replicate same-day samples from 6 individuals separated by hours – one nasal and one nasal/throat – were well correlated with respect to iSNV type and frequency. For comparison, the excellent work of Lakdawala et al., cited by the reviewer reports spatial differences in allele frequencies for 3 ferrets who were experimentally infected.</p>
