 <p>Reviewer #3:</p>
 <p>This work presents an interesting dataset collected from a household study of human influenza infection. Via a mathematical analysis, two key claims about the data are presented here. Firstly, the within-host effective population size, Ne, is relatively low, at 30-70. Secondly the transmission bottleneck is tight, with 1-2 viruses typically founding an infection.</p>
 <p>There is an odd repetition to the manuscript, in so far as multiple techniques are applied to get each value of N. In so far as a method of analysis is correct, recalculation of the same sum using an alternative approach is unnecessary. In so far as a method has limitations, repeating a calculation using another method, which shares the same limitations, adds no further useful information to the manuscript. Quantitative accuracy is not achieved via a democratic vote among statistical methods.</p>
 <p>The analysis of the transmission bottleneck is convincing, though susceptible to criticism under the point above. Given that the presence-absence model underestimates the size of a bottleneck, and the conclusion that the bottleneck is small, why not just use the Î²-binomial model? For myself, under the assumption that the identification of transmission pairs is correct, Figure 3C is clear evidence of a tight bottleneck.</p>
