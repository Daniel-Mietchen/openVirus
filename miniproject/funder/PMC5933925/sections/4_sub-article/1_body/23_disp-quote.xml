 <p>Subsection “The mutation rate of influenza A virus within human hosts”: here, you estimate a mutation rate on the order of 3-4 x 10^-5 mutations per site per replication cycle, which corresponds to ~0.35 mutations/genome/replication cycle. You also mention that this is close to your own recently published estimate (Pauly et al., 2017). However, that paper estimated a mutation rate on the order of 1.8 x 10^-4 (H1N1) and 2.5 x 10^-4, resulting in 2-3 mutations/genome per replication cycle. Since that Pauly et al., paper's primary point was to revise the 2.7 x 10^-6 – 3.0 x 10^-5 previous estimates, it would be nice to explicitly state the discrepancy of the Pauly et al., estimate with the estimate obtained in this paper (since they differ by an order of magnitude).</p>
