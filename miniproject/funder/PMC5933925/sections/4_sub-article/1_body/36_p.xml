<p>In response to the suggestions from these same reviewers from the previously rejected manuscript, we included additional analyses to look for evidence of selection with the suggested null models. First, we compared the number of HA variants in antigenic and non-antigenic sites (the former being more likely to be subject to positive selection) and found that our data were consistent with the null expectation of no difference (Figure 2B). Second, we asked whether any of the antigenic variants identified as minority SNV in our study were subsequently observed globally, as this would support the idea that they were “on the way up” due to positive selection. We found that this did not appear to be the case (Figure 2C). Finally, with the additional data presented now regarding the accuracy of our frequency measurements (see below), we can state more strongly that the data in Figure 2E regarding the dynamics of iSNV within hosts show evidence for considerable stochasticity. Here, the null expectation is that synonymous variants will show similar dynamics as antigenic variants (the latter being most likely to be affected by positive selection). We note that the number of variants detectable at &gt;2% is roughly consistent with a neutral model based on influenza’s known mutation rate and generation time (see for example Box and figures in Xue et al., 2018.</p>
