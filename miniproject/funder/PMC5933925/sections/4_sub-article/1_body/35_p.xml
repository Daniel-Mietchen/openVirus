<p>We agree with this critique and recognizing that “absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,” we were careful in our manuscript to indicate that while positive selection is an inefficient driver over the course of an acute infection, it is definitely not absent. We concede that due to well-known issues in variant calling in NGS data, we only really make our arguments based on variants present at greater than 2% frequency and that this imposes a limit on what we can say about positive selection in an acute infection.</p>
