<p>We have now provided a Supplementary file 3 that shows the ages and dates of sampling of donor and recipient, bottleneck size, viral subtype, and vaccination status for each transmission pair. We have also generated a shiny app with a link provided (subsection “Identification of forty-three transmission pairs”) so that interested readers can look at the sequence variants observed in each donor and recipient pair.</p>
