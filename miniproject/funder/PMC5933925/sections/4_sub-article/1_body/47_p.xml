<p>We appreciate these suggestions and have provided the requested analyses. We have added a 1:1 line to Figure 2—figure supplement 1A. There are several variants that were identified above the 2% cutoff in one sample but not the other. Together with the missing 1:1 line, this gave the appearance of a systematic bias in frequency measurement. As suggested, we have supplied a new Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, which shows iSNV frequency measurements across all duplicate samples stratified by viral load. Note that samples above 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies per microliter were not processed in duplicate and those with fewer than 10
 <sup>3</sup> copies per microliter were not used. This figure shows that our sequencing method accurately measures iSNV frequency. Finally, we have supplied a new Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, which compares the measurement error in frequency measurement (from duplicate RT-PCR and sequencing libraries) to the observed frequency differences in the serial biological samples. The impact of measurement error is minor. Together, these data strengthen our case regarding the biological significance of the changes in frequency in serial samples. They establish the bounds of what can reasonably be explained by stochastic and selective forces within hosts.
