<p>Discussion section “We have deeply sequenced 332 intrahost populations from 283 individuals collected over more than 11,000 person-seasons of observation and only identified a handful of minority antigenic variants with limited evidence for positive selection (this work and (Debbink et al., 2017)). Importantly, our data suggest that even if selection acts below our level of detection, such rare variants are unlikely to transmit. Given the size of the estimated bottleneck, the probability of transmission is approximately 1.7% for a variant at 1% frequency and 3.3% for a variant at 2% frequency. However, with several million infected individuals each year, even inefficient processes and rare events at the scale of individual hosts are likely to occur at a reasonable frequency on a global scale.”</p>
