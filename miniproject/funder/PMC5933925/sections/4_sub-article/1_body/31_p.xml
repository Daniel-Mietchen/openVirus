 <italic>There are other factors which might limit the correct inference of a high Ne. For example, while the existence of variant allele frequencies is well-validated, the precision with which an allele frequency can be measured is less clear. A standard deviation in a variant frequency is cited from a previous paper (subsection “Discrete Wright-Fisher estimation of 𝑁𝑒”), albeit this was measured from</italic> in vitro 
 <italic>material. Other authors (Lakdawala et al., 2015) have highlighted the potential for non-trivial population structure within a host. Here, while one sample was collected via nasal swab, the second was collected from a mix of nasal swab and throat samples; this could conceivably introduce a greater variance into the allele frequencies.</italic>
