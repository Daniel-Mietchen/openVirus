<p>If we understand the comment correctly, the reviewer suggests that mutations that increase in frequency within a host have a competitive advantage during transmission, such that a minority variant could be selectively transmitted. This would seem to assume (i) that variants increase in frequency in a host due to positive selection, (ii) that transmission is a selective process as well, (iii) that the same factors are selected within hosts and between hosts. This is a reasonable model, but not well supported by our data. Nevertheless, we have toned down the statement a bit given the uncertainty, and also given that we may misunderstand the comment as stated here. The Introduction now reads. “Their potential for subsequent spread through host populations is heavily dependent on the size of the transmission bottleneck (Alizon et al., 2011; Zwart and Elena, 2015).”</p>
