 <p>The analysis of within-host effective population size is problematic. The initial analysis of Ne assumes that selection does not act upon the viral populations, calculating the parameter on the basis of a model of genetic drift alone. This is fine in establishing a lower bound for Ne but cannot support a conclusion that Ne is small. Here, while much care is taken in evaluating both diffusion and Wright-Fisher models, and evaluating the potential power of the calculation, the issues addressed are relatively trifling in the context of the assumption of neutrality. The final result is to conclude that Ne is small, and therefore selection has little influence, all under the assumption that selection can be neglected.</p>
