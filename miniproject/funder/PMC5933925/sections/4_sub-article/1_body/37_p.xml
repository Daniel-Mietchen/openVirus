<p>In sum, we have performed several distinct analyses to identify evidence for positive selection in acute influenza infections, each with a reasonable null model. From these, we concluded that while positive selection clearly happens within hosts, it is not sufficiently strong to frequently drive new variants to fixation or even to levels where they are likely to be transmitted (our data would estimate that the probability of transmission is approximately 1.7% for a variant at 1% frequency and 3.3% for a variant at 2% frequency in both presence-absence and Î²-binomial models). Defining the limits of positive selection vis a vis drift at the level of individual hosts is an important aspect of our work, as three recent reviews on influenza evolution offer differing views on this question. (see Johnson et al., 2017; Petrova and Russell, 2017; Xue et al., 2018).</p>
