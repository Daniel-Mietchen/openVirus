<p>As described in the Materials and methods section of the original submission, “To control for PCR errors in samples with lower input titers, all isolates with titers between 10
 <sup>3</sup> and 10
 <sup>5</sup> genomes/μl were processed and sequenced in duplicate. Only iSNV that were found in both replicates were included in downstream analysis. The frequency of the variant in the replicate with higher coverage at the iSNV location was assigned as the frequency of the iSNV. Finally, any SNV with a frequency below 2% was discarded.”
