<p>The issue of sampling in a community-based cohort with an acute respiratory viral infection is indeed a challenging one. We note that we provided data in Figure 2â€”figure supplement 1A of the original manuscript that showed reproducibility of sequence data from two distinct same day samples (one self-collected at home and one collected at the clinic) from six individuals. The reviewer is correct that this does not completely exclude the potential issues of sampling. We have therefore removed the figure and discussion of individual selection coefficients.</p>
