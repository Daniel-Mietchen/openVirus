<p>For samples with two within host samples (2014-2015 season only), we used the time point closest to the time of transmission, as determined by date of onset of symptoms in the recipient. We assume that using this sample would provide a better representation of the diversity in the donor at the time of transmission. As above, we have provided the requested information as part of a shiny app with a link (subsection “Identification of forty-three transmission pairs”) that allows one to examine the variants for each pair across samples.</p>
