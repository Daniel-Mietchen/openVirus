<p>Therefore, for each sample (nasal/throat swab in 1ml transport media), we performed a single RNA prep. The RNA genome copy number was determined by RT-qPCR. The vast majority of samples had copy numbers between 10
 <sup>3</sup> and 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies per microliter and were then processed for duplicate multiplex RTPCR reactions and then duplicate Illumina sequencing libraries. We only called iSNV that were present in both replicates subject to our variant calling criteria. We have documented the sensitivity and specificity of this approach in McCrone and Lauring, 2016, used these same criteria in Debbink et al., 2017, and report our validation again in the present manuscript. In our experience, this is well beyond what is often reported in the literature and should suffice for documentation of reliability in variant calling. All figures were based on variants identified using this approach.
