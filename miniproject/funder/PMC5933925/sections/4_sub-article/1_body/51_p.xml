<p>We have added the 95% confidence intervals (using the β binomial model) for the estimate of each transmission pair in Supplementary file 3. As expected, they are quite large because each transmission pair has so few data points. We have aggregated these confidence intervals using a log-normal distribution as suggested and weighted each transmission pair by the number of donor iSNV as performed in Sobel Leonard et al., 2017 (the same study in which the β binomial model was first implemented). The associated text now reads, “We also fit a long-tailed, discrete distribution based on the lognormal. As expected, this analysis resulted in a slightly wider distribution with a mode of 1, a 95
 <sup>th</sup> percentile of 11 and a 97.5
 <sup>th</sup> percentile of 21.” This analysis was run up to a maximum bottleneck of 1000. We have also added a curve to the bottleneck models in Figure 3 showing the probability that a variant will be transmitted given its frequency in the donor and a bottleneck of 10. This gives an indication of the fit of our aggregate bottleneck to the data.
