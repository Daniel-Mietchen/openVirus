 <p>Any idea why the probability to transmit a 50% variant is larger than 50%? Is this the effect of minor variants and bottlenecks&gt;1 or selective advantage of minor variants? The explanation of the shaded areas is confusing: These are distributions of the inferred probability across 1000 simulations, but not outcomes of transmission.</p>
