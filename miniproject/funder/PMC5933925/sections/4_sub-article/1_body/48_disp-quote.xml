 <p>c) Given the difficulty to characterize within host stochasticity and the absence of positive selection, the claims made in this direction need to be revisited, toned down or removed. Furthermore, we suggest changing the title. A title like "Small transmission bottlenecks and low genetic diversity in acute influenza A virus infection". We are open to suggestions here, but please make sure that the title reflects what can be concluded from your data. On larger spatio-temporal scales, influenza virus evolution is certainly not stochastic and the current title doesn't make this distinction clearly enough.</p>
