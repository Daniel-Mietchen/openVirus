<p>As above, we have toned down where appropriate. We feel that our controls in variant calling and measurement error, our analyses of antigenic variants, and our quantitative analysis of SNV dynamics in serial samples demonstrate that while present, positive selection is an inefficient driver of variant accumulation within hosts – largely due to the short time scales (as summarized by the editor above). As we wrote in the Introduction of the submitted manuscript, “Despite limited evidence for positive selection, novel mutations do arise within hosts. Their potential for subsequent spread through host populations is heavily dependent on the size of the transmission bottleneck (Alizon et al., 2011; Zwart and Elena, 2015).” Therefore, we believe the within host data are important to the field, as they allow us to put the bottleneck in context, beyond simply providing a number. The data in Figure 2E suggest that variants arising through neutral processes are just as likely to be present at frequencies above 2% and therefore transmitted. Furthermore, the small size of the bottleneck and the good fit of a neutral model of transmission provide strong evidence for stochasticity. An alternative title that might more concisely capture the impact of stochasticity without overstating its role would be, “Stochastic processes 
 <italic>constrain</italic> the within and between host evolution of influenza virus.” This title also clearly delineates the scale at which these processes are studied (individual hosts). We note that stochasticity in influenza evolution has been documented at larger scales (bigger than hosts, smaller than globally) in a paper by Nelson et al., “Stochastic processes are key determinants of short-term evolution in influenza”, 2006.
