<p>In the submitted manuscript we used the sample (home vs. clinic) that was obtained closer to the estimated time of transmission (based on onset of symptoms in the recipient). If the sample closest to the time of transmission had no minority SNV above 2%, we used the other sample (this is more conservative as we attempted to use all possible SNV data for these pairs). While we do not think that the data in Figure 2—figure supplement 1Ashow a systematic deviation, we do acknowledge that the choice of sample for these paired isolates from the 2014-2015 season entails certain assumptions about the transmission process. We have provided bottleneck estimates for all four possible combinations for which there are paired samples for each member of a pair as a source data file (Figure 3—source data 7).</p>
