<p>We have removed the diffusion models and all quantitative analysis of effective population size. We have kept the within host data (which the reviewers agreed was of high quality) and discuss it in a qualitative or semi-quantitative manner. We now describe our data as consistent with a model in which variants more frequently arise within hosts through neutral processes such as genetic drift.</p>
