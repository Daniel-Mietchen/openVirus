<p>In this manuscript, McCrone and coauthors use deep sequencing data from a prospective community-based cohort study to estimate the transmission bottleneck size for seasonal influenza viruses H1N1 and H3N2, as well as the effective population size of the viral population within acutely infected individuals. In contrast to the only other dataset used in quantifying transmission bottleneck sizes for influenza circulating in natural human populations (Poon et al.), they find evidence for a remarkably small bottleneck size of 1-2 influenza virions using two distinct methods. Further, they estimate small within-host effective population sizes of 30-40 virions using a number of different methods. With both small transmission bottleneck sizes and small within-host population sizes, they conclude that genetic drift and stochastic processes are important factors influencing influenza virus dynamics. Finally, they do find some evidence for purifying selection going on within infected hosts, given observed patterns of nonsynonymous versus synonymous nucleotide variation.</p>
