<p>McCrone et al., present influenza A virus whole genome deep sequencing data from 200 infected individuals, including 49 likely transmission pairs. The authors find little within-host genetic diversity. Furthermore, low overlap in genetic diversity between samples in a transmission pair suggests that new infections are typically dominated by one founder virus, i.e., the transmission bottleneck is very small. Since the size of the transmission bottleneck is an important determinant of influenza virus transmission and previous studies estimated a much larger bottleneck, the results reported here are an important contribution.</p>
