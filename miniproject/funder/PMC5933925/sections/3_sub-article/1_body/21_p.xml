<p>In general, this manuscript is very clearly written, is very thorough in applying different methods to arrive at robust conclusions and presents interesting results. One concern is of course the disparity between the results this manuscript presents for transmission bottleneck sizes in flu (1-2 virions) relative to the previous literature estimate of 100-200 virions, based on the data presented in Poon et al. It is clear from the variant frequency plot shown in Figure 3C that these differences in estimated bottleneck sizes are based on differences present in the data themselves, rather than the specifics of the methods applied to the data.</p>
