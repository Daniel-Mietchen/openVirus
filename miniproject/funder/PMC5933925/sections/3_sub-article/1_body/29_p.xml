<p>The analysis of the transmission bottleneck is convincing, though susceptible to criticism under the point above. Given that the presence-absence model underestimates the size of a bottleneck, and the conclusion that the bottleneck is small, why not just use the Î²-binomial model? For myself, under the assumption that the identification of transmission pairs is correct, Figure 3C is clear evidence of a tight bottleneck.</p>
