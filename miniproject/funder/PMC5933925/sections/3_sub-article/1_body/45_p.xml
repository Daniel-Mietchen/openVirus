<p>2) Confidence intervals on the transmission bottleneck size. You estimate the parameter of a Poisson distribution that is assumed to describe the distribution of bottlenecks in the population. The error bars of this estimate are remarkably tight given the small number of informative iSNVs in individual pairs. The actual distribution of bottleneck sizes in the population is certainly much broader and fitting a Poisson distribution will underestimate the confidence interval. Please include the 95% confidence intervals for the estimate of each transmission pair in Supplementary file 3. Aggregating these confidence intervals or fitting a broader distribution (say log-normal or power-law) should result in more sensible confidence intervals.</p>
