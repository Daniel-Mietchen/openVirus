<p>There is an odd repetition to the manuscript, in so far as multiple techniques are applied to get each value of N. In so far as a method of analysis is correct, recalculation of the same sum using an alternative approach is unnecessary. In so far as a method has limitations, repeating a calculation using another method, which shares the same limitations, adds no further useful information to the manuscript. Quantitative accuracy is not achieved via a democratic vote among statistical methods.</p>
