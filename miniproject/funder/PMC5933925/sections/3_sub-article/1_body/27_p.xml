<p>This work presents an interesting dataset collected from a household study of human influenza infection. Via a mathematical analysis, two key claims about the data are presented here. Firstly, the within-host effective population size, Ne, is relatively low, at 30-70. Secondly the transmission bottleneck is tight, with 1-2 viruses typically founding an infection.</p>
