<p>All reviewers agreed that you have presented comprehensive data on within-host diversity of influenza virus. The data set includes transmission pairs within households which allowed you to estimate the size of the transmission bottleneck. In sharp contrast to previous estimates, your data suggest a very small transmission bottleneck (evident in Figure 3C). This observation is important, and this conclusion is strongly supported by the data. The estimation of Ne, however, is unconvincing. The major concerns regarding the Ne estimation are summarized below -- you can find details in the attached reviews.</p>
