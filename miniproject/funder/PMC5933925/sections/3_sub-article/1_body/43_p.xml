<p>b) In subsection “Within-host populations have low genetic diversity”, you are comparing R^2 values of variant frequencies of same day samples with the fraction of minor variants recovered in later samples. But an R^2 value and the fraction recovered iSNV are not comparable. To make a convincing case that your sequencing method accurately measures iSNV frequency and that the observed frequency changes are biological we would like to see the equivalent of Figure 2—figure supplement 1A for duplicate samples, ideally stratified by viral load (in subsection “Illumina library preparation and sequencing”, you write that samples were processed in duplicate). Such a control is particularly important for the comparison of iSNV frequencies in longitudinal samples, as the samples that are being compared likely differ in viral load. Figure 2—figure supplement 1A could use a 1:1 line. It seems that iSNV frequencies are systematically lower in-home isolates than in clinic isolates for low-frequency variants.</p>
