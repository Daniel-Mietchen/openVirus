We suggest, to estimate, bottlenecks from all possible different sample-pairings of donor and recipient in those transmission pairs where either has more than one sample available. In particular the difference between self-sampling and sampling in the clinics (Figure 2â€”figure supplement 1A suggests a possible systematic deviation) should be tested and discussed.</p>
