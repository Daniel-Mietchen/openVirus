<p>McCrone et al., study genetic variation of influenza virus population within hosts and in transmission chain to estimate the stochasticity of within host evolution and the effective size of the transmission bottle neck. Virus populations are characterized by deep sequencing. The quality of the data and the analysis seem high and the conclusions seem justified and solid. I have a number of comments regarding the interpretation of the results and some parts of the analysis.</p>
