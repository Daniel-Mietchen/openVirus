<p>Subsection “Within host populations have low genetic diversity”: I really like that the within-host Ne calculation was done a number of different ways and that similar results were obtained when some of the more stringent assumptions (site independence and large population size) of the first approach were relaxed. One other assumption in all of these models, however, I think is that the viral population size is constant. Given that this is an acute infection, the viral population size is much more likely to be exponentially declining (given that individuals were sampled following symptom onset). How does an exponentially declining viral population affect your estimate of within-host Ne?</p>
