<p>While the transmission bottleneck size is a relevant and interpretable quantity, I don't think the concept of an effective population is useful for an acute within-host population. The actual population size is orders of magnitudes higher than any estimate of Ne and the variation in variant frequencies likely depends on subpopulations dynamics in the infected tissue. These are populations subject to exponential expansion and decay and there is no reason why a diffusion-based model is useful. This is evident in Figure 2B: The distribution of allele frequency changes is incompatible with a diffusion model: most alleles don't change much in frequency, while others change by 0.4. The removal of the most extremely changing iSNVs partly addresses this issue, but also shows that there is a substantial dependence on this cut-off. The distribution of variant frequency changes is interesting in its own right, but there is probably not enough data to investigate this here. But even taking the estimate of Ne at face value, how is sampling noise handled in the Ne estimates? And why is the 0.02 cutoff a good idea for the later sample? Once a iSNV is ascertained in the earlier sample, you should use the raw variant frequency in the diffusion model.</p>
