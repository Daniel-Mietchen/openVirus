<p>If the within-host effective population size is very small (~35 virions), then it seems to me that the timing of transmission should matter for determining the transmission bottleneck size. Have you looked to see how much the estimates differ from one another based on whether the first or second sampling timepoint in a donor was used? (The data might not be available to conduct this analysisâ€¦)</p>
