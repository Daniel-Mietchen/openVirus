<p>1) The signal to estimate Ne is weak. The distribution of iSNV frequency changes as day 3 is hardly different from that at day 1. Furthermore, the distribution of variant frequency changes is long-tailed, which conflicts the assumptions of the Wright-Fisher model. While you correct for false negatives and allow for a constant variance in observed frequency, estimates might still be affected by extraction and amplification noise (particularly important for the second time point with typically lower viral load). At best, your estimate of Ne is a loose lower bound.</p>
