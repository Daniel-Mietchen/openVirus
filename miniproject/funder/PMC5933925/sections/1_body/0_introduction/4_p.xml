<p>Here, we use next generation sequencing of within-host influenza virus populations to define the evolutionary dynamics of IAV within and between human hosts. We apply a benchmarked analysis pipeline to identify iSNV and to characterize the genetic diversity of H3N2 and H1N1 populations collected over five post-pandemic seasons from individuals enrolled in a prospective household study of influenza. We find that intrahost populations are dynamic and constrained by genetic drift and purifying selection. In our study, positive selection rarely amplifies a beneficial de novo variant to a frequency greater than 2%. Contrary to what has been previously reported for human influenza transmission (

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Zwart and Elena, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">McCrone and Lauring, 2018</xref>), we identify a very tight effective transmission bottleneck that limits the transmission of low-frequency variants.
