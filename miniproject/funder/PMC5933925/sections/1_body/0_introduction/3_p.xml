<p>Despite limited evidence for positive selection, novel mutations do arise within hosts and some will clearly be positively selected. Their potential for subsequent spread through host populations is heavily dependent on the size of the transmission bottleneck (

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Zwart and Elena, 2015</xref>). If the transmission bottleneck is sufficiently wide, low frequency variants can plausibly be transmitted and spread efficiently through host populations (

 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Varble et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Wilker et al., 2013</xref>), studies of equine influenza support a bottleneck wide enough to allow transmission of rare iSNV (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Murcia et al., 2010</xref>). The only available genetic study of influenza virus transmission in humans estimated a remarkably large transmission bottleneck, allowing for transmission of 100â€“200 genomes (
