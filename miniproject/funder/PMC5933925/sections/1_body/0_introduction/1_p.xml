<p>The rapid evolution of influenza viruses has led to reduced vaccine efficacy and the continuing emergence of novel strains. Broadly speaking, evolution is the product of deterministic processes, such as selection, and stochastic processes, such as genetic drift and migration (
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kouyos et al., 2006</xref>). The global evolution of influenza A virus (IAV) is dominated by the positive selection of novel antigenic variants that subsequently seed annual epidemics in the Northern and Southern hemisphere (
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Rambaut et al., 2008</xref>). These global patterns are contrasted by results from whole genome sequencing of viruses on more local scales, which suggest the importance of stochastic processes such as strain migration and within-clade reassortment (
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2006</xref>). While it is clear that influenzaâ€™s evolutionary dynamics differ across scales (

 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, 2009</xref>), the relative roles of deterministic and stochastic forces in viral evolution within and between acutely infected individuals remain unclear.
