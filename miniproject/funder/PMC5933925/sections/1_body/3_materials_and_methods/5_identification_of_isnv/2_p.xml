<p>Given the diversity of the circulating strain in a given season, there were a number of cases in which isolates contained mutations that were essentially fixed (&gt;95%) relative to the plasmid control. Often in these cases, the minor allele in the sample matched the major allele in the plasmid control. We were, therefore, unable to use DeepSNV in estimating the base specific error rate at this site for these minor alleles and required an alternative means of discriminating true and false minority iSNV. To this end we applied stringent quality thresholds to these putative iSNV and implemented a 2% frequency threshold. In order to ensure we were not introducing a large number of false positive iSNV into our analysis, we performed the following experiment. Perth (H3N2) samples were sequenced on the same flow cell as both the Perth and Victoria (H3N2) plasmid controls. Minority iSNV were identified using both plasmid controls. This allowed us to identify rare iSNV at positions in which the plasmid controls differed both with and without the error rates provided by DeepSNV. We found that at a frequency threshold of 2% the methods were nearly identical (NPV of 1, and PPV of 0.94 compared to DeepSNV).</p>
