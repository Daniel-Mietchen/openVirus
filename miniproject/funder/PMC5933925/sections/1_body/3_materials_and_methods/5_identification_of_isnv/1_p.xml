<p>Intrahost single nucleotide variants were identified in samples that had greater than 10
 <sup>3</sup> genomes/μl and an average coverage &gt;1000 x across the genome. Variants were identified using DeepSNV and scripts available at

Briefly, reads were aligned to the reference sequence (H3N2 2010–2011 and 2011–2012: GenBank CY121496-503, H3N2 2012–2013:GenBank KJ942680-8, H3N2 2014–2015: Genbank CY207731-8, H1N1 GenBank: CY121680-8) using Bowtie2 (35). Duplicate reads were then marked and removed using Picard (

We identified putative iSNV using DeepSNV. Bases with phred &lt;30 were masked. Minority iSNV (frequency &lt;50%) were then filtered for quality using our empirically determined quality thresholds (p-value&lt;0.01 DeepSNV, average mapping quality &gt;30, average Phred &gt; 35, average read position between 31 and 94). To control for RT-PCR errors in samples with lower input titers, all isolates with titers between 10
 <sup>3</sup> and 10
 <sup>5</sup> genomes/μl were processed and sequenced in duplicate. Only iSNV that were found in both replicates were included in down stream analysis. The frequency of the variant in the replicate with higher coverage at the iSNV location was assigned as the frequency of the iSNV. Finally, any SNV with a frequency below 2% was discarded.
