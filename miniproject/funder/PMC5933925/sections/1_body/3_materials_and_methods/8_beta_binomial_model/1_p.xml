<p>The Beta binomial model is explained in detail in Leonard 
 <italic>et al.</italic> (Sobel Leonard et al. 2017). It is similar to the presence/absence model in that transmission is modeled as a simple sampling process; however, it relaxes the following assumptions. In this model, the frequencies of transmitted variants are allowed to change between transmission and sampling according a beta distribution. The distribution is not dependent on the amount of time that passes between transmission and sampling, but rather depends on the size of the founding population (here assumed to equal to
