<p>The equations below are very similar to those presented by Leonard 
 <italic>et al.</italic> with one exception. Because we know the sensitivity of our method to detect rare variants based on the expected frequency and the titer, we can include the possibility that iSNV are transmitted but are missed due to poor sensitivity. Because the beta binomial model is aware of the frequency of the iSNV in the recipient, no information is added by tracking both alleles at a genomic site
