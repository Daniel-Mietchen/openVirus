<p>In this model, there are three possible mechanisms for a donor iSNV to not be detected in the recipient. (i) The variant was not transmitted. (ii) The variant was transmitted but is present below our limit of detection (2%). (iii) The variant was transmitted and isÂ present above our limit of detection but represents a false negative in iSNV identification.</p>
