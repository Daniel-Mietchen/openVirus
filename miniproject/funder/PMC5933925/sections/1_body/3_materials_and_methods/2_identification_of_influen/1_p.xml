<p>Respiratory specimens were processed daily to determine laboratory-confirmed influenza infection. Viral RNA was extracted (Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, Germantown, MD) and tested by RT-PCR for universal detection of influenza A and B. Samples with positive results by the universal assay were then subtyped to determine A(H3N2), A(H1N1), A(pH1N1) subtypes and B(Yamagata) and B(Victoria) lineages. We used primers, probes and amplification parameters developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Influenza Division for use on the ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System platform. An RNAseP detection step was run for each specimen to confirm specimen quality and successful RNA extraction.</p>
