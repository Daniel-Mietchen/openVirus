<p>We model transmission as a simple binomial sampling process (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sobel Leonard et al., 2017</xref>). In our first model, we assume any transmitted iSNV, no matter the frequency, will be detected in the recipient. In the second, we relax this assumption and account for false negative iSNV in the recipient. To include the variance in the transmission bottlenecks between pairs we use maximum likelihood optimization to fit the average bottleneck size assuming the distribution follows a zero-truncated Poisson distribution.
