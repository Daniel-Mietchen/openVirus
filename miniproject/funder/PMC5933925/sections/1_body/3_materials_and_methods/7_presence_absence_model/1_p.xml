<p>The presence/absence model makes several assumptions. We assume perfect detection of all transmitted iSNV in the recipient. For each donor iSNV, we measure only whether or not the variant is present in the recipient. Any iSNV that is not found in the recipient is assumed to have not been transmitted. We also assume the probability of transmission is determined only by the frequency of the iSNV in the donor at the time of sampling (regardless of how much time passes between sampling and transmission). The probability of transmission is simply the probability that the iSNV is included at least once in a sample size equal to the bottleneck. Finally, we assume all genomic sites are independent of one another. For this reason, we discarded the one case where the donor was likely infected by two strains, as the iSNV were certainly linked.</p>
