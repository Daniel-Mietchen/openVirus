<p>We amplified cDNA corresponding to all eight genomic segments from 5 μl of viral RNA using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR Platinum Taq HiFi Kit (Invitrogen 12574). Reactions consisted of 0.5 μl Superscript III Platinum Taq Mix, 12.5 μl 2x reaction buffer, 6 μl DEPC water, and 0.2 μl of 10 μM Uni12/Inf1, 0.3 μl of 10 μM Uni12/Inf3, and 0.5 μl of 10 μM Uni13/Inf1 universal influenza A primers (

The thermocycler protocol was: 42 ˚C for 60 min then 94 ˚C for 2 min then 5 cycles of 94 ˚C for 30 s, 44 ˚C for 30 s, 68 ˚C for 3 min, then 28 cycles of 94 ˚C for 30 s, 57 ˚C for 30 s, 68 ˚C for 3 min. Amplification of all eight segments was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, and 750 ng of each cDNA mixture were sheared to an average size of 300 to 400 bp using a Covaris (Woburn, MA) S220 focused ultrasonicator. Sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra DNA library prep kit (NEB E7370L), Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter A63881, Indianapolis, IN), and NEBNext multiplex oligonucleotides for Illumina (NEB E7600S, Ipswich, MA). The final concentration of each barcoded library was determined by Quanti PicoGreen dsDNA quantification (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and equal nanomolar concentrations were pooled. Residual primer dimers were removed by gel isolation of a 300–500 bp band, which was purified using a GeneJet Gel Extraction Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). Purified library pools were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 with 2 × 125 nucleotide paired end reads. All raw sequence data have been deposited at the NCBI sequence read archive (BioProject Accession number: PRJNA412631). PCR amplicons derived from an equimolar mixture of eight clonal plasmids, each containing a genomic segment of the circulating strain were processed in similar fashion and sequenced on the same HiSeq flow cell as the appropriate patient derived samples. These clonally derived samples served as internal controls to improve the accuracy of variant identification and control for batch effects that confound sequencing experiments.
