 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Petrie et al., 2013</xref>), established at the UM School of Public Health in 2010, enrolled and followed households of at least three individuals with at least two children &lt; 18 years of age; households were then followed prospectively throughout the year for ascertainment of acute respiratory illnesses. Study participants were queried weekly about the onset of illnesses meeting our standard case definition (two or more of: cough, fever/feverishness, nasal congestion, sore throat, body aches, chills, headache if ≥3 years old; cough, fever/feverishness, nasal congestion/runny nose, trouble breathing, fussiness/irritability, decreased appetite, fatigue in &lt;3 years old), and the symptomatic participants then attended a study visit at the research clinic on site at UM School of Public Health for sample collection. For the 2010–2011 through 2013–2014 seasons, a combined nasal and throat swab (or nasal swab only in children &lt; 3 years of age) was collected at the onsite research clinic by the study team. Beginning with the 2014–2015 seasons, respiratory samples were collected at two time points in each participant meeting the case definition; the first collection was a self- or parent-collected nasal swab collected at illness onset. Subsequently, a combined nasal and throat swab (or nasal swab only in children &lt; 3 years of age) was collected at the onsite research clinic by the study team. Families with very young children (&lt;3 years of age) were followed using home visits by a trained medical assistant.
