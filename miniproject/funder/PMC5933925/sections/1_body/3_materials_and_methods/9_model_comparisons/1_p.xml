<p>In order evaluate the fits of the two transmission models, we calculated the probability of detecting a donor iSNV in the recipient given its frequency in the donor. For each model this reduces to one minus the probability of only detecting the other allele in the recipient summed over all possible bottlenecks. As in fitting the models this infinite sum was approximated by a partial sum up to a bottleneck size of 100. We used a recipient titer of 10
 <sup>4</sup> genomes/Î¼l to estimate the effect of sequencing sensitivity for the beta binomial model.
