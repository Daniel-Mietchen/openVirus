<p>We next examined the changes in within-host virus diversity over time in 49 individuals who provided paired longitudinal samples during the 2014/2015 season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We found that there was very little change in iSNV frequency in populations sampled twice on the same day (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.982, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and the concordance of same day samples suggests that our sampling procedure is reproducible. An analysis of sequence data from replicate libraries indicates that our estimates of iSNV frequency are precise (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In samples separated by at least a day, only 57% iSNV found in the first sample persisted in the second, above the 2% limit of detection. Additionally, the majority of iSNV (68%) found in the second sample were either new or previously present below the 2% limit of detection. Taken together, these data suggest that the population present in the upper respiratory tract is highly dynamic while maintaining a stable consensus. Of note, 6 iSNV in our longitudinal data set lay within antigenic epitopes (arrows in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Their dynamics are similar to those of other nonsynonymous iSNV and synonymous iSNV, suggesting that most mutations change in frequency due to stochastic as opposed to selective processes. Together with our prior work (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Debbink et al., 2017</xref>), these data suggest that the positive selection of novel variants within hosts is inefficient and rarely amplifies a newly generated variant to a frequency greater than 2%.
