<p>Over five seasons and nearly 6290 person-seasons of observation, we identified 77 cases of influenza A/H1N1pdm09 infection and 313 cases of influenza A/H3N2 infection (
 <xref rid="table1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Approximately half of the cases (n = 166) were identified in the 2014–2015 season, in which there was an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains (

Individuals within a household were considered an epidemiologically linked transmission pair if they were both positive for the same subtype of influenza virus within 7 days of each other. Several households had 3 or four symptomatic cases within this one-week window, suggestive of longer chains of transmission (
