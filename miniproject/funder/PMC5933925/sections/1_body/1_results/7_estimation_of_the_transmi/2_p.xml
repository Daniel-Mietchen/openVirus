<p>Because the presence-absence model can underestimate the transmission bottleneck in some circumstances (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sobel Leonard et al., 2017</xref>), we also applied a beta binomial model, which Leonard 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have used to account for the stochastic dynamics of transmitted variants. This model allows for a limited amount of time-independent genetic drift within the recipient (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Sobel Leonard et al., 2017</xref>), and we modified it to also account for our benchmarked sensitivity for rare variants (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Current Pipeline). For all donor-derived iSNV that were absent in the recipient, we estimated the likelihood that these variants were transmitted but either drifted below our level of detection or drifted below 10% and were missed by our variant identification. Despite the relaxed assumptions provided by this modified beta binomial model, maximum likelihood estimation only marginally increased the average bottleneck size (mean 1.75: lambda 1.25; 0.55â€“2.28, 95% CI) relative to the simpler presence-absence model. We also fit a long-tailed, discrete distribution based on the log-normal. As expected, this analysis resulted in a slightly wider distribution with a mode of 1, a 95
 <sup>th</sup> percentile of 11 and a 97.5th percentile of 21. Although the beta-binomial again reproduced the trend in the data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), the fit was not better than that of the presence-absence model (AIC 80.2 for beta-binomial compared to 74.5 for the presence-absence model), suggesting the stochastic loss of iSNV in the recipient is not a major contributing factor to the transmission dynamics observed here. As in the presence-absence model, there was no apparent stratification in bottleneck size based on vaccination status, donor or recipient age, or influenza A subtype (
