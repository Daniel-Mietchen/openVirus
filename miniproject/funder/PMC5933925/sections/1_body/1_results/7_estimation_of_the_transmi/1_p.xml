<p>We applied a simple presence-absence model to quantify the effective transmission bottleneck in our cohort. The presence-absence model considers only whether or not a donor allele is present or absent in the recipient sample. Under this model, transmission is a neutral, random sampling process, and the probability of transmission is simply the probability that the iSNV will be included at least once in the sample given its frequency in the donor and the sample size, or bottleneck. We estimated a distinct bottleneck for each transmission pair and assumed these bottlenecks followed a zero-truncated Poisson distribution. Maximum likelihood optimization determined that a mean bottleneck of 1.68 (lambda = 1.15; 0.49–2.14, 95% CI) best described the data. This distribution indicates that the majority of bottlenecks are 1 and that 95% of bottlenecks are expected to be ≤3. One outlier was a single transmission pair with an estimated bottleneck of &gt;200; this pair had two minority iSNV present at very low frequencies in both donor and recipient. There were no apparent differences between H3N2 and H1N1 pairs. The model fit was evaluated by comparing the probability of transmission predicted by the model with that estimated from the data using a sliding window (
