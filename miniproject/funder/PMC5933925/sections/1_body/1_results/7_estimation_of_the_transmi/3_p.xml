<p>Because our bottleneck estimates were much lower than what has previously been reported for human influenza (
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Poon et al., 2016</xref>), we investigated the impact that our simplifying assumptions could have on our results. In particular, the presence-absence model assumes perfect detection of variants in donor and recipient, and it can therefore underestimate the size of a bottleneck in the setting of donor-derived variants that are transmitted but not detected in the recipient. These ‘false negative’ variants can occur when the frequency of an iSNV drifts below the level of detection (e.g. 2% frequency) or when the sensitivity of sequencing is less than perfect for variants at that threshold (e.g. 15% sensitivity for variants at a frequency 2–5%). To determine the impact of sequencing sensitivity and specificity on our bottleneck estimates, we re-called variants using our original pipeline without the 2% frequency cut-off. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, this increases the sensitivity of iSNV detection in the 1–5% frequency range, and also the number of false positive variant calls (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">McCrone and Lauring, 2016</xref>). This analysis only slightly increased average transmission bottleneck to 2.11 (lambda = 1.75; 0.87–2.95, 95% CI), and indicates that our results are not biased by the added stringency used in the initial analysis. Interestingly, the inclusion of these low-frequency iSNV reduced model fit and led to an overestimation of the probability of transmitting rare iSNV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These low-frequency bins are likely dominated by iSNV that were not present at the time of transmission either because they are sequencing artifacts or underwent stochastic extinction in the donor prior to transmission.
