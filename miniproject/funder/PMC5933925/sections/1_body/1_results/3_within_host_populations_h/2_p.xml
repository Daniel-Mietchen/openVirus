<p>We identified intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNV) using our empirically validated analysis pipeline (

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Gerstung et al., 2012</xref>). Given the diversity of influenza viruses that circulate locally each season, there were a number of instances in which our patient-derived samples had mutations that were essentially fixed (&gt;0.95 frequency) relative to the clonal control. DeepSNV is unable to estimate an error rate for the control or reference base at these positions. We therefore performed an additional benchmarking experiment to identify a threshold for majority iSNV at which we could correctly infer whether or not the corresponding minor allele was also present (see Materials and methods). We found that we could correctly identify a minor allele at a frequency of ≥2% at such sites. We therefore report data on iSNV present at frequencies between 2% and 98%. As expected, this threshold improved the specificity of our iSNV identification and decreased our sensitivity to detect variants below 5% compared to our initial validation experiment (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">McCrone and Lauring, 2016</xref>), which did not employ a frequency threshold (
