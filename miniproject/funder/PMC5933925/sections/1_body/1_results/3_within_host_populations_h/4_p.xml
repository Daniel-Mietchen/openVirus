<p>Minority variants were rarely shared among multiple individuals. Ninety-eight percent of minority iSNV were only found once, 2.3% were found in two individuals, and no minority iSNV were found in three or more individuals. The low level of shared diversity suggests that within-host populations explore distinct regions of sequence space with little evidence for parallel evolution. Of the 12 minority iSNV that were found in multiple individuals (triangles in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), three were nonsynonymous and none were present in antigenic epitopes. The vast majority of minority variants were rare (frequency 0.02â€“0.07) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous variants was 0.75, and given the excess of nonsynonymous sites across the genome and within the HA gene, these data suggest significant purifying selection within hosts.
