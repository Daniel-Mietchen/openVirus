<p>Consistent with our previous studies of natural infections and those of others, we found that the within-host diversity of seasonal influenza A virus (IAV) populations is low (

There were six samples with greater than 10 minority iSNV. In 3 of these cases, the frequency distribution of minority iSNVs was bimodal, suggesting that the iSNV were linked and that the samples represented mixed infections. Consistent with this hypothesis, putative genomic haplotypes based on these minority iSNV clustered with distinct isolates on phylogenetic trees (
