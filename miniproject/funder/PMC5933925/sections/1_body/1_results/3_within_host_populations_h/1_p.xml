<p>We processed all specimens for viral load quantification and next generation sequencing. Viral load measurements (genome copies per µl) were used for quality control in variant calling, which we have shown is highly sensitive to input titer (

 <sup>3</sup> copies per microliter of transport media, adequate RT-PCR amplification of all eight genomic segments, and an average read coverage of &gt;10
 <sup>3</sup> across the genome (
