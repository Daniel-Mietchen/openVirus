<p>Although the full range of the H3 antigenic sites have not been functionally defined, it is estimated that 131 of the 329 amino acids in HA1 lie in or near these sites (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), mutations in antigenic epitopes were not present at significantly higher within-host frequencies than other nonsynonymous mutations in HA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Five putative antigenic variants were in positions that have been experimentally shown to differ among antigenically drifted viruses (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Wiley et al., 1981</xref>), and two (193S and 189N) lie in the ‘antigenic ridge’ that is a major contributor to antigenic drift (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Koel et al., 2013</xref>). Five of the iSNV in antigenic epitopes have been detected as minority variants above 5% at the global level since the time of isolation (62G, 128A, 193S, 262N, and 307R) with one (62G) seemingly increasing in global frequency (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). An additional within host variant (307R) has dominated the population for the past 12 years (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Neher and Bedford, 2015</xref>). We identified one putative H1N1 antigenic variant (208K in antigenic site C
 <sub>a</sub>) (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Caton et al., 1982</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). In total, putative antigenic variants account for 1.0–2.8% of minority iSNV identified and were found in 3.0–7.1% of infections. None of these iSNV were shared among multiple individuals.
