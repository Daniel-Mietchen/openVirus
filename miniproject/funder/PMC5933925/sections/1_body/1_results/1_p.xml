<p>We used next generation sequencing to characterize influenza virus populations collected from individuals enrolled in the Household Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness (HIVE) study (

These households are followed prospectively from October to April, with symptom-triggered collection of nasal and throat swab specimens for identification of respiratory viruses by RT-PCR (see Materials and methods). In contrast to case-ascertained studies, which identify households based on an index case who seeks medical care, the HIVE study identifies symptomatic individuals regardless of illness severity. In the first four seasons of the study (2010–2011 through 2013–2014), respiratory specimens were collected 0–7 days after illness onset. Beginning in the 2014–2015 season, each individual provided two samples, a self-collected specimen at the time of symptom onset and a clinic-collected specimen obtained 0–7 days later. Each year, 59–69% of individuals had self-reported or confirmed receipt of that season’s vaccine prior to local circulation of influenza virus.
