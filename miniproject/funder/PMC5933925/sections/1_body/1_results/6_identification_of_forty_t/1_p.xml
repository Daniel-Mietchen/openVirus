<p>Our within-host data suggest that newly arising iSNV with positive fitness effects are likely to be present at low frequencies (&lt;2%) during an acute infection. The maintenance of these mutations in host populations is therefore highly dependent on the transmission bottleneck. We analyzed virus populations from 85 households with concurrent infections to quantify the level of shared viral diversity and to estimate the size of the IAV transmission bottleneck (

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Petrie et al., 2017</xref>), we used stringent criteria to eliminate individuals in a household with co-incident community acquisition of distinct viruses. We considered all individuals in a household with symptom onset within a 7 day window to be epidemiologically linked. The donor in each putative pair was defined as the individual with the earlier onset of symptoms. We discarded a transmission event if there were multiple possible donors with the same day of symptom onset. Donor and recipients were not allowed to have symptom onset on the same day, unless the individuals were both index cases for the household. In these six instances, we analyzed the data for both possible donor-recipient directionalities. Based on these criteria, our cohort had 124 putative household transmission events over five seasons (
