<p>We next used sequence data to determine which of these 52 epidemiologically linked pairs represented true household transmission events as opposed to coincident community-acquired infections. We measured the genetic distance between influenza populations from each household pair by L1-norm and compared these distances to those of randomly assigned community pairs within each season (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1â€”figure supplements 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). While the L1-norm of a pair captures differences between the populations at all levels, in our cohort, it was largely driven by differences at the consensus level. We only considered individuals to be a true transmission pair if they had a genetic distance below the 5th percentile of the community distribution of randomly assigned pairs (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Among these 47 sequence-validated transmission pairs, three had no iSNV in the donor and one additional donor appeared to have a mixed infection. These four transmission events were removed from our bottleneck analysis, as donors without iSNV are uninformative and mixed infections violate model assumptions of site independence (see Materials and methods). We estimated the transmission bottleneck in the remaining 43 high-quality pairs (37 H3N2, 6 H1N1,
