<p>A transmission bottleneck restricts the amount of genetic diversity that is shared by both members of a pair. We found that few minority iSNV where polymorphic in both the donor and recipient populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Minority iSNV in the donor were either absent or fixed in the recipient (top and bottom of plot). The lack of shared polymorphic sites (which would lie in the middle of the plot in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) suggests a stringent effective bottleneck in which only one allele is passed from donor to recipient.
