<p>Contrary to previous studies, which have found signatures of adaptive evolution in infected hosts (

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Rogers et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ghedin et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sobel Leonard et al., 2016</xref>), we have found only limited evidence of positive selection during acute infection. Previous reports have relied on infections in which selective pressures are likely to be particularly strong (e.g. due to drug treatment or infection with a poorly adapted virus), or in which the virus has replicated within a host for an extended period of time (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Xue et al., 2017</xref>). Under these conditions, it is plausible that positively selected alleles reach levels of detection. We suggest that these are important and informative exceptions to dynamics defined here, in which positive selection is rarely strong enough to drive a new mutation to a frequency above 2% over the course of several days. Our findings are consistent with the observed global rates of influenza evolution and with epidemiological studies that have shown limited antigenic selection over the course of local epidemics (
