<p>Accurately modeling and predicting influenza virus evolution requires a thorough understanding of the virusâ€™ population structure. Some models have assumed a large intrahost population and a relatively loose transmission bottleneck (

In such a model, it would be possible for an emerging virus to become more transmissible or a seasonal virus to evolve resistance to vaccine-induced immunity over a short transmission chain (
