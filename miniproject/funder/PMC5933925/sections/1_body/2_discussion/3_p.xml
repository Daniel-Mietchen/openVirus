<p>We used both a simple presence-absence model and a more complex beta binomial model to estimate an extremely tight transmission bottleneck. The estimation of a small bottleneck is due to the fact that at most polymorphic sites in the donor, only one allele (iSNV) was found in the recipient. While our methods for variant calling may be more conservative than those used in similar studies, we found that relaxing our variant calling criteria only led to the inclusion of false positive variants and did not significantly inflate our estimates. Furthermore, the beta binomial model accounts for false negative iSNV (i.e. variants that are transmitted but not detected in the donor), which can lead to underestimated transmission bottlenecks (

Finally, if rare, undetected, iSNV were shared between linked individuals, we would expect to see transmission of more common iSNV (frequency 5–10%), which we can detect with high sensitivity. In our data, the transmission probability iSNVs &gt; 5% frequency in the donor were also well predicted by small bottleneck size (
