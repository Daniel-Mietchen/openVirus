<p>We characterized influenza virus dynamics in human hosts through sequencing of 249 specimens from 200 individuals collected over 6290 person-seasons of observation. In our study, we find that acute influenza infections are characterized by low diversity, limited positive selection, and tight transmission bottlenecks. Because we used viruses collected over five influenza seasons from individuals enrolled in a prospective household cohort, these dynamics are likely to be broadly representative of many seasonal influenza infections in temperate regions. Our results are further strengthened by the use of a validated sequence analysis pipeline and models that are robust to the underlying assumptions. The observed within-host dynamics and the tight effective transmission bottleneck suggest that stochastic processes, such as genetic drift, dominate influenza virus evolution at the level of individual hosts. This stands in contrast to the prominent role of positive selection in the global evolution of seasonal influenza.</p>
