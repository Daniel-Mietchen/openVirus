<p>Although the size of our transmission bottleneck is consistent with estimates obtained for other viruses and in experimental animal models of influenza (

 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Varble et al., 2014</xref>), it differs substantially from the only other study of bottlenecks in natural human infection (

 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Kugelman et al., 2017</xref>), the bottleneck size estimates are fundamentally driven by the amount of viral diversity shared among individuals in a household. Importantly, and as in Poon et al., we used both epidemiologic linkage and the genetic relatedness of viruses in households to define transmission pairs and to exclude confounding from the observed background diversity in the community. We find that household transmission pairs and randomly assigned community pairs had distinct patterns of shared consensus and minority variant diversity, a pattern that is distinct from the observations of Poon et al. An unexplained aspect of their study is that rare iSNV were frequently shared by randomly selected individuals, and more common ones were not (
