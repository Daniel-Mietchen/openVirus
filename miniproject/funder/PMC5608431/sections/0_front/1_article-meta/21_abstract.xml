 <p>Finding methods to identify important spreaders—and consequently protocols to identify individuals to vaccinate in targeted vaccination campaigns—is one of the most important topics of network theory. Earlier studies typically make some assumption about what information is available about the contact network that the disease spreads over. Then they try to optimize an objective function—either the average outbreak size in disease simulations, or (simpler) the size of the largest connected component. For public-health practitioners, gathering the network information cannot be detached from the decision process—their cost function includes the costs for both the vaccination itself and mapping of the network. This is the first paper to evaluate the cost efficiency of vaccination protocols—a problem that is much more relevant and not so much more complicated, than the oversimplified objective functions optimized in previous studies. We find a “no-free lunch” situation, where different protocols proposed in the past are most efficient at different cost scenarios. However, some methods are never cost efficient due to the amount of information they need. What protocol that is the best depends on network structure in a non-trivial way. We use both analytical and simulation techniques to reach these conclusions.</p>
