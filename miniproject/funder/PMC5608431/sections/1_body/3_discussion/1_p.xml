<p>We have discussed how to make theoretical studies of targeted vaccination more practically useful for decision makers. Instead of evaluating vaccination protocols for some scenario about what is known about the network, we evaluate methods based as a cost-benefit problem. From this starting point, we have evaluated the cost efficiency of seven network-based vaccination methods. There is not one universally best method. Rather, depending on the network structure and relative vaccination and information costs, the best method (at least for the network and parameters we explore) seem to be one of fourâ€”

 <italic>TSH</italic>, 
 <italic>CI</italic> and 
 <italic>Random walk</italic>. We make this point both by analytical calculations and simulations.
