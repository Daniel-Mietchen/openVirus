<p>In practical applications, one would in principle need to know the parameters, both for the SIR model and to calculate the cost [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] (which, in addition to the network itself, could give the contact rates), then one could assume a per-contact transmission probability of 1â€“2% [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Furthermore, the societal cost for a positive HIV case is well understood [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. With these parameters at hand, it should be possible to narrow down the protocols to one or two.
