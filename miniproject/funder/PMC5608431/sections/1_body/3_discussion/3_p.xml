 <italic>CI</italic> performs well for very sparse networks with few triangles, especially in the region of large 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>vacc</sub> and low 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>info</sub>. 
 <italic>Degree</italic> is never most efficient, meaning that vaccinating exactly in order of degree is not so important that it is worth obtaining all the network information. Furthermore, 
 <italic>Coreness</italic> is also never most efficient, supporting Refs. [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] (but disagreeing with Ref. [
