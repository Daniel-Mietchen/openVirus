<p>To proceed towards increasing realism and applicability, one would also need to take social mechanisms into account. Parallel to the targeted immunization problem, there is an emergent field studying vaccination as a social-psychological problem. One issue being that for voluntary vaccination it is irrational to become vaccinated if almost everyone else is vaccinated (the diseases would not spread anyway, and there are side-effects and discomfort associated with being vaccinated). Conversely, it is irrational not to vaccinate if almost nobody is vaccinate, leading to a typical game theoretical dilemma [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Or how vaccination and awareness diffusion can create synergistic effects [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Other papers study how social influence affects the decision to vaccinate ones children (e.g. Ref. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). To make theoretical vaccination studies fully realistic and most useful to decision makers, one would need combine such social aspects with the cost-benefit approach of this paper.
