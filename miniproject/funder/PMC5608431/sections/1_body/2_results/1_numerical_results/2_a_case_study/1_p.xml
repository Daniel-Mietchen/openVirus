<p>The 
 <italic>Colorado Springs</italic> network serves well as an example since it is of intermediate size in our collection and has typical features, such as a heterogeneous degree distribution. In this section we set 
 <italic>β</italic> = 2—once again choosing a modest value that is in the interesting range where disease can spread throughout the population. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005696.g001">Fig 1</xref>, we plot the optimal saved cost 
 <italic>Nχ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>opt</italic>
 </sub> as a function of the two parameters—the relative cost of information 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>info</sub> and the relative cost of vaccination 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>vacc</sub>. The general pattern is quite trivial—the protocols needing most information (
 <italic>CI</italic>, 
 <italic>Degree</italic> and 
 <italic>Coreness</italic>) are also the ones that depend most on 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>info</sub>, while 
 <italic>Random</italic>, that needs no information at all, depends only on 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>vacc</sub>. The three protocols using an amount of information depending on 
 <italic>f</italic> (
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic>, 
 <italic>Random walk</italic> and 
 <italic>TSH</italic>) are affected by both 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>info</sub> and 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>vacc</sub>. From the heat maps it is hard to see which protocol is the best (except, perhaps that 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic> has the largest 
 <italic>χ</italic> for high 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>info</sub>). This means that the efficiencies of the best-performing protocols are relatively similar.
