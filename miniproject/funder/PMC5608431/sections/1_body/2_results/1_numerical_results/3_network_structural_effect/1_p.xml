<p>The picture painted in the previous section remains roughly true for other data sets and 
 <italic>β</italic> values. In this section, we go directly to our main question of what the most cost effective vaccination protocol is. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005696.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows the results for 
 <italic>β</italic> = 2. The corresponding figure for the other 
 <italic>β</italic>-values we study can be found in the Supplementary material. From these figures, the conclusions are roughly the same, but for small 
 <italic>β</italic>, i.e. small outbreak sizes, the results are affected by noise (so the regions are not that clear cut).
