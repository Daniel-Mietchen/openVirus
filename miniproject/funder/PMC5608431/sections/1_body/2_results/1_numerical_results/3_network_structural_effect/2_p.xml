<p>For most of the data sets, 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic> vaccination is the most efficient protocol for relatively high information costs, 
 <italic>TSH</italic> is the most efficient for low 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>info</sub> and high 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>vacc</sub>, while 
 <italic>Random walk</italic> is the most efficient for the rest of the parameter space. One exception is the 
 <italic>Prostitution</italic>—the largest and sparsest network—where 
 <italic>CI</italic> is the most cost effective (despite the fact it requires global knowledge of the network structure). This network also has zero clustering coefficient—i.e. no triangles (because only heterosexual contacts are recorded). Still, the size and sparsity seem like more fundamental differences to the other networks (cf. Ref. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]). To understand the role of clustering one could perform the same study on model networks where the clustering can be controlled. The densest network, 
 <italic>Hospital</italic>, is also different in the respect that 
 <italic>TSH</italic> performs best for the entire parameter space. 
 <italic>Random</italic> is never the most efficient, meaning that there are network structures that can be exploited for all data sets and parameter values. 
 <italic>Coreness</italic> and 
 <italic>Degree</italic> does not perform best under any circumstance.
