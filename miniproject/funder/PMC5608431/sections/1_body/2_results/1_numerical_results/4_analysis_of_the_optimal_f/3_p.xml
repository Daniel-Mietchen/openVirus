<p>Following a widely used approach in epidemiology and network science, consider a continuous version of 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005696.e007">Eq (4)</xref>, where all functions of 
 <italic>f</italic> ∈ [0, 1] are differentiable and all vanishing terms are neglected. (We note that proving formally that the process converges to its continuous representation as 
 <italic>N</italic> → ∞ is a challenging mathematical problem, however, it is common to analyze the continuous version in its own right.) In the continuous version of the system, our observations above can be summarized as follows: (i) Δ′(
 <italic>f</italic>) &gt; 0 for 
 <italic>f</italic> &lt; 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>; (ii) Δ(
 <italic>f</italic>) = Ω/
 <italic>N</italic> and Δ′(
 <italic>f</italic>) = 0 for 
 <italic>f</italic> ≥ 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>; (iii) Δ′(
 <italic>f</italic>) → 0 when 
 <italic>f</italic> → 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>. This behavior of Δ′(
 <italic>f</italic>) is schematically depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005696.g006">Fig 6</xref>.
