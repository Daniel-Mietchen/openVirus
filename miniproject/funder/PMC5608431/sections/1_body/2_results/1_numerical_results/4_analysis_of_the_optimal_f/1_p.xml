<p>In this section our goal is to understand regularities behind the numerical results. The exact analysis is available only for asymptotic behavior of 
 <italic>Random</italic>, 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic> and 
 <italic>Degree</italic> strategies in a configuration model, see e.g. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but the analytical expressions are cumbersome, and do not provide sufficient qualitative insights. The results on other vaccination strategies are currently not available. Therefore, we resort to heuristic arguments, that are based on the exact results in the literature.
