<p>Consequently, we have two rules of thumb to anticipate the value of 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>opt</sub>. First, one expects that 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>opt</sub> is smaller for more effective strategies. This is because 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>opt</sub> â‰¤ 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub>, while 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> can be viewed as an indicator of the effectiveness of a vaccination strategy in preventing the epidemics. Indeed, when 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>c</italic>
 </sub> is small, then the global outbreak is prevented by vaccinating only a small fraction of individuals. Second, a higher value of the right-hand side of 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1005696.e009">Eq (6)</xref> is also an indication for smaller 
 <italic>f</italic>
 <sub>opt</sub>, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005696.g006">Fig 6</xref>, where this value is represented by the dashed line.
