<p>The cost efficiency of 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic> and 
 <italic>Random</italic> strategies is harder to compare because 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic> targets high-degree nodes while 
 <italic>Random</italic> does not, but on the other hand, 
 <italic>Random</italic> has no information costs. To take extreme examples, 
 <italic>Random</italic> will yield higher gain on a regular graph, while 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic>â€”on a star graph. In the case study in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005696.g004">Fig 4</xref>, we see that the gain for the 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic> strategy is similar to the one for the 
 <italic>Random</italic> strategy, while in other data sets 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic> outperforms other protocols especially when information costs are high, see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005696.g004">Fig 4</xref>.
