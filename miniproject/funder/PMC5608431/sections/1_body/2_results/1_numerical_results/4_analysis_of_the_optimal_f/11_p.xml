 <italic>Degree</italic> (
 <italic>D</italic>), 
 <italic>Coreness</italic> (
 <italic>C</italic>) and 
 <italic>CI</italic> strategies must be most effective in the configuration model because they target the nodes that have the highest potential for spreading the infection. A formula for the average outbreak size in the configuration model when nodes of degree 
 <italic>s</italic> are removed with given probability is given in Ref. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but these results do not directly apply when fraction 
 <italic>f</italic> of highest degree nodes is removed.
