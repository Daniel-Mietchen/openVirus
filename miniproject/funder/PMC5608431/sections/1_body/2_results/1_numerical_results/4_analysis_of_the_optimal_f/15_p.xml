<p>The comparison of 
 <italic>Random walk</italic> and 
 <italic>TSH</italic> to the 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic> strategy is trickier since the latter also targets high degree nodes but at lower costs. On the other hand, the accuracy of 
 <italic>Random walk</italic> and 
 <italic>TSH</italic> is higher. The comparison between the three randomized strategies—
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic>, 
 <italic>Random walk</italic>, and 
 <italic>TSH</italic>—thus depends on the interplay between accurate targeting and information costs. This explains that the 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic> sometimes performs better than 
 <italic>Random walk</italic> and 
 <italic>TSH</italic>.
