<p>Like many previous studies, we focus on networks with a power-law degree distribution, so the probability of a vertex having degree 
 <italic>k</italic> is proportional to 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sup>−
  <italic>γ</italic>
 </sup>. We truncate the degree distribution at 
 <italic>N</italic>
 <sup>1/(
  <italic>γ</italic> − 1)
 </sup>. Such a truncation improves the precision of the estimated average values of the infection outbreak, and at the same time it preserves the limiting degree distribution and the order of magnitude of the maximum degree.
