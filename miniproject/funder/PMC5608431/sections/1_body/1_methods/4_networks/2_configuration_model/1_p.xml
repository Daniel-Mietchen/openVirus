<p>The input to the configuration model is a degree sequence, i.e. a sequence of desired degrees of the nodes of the network. Then the model proceeds by picking random pairs of nodes and adding an edge between them if their actual degrees are less than their desired degrees. When all nodes has their desired degree, the network has been constructed. The model does not enforce a simple graph (i.e. if there are already edges between a selected pair of nodes, one would still add another edge, and links from a vertex to itself are also allowed). Since the empirical graphs in our study are simple graphs by construction, we convert the output of the configuration model to a simple graph by deleting multiple edges and self-loops. In the literature this construction is sometimes called the erased configuration model [
