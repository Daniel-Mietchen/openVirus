<p>Ideally, the underlying network of our study should be as realistic as possible (given a pathogen). Our knowledge of the structure of contact networks is advancing, and there are some datasets available. We use the ones that record actual contacts between people and disregard those where contacts are inferred from interaction on social media, etc. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To better understand how the size of the network, and higher-order structures, affect the performance of the algorithms, it is desirable to have models able to generate contact networks. We study one of the simplest such models—the configuration model—not because it is able to generate a network with very realistic structure, but because it enables us to compare the result to other studies, in particular analytical ones.
