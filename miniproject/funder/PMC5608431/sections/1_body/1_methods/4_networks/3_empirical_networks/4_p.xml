<p>The original proximity data sets along with 
 <italic>Prostitution</italic> are time resolved. We construct static networks by aggregating all contacts. (Ideally these data sets should be analyzed as temporal networks [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]â€”then one could get around the assumption that the past accurately predicts the future [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, that is outside the scope of this paper.)
