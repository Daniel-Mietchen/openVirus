<p>The first type of empirical networks that we use represent self-reported sexual contacts. Two of these data sets—we label them 
 <italic>HIV</italic> and 
 <italic>Colorado Springs</italic>—were gathered by so called contact tracing where individuals testing positive with HIV were required to report their recent contacts. 
 <italic>HIV</italic> data set is from the first study [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], which used an observed contact network between HIV patients to argue that HIV is a sexually transmitted disease. 
 <italic>Colorado Springs</italic> is a larger and more recent contact-tracing data set based on patients from its namesake city in Colorado, USA [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Contact tracing does not follow contacts of uninfected individuals, indeed 
 <italic>HIV</italic> only includes positive cases while 
 <italic>Colorado Springs</italic> also includes uninfected individuals that had sex with HIV positive others.
