<p>The final type of empirical networks are so called proximity networks. In these, a link represent a pair of people being close to each other at some time. These data sets all come from the Sociopatterns project (sociopatterns.org) and were collected by radio-frequency identification sensors given to people in some specific social setting. Such sensors record a contact if two persons are within 1â€“1.5 m. The social setting of one of these data sets is a conference [
