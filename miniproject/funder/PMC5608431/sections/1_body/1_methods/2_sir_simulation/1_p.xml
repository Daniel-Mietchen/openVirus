<p>We assume that an infectious disease is spreading over a static contact network represented as a graph 
 <italic>G</italic> = (
 <italic>V</italic>, 
 <italic>E</italic>). 
 <italic>V</italic> is the set of 
 <italic>N</italic> vertices, or nodes, representing individuals; 
 <italic>E</italic> is the set of 
 <italic>M</italic> undirected edges representing pairs of individuals between whom the disease may spread. The nodes are, at any given time, in one of three states—susceptible (S), infectious (I) or recovered (R). Susceptible nodes do not have the disease, but can get it. Infectious nodes have the disease and they can spread it. Recovered nodes do not have the disease and cannot get it. We assume a disease outbreak starts at time 
 <italic>t</italic> = 0. At the beginning all nodes are susceptible, except a randomly chosen node that is infectious. If an edge is between one susceptible individual and one infected individual, then the susceptible becomes infectious at rate 
 <italic>β</italic>. Every infectious recovers at rate 
 <italic>ν</italic>. In this setting, the infection and recovery times are independent exponential random variables, and an infectious node transfers a disease through an edge before getting recovered with probability 
 <italic>β</italic>/(
 <italic>β</italic> + 
 <italic>ν</italic>).
