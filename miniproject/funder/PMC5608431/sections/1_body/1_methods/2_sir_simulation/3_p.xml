<p>For all contact networks and parameter values, we use 300,000 or more runs of the SIR model for averages. Since each run represents an independent realization of the (random) costs of the entire process, we used the normal approximation of the sample average, to verify with 99% confidence intervals that our evaluations of mean costs were very accurate. The exact values of the confidence intervals are not informative for our purpose and thus are omitted. We use 
 <italic>β</italic> = 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and (as mentioned) 
 <italic>ν</italic> = 1.
