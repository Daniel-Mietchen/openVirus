<p>An elegant way of exploiting the network structure to find high-degree individuals to vaccinate is the 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic> vaccination scheme by Cohen, Havlin and ben Avraham [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In the literature it is often assumed that each individual is sampled a Poisson(
 <italic>f</italic>) distributed number of times, and each time a sampled individual names one neighbor to vaccinate. When the neighbor has already been vaccinated, no vaccination occurs and the next individual is sampled randomly. Then, the average fraction of vaccinated individuals 
 <italic>v</italic>(
 <italic>f</italic>) is smaller than 
 <italic>f</italic>. The exact formula for 
 <italic>v</italic>(
 <italic>f</italic>) is given e.g. in Refs. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Naturally, 
 <italic>v</italic>(
 <italic>f</italic>) is close to 
 <italic>f</italic> when 
 <italic>f</italic> is small. Here we assume that when a randomly sampled individual names a contact, which has already been vaccinated, then the individual is asked to name another contact. We discard the rare cases when all contacts of a random individual have already been vaccinated, and thus assume that 
 <italic>v</italic>(
 <italic>f</italic>) = 
 <italic>f</italic>. Then the information cost of this protocol is 
 <italic>fNc</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>info</italic>
 </sub>, since one needs to make an inquiry to one node for every node that is vaccinated.
