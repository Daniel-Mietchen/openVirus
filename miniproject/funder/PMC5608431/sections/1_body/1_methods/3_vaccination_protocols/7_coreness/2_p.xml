<p>The coreness as an estimate of importance with respect to disease spreading was proposed by Ref. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and further refined in Ref. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To use it, one would need to map out the entire network, i.e. all its 
 <italic>M</italic> edges. However, in reality, the inquiries will be implemented node by node. Therefore, we choose a simplified approach, in which we assume that knowing the complete network takes one inquiry per node, i.e. the total information cost is 
 <italic>Nc</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>info</italic>
 </sub>. Note that this is a more demanding inquiry, because it requires an individual to list all its neighbors. Still, we use the same cost, meaning the performance of 
 <italic>Coreness</italic> relative to its cost will be slightly overestimated compared to the above protocols.
