<p>There are other structures than degree that could be exploited for mitigating disease spreading. Coreness captures not only the degree of a node, but also increases with the connectedness of a node’s neighborhood. The idea that dense clusters (“core groups” in the epidemiological literature) are important for disease spreading dates back to Ref. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Coreness is not the only metric to capture this property, but a simple and straightforward one. It is the byproduct of a 
 <italic>k</italic>-
 <italic>core decomposition</italic>, which is a way to analyze the network by successively removing nodes from it. Specifically, at level 
 <italic>k</italic>, one deletes all nodes with degree ≤ 
 <italic>k</italic>. If nodes get degree ≤ 
 <italic>k</italic> during the deletion process, one deletes these too, until all nodes have degrees larger than 
 <italic>k</italic>. The coreness value of a node is the 
 <italic>k</italic>-value when it was deleted.
