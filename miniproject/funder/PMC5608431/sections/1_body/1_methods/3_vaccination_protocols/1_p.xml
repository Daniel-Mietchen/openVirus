<p>We compare the performance of seven vaccination protocolsâ€”five of these have been analyzed in the literature, and two are proposed by us in this work (but derived from a cost-efficient way of finding the highest degree vertices). The vaccination protocols range from simple to complex and use different amount of information about the network.</p>
