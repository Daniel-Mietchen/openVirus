<p>Infectious disease is a major burden to global health. Infections spread from person to person over human contact networks. The propagation speed is an emergent property of both the pathogenesis in the infected individual and the contacts between people. By understanding the contact networks, we should thus be able to better predict and mitigate disease outbreaks. These are the premises of network epidemiology [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]—one of its most active questions being how to exploit the contact network in targeted vaccination campaigns [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] or livestock diseases (where one node is a farm and links are connections by transport) [
