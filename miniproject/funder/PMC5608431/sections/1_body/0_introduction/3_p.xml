<p>By reformulating the vaccination problem as a cost-optimization problem, one can evaluate the protocols proposed in the literature in a way more useful for decision makers. In this paper, we use this approach to evaluate eight vaccination protocols for many kinds of cost scenarios and underlying networks. We use eight different empirical networks of human contacts (representing sexual interaction or proximity). We also use the configuration modelâ€”a popular method to generate synthetic uncorrelated random networks given a degree sequence.</p>
