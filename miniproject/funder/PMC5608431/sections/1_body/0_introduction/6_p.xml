<p>A large empirical study based on the 2006 census of the Greater Toronto Area [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] suggests that vaccination of top-degree nodes—the 
 <italic>Degree</italic> (
 <italic>D</italic>) vaccination protocol—is most effective. However, such strategy requires information about the entire network, which makes it hard to implement. For analytical results on degree-based vaccination and an implicit expression for

 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], like us, considers vaccination as a cost problem but does not consider the cost of information gathering. They find that the picture of Ref. [
