<p>In the theoretical literature, the problem of targeted vaccination has typically been formulated as follows. Given some knowledge of the contact network, identify the individuals that are potentially most important for disease spreading. To carry out a targeted vaccination campaign, one would first need to gather information about the contact network, then use this information to vaccinate (or otherwise reduce the impact of the important individuals). There are thus three major costs involved in such an endeavor: the cost of the disease itself (that we use as our base unit), the cost of gathering the information about the network

 <sub>info</sub> (in units of the cost of a person getting the disease) and the cost of vaccinating 
 <italic>c</italic>
 <sub>vacc</sub>. We can thus evaluate the cost efficiency of a vaccination protocol by measuring the net saving 
 <italic>χ</italic> per person in units of the cost of sick individuals
