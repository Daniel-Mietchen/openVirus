<p>Before proceeding to the details of our approach we will give a brief overview of the recent analytical advances on the vaccination problem. The simplest vaccination protocol is just to vaccinate random individuals—the 
 <italic>Random</italic> (
 <italic>R</italic>) protocol—which often serves as a baseline in the literature, see e.g. Refs. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>–
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In a seminal paper, Cohen, Havlin and ben Avraham [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1005696.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] proposed the more effective 
 <italic>Acquaintance</italic> (
 <italic>A</italic>) vaccination. In their approach, one also starts by randomly selected individuals, but does not vaccinate these, rather, asks them to name someone they met (in such a way that contagion could occur). In an uncorrelated network, the probability of meeting a node of degree 
 <italic>k</italic> in such an approach, is proportional to 
 <italic>k</italic>. It is important to vaccinate high-degree nodes, not only because they have more people to spread the disease to, but also more people to get the disease from.
