  <title>Phylogenetic tree of DENV-2 from Lihir, October 2010.</title>
  <p>PNG DENV-2 (indicated in red) compared with reference viruses obtained from GenBank. The Lihir virus grouped with the Cosmopolitan genotype of DENV-2, and clustered with DENV-2 identified in travellers entering northern Australia from PNG 2009â€“2010. The tree was derived by maximum likelihood methods using whole genome sequences. Most reference virus sequences were complete envelope gene. Bootstrap support values are shown at nodes.</p>
