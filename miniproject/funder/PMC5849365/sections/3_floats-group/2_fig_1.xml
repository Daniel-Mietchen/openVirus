  <title>Phylogenetic tree of DENV-3 from Madang (2007â€“2008) and Lihir (2010).</title>
  <p>PNG DENV-3 (indicated in red) compared with reference viruses obtained from GenBank. The PNG viruses grouped with genotype 1 of DENV-3. Viruses isolated from Madang clustered together and were distinct from later strains, clustering with the Lihir isolate, identified in travellers to northern Australia originating in PNG. The tree was derived by maximum likelihood methods using whole genome sequences. Most reference virus sequences were complete envelope gene. Bootstrap support values are shown at nodes.</p>
