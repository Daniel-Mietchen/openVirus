<p>Overall dengue seroprevalence at the two study sites was 85.3%. Assessment of convalescent sera from residents of Madang identified previous DENV infection in the great majority of samples tested (101/119 sera; 84.9%), most of which showed multitypic NAb responses to all four DENV serotypes (

In both locations, monotypic NAb responses were identified in 11% of sera and overall were directed against each of the four serotypes. Seroprevalence increased with age (
