<p>Whole genomes were sequenced from one DENV-2 and five DENV-3 isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of the five DENV-3 isolates indicated that the four from Madang group together to form a previously unidentified lineage within Genotype I (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0006254.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The Madang lineage included other DENV-3 from the region, including a group exported to Solomon Islands and Fiji and collected in 2013 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and 2014, respectively. The DENV-3 strain originating in Lihir in 2010 also grouped within Genotype I and clustered with a lineage formed by DENV-3 first found in travellers between PNG and northern Australia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Collectively, these data identify a lineage of DENV-3 endemic to the northern coast of PNG, closely related to DENV-3 circulating in neighbouring Indonesia, and the subsequent introduction of this lineage into the western and south Pacific. The entire lineage is well supported and distinguished from other viruses within Genotype I by seven amino acid substitutions spanning several genes [prM, E, NS2A, NS3, NS5] (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd.0006254.t003">Table 3</xref>) and are indicated by the highlighted branch in Figure I. Several of these substitutions were non-conservative, involving the replacement of one encoded amino acid with another of very different properties. At least two of these substitutions were fixed through the process of positive selection according to at least one statistical test implemented in HyPhy [
