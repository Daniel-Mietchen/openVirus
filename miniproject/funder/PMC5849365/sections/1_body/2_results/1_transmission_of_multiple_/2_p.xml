<p>DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 infections were identified in adults and children from Madang town or from villages and rural settlements around the town. In several instances, two serotypes were identified in individuals sampled within a period of 10 days. Two DENV cases originated in Lihir in May and October 2010 â€“a 47 year-old male Australian traveller infected with DENV-2 and 32 year-old female resident of Lihir infected with DENV-3. These data clearly identify hyperendemic DENV transmission on the northern coast of PNG, in Madang, and on Lihir Island in the Bismarck Archipaleago.</p>
