<p>Samples analysed in this study were collected from Madang, on the northern coast of PNG, and from Lihir Island in New Ireland Province. Madang is a town of about 30,000 people with a sea port that is a major hub for domestic and international shipping, and an airport where domestic flights from throughout PNG arrive several times each day. Lihir Island is 800 kilometres northeast of Madang in the Bismarck Archipelago, in the western Pacific Ocean. The islandâ€™s population doubled to more than 12,000 people after establishment of a gold mine in 1997 and although many residents still live a predominantly traditional subsistence lifestyle, in recent years there has been an influx of PNG-national and expatriate mine workers and development of an international airport and sea port.</p>
