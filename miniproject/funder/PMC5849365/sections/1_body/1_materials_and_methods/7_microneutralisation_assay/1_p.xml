<p>A serum microneutralization (MN) assay was used to measure serum anti-DENV antibodies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This approach was selected to allow simultaneous assessment of antibody to all four DENV serotypes in samples with limited volumes. Standard anti-DENV-1-4 sera NIBSC 05/248 (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control [NIBSC], Potter’s Bar, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom) were assayed against the homologous DENV prototype strains DENV-1
 <sub>Hawaii2001</sub>; DENV-2
 <sub>NGC;</sub> DENV-3
 <sub>H-87</sub> and DENV-4
 <sub>H-241</sub> and consistently produced MN titres of 10–20 and thus, the cut-off value for a positive test result was a reciprocal serum dilution of 10. Subject results were summarized and presented as geometric mean titres (GMT). Cross-neutralization experiments in which Standard DENV-1-4 sera were each tested against heterologous prototype DENV consistently produced negative results. Standard anti-JE serum (NIBSC 02/182) and serum samples from individuals with diagnosed other flavivirus infection (JEV, MVEV, and KUNJV) were tested against DENV-1-4 and were always negative.
