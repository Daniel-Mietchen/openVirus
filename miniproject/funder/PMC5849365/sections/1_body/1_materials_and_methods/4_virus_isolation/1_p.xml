<p>DENV was isolated from serum by inoculation onto monolayers of Vero cells [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Briefly, 100μl of acute phase serum was inoculated onto a Vero cell monolayer in minimal media in a 2.5 ml culture tube, and incubated overnight. On the following day the inoculum was removed and 3ml of DMEM with 2% FBS (supplemented with L-glutamine and antibiotics) was added to the cells, and the culture was maintained at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 7 days or until cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed; for most samples a blind passage into a second 2.5 ml culture tube was required in sorder to isolate virus. Successful virus isolation was identified by NS1 antigen ELISA (Platelia Dengue NS1 Antigen ELISA; Bio-Rad, Australia).
