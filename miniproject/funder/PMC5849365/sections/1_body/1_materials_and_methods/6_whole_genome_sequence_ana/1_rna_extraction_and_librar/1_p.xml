<p>DENV NS1-positive cultures were expanded by passage in 25 ml tissue culture flasks in a volume of 15 ml. Supernatants were harvested and clarified by centrifugation at 1400 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 deg C to remove cellular debris. The clarified supernatant was then transferred to a Millipore centrifugal filter unit (100,000kDa) and centrifuged at 4000 x g for 20 minutes. RNA was extracted from 150–200 μl concentrated virus supernatant using the Roche High Pure RNA isolation kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA mass/concentration was then determined by fluorescent detection using the Qubit system with Qubit RNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen). All RNA was stored at -80°C until used. DNA libraries were prepared with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit (Illumina), with the use of 200ng of total starting RNA and the exclusion of the polyA selection step. The DNA library sizes were validated with a High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent) on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The concentration of the libraries were normalised to 4nM using HT1 buffer supplied by Illumina and pooled together. The final concentration of the pooled DNA library was then re-examined using the Qubit ssDNA Assay kit (Invitrogen). The pooled DNA library was sequenced using a MiSeq Reagent Nano Kit, v2 (Illumina).</p>
