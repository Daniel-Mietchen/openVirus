<p>Sequences were trimmed, quality checked and assembled against DENV reference genomes into contigs using CLC Genomics Workbench (Ver. 8.5.1). Complete assembled contigs were checked for chimeras and aligned against publicly available sequences using MACSE [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], using a general-time-reversible substitution model with among-site rate heterogeneity accounted for by the gamma model (GTR + gamma, best fit as indicated in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://datamonkey.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">datamonkey.org</ext-link>). Trees were mid-point rooted. To identify nucleotide substitutions that have occurred on the internal branches of lineages formed during the evolution of DENV, particularly in PNG, we mapped changes onto the ML phylogenetic tree using a parsimony-based method implemented in MacClade 4.08 [
