<p>Madang sera were collected from febrile patients presenting to the outpatient clinic of Yagaum rural hospital or to Jomba town clinic from September 2007 through June 2008, and who were enrolled in a malaria study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Sera excluded for malaria antigens were tested for anti-DENV IgG and IgM, and NS1 antigen; 8% (46/578) were identified as probable acute DENV infection ie. NS1 antigen-positive and/or anti-DENV IgM-positive. A total of 55 acute phase sera (46 sera identified serologically as probable acute DENV infection plus 9 additional febrile sera that were not tested for DENV), were assessed in the present study for the presence of DENV by DENV E gene RT-PCR and virus isolation was attempted on RT-PCR positive samples. Whole genomes of isolated viruses were sequenced using Illumina. Convalescent sera from 119 patients excluded for acute DENV infection and who presented for recollection were collected an average of 29.6 days (range 5â€“159 days) after the first patient visit and tested for the presence of anti-DENV neutralizing antibody (NAb) to all four serotypes simultaneously using a microneutralization assay optimized for small sample volumes [
