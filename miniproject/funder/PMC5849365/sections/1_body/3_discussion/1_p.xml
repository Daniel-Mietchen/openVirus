<p>Although dengue was first described in Papua New Guinea more than 70 years ago when Sabin isolated the prototype DENV-2 strain New Guinea-C from US soldiers deployed along the northern PNG coast during the Second World War [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the lack of reported case data and DENV transmission data since that time has meant that the distribution of dengue in PNG is not understood. In this study we identified infection with three DENV serotypes among febrile patients presenting to health clinics on the northern coast of PNG, in Madang, over a nine month period in 2007–2008, and infection with two serotypes within 6 months in 2010, in Lihir Island. These findings are consistent with hyperendemic DENV transmission between 2007–2010 and confirm that dengue is endemic in this country.
