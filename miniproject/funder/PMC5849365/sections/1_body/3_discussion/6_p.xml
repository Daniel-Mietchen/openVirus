<p>Hyperendemic DENV transmission is associated with symptomatic dengue infection and with greater incidence of severe dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. No febrile patients were diagnosed with severe dengue in Madang [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] or Lihir and indeed, severe dengue is rarely identified in PNG despite the hyperendemic transmission we have identified and which has likely been occurring for a significant period of time. In previous studies we demonstrated high seroprevalence and predominantly multitypic NAb responses to all four serotypes in sera collected in New Guinea between 1959â€“1963 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] indicating DENV transmission in the decades prior to sampling. The reasons for the rarity of severe disease are unclear but may be related to poor recognition of dengue and the lack of routine dengue surveillance. It is also possible that undefined DENV-specific immune mechanisms may contribute to the apparent rarity of severe dengue disease.
