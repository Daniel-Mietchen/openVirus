<p>DENV epidemic virulence has been linked to introduction and transmission of specific serotypes and lineages [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The DENV-3 lineage we identified to be circulating in Madang in 2007â€“2008 and which our analysis showed to have evolved locally was subsequently associated with hospitalizations and deaths when it was introduced into the Solomon Islands in 2013 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], although severe disease was not identified among patients in Madang. This entire lineage was distinguished by several amino acid substitutions that may influence virus phenotypic characteristics and ultimately, disease outcome. Severe dengue has also been linked to genetic polymorphisms including HLA type [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; PNG and the Solomon Islands both belong to the Melanesian subgroup of Pacific Islanders and although relatively few HLA data are available for this population group, certain allele frequencies are known to be shared. Studies to assess the immunopathogenesis of dengue in PNG would be informative and should be undertaken in future.
