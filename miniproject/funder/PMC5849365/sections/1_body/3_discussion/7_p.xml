<p>In summary we have identified hyperendemic dengue transmission in PNG in the period up to 2010, which has likely been occurring for many years. We also demonstrate circulation of DENV which has evolved locally, and shown by others to have been introduced into the western and south Pacific in subsequent years. The absence of regular sampling for DENV in PNG and the potential for misdiagnosis of febrile individuals has meant that the evidence consensus for dengue presence is low [

An important aspect of this is to understand the origin and transmission patterns of PNG DENV, define endemic and introduced genotypes and lineages, and to characterize epidemic virulence associated with circulation of these viruses among the PNG population and within the Asia Pacific region.
