<p>Similarly, the DENV-2 virus identified in this study in a local resident of Lihir Island in 2010 is representative of strains known to circulate in the region, clustering with a highly similar strain originating in Makassar, Indonesia, in 2007; both viruses belong to a DENV-2 (Cosmopolitan genotype) clade also circulating in neighbouring Singapore in 2008 and identified in travellers to northern Australia in 2004 and 2006. Our results provide further evidence of DENV movement between endemic countries in the Asia Pacific region that has been described by ourselves and others [
