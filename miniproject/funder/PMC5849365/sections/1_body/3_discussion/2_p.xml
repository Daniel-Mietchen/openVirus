<p>Our understanding of DENV transmission in PNG has previously been largely limited to detection of DENV in febrile travellers to northern Australia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The Madang DENV-3 Genotype 1 lineage evolved locally and circulated over the year the study was conducted. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that it was most closely related to DENV-3 detected 3.5 years later in the Solomon Islands in January 2103 and then in the Fiji Islands in 2014, likely exported by travellers and having moved over distances of thousands of kilometres. PNG shares geographic borders with Indonesia, where dengue epidemics occur regularly and endemic, locally evolved DENV-3 lineages have been described [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The Madang lineage is most closely related to DENV-3 originating in Indonesia, as is the DENV-3 originating in Lihir Island which clustered with DENV-3 identified in travellers to northern Australia.
