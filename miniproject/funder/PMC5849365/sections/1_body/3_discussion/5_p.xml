<p>Dengue seroprevalence was very high with an overall rate of 85.3%, and increased with age. More than half of seropositive individuals from Madang were greater than 11 years of age and about 40% were older than 20 years. This age distribution reflects opportunities for multiple exposures over the lifetime of the individual in a setting where dengue is endemic or is regularly introduced and indeed, anti-DENV neutralising antibody profiles were predominantly multitypic. A majority of individuals in Madang and in Lihir demonstrated responses to two or more DENV serotypes and most sera neutralized all four DENV serotypes. Serum samples included in this analysis were from two main groupsâ€“convalescent patients excluded for acute DENV infection in Madang, and clinic attendees in Lihir (predominantly women attending antenatal clinics) therefore these neutralization data likely reflect multiple DENV infections in the years prior to sampling, and corroborate the genetic evidence for circulation of multiple serotypes. Studies in rural Haiti and Nicaragua [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] have shown that in endemic populations anti-DENV antibody prevalence increases with age and begins to plateau in adolescence reflecting long-term exposure to, and infection with, endemically circulating DENV. In the present study further support for endemic DENV transmission in PNG is indicated by the young age (median 2 years) of individuals in Madang with monotypic anti-DENV NAb responses to DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 or DENV-4 whereas the majority of multitypic infections were in adults. Three individuals with monotypic NAb profiles were babies less than 1 year old and anti-DENV NAb were likely passively transferred maternal antibody. We do not know the age of the mothers but it is possible they were relatively young and/or had experienced a single DENV infection in the past, or that they had experienced multiple infections but that only antibodies to a single serotype were present at sufficiently high levels in the infant to be detectable in our assay.
