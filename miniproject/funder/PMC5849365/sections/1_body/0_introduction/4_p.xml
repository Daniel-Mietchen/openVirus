<p>We sought to determine DENV serotype and genotype prevalence in local populations presenting with febrile illness, or with a range of non-febrile conditions. We sequenced whole genomes of DENV and conducted a phylogenetic analysis to determine the evolutionary origin of PNG DENV. In addition we determined anti-DENV-1-4 neutralizing antibody profiles in adults and children in order to assess prevalence and serotype diversity.</p>
