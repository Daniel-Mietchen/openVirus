<p>DENV is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. Like other RNA viruses, DENV displays considerable genetic diversity and is grouped into four antigenically distinct serotypes (DENV-1-DENV-4) which may be distinguished on the basis of serum neutralization tests. The four serotypes are more precisely classified, using phylogenetic approaches, into distinct genotypes which have been defined as clusters with nucleotide sequence divergence of not more than 6% [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. DENV genetic diversity thus appears to impact host mechanisms shown to mediate pathogenesis [
