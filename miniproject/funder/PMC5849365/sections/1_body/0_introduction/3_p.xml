<p>Dengue was first identified in Papua New Guinea (PNG) when Sabin isolated the prototype DENV-2
 <sub>New Guinea C</sub> strain from febrile soldiers deployed on the northern coast of New Guinea in 1944 [

 <sub>Hawaii</sub> that Sabin had recently isolated from febrile soldiers in Hawaii, was also isolated from soldiers in the same area of New Guinea in 1944 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], suggesting that at least two serotypes may have circulated in the north of PNG in the 1940s. More recently, DENV-1-3 genetic data derived from viremic travellers returning to northern Australia from PNG between 1999â€“2010 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] indicate that dengue is endemic in PNG, supporting an earlier serological study demonstrating a seroprevalence rate of 8% among patients presenting to clinics in Madang with acute febrile illness [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite the likely transmission of multiple DENV serotypes and the potential for introduction of DENV from endemic neighbouring countries which experience large-scale epidemics of severe dengue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006254.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], little is known about the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of dengue in PNG, where dengue surveillance is not undertaken, individuals with acute febrile illness are not routinely tested for DENV infection, and where severe disease is rarely reported.
