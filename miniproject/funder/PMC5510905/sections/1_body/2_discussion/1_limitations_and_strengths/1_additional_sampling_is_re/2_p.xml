<p>Ultimately, far more extensive sampling—specifically, obtaining more full-length sequences from undersampled lineages—of primate lentiviruses is required in order to resolve these instances. We included only sequences at least 500 bases long; each taxon may contribute more informative sites to some segments than to others. When splitting the master alignment along breakpoints, we removed from each segment any taxon that had no informative bases. However, for each segment, there were between 0 and 13 (mean: 3.6) taxa that had some informative sites, but were very short (&lt;100 informative sites). Statistically, these short taxa contribute little information, and are placed in the topology for each segment with high uncertainty. This phylogenetic uncertainty is then propagated forward to the discrete traits model, meaning that these short taxa should not statistically influence our results in any meaningful way. Notably, though, their removal does result in extensive technical challenges (this “pruned” dataset results in poor mixing and rather divergent results, seen in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s012">S12</xref> Figs). Given the high congruence between results from independent sampling replicates of the main dataset and from an alternative sampling scheme, we believe this to be a technical issue, rather than reflecting true differences. However, this issue does further emphasize the importance of additional sampling in fully resolving the natural history of SIVs.
