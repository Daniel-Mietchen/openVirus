<p>In addition to the 14 strongly supported novel transmissions (BF ≥ 10) described above, we also find substantial evidence for an additional 8 possible novel transitions, but with lower support (BF ≥ 3) (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g003">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s004">S4</xref>). These transmissions are more difficult to assess, because many of them are inferred on the basis of just a few “outlier” tips of the tree that group apart from the majority of viral samples from the same lineage. In each case, the tips’ phylogenetic position is strongly supported, and the primary literature associated with the collection of each of these “outlier” samples clearly specifies the host metadata. However, due to the limited number of lentiviral sequences available for some hosts, we are unable to control for sampling effects for some of these lower-certainty transmissions. We report them here because it is unclear whether these outliers are the result of unidentified separate endemic lineages, one-time spillovers from other hosts, or species misidentification during sample collection. It is also important to note that while some of these less-supported transmissions are potentially sampling artifacts, many of them may be real, and may be less supported simply because they lack the requisite available data for some genome segments.
