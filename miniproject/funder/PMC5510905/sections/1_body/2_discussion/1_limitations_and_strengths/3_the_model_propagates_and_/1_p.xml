<p>The deep phylogenies and extensive sequence divergence between SIV lineages makes any assessment of recombination imperfect. Our analysis aims to 1) place a lower bound on the number of interlineage recombination events that must have occurred to explain the observed extant viruses, and 2) use this understanding to construct a model of CST among these viruses. As the most well developed package currently available for topology-based recombination analysis, GARD was an appropriate choice to identify in broad strokes the extent and nature of recombination among SIVs. Some (though not all) of the remaining uncertainty as to the exact location of breakpoints is represented within the posterior distribution of trees for each segment, and is thus propagated and accounted for in the discrete traits model (inferences of CST). Most other studies of SIV evolutionary history simply split the phylogeny along gene boundaries or ignore recombination (e.g., [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Thus, while there is still some remaining uncertainty in our recombination analyses, these results still represent a major step forward in attempting to systematically assess recombination among all extant SIV lineages and to incorporate it into the phylogenetic reconstruction.
