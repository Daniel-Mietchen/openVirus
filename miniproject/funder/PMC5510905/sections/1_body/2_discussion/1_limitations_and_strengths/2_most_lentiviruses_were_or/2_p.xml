<p>The possibility of virus/host coevolution means that while we also observe extensive host switching 
 <italic>between</italic> primate clades, many of the observed jumps 
 <italic>within</italic> a primate clade may be the result of host-virus coevolution. However, we also note that the species barrier is likely lower between closely related primates, making it challenging to rigorously disentangle coevolution vs. true host switches within a primate clade [
