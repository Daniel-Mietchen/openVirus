<p>Some of these “noisier” transmission inferences, particularly within the same primate clade, may be the result of coevolution, ie. lineage tracking of viral lineages alongside host speciation. Within the model, viral jumps into the 
 <italic>common ancestor</italic> of two extant primate species appear as a jump into 
 <italic>one</italic> of the extant species, with a secondary jump between the two descendants. For example, the model infers a jump from mona monkeys into mustached monkeys, with a secondary jump from mustached monkeys into their sister species, red-tailed guenons (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Comparing the virus and host phylogenies, we observe that this host tree bifurcation between mustached monkeys and red-tailed guenons is mirrored in the virus tree bifurcation between SIV
 <italic>mus</italic> and SIV
 <italic>asc</italic> for most segments of the viral genome (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g003">3</xref>). This heuristically suggests that the true natural history may be an ancient viral transmission from mona monkeys into the common ancestor of mustached monkeys and red-tailed guenons, followed by host/virus coevolution during primate speciation to yield SIV
 <italic>mus</italic> and SIV
 <italic>asc</italic>.
