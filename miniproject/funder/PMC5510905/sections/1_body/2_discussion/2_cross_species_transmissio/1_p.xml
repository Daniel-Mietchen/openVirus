<p>Paleovirology, biogeography, and statistical models of lentiviral evolution estimate that primate lentiviruses share a common ancestor approximately 5–10 million years ago [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This, along with the putative viral coevolution during primate speciation, suggests that many of these transmissions were ancient, and have been acted on by selection for millions of years. Thus, given that the observed transmissions almost exclusively represent evolutionarily successful host switches, it is remarkable that lentiviruses have been able to repeatedly adapt to so many new host species. In the context of this vast evolutionary timescale, however, we conclude that while lentiviruses have a far more extensive history of host switching than previously understood, these events remain relatively rare overall.
