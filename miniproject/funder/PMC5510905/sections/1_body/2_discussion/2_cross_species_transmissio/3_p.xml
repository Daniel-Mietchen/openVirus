<p>Biologically, increasing host genetic distance has a clear negative association with the probability of cross-species transmission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, blue, p&lt;0.001, coef. 95% CI [-7.633, -2.213]). Importantly, as already discussed, the strength of this association may be inflated by instances of lineage tracking (virus/host cospeciation). However, it is well established that increasing host genetic distance is associated with a higher species barrier [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As previously documented in the literature we expect this is due to several factors, such as the divergence of host restriction factor genes, which are key components of the innate immune system (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) and differences in host cell receptor phenotypes (e.g., [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]). Functional assays of these host phenotypes against panels of SIVs, while outside the scope of this study, will be important for further identifying the molecular bases of the species barriers that have led to the transmission patterns identified here.
