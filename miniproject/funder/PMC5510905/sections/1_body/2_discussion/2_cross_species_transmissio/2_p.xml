<p>As noted above, our results illustrate that some SIVs cross the species barrier more readily than others, and some primate host species become infected with new viral lineages more commonly than others. This is likely governed by both ecological and biological factors. Ecologically, frequency and form of exposure are likely key determinants of transmission [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Using log body mass ratios [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] as a proxy for predation, we do not see a statistically significant association between body mass ratio and non-zero transmission rate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, blue; p = 0.678, coef. 95% CI [-0.311, 0.202]). We believe the lack of signal is likely due to the imperfect proxy, although it is also possible that predator-prey relationships do not strongly structure the CST network. It is also likely that geographic overlap and habitat similarity are ecological determinants of SIV CST, but modern primate habitats are likely very different since the time that these transmissions actually occurred.
