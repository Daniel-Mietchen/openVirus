<p>Here, we have shown that lentiviruses have a far more extensive history of host switching than previously described. Our findings also demonstrate that the propensity of each lentiviral lineage to switch between distant hosts, or to spillover among related hosts, is highly variable. In examining specific lineages, our findings are consistent with the prevalent hypothesis that SIV
 <italic>col</italic> has evolved in isolation from other SIVs. Contrastingly, we have also demonstrated that the mosaic origins of SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> are far more complex than previously recognized; the currently available sequence data is unable to resolve the ancestry of nearly half of the SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> genome. Together, our analyses move closer to a full understanding of the pattern of cross-species transmission among primate lentiviruses, but additional efforts to obtain high quality viral genome sequences from under sampled lineages will be necessary to fully resolve the natural history of these viruses.
