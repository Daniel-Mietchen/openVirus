<p>Among primates, our results clearly illustrate that the vast majority of lentiviral lineages were originally acquired by cross-species transmission. It is intriguing to speculate as to which virus was the “original” source of all of these lineages. Because of its consistent position as the outgroup of primate lentiviral trees, it has been hypothesized [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] that SIV
 <italic>col</italic> was this original lentivirus among primates. While SIV
 <italic>col</italic> is certainly the most evolutionary isolated extant lentivirus that has been sampled to date, this does not definitively place it as the ancestral lentivirus. Alternative scenarios (also noted by [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]) include an extinct original lentiviral lineage (and/or primate host species) or an unsampled ancestral lentivirus. It is also plausible that another known extant lentivirus was the “original” lineage, but has diverged and/or recombined to such an extant that its origins are obscured.
