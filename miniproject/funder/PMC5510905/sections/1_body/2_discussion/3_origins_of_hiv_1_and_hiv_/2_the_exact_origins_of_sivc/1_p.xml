<p>The ancestry of SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> appears to be tripartite: the unknown ancestry of the 5’ end; the putatively SIV
 <italic>rcm</italic> or SIV
 <italic>mnd-2</italic> derived 
 <italic>int</italic> and 
 <italic>vif</italic> genes; and the putatively SIV
 <italic>gsn/mon/mus</italic> derived 3’ end of the genome. For any of these three portions of the genome, there are multiple evolutionary histories supported by available sequence data. However, it is possible that further sampling of lentivirus lineages (both known and currently undiscovered) will be able to definitively resolve the ancestry of SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic>. Alternatively, it may be that the ancestral virus(es) that gave rise to any of these three portions is extinct [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In the case of the last two portions of the SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> genome, it may be that the common ancestor of these putative genetic donors (SIV
 <italic>rcm/mnd-2</italic> and SIV
 <italic>mon/mus/gsn</italic>, respectively) was the true source. However, it is also a distinct possibility that SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> has sufficiently diverged since its acquisition by chimpanzees such that its history is obscured.
