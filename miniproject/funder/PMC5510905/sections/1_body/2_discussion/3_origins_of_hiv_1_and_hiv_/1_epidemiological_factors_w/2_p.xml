<p>Examining this phenomenon more closely, the history of HIV-2 is enlightening. HIV-2 has been acquired through at least 8 
 <italic>independent</italic> spillover events from sooty mangabeys [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Notably, 6 of these transmissions have resulted in only a single observed infection (spillovers) [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; only 2 of these events have established sustained transmission chains and successfully switched hosts to become endemic human pathogens [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This pattern, as well as serology-based reports of other limited spillovers of SIVs into humans [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], suggest that there have been many isolated introductions of lentiviruses into humans over the past 200,000 years. However, these other viral exposures did not result in new endemic human pathogens either because of species-specific immune barriers, non-conducive epidemiological conditions, or a combination thereof. The rapid and repeated emergence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 is on a timescale more congruent with changes in epidemiological conditions than mammalian evolution, perhaps emphasizing the importance of the concurrent changes in human population structure and urbanization in facilitating the early spread of the epidemic [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Significantly, though, this also highlights the importance of careful public health surveillance and interventions to prevent future epidemics of zoonotic viruses.
