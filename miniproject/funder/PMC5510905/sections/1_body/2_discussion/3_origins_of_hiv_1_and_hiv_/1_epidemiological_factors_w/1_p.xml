<p>Understanding the underlying dynamics of lentiviral CST provides important ecological context to the transmissions that generated the HIV pandemic. As discussed above, our results support a view of lentiviral cross-species transmission as a rare event. Notably, only two lentiviruses have crossed the high species barrier from Old World monkeys into hominids: SIV

 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. While it is possible that this has occurred by chance, even without increased primate exposure or other risk factors, we nevertheless find it striking that humans would acquire two exogenous viruses within such a short evolutionary timespan.
