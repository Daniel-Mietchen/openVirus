<p>The tree topologies from 
 <italic>env</italic> in the 3’ end of the genome (segments 8–11) support the previous hypothesis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that this region came from a virus in the SIV
 <italic>mon/-mus/-gsn</italic> clade. These viruses form a clear sister clade to SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> with high posterior support (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). We find strong evidence for transmissions from mona monkeys (SIV
 <italic>mon</italic>) to mustached monkeys (SIV
 <italic>mus</italic>), and from mustached monkeys to greater spot-nosed monkeys (SIV
 <italic>gsn</italic>) (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Discussion</xref> of potential coevolution below). We also find more evidence in support of a transmission from mona monkeys to chimpanzees than from the other two potential donors, but more sampling is required to firmly resolve which of these viruses was the original donor of the 3’ end of SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic>.
