<p>Unlike SIV
 <italic>col</italic>, SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> appears to be the product of multiple CSTs and recombination events. SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> actually encompasses two viral lineages: SIV
 <italic>cpzPtt</italic> infects chimpanzees of the subspecies 
 <italic>Pan troglodytes troglodytes</italic>, and SIV
 <italic>cpzPts</italic> infects chimpanzees of the subspecies 
 <italic>Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. There are two additional subspecies of chimpanzees that have not been found harbor an SIV despite extensive surveys, suggesting that SIV
 <italic>cpzPtt</italic> was acquired after chimpanzee subspeciation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Both this previous work and our own results support the hypothesis that SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> was later transmitted from one chimpanzee subspecies to the other, and SIV
 <italic>cpzPtt</italic> is the only SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> lineage that has crossed into humans. Given the shared ancestry of the two lineages of SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic>, we use “SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic>” to refer specifically to SIV
 <italic>cpzPtt</italic>.
