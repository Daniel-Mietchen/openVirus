<p>We find phylogenetic evidence to support the previous hypothesis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] that the 
 <italic>integrase</italic> and 
 <italic>vif</italic> genes of SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> (segments 4â€“6) originated from SIV
 <italic>rcm</italic>; however, we find 
 <italic>equally strong evidence</italic> to support the competing hypothesis that 
 <italic>pol</italic> came from SIV
 <italic>mnd-2</italic>, which infects mandrils (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g002">Fig 2B and 2D</xref>). In these portions of the genome, SIV
 <italic>mnd-2</italic> and SIV
 <italic>rcm</italic> together form a clear sister clade to SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic>. The 
 <italic>vpr</italic> gene, in segment 7, is also closely related to both SIV
 <italic>rcm</italic> and SIV
 <italic>mnd-2</italic>, but this sister clade also contains SIV
 <italic>smm</italic> from sooty mangabeys. Notably, we infer a transmission from red-capped mangabeys to mandrils, but we cannot determine whether this portion of the 
 <italic>SIVcpz</italic> genome was acquired directly from 
 <italic>SIVrcm</italic> or from SIV
 <italic>mnd-2</italic>.
