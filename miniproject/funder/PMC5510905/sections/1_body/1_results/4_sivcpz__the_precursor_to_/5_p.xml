<p>Interestingly, we do 
 <italic>not</italic> find evidence to support either SIV
 <italic>rcm/mnd-2</italic> or SIV
 <italic>mon/mus/gsn</italic> as the donor for the 5’ most end of the genome (segments 1–5), including the 
 <italic>5’ LTR</italic>, 
 <italic>gag</italic>, and 
 <italic>RT</italic> genes. This is also true for the 
 <italic>3’ LTR</italic> (segment 12). SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> lacks a clear sister clade or ancestor in this region, and SIV
 <italic>rcm</italic> groups in a distant clade; we therefore find no evidence to suggest that an ancestor of an extant SIV
 <italic>rcm</italic> was the parental lineage of SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> in the 5’ most end of the viral genome as previously believed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g002">Fig 2A and 2D</xref>). This may support the possibility of a third parental lineage, or a number of other plausible scenarios (discussed below).
