<p>Based on the lentiviral sequences available in 2003, Bailes et al [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] suggested that the SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> genome is a recombinant of just two parental lineages. SIV
 <italic>rcm</italic> (which infects red-capped mangabeys) was identified as the 5’ donor, and an SIV from the SIV
 <italic>mon/-mus/-gsn</italic> clade (which infect primates in the 
 <italic>Cercopithecus</italic> genus) was identified as the 3’ donor. Since the time of this previous investigation many new lentiviruses have been discovered and sequenced. In incorporating these new data, we find clear evidence that the previous two-donor hypothesis may be incomplete.
