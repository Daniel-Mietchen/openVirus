<p>To address the reticulate evolutionary history of SIVs, we set out to identify the extent and nature of recombination between lentiviral lineages. Extensive sequence divergence between lineages masks site-based methods for linkage estimation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). However, topology-based measures of recombination allow for “borrowing” of information across nearby sites, and are effective for this dataset. We thus utilized a phylogenetic model to group segments of shared ancestry separated by recombination breakpoints instantiated in the HyPhy package GARD [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For this analysis, we used a version of the SIV compendium alignment from the Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), modified slightly to reduce the overrepresentation of HIV sequences (N = 64, see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Methods</xref>) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Importantly, because each virus lineage has only a few sequences present in this alignment, these inferences refer to 
 <italic>inter</italic>-lineage recombination, and not the rampant 
 <italic>intra</italic>-lineage recombination common among lentiviruses.
