<p>GARD identified 13 locations along the genome that had strong evidence of inter-lineage recombination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Here, evidence for a particular model is assessed via Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and differences in AIC between models indicate log probabilities, so that a delta-AIC of 10 between two models would indicate that one model is

 <sup>10/2</sup> = ~148 as likely as the other [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In our case, delta-AIC values ranged from 154 to 436 for each included breakpoint, indicating that these breakpoints are strongly supported by the underlying tree likelihoods. The 14 resulting segments ranged in length from 351 to 2316 bases; in order to build reliable phylogenies, we omitted two of the less supported breakpoints from downstream analyses, yielding 12 segments ranging in length from 606â€“2316 bases. We found no evidence to suggest linkage between non-neighboring segments (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). While it has been previously appreciated that several lineages of SIV are recombinant products (e.g., [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), the 13 breakpoints identified here provide evidence that there have been at least 13 inter-lineage recombination events during the evolution of SIVs. Identifying these recombination breakpoints allowed us to construct a putatively valid phylogeny for each segment of the genome that shares an internally cohesive evolutionary history.
