<p>To control for sampling effects, we repeated the analysis with a supplemental dataset built with fewer hosts, and more sequences per host (15 host species, subsampled to 16–40 sequences per viral lineage, N = 510), and see consistent results. As illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s006">S6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s008">S8</xref> Figs, we find qualitatively similar results. When directly comparing the average indicator values, host state transition rates, and BF values between analyses, the results from the main and supplemental datasets are strongly correlated, indicating robust quantitative agreement between the two analyses (
