 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows reconstructed phylogenies for 3 segments along with inferred ancestral host states. Trees are color coded by known host state at the tips, and inferred host state at internal nodes/branches; color saturation indicates the level of certainty for each ancestral host assignment. A visual example of how the model identifies cross-species transmissions can be seen in the SIV
 <italic>mon</italic>/SIV
 <italic>tal</italic> clade, which infect mona- and talapoin monkeys, respectively (starred in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g002">Fig 2Aâ€“2C</xref>). Due to the phylogenetic placement of the SIV
 <italic>mon</italic> tips, the internal node at the base of this clade is red, indicating that the host of the ancestral virus was most likely a mona monkey. This contrasts with the host state of the samples isolated from talapoin monkeys (tips in green). These changes in the host state across the tree are what inform our estimates of the rate of transmission between host pairs. In total, the support for each possible transmission is derived from both A) whether the transmission is supported across the posterior distribution of phylogenies for a particular segment, and B) whether this is true for multiple genomic segments.
