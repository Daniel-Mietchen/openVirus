<p>In phylogenetic trees of viral sequences, cross-species transmission appears as a mismatch between the host of a virus and the host of that virus’s ancestor. To identify this pattern and estimate how frequently each pair of hosts has exchanged lentiviruses, we used the established methods for modeling evolution of discrete traits, as implemented in BEAST [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our case, the host of each viral sample was modeled as a discrete trait. This is analogous to treating the “host state” of each viral sample as an extra column in an alignment, and inferring the rate of transition between all pairs of host states along with inferring ancestral host states across the phylogeny. This approach is similar to common phylogeographic approaches that model movement of viruses across discrete spatial regions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and has previously been applied to modeling discrete host state in the case of rabies virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, we took a fully Bayesian approach and sought the posterior distribution across phylogenetic trees, host transition rates and ancestral host states. We integrate across model parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The resulting model provides phylogenetic trees for each segment annotated with ancestral host states alongside inferred transition rates.
