<p>Notably, the tree topologies are substantially different between segments, which emphasizes both the extent of recombination and the different evolutionary forces that have shaped the phylogenies of individual portions of the genome. In all segmentsâ€™ trees, we also see frequent changes in the host state between internal nodes (illustrated as changes in color going up the tree), suggestive of frequent ancient cross-species transmissions. On average, primate lentiviruses switch hosts once every 6.25 substitutions per site per lineage across the SIV phylogeny.</p>
