<p>Taken together, these results represent a far more extensive pattern of CST among primate lentiviruses than previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; nearly every primate clade has at least one inbound, robustly supported viral transmission from another clade. We thus conclude that the majority of lentiviruses have arisen from a process of host switching, followed by a combination of intraclade host switches and host-virus coevolution.
