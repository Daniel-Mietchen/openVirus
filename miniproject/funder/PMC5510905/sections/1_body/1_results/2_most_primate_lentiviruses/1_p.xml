<p>We then looked for phylogenetic evidence of cross-species transmission in the tree topologies of each of the 12 genomic segments. For this and all further analyses, we constructed a dataset from all publicly available primate lentivirus sequences, which we curated and subsampled by host and virus lineage to ensure an equitable distribution of data (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Methods</xref>). This primary dataset consists of virus sequences from the 24 primate hosts with sufficient data available (5â€“25 sequences per viral lineage, N = 423,
