<p>While most SIVs are the product of ancient recombination and host switching, the distribution of these host switches is not uniform; when we assess the network centrality of each virus we find a broad range (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g003">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s007">S7</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s011">S11</xref>, as node size), indicating some hosts act as sources in the SIV transmission network and other hosts act as sinks. From this, we infer that some viruses have either had greater opportunity or have a greater ability to cross the species barrier than others.
