<p>Contrastingly, previous studies of the lentiviral phylogeny have noted that SIV
 <italic>col</italic> is typically the outgroup to other viral lineages, and have hypothesized that this may implicate SIV
 <italic>col</italic> as the “original” primate lentivirus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We find this hypothesis plausible, but the evidence remains inconclusive. For the majority of genomic segments, we also observe SIV
 <italic>col</italic> as the clear outgroup (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g002">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s005">S5</xref>). In contrast, for portions of 
 <italic>gag/pol</italic> (segments 3 and 4) and some of the accessory genes (segment 7), we find that there is not a clear outgroup. For these segments, many other lineages of SIV are just as closely related to SIV
 <italic>col</italic> as they are to each other. However, with the occasional exception of single heterologous taxa with poorly supported placement, SIV
 <italic>col</italic> remains a monophyletic clade (N = 16), and does not intercalate within the genetic diversity of any other lineage in our dataset. Based on these collective tree topologies, our model does not identify strong evidence for any specific transmissions out of colobus monkeys, and identifies only a single, weakly supported inbound transmission (likely noise in the model caused by the fact that red-capped mangabeys are the marginally supported root host state; see below). This is consistent with previous findings that the colobinae—in a different genus than most of the 
 <italic>Cercopithecus</italic> primates in our dataset—have a unique variant of the 
 <italic>APOBEC3G</italic> gene, which is known to restrict lentiviral infection and speculated to be a barrier to cross-species transmission [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These observations generally support the idea of SIV
 <italic>col</italic> as having maintained a specific relationship with its host over evolutionary time.
