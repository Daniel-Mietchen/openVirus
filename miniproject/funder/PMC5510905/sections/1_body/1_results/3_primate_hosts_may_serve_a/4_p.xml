<p>Additionally, while most host species carry only one lineage of SIV, mandrils and mustached monkeys carry 2 and 3 lineages of SIV, respectively [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In agreement with these previous studies, SIV
 <italic>mnd-1</italic> and SIV
 <italic>mnd-2</italic> do not always cluster together in the phylogeny; the same is true for SIV
 <italic>mus-1</italic>, SIV
 <italic>mus-2</italic>, and SIV
 <italic>mus-3</italic>, indicating that each of these viral lineages likely has a unique origin. This stands in stark contrast to baboons, which have only been infected by an SIV via a single documented spillover event [
