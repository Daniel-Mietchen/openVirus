<p>For all recombination analyses (GARD, R
 <sup>2</sup>, rSPR), we used the 2015 Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) HIV/SIV Compendium [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The compendium is a carefully curated alignment of high-quality, representative sequences from each known SIV lineage and each group of HIV-1 and HIV-2. We reduced the overrepresentation of HIV in this dataset, but maintained at least one high quality sample from each group of HIV. In total, this dataset contains 64 sequences from 24 hosts (1–10 sequences per host). Maximum likelihood trees for each segment—used for the rSPR analysis and displayed in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g001">Fig 1</xref>—were built with RAxML v.8.2.9 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] with the rapid bootstrapping algorithm under a GTR model with 25 discrete bins of site to site rate variation and were rooted to SIV
