<p>Alignments were done with the L-INSI algorithm implemented in mafft v7.294b [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]; the Compendium alignment was held fixed, with other sequences aligned to this template. Insertions relative to the fixed compendium were discarded. This alignment was then split along the breakpoints identified by GARD to yield the segment-specific alignments. Sequences that contained no bases for a given segment were removed; the “pruned” dataset is identical to the “main” dataset, but here we also removed sequences with fewer than 100 ungapped bases for a given segment.
