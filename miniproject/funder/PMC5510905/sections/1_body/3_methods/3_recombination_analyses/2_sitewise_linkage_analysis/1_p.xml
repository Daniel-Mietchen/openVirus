<p>Biallelic sites were identified across the genome (ignoring gap characters and polymorphisms present at &lt;5%). These biallelic sites were compared pairwise to generate an observed and expected distribution of haplotypes (combinations of alleles between the two sites), and assessed with the statistic 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = χ
 <sup>2</sup>/(
 <italic>d</italic> × 
 <italic>N</italic>), where χ
 <sup>2</sup> is chi-square, 
 <italic>d</italic> is the degrees of freedom, and 
 <italic>N</italic> is the number of haplotypes for this pair of sites [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This statistic follows the canonical interpretation of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup>, i.e., if the allele at site 1 is known, how well does it predict the allele at site 2 (0 indicating no linkage between sites, and 1 indicating perfect linkage).
