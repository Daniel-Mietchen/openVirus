<p>Computational intensity was eased by analyzing the recombination dataset in 3kb long portions, with 1kb overlaps on either end (e.g., bases 1:3000, 2000:5000, 4000:7000, etc.). To control for sites’ proximity to the ends of the genomic portion being analyzed, this was repeated with the windows offset (e.g., bases 1:2500, 1500:4500, 3500:6500, etc.). In total, this resulted in every site of the alignment being analyzed at least two-fold, with at least one of these replicates providing 500–1500 bases of genomic context on either side (other than at the very ends of the total alignment). Disagreement between window-offset replicates for a given breakpoint were minimal and almost always agreed within a few bases, with two exceptions: offset replicates for the breakpoint between segments 7 and 8 disagreed by 529 bases, and offset replicates for the breakpoint between 8 and 9 disagreed by 263 bases. In these instances, we used the average site placement.</p>
