<p>Segment linkage was assessed by comparing the similarity of tree topologies between segments. This was done with the pairwise method in the Rooted Subtree-Prune-and-Regraft (rSPR) package [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], which measures the number of steps required to transform one topology into another. Segment pairs with similar topologies have lower scores than segments with less similar topologies.
