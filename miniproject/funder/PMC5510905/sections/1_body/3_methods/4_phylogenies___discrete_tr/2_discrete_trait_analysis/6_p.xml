<p>Statistical support for each transmission is summarized as a Bayes factor (BF), calculated by comparing the posterior and prior odds that a given rate is non-zero (i.e., that there has been 
 <italic>any</italic> transmission between a given pair of hosts) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The ancestral tree likelihoods of each of the 12 tree distributions contribute equally to the inference of a shared transmission rate matrix. However, not every lineage has recombined along every breakpoint, which means that the tree likelihoods from each segment are not fully statistically independent. Thus, we report conservative estimates of BF by dividing all BF values by 12.
