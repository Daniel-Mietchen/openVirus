<p>These tree distributions were used to estimate the transmission network. As in Faria 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we model hosts as states of a discrete trait, and model cross-species transmission as a stochastic diffusion process among 
 <italic>n</italic> host states. We use a non-reversible state transition matrix with 
 <italic>n</italic> × (
 <italic>n–1</italic>) individual transition parameters [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. We also utilize standard methodology in using a Bayesian stochastic search variable selection process to encourage a sparse network, implemented as in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. An exponential distribution with mean = 1.0 was used as a prior on each of the pairwise rate parameters (552 in total for the main and pruned datasets with 24 hosts; 210 parameters in total for the supplemental dataset with 15 hosts). The prior placed on the 
 <italic>sum</italic> of the binary indicator variables corresponding to each pairwise rate parameter (i.e., the number of transitions that are non-zero) was an exponential distribution with mean = 20–23. Convergence was again assessed by visually inspecting the log files in Tracer. MCMC chain parameters and ESS values were as follows.
