<p>For the main and supplemental datasets, more than 97% of the rate, indicator, and actualRate (stepwise rate×indicator values) parameters, and all other parameters, had an ESS well over 200 (most &gt; 1000). The pruned dataset had a posterior ESS of 677, but the component tree likelihood ESS values ranged from 57–287; 91% of the rate, indicator, and actualRate parameters had an average ESS value &gt; 200.</p>
