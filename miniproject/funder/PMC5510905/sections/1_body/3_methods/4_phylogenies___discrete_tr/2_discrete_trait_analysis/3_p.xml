 <underline>“Pruned” dataset:</underline> decreased phylogenetic noise in the empirical tree distributions for this dataset led to narrow tree distributions and poor mixing (but clear convergence). We thus ran 40 parallel chains of 25–35 million steps each, sampled every 20,000 states (trees sampled every 50,000 states). We discarded 10 million steps of each chain as burnin and concatenated the remaining states.
