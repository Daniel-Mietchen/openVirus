<p>For each segment alignment, a posterior distribution of trees was generated with BEAST v. 1.8.2 under a general time reversible substitution model with gamma distributed rate variation and a strict molecular clock [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. We used a Yule birth-death speciation model tree prior [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]; all other priors were defaults. Trees were estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and convergence was determined by visually inspecting the trace in Tracer v. 1.6.0 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. MCMC chain parameters and ESS values were as follows.
