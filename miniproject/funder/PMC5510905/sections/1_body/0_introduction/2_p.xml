<p>HIV is the product of not just one successful host switch, but a long chain of host switch events [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There are two human immunodeficiency viruses, HIV-2 and HIV-1. HIV-2 arose from multiple cross-species transmissions of SIV
 <italic>smm</italic> (simian immunodeficiency virus, 
 <italic>sooty mangabey</italic>) from sooty mangabeys to humans [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. HIV-1 is the result of four independent cross-species transmissions from chimpanzees and gorillas. Specifically, SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> was transmitted directly from chimpanzees to humans twice; one of these transmissions generated HIV-1 group M, which is the primary cause of the human pandemic [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> was also transmitted once to gorillas, generating SIV
 <italic>gor</italic> [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which was in turn transmitted twice to humans [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].
