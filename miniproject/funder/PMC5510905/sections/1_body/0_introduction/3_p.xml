<p>Looking further back, SIV
 <italic>cpz</italic> itself was also generated by lentiviral host switching and recombination. Based on the SIV sequences available at the time, early studies identified SIV
 <italic>mon/-mus/-gsn</italic> (which infect mona, mustached, and greater spot-nosed monkeys, respectively) and SIV
 <italic>rcm</italic> (which infects red-capped mangabeys) as probable donors [

 <italic>cpz</italic> to cross the high species barrier and establish an endemic lineage in hominids [
