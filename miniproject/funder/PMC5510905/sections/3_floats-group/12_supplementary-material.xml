  <title>Comparison of discrete trait analysis results.</title>
  <p>Each datapoint represents on of the 210 possible transmissions between each pair of the 15 hosts present in the supplemental, main, and main/pruned datasets. The main dataset consists of 5–25 sequences from each of 24 host species; the pruned dataset is identical, but with short taxa removed from each segment. The supplemental dataset consists of 16–40 sequences from each of 15 host species. The black dashed line shows 
   <italic>y</italic> = 
   <italic>x</italic>; the linear regression is shown in gray.
