  <title>Maximum clade credibility trees for each of the 12 GARD-identified genomic segments of the lentiviral genome ("supplemental" dataset).</title>
  <p>Tips are color coded by known host state; branches and internal nodes are color coded by inferred host state, with color saturation indicating the confidence of these assignments. Monophyletic clades of viruses from the same lineage are collapsed, with the triangle width proportional to the number of represented sequences.</p>
