  <title>Inferred interlineage recombination breakpoints and supporting tree topologies.</title>
  <p>The SIV LANL compendium, slightly modified to reduce overrepresentation of HIV, was analyzed with GARD to identify 13 recombination breakpoints across the genome (dashed lines in 
   <bold>B</bold>; numbering according to the accepted HXB2 reference genomeâ€”accession K03455, illustrated). Two of these breakpoints were omitted from further analyses because they created extremely short fragments (&lt; 500 bases; gray dashes in 
   <bold>B</bold>). For each of the 11 remaining breakpoints used in further analyses, we split the compendium alignment along these breakpoints and built a maximum likelihood tree, displayed in 
   <bold>A</bold>. Each viral sequence is color-coded by host species, and its phylogenetic position is traced between trees. Heuristically, straight, horizontal colored lines indicate congruent topological positions between trees (likely not a recombinant sequence); criss-crossing colored lines indicate incongruent topological positions between trees (likely a recombinant sequence).
