  <title>Lentiviral phylogenies highlighting the mosaic origins of SIV
   <italic>cpz</italic> and examples of how CST is inferred from the phylogenies A,B,C.
  </title>
  <p>Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees are displayed for segments 2 (
   <italic>gag</italic>—
   <bold>A</bold>), 6 (
   <italic>int</italic> and 
   <italic>vif</italic>—
   <bold>B</bold>), and 9 (
   <italic>env</italic>–
   <bold>C</bold>) of the main dataset (N = 423). Tips are color coded by known host species; internal nodes and branches are colored by inferred host species, with saturation indicating the confidence of these assignments. Monophyletic clades of viruses from the same lineage are collapsed, with the triangle width proportional to the number of represented sequences. An example of likely cross-species transmission is starred in each tree, where the host state at the internal node (red / mona monkeys) is incongruent with the descendent tips' known host state (green / talapoin monkeys), providing evidence for a transmission from mona monkeys to talapoin monkeys. Another example of cross-species transmission of a recombinant virus among African green monkeys is marked with a dagger. 
   <bold>D</bold>—The genome map of SIV
   <italic>cpz</italic>, with breakpoints used for the discrete trait analysis, is color coded and labeled by the most likely ancestral host for each segment of the genome.
