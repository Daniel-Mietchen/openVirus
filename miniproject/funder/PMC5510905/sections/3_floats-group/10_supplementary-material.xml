  <title>Network of inferred CSTs of primate lentiviruses (supplemental dataset).</title>
  <p>The phylogeny of the host species' mitochondrial genomes forms the outer circle. Arrows with filled arrowheads represent transmission events inferred by the model with Bayes' factor (BF) ≥ 3.0; black arrows have BF ≥ 10, with opacity of gray arrows scaled for BF between 3.0 and 10.0. Transmissions with 2.0 ≤ BF &lt; 3.0 have open arrowheads (see 
   <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Discussion</xref>). Width of the arrow indicates the rate of transmission (actual rates = rates × indicators). Circle sizes represent network centrality scores for each host. Transmissions from chimps to humans; chimps to gorillas; gorillas to humans; sooty mangabeys to humans; sabaeus to tantalus; and vervets to baboons have been previously documented. To our knowledge, all other transmissions illustrated are novel identifications.
