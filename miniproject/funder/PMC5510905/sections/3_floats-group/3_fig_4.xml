  <title>Logistic regressions of body mass ratios (a proxy for predation) and host genetic distance on the probability of CST.</title>
  <p>For each pair of host species, we (
   <bold>A</bold>) calculated the log ratio of their average body masses and (
   <bold>B</bold>) found the patristic genetic distance between them (from a maximum-likelihood tree of mtDNA). To investigate the association of these predictors with cross-species transmission, we treated transmission as a binary variable: 0 if the Bayes factor for the transmission (as inferred by the discrete traits model) was &lt; 3.0, and 1 for a Bayes factor â‰¥ 3.0. Each plot shows raw predictor data in gray; the quintiles of the predictor data in green; and the logistic regression and 95% CI in blue.
