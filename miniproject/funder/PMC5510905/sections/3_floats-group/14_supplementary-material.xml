  <title>Network of inferred CSTs of primate lentiviruses ("main" dataset, after "pruning" [removing taxa shorter than 100 bases from each segment]).</title>
  <p>The phylogeny of the host species' mitochondrial genomes forms the outer circle. Arrows represent transmission events inferred by the model with Bayes' factor (BF) ≥ 3.0; black arrows have BF ≥ 10, with opacity of gray arrows scaled for BF between 3.0 and 10.0. Width of the arrow indicates the rate of transmission (actual rates = rates × indicators). As illustrated and discussed, pruning short taxa from the topology can introduce unusual model behavior.</p>
