 <p>Virus cross-species transmissions (CSTs) can cause devastating epidemics, including EBOV, MERS, and HIV. HIV is actually one of over 45 similar viruses, called SIVs, which infect primates; the emergence of HIV as a human pathogen was the result of multiple CSTs, and yet it is not understood how commonly these viruses switch hosts. We used publicly available genetic sequence data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of these viruses. We found evidence for at least 13 instances of recombination between lineages of SIV, and identified at least 14 ancient cross-species transmission events where an SIV switched hosts. These results provide important ecological context to the HIV pandemic, suggesting that while SIV CST is relatively rare over evolutionary time, it is an important factor that has shaped SIV biology and evolution.</p>
