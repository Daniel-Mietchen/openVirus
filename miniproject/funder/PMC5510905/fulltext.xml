HIV-1 and HIV-2 (human immunodeficiency virus 1 and 2), which have collectively caused over 35 million deaths, are the result of multiple CSTs from chimpanzees, gorillas, and sooty mangabeys. While the immediate history of HIV is known, there are over 45 lentiviruses that infect specific species of primates, and patterns of host switching are not well characterized. We thus took a phylogenetic approach to better understand the natural history of SIV recombination and CST. We modeled host species as a discrete character trait on the viral phylogeny and inferred historical host switches and the pairwise transmission rates between each pair of 24 primate hosts. We identify 14 novel, well-supported, ancient cross-species transmission events. We also find that lentiviral lineages vary widely in their ability to infect new host species: SIV<italic>col</italic> (from colobus monkeys) is evolutionarily isolated, while SIV<italic>agm</italic>s (from African green monkeys) frequently move between host subspecies. We also examine the origins of SIV<italic>cpz</italic> (the predecessor of HIV-1) in greater detail than previous studies, and find that there are still large portions of the genome with unknown origins. Observed patterns of CST are likely driven by a combination of ecological circumstance and innate immune factors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Virus cross-species transmissions (CSTs) can cause devastating epidemics, including EBOV, MERS, and HIV. HIV is actually one of over 45 similar viruses, called SIVs, which infect primates; the emergence of HIV as a human pathogen was the result of multiple CSTs, and yet it is not understood how commonly these viruses switch hosts. We used publicly available genetic sequence data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of these viruses. We found evidence for at least 13 instances of recombination between lineages of SIV, and identified at least 14 ancient cross-species transmission events where an SIV switched hosts. These results provide important ecological context to the HIV pandemic, suggesting that while SIV CST is relatively rare over evolutionary time, it is an important factor that has shaped SIV biology and evolution.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>TB is a Pew Biomedical Scholar and his work is supported by National Institutes of Health award R35 GM119774-01.

As such, understanding the propensity and ability of viral pathogens to cross the species barrier is of vital public health importance. Of particular interest are transmissions that not only &#x0201c;spillover&#x0201d; into a single individual of a new host species, but that result in a virus actually establishing a sustained chain of transmission and becoming endemic in the new host population (&#x0201c;host switching&#x0201d;) [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>HIV is the product of not just one successful host switch, but a long chain of host switch events [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. There are two human immunodeficiency viruses, HIV-2 and HIV-1. HIV-2 arose from multiple cross-species transmissions of SIV<italic>smm</italic> (simian immunodeficiency virus, <italic>sooty mangabey</italic>) from sooty mangabeys to humans [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. HIV-1 is the result of four independent cross-species transmissions from chimpanzees and gorillas. Specifically, SIV<italic>cpz</italic> was transmitted directly from chimpanzees to humans twice; one of these transmissions generated HIV-1 group M, which is the primary cause of the human pandemic [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. SIV<italic>cpz</italic> was also transmitted once to gorillas, generating SIV<italic>gor</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which was in turn transmitted twice to humans [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Looking further back, SIV<italic>cpz</italic> itself was also generated by lentiviral host switching and recombination. Based on the SIV sequences available at the time, early studies identified SIV<italic>mon/-mus/-gsn</italic> (which infect mona, mustached, and greater spot-nosed monkeys, respectively) and SIV<italic>rcm</italic> (which infects red-capped mangabeys) as probable donors [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Functional analysis of accessory genes from these putative parental lineages indicate that the specific donors and genomic locations of these recombination event(s) were crucial for enabling what became SIV<italic>cpz</italic> to cross the high species barrier and establish an endemic lineage in hominids [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The complex evolutionary history resulting in HIV illustrates the importance of natural history to modern day viral diversity, and although the history leading to HIV is well detailed, broader questions regarding cross-species transmission of primate lentiviruses remain [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. With over 45 known extant primate lentiviruses, each of which is endemic to a specific host species [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we sought to characterize the history of viral transmission between these species to the degree possible given the precision allowed from a limited sample of modern-day viruses.</p><p>Here, we utilized phylogenetic inference to reconstruct the evolutionary history of primate lentiviral recombination and cross-species transmission. We assembled datasets from publicly available lentiviral genome sequences and conducted discrete trait analyses to infer rates of transmission between primate hosts. We find evidence for extensive interlineage recombination and identify many novel host switches that occurred during the evolutionary history of lentiviruses. We also find that specific lentiviral lineages exhibit a broad range of abilities to cross the species barrier. Finally, we also examined the origins of each region of the SIV<italic>cpz</italic> genome in greater detail than previous studies to yield a more nuanced understanding of its origins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>There have been at least 13 interlineage recombination events that confuse the lentiviral phylogeny</title><p>In order to reconstruct the lentiviral phylogeny, we first had to address the issue of recombination, which is frequent among lentiviruses [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the context of studying cross-species transmission, this is both a challenge and a valuable tool. Evidence of recombination between viral lineages endemic to different hosts is also evidence that at one point in time, viruses from those two lineages were in the same animal (i.e., a cross-species transmission event must have occurred in order to generate the observed recombinant virus). However, this process also results in portions of the viral genome having independent evolutionary&#x02014;and phylogenetic&#x02014;histories.</p><p>To address the reticulate evolutionary history of SIVs, we set out to identify the extent and nature of recombination between lentiviral lineages. Extensive sequence divergence between lineages masks site-based methods for linkage estimation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). However, topology-based measures of recombination allow for &#x0201c;borrowing&#x0201d; of information across nearby sites, and are effective for this dataset. We thus utilized a phylogenetic model to group segments of shared ancestry separated by recombination breakpoints instantiated in the HyPhy package GARD [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For this analysis, we used a version of the SIV compendium alignment from the Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), modified slightly to reduce the overrepresentation of HIV sequences (N = 64, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec018">Methods</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Importantly, because each virus lineage has only a few sequences present in this alignment, these inferences refer to <italic>inter</italic>-lineage recombination, and not the rampant <italic>intra</italic>-lineage recombination common among lentiviruses.</p><p>GARD identified 13 locations along the genome that had strong evidence of inter-lineage recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Here, evidence for a particular model is assessed via Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and differences in AIC between models indicate log probabilities, so that a delta-AIC of 10 between two models would indicate that one model is <italic>e</italic><sup>10/2</sup> = ~148 as likely as the other [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In our case, delta-AIC values ranged from 154 to 436 for each included breakpoint, indicating that these breakpoints are strongly supported by the underlying tree likelihoods. The 14 resulting segments ranged in length from 351 to 2316 bases; in order to build reliable phylogenies, we omitted two of the less supported breakpoints from downstream analyses, yielding 12 segments ranging in length from 606&#x02013;2316 bases. We found no evidence to suggest linkage between non-neighboring segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). While it has been previously appreciated that several lineages of SIV are recombinant products (e.g., [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), the 13 breakpoints identified here provide evidence that there have been at least 13 inter-lineage recombination events during the evolution of SIVs. Identifying these recombination breakpoints allowed us to construct a putatively valid phylogeny for each segment of the genome that shares an internally cohesive evolutionary history.</p><fig id="ppat.1006466.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1006466.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Inferred interlineage recombination breakpoints and supporting tree topologies.</title><p>The SIV LANL compendium, slightly modified to reduce overrepresentation of HIV, was analyzed with GARD to identify 13 recombination breakpoints across the genome (dashed lines in <bold>B</bold>; numbering according to the accepted HXB2 reference genome&#x02014;accession K03455, illustrated). Two of these breakpoints were omitted from further analyses because they created extremely short fragments (&#x0003c; 500 bases; gray dashes in <bold>B</bold>).

To identify this pattern and estimate how frequently each pair of hosts has exchanged lentiviruses, we used the established methods for modeling evolution of discrete traits, as implemented in BEAST [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In our case, the host of each viral sample was modeled as a discrete trait. This is analogous to treating the &#x0201c;host state&#x0201d; of each viral sample as an extra column in an alignment, and inferring the rate of transition between all pairs of host states along with inferring ancestral host states across the phylogeny. This approach is similar to common phylogeographic approaches that model movement of viruses across discrete spatial regions [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and has previously been applied to modeling discrete host state in the case of rabies virus [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Here, we took a fully Bayesian approach and sought the posterior distribution across phylogenetic trees, host transition rates and ancestral host states. We integrate across model parameters using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The resulting model provides phylogenetic trees for each segment annotated with ancestral host states alongside inferred transition rates.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows reconstructed phylogenies for 3 segments along with inferred ancestral host states. Trees are color coded by known host state at the tips, and inferred host state at internal nodes/branches; color saturation indicates the level of certainty for each ancestral host assignment. A visual example of how the model identifies cross-species transmissions can be seen in the SIV<italic>mon</italic>/SIV<italic>tal</italic> clade, which infect mona- and talapoin monkeys, respectively (starred in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g002">Fig 2A&#x02013;2C</xref>). Due to the phylogenetic placement of the SIV<italic>mon</italic> tips, the internal node at the base of this clade is red, indicating that the host of the ancestral virus was most likely a mona monkey. This contrasts with the host state of the samples isolated from talapoin monkeys (tips in green). These changes in the host state across the tree are what inform our estimates of the rate of transmission between host pairs. In total, the support for each possible transmission is derived from both A) whether the transmission is supported across the posterior distribution of phylogenies for a particular segment, and B) whether this is true for multiple genomic segments.</p><fig id="ppat.1006466.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1006466.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Lentiviral phylogenies highlighting the mosaic origins of SIV<italic>cpz</italic> and examples of how CST is inferred from the phylogenies A,B,C.</title><p>Bayesian maximum clade credibility (MCC) trees are displayed for segments 2 (<italic>gag</italic>&#x02014;<bold>A</bold>), 6 (<italic>int</italic> and <italic>vif</italic>&#x02014;<bold>B</bold>), and 9 (<italic>env</italic>&#x02013;<bold>C</bold>) of the main dataset (N = 423).

For all other segments, however, the SIV<italic>agm</italic>s cluster together. We thus concur with the conclusion of Ayouba <italic>et al</italic>. that these samples represent a recent spillover of SIV<italic>sab</italic> from sabaeus monkeys to tantalus monkeys, and the model appropriately identifies this transmission.</p><p>Contrastingly, previous studies of the lentiviral phylogeny have noted that SIV<italic>col</italic> is typically the outgroup to other viral lineages, and have hypothesized that this may implicate SIV<italic>col</italic> as the &#x0201c;original&#x0201d; primate lentivirus [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

In contrast, for portions of <italic>gag/pol</italic> (segments 3 and 4) and some of the accessory genes (segment 7), we find that there is not a clear outgroup. For these segments, many other lineages of SIV are just as closely related to SIV<italic>col</italic> as they are to each other. However, with the occasional exception of single heterologous taxa with poorly supported placement, SIV<italic>col</italic> remains a monophyletic clade (N = 16), and does not intercalate within the genetic diversity of any other lineage in our dataset. Based on these collective tree topologies, our model does not identify strong evidence for any specific transmissions out of colobus monkeys, and identifies only a single, weakly supported inbound transmission (likely noise in the model caused by the fact that red-capped mangabeys are the marginally supported root host state; see below). This is consistent with previous findings that the colobinae&#x02014;in a different genus than most of the <italic>Cercopithecus</italic> primates in our dataset&#x02014;have a unique variant of the <italic>APOBEC3G</italic> gene, which is known to restrict lentiviral infection and speculated to be a barrier to cross-species transmission [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These observations generally support the idea of SIV<italic>col</italic> as having maintained a specific relationship with its host over evolutionary time.</p><p>Additionally, while most host species carry only one lineage of SIV, mandrils and mustached monkeys carry 2 and 3 lineages of SIV, respectively [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].

These transmissions are more difficult to assess, because many of them are inferred on the basis of just a few &#x0201c;outlier&#x0201d; tips of the tree that group apart from the majority of viral samples from the same lineage. In each case, the tips&#x02019; phylogenetic position is strongly supported, and the primary literature associated with the collection of each of these &#x0201c;outlier&#x0201d; samples clearly specifies the host metadata. However, due to the limited number of lentiviral sequences available for some hosts, we are unable to control for sampling effects for some of these lower-certainty transmissions. We report them here because it is unclear whether these outliers are the result of unidentified separate endemic lineages, one-time spillovers from other hosts, or species misidentification during sample collection. It is also important to note that while some of these less-supported transmissions are potentially sampling artifacts, many of them may be real, and may be less supported simply because they lack the requisite available data for some genome segments.</p><p>Ultimately, far more extensive sampling&#x02014;specifically, obtaining more full-length sequences from undersampled lineages&#x02014;of primate lentiviruses is required in order to resolve these instances. We included only sequences at least 500 bases long; each taxon may contribute more informative sites to some segments than to others. When splitting the master alignment along breakpoints, we removed from each segment any taxon that had no informative bases. However, for each segment, there were between 0 and 13 (mean: 3.6) taxa that had some informative sites, but were very short (&#x0003c;100 informative sites). Statistically, these short taxa contribute little information, and are placed in the topology for each segment with high uncertainty. This phylogenetic uncertainty is then propagated forward to the discrete traits model, meaning that these short taxa should not statistically influence our results in any meaningful way. Notably, though, their removal does result in extensive technical challenges (this &#x0201c;pruned&#x0201d; dataset results in poor mixing and rather divergent results, seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s010">S10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006466.s012">S12</xref> Figs).

As the most well developed package currently available for topology-based recombination analysis, GARD was an appropriate choice to identify in broad strokes the extent and nature of recombination among SIVs. Some (though not all) of the remaining uncertainty as to the exact location of breakpoints is represented within the posterior distribution of trees for each segment, and is thus propagated and accounted for in the discrete traits model (inferences of CST). Most other studies of SIV evolutionary history simply split the phylogeny along gene boundaries or ignore recombination (e.g., [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]).

This, along with the putative viral coevolution during primate speciation, suggests that many of these transmissions were ancient, and have been acted on by selection for millions of years.

Using log body mass ratios [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] as a proxy for predation, we do not see a statistically significant association between body mass ratio and non-zero transmission rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006466.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, blue; p = 0.678, coef. 95% CI [-0.311, 0.202]). We believe the lack of signal is likely due to the imperfect proxy, although it is also possible that predator-prey relationships do not strongly structure the CST network. It is also likely that geographic overlap and habitat similarity are ecological determinants of SIV CST, but modern primate habitats are likely very different since the time that these transmissions actually occurred.</p><fig id="ppat.1006466.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1006466.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Logistic regressions of body mass ratios (a proxy for predation) and host genetic distance on the probability of CST.</title><p>For each pair of host species, we (<bold>A</bold>) calculated the log ratio of their average body masses and (<bold>B</bold>) found the patristic genetic distance between them (from a maximum-likelihood tree of mtDNA).

Importantly, as already discussed, the strength of this association may be inflated by instances of lineage tracking (virus/host cospeciation). However, it is well established that increasing host genetic distance is associated with a higher species barrier [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. As previously documented in the literature we expect this is due to several factors, such as the divergence of host restriction factor genes, which are key components of the innate immune system (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) and differences in host cell receptor phenotypes (e.g., [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]).

As discussed above, our results support a view of lentiviral cross-species transmission as a rare event. Notably, only two lentiviruses have crossed the high species barrier from Old World monkeys into hominids: SIV<italic>smm</italic> and the recombinant SIV<italic>cpz</italic>. Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 have arisen in human populations in the last century [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].

HIV-2 has been acquired through at least 8 <italic>independent</italic> spillover events from sooty mangabeys [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].

However, these other viral exposures did not result in new endemic human pathogens either because of species-specific immune barriers, non-conducive epidemiological conditions, or a combination thereof. The rapid and repeated emergence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 is on a timescale more congruent with changes in epidemiological conditions than mammalian evolution, perhaps emphasizing the importance of the concurrent changes in human population structure and urbanization in facilitating the early spread of the epidemic [<xref rid="ppat.1006466.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].
