<p id="Par76">The carried out analysis represents a first attempt to investigate the impact of spatial heterogeneity in hospital accessibility on measles epidemiology, to quantify the hidden burden of measles in low-income settings, and to assess the effect of hospitalization in preventing death from severe measles disease. Epidemiological patterns identified through the performed analysis should be tested in other settings and may strongly depend on both levels of care available in health facilities [

If similar results will be confirmed, geographical heterogeneity in the hospitalization rates should be taken into account when estimating the burden of diseases and the effectiveness of the public healthcare system [
