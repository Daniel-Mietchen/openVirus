<p id="Par17">Here we analyze a sequence of annual measles epidemics, with 1819 hospitalized cases and 36 deaths, occurring from January 2013 to April 2017 in the South West Shoa Zone of the Oromia Region. Specifically, we describe the epidemiological characteristics of the observed epidemic, providing estimates of the disease transmissibility, incidence, and mortality at population level. In addition, we investigate the spatial heterogeneity characterizing both the detection and treatment of measles infections as a consequence of travel distance to the nearest hospital. The performed analysis highlights the potential hidden burden of disease caused by the heterogeneous access to primary health care in the region.</p>
