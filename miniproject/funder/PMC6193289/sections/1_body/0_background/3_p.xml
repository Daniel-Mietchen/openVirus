<p id="Par15">In particular, some recent epidemiological studies, focusing on a variety of illness conditions, have shown that larger travel distances to large health care facilities are associated with lower hospital admission rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and higher mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, these studies do not always differentiate between causes of hospitalization and death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and few recent works have documented measles mortality in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. As a matter of fact, the burden of disease is still often estimated on the basis of admitted hospital cases, representing a biased sample that does not reflect the severity of measles within the community [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].
