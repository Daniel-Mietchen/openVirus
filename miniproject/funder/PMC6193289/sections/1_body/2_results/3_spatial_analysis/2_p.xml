<p id="Par59">Estimated measles hospitalization rate dramatically decreases with travel distance from the hospital: from 31.0% (95% CI 15.9–45.0) in Woliso town to 5.7% (95% CI 3.0, 8.1) at 30 km from the hospital (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Remarkably, similar estimates were obtained by fitting the transmission model to cases observed in Woliso (Woliso town and Obi, Dilela, Gurura, and Korke kebeles), Wonchi, Ameya, and Goro separately (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In this case, estimates of woredas’ specific hospitalization rates range between 6.1% (95% CI 5.7–6.5) in Ameya and 15.9% (95% CI 15.0–17.0) in Woliso, with an average hospitalization rate in the hospital catchment area of 12.7% (95% CI 11.1–14.1) that is consistent with estimates obtained with the baseline model (see Additional file
