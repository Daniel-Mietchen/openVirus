<p id="Par61">Interestingly, we found that the relative risk of hospitalization at the Woliso hospital associated with different illness conditions and health care treatments decreases with distance as well (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). These results suggest that the estimated decrease in measles hospitalization with the distance from the hospital is ascribable to inequalities in access to health care due to travel distances from the nearest hospital. These results, combined with those coming from the cross-correlation analysis of time series of cases from distinct woredas, suggest that observed measles cases were the result of a unique synchronous epidemic with similar epidemiological characteristics across different woredas.
