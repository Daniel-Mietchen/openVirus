<p id="Par58">Differences in the case fatality rate among hospital admitted patients from different sites were not found statistically significant (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Significantly different cumulative incidences of hospitalizations by woreda and kebele were observed, with the largest values at 71 per 10,000 inhabitants in Woliso town (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d). Cumulative incidence of hospitalizations by kebele/woreda was significantly correlated to travel distance from Woliso (Pearson
