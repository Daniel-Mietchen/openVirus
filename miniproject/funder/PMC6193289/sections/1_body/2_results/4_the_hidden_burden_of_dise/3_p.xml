<p id="Par64">Averted deaths due to hospitalization in the main hospital’s catchment area resulted to be 1049 (95% 757–1342). However, our results suggest that hospital effectiveness in preventing deaths dramatically reduces with travel distance from the hospital, becoming negligible beyond 20–30 km from the hospital (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Our estimates suggest that the case fatality rate increases from 0.62% (95% CI 0.60–0.65) in Woliso town to more than 20%, on average, for sites that are more than 20 km far from the hospital (Fig.
