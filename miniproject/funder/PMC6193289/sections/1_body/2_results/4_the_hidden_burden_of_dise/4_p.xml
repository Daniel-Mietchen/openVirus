<p id="Par65">The estimated number of deaths and the resulting CFR in the main catchment area decrease with the fatality rate assumed among severe cases that were not hospitalized (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). However, if only half of the severe cases that were not hospitalized are assumed to die, the estimated average number of measles deaths exceeds 1100, only 3% of which were recorded at the hospital; the estimated CFR among all infections results larger than 9% (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
