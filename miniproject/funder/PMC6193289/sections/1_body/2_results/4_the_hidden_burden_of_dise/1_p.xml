<p id="Par62">The probability of severe illness once infected, based on measles inpatients from Woliso town, resulted in 0.30 (95% CI 0.16–0.43). The total number of severe measles cases in the Woliso hospital catchment area was consequently estimated to be 3821 (95% CI 1969–5671), only 1512 of which have been recorded among hospital admissions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, f</xref>). By assuming that all untreated severe measles cases died, a total number of 2337 deaths (95% CI 716–4009) were estimated, 28 of which were detected at the hospital. Accordingly, 98% of deaths remained unobserved.
