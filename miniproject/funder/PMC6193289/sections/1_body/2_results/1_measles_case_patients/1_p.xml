<p id="Par52">A total of 1819 case patients were recorded in Woliso hospital from January 1, 2013, to April 9, 2017 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Of these, 855 (47.0%) were female and 964 (53.0%) were male; 1512 patients (83.1%) were resident in the main hospital’s catchment area, consisting of Woliso, Wonchi, Goro, and Ameya woredas. The mean age was 6.0 years (range, 0–65); 1259 case patients (69.2%) were aged ≤ 4 years and 1486 (81.7%) were aged ≤ 10 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Records obtained during 2016 show that vaccinated admitted cases between 9 months and 5 years of age were 40.6%. In sub-Saharan Africa, different immunization rates may correspond to rural and urban areas [

However, by looking at the vaccination status of hospitalized measles cases, though only recorded for a small fraction of cases, we found that the fraction of vaccinated individuals among measles cases was not significantly different across woredas (proportional test
