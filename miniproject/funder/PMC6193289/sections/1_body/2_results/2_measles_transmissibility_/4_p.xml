<p id="Par57">The coverage of the 2013 SIA among residual susceptible individuals was estimated to be 18.7% (95% CI 11.9–24.3). The percentage of susceptible individuals at the beginning of 2013 was estimated to be 6.5% (95% CI 6.0–7.3). By assuming that the age distribution of observed measles cases mirrored the distribution of susceptible individuals across different age segments, we estimated the corresponding age-specific immunity profile of the population. This analysis showed that about 40% of children aged ≤ 2 years were not immunized against measles, while less than 10% of individuals aged &gt; 5 years were susceptible to measles (inset of Fig.
