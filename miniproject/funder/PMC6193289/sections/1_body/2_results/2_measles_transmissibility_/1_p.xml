Remarkably, even if based on the assumption of homogeneous mixing, the baseline transmission model well reproduced the number of measles cases observed over time, among different age groups: 0–6 years, 7–14 years, and &gt; 15 years (details in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Interestingly, we found that considering different transmission rate by age groups, as a consequence of heterogeneous mixing by age, does not improve the model ability in reproducing the observed time series of measles cases. The average reproduction number estimated with the baseline transmission model was
