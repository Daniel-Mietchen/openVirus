<p id="Par55">A strong seasonal pattern of transmission was consistently observed across the different woredas. Significant synchrony in the timing of epidemics in Woliso and most rural areas was observed (inset of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), so that the observed seasonal pattern was not an artifact of averaging asynchronous local epidemics. Model estimates suggest an average decrease in the force of infection of 27.8% (95% CI 21.6–33.2) between June and September, corresponding to school holidays and the rainy season.
