<p id="Par73">Obtained results are supported by spatial trends we identified in the relative risk of being hospitalized as a consequence of other illness conditions (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) and are consistent with what observed in previous studies on a variety of illness conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The role of distance as a barrier to health care access and affecting individuals’ mortality has been well documented by recent population-based studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], although most of them do not differentiate between causes of death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and between levels of care available in facilities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and none of these are focused on measles. In particular, a cross-sectional survey recently conducted in Ethiopia highlighted that children who lived more than 30 km from the health center had a two- to threefold greater risk of death than children who lived near to the health center [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similar results were found when considering either traveling distances or travel times [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In rural Tanzania, direct obstetric mortality was found to be four times higher at 35 km from hospital [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Finally, geographical clusters of acute abdominal conditions in India were found to have a nine times higher mortality rate and significantly greater distance to a well-resourced hospital [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
