<p id="Par75">The analysis has several limitations that should be considered in interpreting the results. The most important ones relate to the short observational period, the limited area considered, and the difficult task of quantifying unobserved severe measles cases. In particular, we assume that severe cases occurring within the main hospital’s catchment area that have not been reported at the Woliso hospital were not treated at all for measles disease. Although past studies have not found any association between child mortality and distance to small health facilities (e.g., health posts) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], most severe infections might have seek treatment at hospitals that are more distant than the Woliso one. In addition, factors other than distance such as individual sex, age, family’s income, and geographical heterogeneity in incidence levels of comorbidities and social support provided to families might have strongly affected the access to health care and the disease outcome of patients coming from different locations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Finally, misclassification of measles patients may always occur [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These limitations make it particularly difficult to reliably quantify untreated cases and estimate their fatality rate and the number of measles deaths, especially in absolute terms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other limitations of the proposed approach are determined by the lack of suitable data to model heterogeneous vaccination coverage within the hospital main catchment area, possible changes in the measles hospitalization rates over time, variations in the individual transmission rate of hospitalized cases, and seasonal variations of the population density as a consequence of migration flows between rural and urban areas.
