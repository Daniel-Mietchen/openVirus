<p id="Par69">Such a reduction may reflect changes in contact rates induced by either school closure or rainfalls. Indeed, in the Oromia Region, school holidays occur during the rainy season [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], possibly due to relatively low connectivity or an increase in urban density during the dry season as a consequence of migration from agricultural areas. As already observed in Niger [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the strong seasonality in measles transmission, combined with variations in vaccine uptake and in fertility rates may lead to erratic epidemiological patterns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], characterized by frequent stochastic fadeouts, and irregular large epidemics. Occasional large outbreaks may be followed by years of very few cases, with inter-epidemic periods of unpredictable length and frequency, during which the high fertility characterizing the country can produce a fast, possibly unnoticed, recruitment of susceptible individuals [
