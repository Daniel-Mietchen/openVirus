<p id="Par70">We found that the 2013 SIA might have reached less than 20% of residual susceptible individuals, which is much lower than the observed 75% reduction in the susceptible proportion produced by the first regional SIA conducted in southern Ethiopia in 1999 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and than the coverage levels estimated for SIAs conducted in other sub-Saharan countries (66â€“77%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The low impact of 2013 vaccination campaign with respect to past SIAs might have been influenced by problems in cold chain operations or vaccine maintenance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the short duration of this campaign. However, the low impact of 2013 SIA may also reflect difficulties in immunizing individuals who escaped routine programs and past immunization efforts, especially through vaccination activities performed as a response strategy to ongoing epidemics [
