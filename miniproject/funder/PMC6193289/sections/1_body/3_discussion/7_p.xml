<p id="Par72">The overall estimated cumulative incidence was 2.34% (95% CI 2.06–2.66) of the population in less than 5 years. CFR among hospitalized cases was 1.98% (95% CI 1.43–2.72). However, while only 36 deaths were recorded at the hospital, the spatial epidemiological analysis performed highlighted that the observed epidemics may have caused about 2300 additional deaths, consisting of severe cases that did not received any hospital treatment. These results suggest that the overall case fatality rate among all measles infections might have been between 5 and 30%, significantly higher than published estimates for epidemics occurred in 2005–2006 in Niger, Chad, and Nigeria, namely 4.2–8.1% [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Estimates obtained on the total number of deaths and on the overall case fatality rate strongly depend on the assumption that all unobserved severe measles cases died. On the one hand, this represents a worst-case scenario. On the other hand, it is worth considering that cases here defined as severe are those with critical complications requiring to occupy, for two or more consecutive nights, one out of the 200 beds of a hospital in Ethiopia serving a potential catchment area of roughly 1.3 Million people and representing the closest well-resourced heath facility that can provide adequate treatments and supportive care for 521,771 inhabitants.
