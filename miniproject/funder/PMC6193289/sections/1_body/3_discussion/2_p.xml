 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and coverage at 88%. In particular, the estimated age-specific serological profile is consistent with estimates recently provided for Ethiopia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], showing that, in 2015, 60% of susceptible individuals in Ethiopia were less than 5 years of age. These results suggest critically low immunization rates in recent birth cohorts.
