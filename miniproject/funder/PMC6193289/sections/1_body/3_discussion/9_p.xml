<p id="Par74">All these epidemiological evidences suggest that what was observed for measles in the South West Shoa zone may likely affect other diseases and characterize other low-income settings of sub-Saharan Africa. Obtained results highlight that epidemiological estimates, based on hospitalization records only, may dramatically underestimate the burden of measles and should be carefully considered to design adequate and effective surveillance activities. More, in general, as already suggested in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], disease burden estimates based on hospital data may be strongly affected by distance from the hospital, although the amount of underestimation of disease burden may differ by disease [
