<p id="Par71">Remarkably, we found that hospitalization rates and the effectiveness of passive surveillance based on hospital admissions, in both detecting measles and preventing measles-related deaths, dramatically decrease with travel distances from the hospital, becoming negligible beyond 20–30 km from the hospital. In particular, our estimates suggest that measles hospitalization rate decreases by about 80% within a 30-km travel distance from the hospital. These results are consistent with what observed in Kenya where all-cause admission rates were found to decrease by 11–20% with every 5-km increase in distance from the hospital [
