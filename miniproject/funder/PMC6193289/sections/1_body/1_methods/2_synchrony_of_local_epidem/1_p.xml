<p id="Par22">Synchrony in the timing of epidemics across different woredas was assessed by calculating the cross-correlation of time series at different time lags. The aim of this analysis is twofold: (i) to evaluate whether the observed seasonal pattern is an artifact of averaging asynchronous local epidemics and (ii) to support the hypothesis that observed measles cases were the result of a unique synchronous epidemic with similar epidemiological characteristics across different woredas.</p>
