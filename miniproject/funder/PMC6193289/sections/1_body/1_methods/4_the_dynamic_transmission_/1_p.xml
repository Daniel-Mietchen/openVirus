<p id="Par25">Measles transmission dynamics between 2013 and 2017 is simulated through a deterministic, non-stationary, age-structured transmission model. In the model, the population is stratified in 86 1-year age classes, according to available data on the age distribution of the Ethiopian population in 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The crude birth rate of the population is 0.0325 years
 <sup>−1</sup>; individuals die according to age-specific mortality rates as reported between 2013 and 2015 and reflecting a crude mortality rate of 0.0083 days
 <sup>−1</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The population of any age
