<p id="Par35">The fundamental quantity regulating disease dynamics is the basic reproduction number (defined as 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 〈
 <italic>β</italic>〉/
 <italic>γ</italic>, where 〈
 <italic>β</italic>〉 is the average of 
 <italic>β</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) over the year), which represents the average number of secondary infections in a fully susceptible population generated by a typical index case during the entire period of infectiousness. The larger the 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, the higher the disease transmissibility. If 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1, the infection will be able to spread in a population. Otherwise, the infection will die out. For endemic diseases like measles, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> provides insights into the proportion 
 <italic>p</italic> of population to be successfully vaccinated to achieve disease elimination; the equation 
 <italic>p</italic> = 1–1/
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is widely accepted (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). For instance, if 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> = 10, at least 90% of children have to be routinely immunized to eliminate the disease.
