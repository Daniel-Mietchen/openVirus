<p id="Par41">We investigate the spatial variation in the incidence of hospitalized patients in the population as a consequence of different illness conditions. The aim is to characterize the relationship between hospitalization and distance from the hospital. The relative risk of being hospitalized at different distances from the hospital was computed by considering the incidence of hospitalization in each kebele/woreda divided by the incidence of hospitalized cases from Woliso town. The relative risk was fitted by an exponential function using distance as the independent variable (i.e., by fitting a linear model to the logarithm of the relative risk without intercept). Finally, a proportional test was used to assess possible statistical differences in the case fatality rate at hospital between cases coming from different sites.</p>
