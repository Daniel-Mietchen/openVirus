<p id="Par40">In order to take into account the uncertainty on incidence estimates obtained with the dynamic model, 10,000 draws from the posterior distribution of incidence estimates associated with 10,000 samples of the posterior distribution of free model parameters were considered to generate a distribution of regression model fits. Obtained results therefore account for the combined uncertainty due to the regression model and the dynamic transmission model.</p>
