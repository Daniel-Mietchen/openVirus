<p id="Par36">A negative binomial regression was used to study the relationship between incidence of hospitalization by kebeles/woredas and distance from Woliso hospital. Specifically, the observed number of hospitalized cases from each spatial unit is the response variable, the distance from the hospital is the independent variable, and the estimated total number of measles cases in each spatial unit (as estimated by the transmission model) is used as the offset.</p>
