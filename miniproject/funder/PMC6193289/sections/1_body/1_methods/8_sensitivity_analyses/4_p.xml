<p id="Par46">We explored whether the assumption of homogeneous mixing, consisting in applying the same transmission rate to all age groups, can affect the model ability in reproducing the observed epidemiological patterns. To do this, we fitted the time series of cases with a transmission model encoding age-specific contacts as recently estimated for Ethiopia by Prem et al. [
