<p id="Par19">Data on age, sex, residence at woreda (i.e., district) and kebele (i.e., neighborhood) level, date of hospital admission, and death/discharge of measles case patients from 2013 to 2017 were obtained from the registers of Woliso hospital. Incidence of hospitalizations by woreda and kebele were calculated by assuming population projections for the 2014, based on the 2007 census conducted by the

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The case fatality rate (CFR) for hospital admitted cases was calculated as the percentage of fatal cases among measles patients recorded. Routine vaccination coverage for this area was derived from administrative records: on average, 88% of children are routinely vaccinated against measles at 9 months of age. Two immunization campaigns were conducted in the area from May 29 to June 5, 2013, and from March 13 to March 20, 2017, targeting children 9–59 months of age [
