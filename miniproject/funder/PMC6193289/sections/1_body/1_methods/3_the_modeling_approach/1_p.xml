<p id="Par23">The baseline analysis combines results of a dynamic transmission model, calibrated on the time series of hospitalized measles cases occurring between 2013 and 2017, with a spatial regression analysis, providing estimates of the measles hospitalization rate at different distances from the Woliso hospital. We restricted the analysis to measles cases from Woliso, Wonchi, Ameya, and Goro woredas, which represent the main hospital catchment area, consisting of 521,771 inhabitants and accounting for 83.1% of recorded case patients. Under the assumption of homogeneous mixing transmission, the baseline model provided estimates of the basic reproductive number (

 <sub>0</sub>), the age-specific immunity profile, and the average measles incidence in the considered area. The estimated total number of infection cases in the population was disaggregated into smaller spatial units (woredas and kebeles), by assuming the same incidence rate across all spatial units and proportionally to the population size of each spatial unit. A regression model was applied to counts of observed hospitalized cases in each spatial unit to estimate the corresponding hospitalization rate; distance from the hospital was used as the independent variable and the estimated total number of cases in each spatial unit as offset. Obtained results were used to quantify the hidden burden of measles disease.
