  <p>Sensitivity analysis. Total number of measles deaths (scaled on the left) and overall measles case fatality rate (scaled on the right) in the main hospital catchment area as estimated for different values of the fatality rate among severe cases that were not hospitalized. Estimates obtained with the baseline assumption are shown in orange. Vertical bars represent 95% of credible intervals. Percentages shown on top of the figure represent the estimated average proportions of deaths that were not reported at the hospital obtained with different values of the fatality rate among missed/untreated severe cases</p>
