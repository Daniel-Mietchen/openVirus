  <title>Nextstrain as a tool to visualize WNV evolution and spread.</title>
  <p>A depiction of the main interactive interface on Nextstrain to visualize the virus (
   <bold>A</bold>) phylogeny (time-resolved phylogenetic tree created with TreeTime, states listed by two-letter abbreviations, countries listed by three-letter abbreviations), (
   <bold>B</bold>) spread (inferred patterns of spread based on the tree, circle size is relative to the number of genomes that remained local), and (
   <bold>C</bold>) genetic diversity (amino acid diversity plotted as entropy and positioned by codon sequence). In the WNV genome, the protein abbreviations are as follows: C = capsid, prM = premembrane, E = envelope, NS1-5 = nonstructural protein 1â€“5. A live display, which can be used to select and zoom in on various features, can be found at
