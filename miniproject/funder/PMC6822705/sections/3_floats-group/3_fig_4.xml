  <title>International spread of WNV following its emergence in the US.</title>
  <p>Following the emergence of WNV in the US, the virus was detected throughout the Americas, from Canada to Argentina. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The colored branches on the tree correspond to (
   <bold>B</bold>) the lines on the map depicting spread. However, the limited number of available near-complete WNV genomes from each location and the long branches make it difficult to accurately map the patterns of spread and timing of introductions (e.g., the long orange branch on the tree may indicate that the virus may have traveled to many locations before being introduced in Brazil sometime between 2002 and 2018). Data from specific countries can be visualized on Nextstrain using the “Color By: Country” and “Filter by Country” functions. A live display can be found at
