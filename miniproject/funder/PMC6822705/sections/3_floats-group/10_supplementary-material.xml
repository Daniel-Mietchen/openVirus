  <title>Establishment of persistent local WNV transmission networks demonstrates endemicity.</title>
  <p>WNV is likely establishing persistent local transmission networks throughout the US, but this can be easily demonstrated from the 570 genomes available from New York (most generated by [
   <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]). Multiple co-occurring transmission chains (branches) exist derived from either local evolution or separate (re-)introductions, but several persist locally for 5 or more years indicating that those viruses became established. Data from other states can be visualized on Nextstrain by using the “Filter by State” function. A live display can be found at
