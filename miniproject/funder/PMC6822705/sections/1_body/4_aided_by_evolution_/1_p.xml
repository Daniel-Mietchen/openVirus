<p>While WNV continues to diversify, the direct role that evolution played during the emergence of WNV in the Americas is currently difficult to discern. Evolution of WNV and other mosquito-borne viruses is complicated due to their requirement to maintain fitness in alternating and quite disparate mosquito vectors and vertebrate hosts [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. As a result, the WNV evolutionary rate (approximately 4 × 10
