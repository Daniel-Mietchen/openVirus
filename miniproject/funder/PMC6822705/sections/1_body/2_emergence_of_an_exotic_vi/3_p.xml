<p>A still unsettled question is how the virus was brought into the US [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The primary mechanism by which dengue and Zika viruses spread around the world is the long-distance travel of infected humans (e.g., [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]). However, unlike these viruses, WNV is maintained in a transmission cycle between birds and mosquitoes, in which humans are considered “dead-end” hosts (i.e., do not contribute to the cycle). Therefore, mobility of infected birds or mosquitoes, rather than infected humans, is the more plausible mechanism for the introduction of WNV from the Middle East into the US. While migratory birds might be important dispersers of WNV worldwide [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], flyways between the Middle East and North America are not common [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], making an introduction via one of the two international airports located within the area of the 1999 New York City WNV outbreak a plausible hypothesis. Although it is impossible to determine exactly how WNV was introduced, more detailed future investigations into the patterns of WNV introductions worldwide may reveal new insights.
