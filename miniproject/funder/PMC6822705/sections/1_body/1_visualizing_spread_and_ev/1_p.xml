<p>Nextstrain (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">nextstrain.org</ext-link>) is an open-source initiative to use pathogen genome data to provide a real-time interactive view of the spread and evolution of significant human pathogens [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The concept was born from a large collaborative project to track influenza virus evolution using rapid virus sequencing and data sharing [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This aided the seasonal influenza vaccine selection process by identifying emerging virus strains that may have evolved resistance to previous vaccines [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Moreover, recent epidemics of Zika and Ebola have highlighted the need for not only real-time virus genome sequencing but also rapid dissemination of epidemiologically relevant results [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, Nextstrain was created to provide a publicly accessible and up-to-date overview of pathogen spread and evolution during outbreaks, facilitated through collaborations with subject matter experts. Alongside platforms such as Virological (
