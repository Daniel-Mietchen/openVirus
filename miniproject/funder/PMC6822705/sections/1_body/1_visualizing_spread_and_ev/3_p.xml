<p>We created a WNV Nextstrain resource in 2018 to convey the history of WNV in the Americas and promote new research directions (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/WNV/NA" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">nextstrain.org/WNV/NA</ext-link>; 
 <bold>
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008042.s001">S1 Fig</xref>
 </bold>). All of the figures herein were created using Nextstrain and contain live display links in each legend to allow the reader to explore the data. The analysis presented on Nextstrain can be recreated using our build pipeline found at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/grubaughlab/WNV-nextstrain" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">github.com/grubaughlab/WNV-nextstrain</ext-link>, which can be used to analyze any WNV dataset offline. Additionally, we designed a new narrative function in Nextstrain to accompany this review—accessible at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://nextstrain.org/narratives/twenty-years-of-WNV" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">nextstrain.org/narratives/twenty-years-of-WNV</ext-link>—which walks users through the epidemiological findings discussed here in a more condensed and interactive format. Mirroring the dynamic nature of such research, Nextstrain is constantly updated as new WNV genomes are shared publicly. Thus, the live display links will always contain the most up-to-date information, helping the readers stay current with the research.
