<p>Nextstrain is powered by a collection of open-source bioinformatic tools to curate, analyze, and visualize available virus genomes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These datasets are used to reconstruct the geographic structure and estimated virus spread using incorporated phylogenetic tools [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. To reduce runtimes, Nextstrain leverages TreeTime for the maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008042.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], through which the entire WNV dataset currently presented on Nextstrain (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2,267 genomes as of June 2019) can be analyzed in under an hour on a modern computer.
