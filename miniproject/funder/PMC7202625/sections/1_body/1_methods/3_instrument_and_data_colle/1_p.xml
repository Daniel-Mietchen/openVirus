<p>We populated questions for our semi-structured interview protocol from reviews of influenza vaccine perception studies [e.g., 
 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Interview topics included health information seeking behavior, influenza knowledge, vaccination history, vaccine perceptions and intentions, and responsibility toward others (refer to 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0232472.s001">S1 Appendix</xref> for the interview protocol). The IRB-approved interview protocol provided exact question wording to be used with each participant but allowed for flexibility in the question sequence given the natural flow of discussion. A semi-structured interview format not only ensured that data were exhaustively collected from all participants, but also functioned to minimize interviewer effects. Follow-up questions and probes were also asked during interviews to gather a more elaborated understanding of participants’ thoughts. Interviews were approximately 45 minutes long and were audio-recorded with participants’ consent.
