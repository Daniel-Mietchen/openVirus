<p>In Singapore, the threat of infectious disease spread is a high-priority public health concern. The high population density of the country exacerbates human-transmission of diseases like influenza and has been considered a potential “hot-spot” for disease outbreaks. This was indeed the case in 2003 when SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) was brought to Singapore by residents returning from overseas resulting in 238 infection cases and 33 deaths [

However, adequate influenza prevention requires substantial herd immunity fostered through individuals’ uptake of the seasonal vaccine. Unfortunately, experts’ recognition of the value of vaccines as an effective preventive tool may not be shared equally by the public. This sentiment toward vaccines is reflected in low immunization rates as Gan [

 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Given that disease incidence rates could be reduced with increased vaccine uptake [
