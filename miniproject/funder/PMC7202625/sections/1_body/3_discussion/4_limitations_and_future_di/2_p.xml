<p>Our study is the first qualitative research in Singapore to identify a typology of its older adults’ misperceptions about the influenza disease and its vaccine. Our findings provide public health practitioners an insight on the complexity of vaccine perceptions among one of the most vulnerable populations. Through this study, we hope that health professionals may be better informed of older adults’ concerns about influenza vaccination and in turn be able to refine their personal communication with this population in encouraging vaccination.</p>
