<p>Participants generally have some rudimentary knowledge of influenza, but also are likely to conflate symptoms with other diseases. The inability to correctly recognize influenza may encourage incorrect prevention and treatment practices among older adults. Further misperceptions about how influenza spreads and how it can be prevented pose significant concerns for this at-risk population as they neither understand the severity of the disease nor have the health knowledge to facilitate adoption of adequate practices to stop the spread of influenza. Therefore, misperceptions about influenza may inadvertently be putting this group at further risk to ancillary diseases and accidents and warrant future engagement regarding influenza transmission and prevention.</p>
