<p>Further aspects should be taken into account for future communication strategies that aim to reach a target group of 65+ years of age. Older adults face significant challenges concerning memory recall of knowledge-based appeals, and this is exacerbated by age as linear declines in fluency, memory, and perceptual speed are observed as people grow older [

 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] pointed out that older adults are inclined to rely more on emotion-evoking information and suggested that risk information may be portrayed with numeric displays, visuals and in narratives to enhance likelihood of message processing and increase message salience among older audiences. Orel, Spence, and Steele [
 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] proposed providing factual information to counteract misperceptions and discussing old age vulnerabilities to increase perceived disease susceptibility. Cummings [
 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] added that written instructions should be accompanied with verbal consultations with healthcare professionals to ensure message comprehension. Message tailoring to older audiences has also been recognized as an effective strategy in increasing information salience and can contribute to reducing information exposure barriers [
 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. These recommendations can be incorporated into future communication to improve knowledge about influenza. Sparks and Nussbaum [
 <xref rid="pone.0232472.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] suggested tailoring interpersonal messages to older adults’ personal characteristics and information processing abilities to improve health knowledge. While their recommendation was oriented toward older cancer patients, this advice is not any less useful for encouraging vaccination among older adults now that this group’s primary misperceptions about the influenza disease have been systematically identified in this study.
