<p>Influenza poses a significant public health challenge in Singapore with high morbidity and mortality particularly among older adults. However, vaccine uptake is observed to be low despite strong medical recommendations for older adults to regularly vaccinate against the seasonal influenza epidemics. This study thus explored older adults’ influenza disease and vaccine misperceptions with the aim of understanding barriers to vaccination and how these barriers may be remedied to improve this population’s health and well-being. Our results demonstrated poor health knowledge among our participants that is indicative of the contributing effects of misperceptions on Singaporean older adults’ hesitancy toward influenza vaccination. We discuss possible reasons for these misperceptions and how communication can enhance older adults’ health knowledge and ultimately their uptake of the influenza vaccine.</p>
