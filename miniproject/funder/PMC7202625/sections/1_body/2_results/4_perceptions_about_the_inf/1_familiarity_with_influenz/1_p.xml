<p>Influenza was largely unfamiliar among many participants with most acknowledging that they did not know much or anything about influenza. By and large the sample was unable to identify characteristics or determinant knowledge about the disease itself. One contributing factor is the use of multiple terms used to describe the disease and response. Many participants voiced confusion between the medical term “
 <italic>influenza</italic>” and the abbreviated term “
 <italic>flu</italic>” with many participants not recognizing it as the same disease. This was also observed with similar Mandarin Chinese translations (“influenza” = 流行性感冒 [or 流感 for short] versus “common cold” = 感冒). Terminology difference between “
 <italic>influenza vaccine</italic>” and the more colloquially used “
 <italic>flu shot</italic>” or “
 <italic>flu jab</italic>” also seem to obfuscate older adults’ ability to identify the disease and response: “
 <italic>Influenza means some sickness…influences the lungs</italic>. 
 <italic>Probably some kind of flu… I think influenza and flu are about the same family</italic>, 
 <italic>quite the same</italic>. 
 <italic>Flu may be passing flu</italic>, 
 <italic>sometimes flu may come and go but influenza may be more serious</italic>, 
 <italic>I don’t know</italic>. 
 <italic>I think so</italic>, 
 <italic>so I think</italic>.” (Male, interview 5). Knowledge about influenza among participants was therefore rudimentary and not comprehensive.
