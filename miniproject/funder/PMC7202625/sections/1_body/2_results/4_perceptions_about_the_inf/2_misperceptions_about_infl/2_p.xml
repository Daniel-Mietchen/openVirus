 <italic>Misperceptions about influenza characteristics</italic>. Influenza was not universally understood by participants and many reports were not wholly inaccurate. Beyond the misunderstanding of disease terms, participants described influenza as (a) a global epidemic, (b) a type of sickness of the lungs, (c) an effect of blood circulation, and (d) seasonal during year-end, during festive periods such as Chinese New Year, “
 <italic>rainy season</italic>” (Male, interview 61), or at the end of the year: 
 <italic>“Usually end of the year I get flu; I don’t know why</italic>. 
 <italic>Whole year round nothing happens but end of the year…”</italic> (Female, interview 26).
