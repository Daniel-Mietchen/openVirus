<p>Despite proven vaccine effectiveness against influenza infection, health officials face tangible and intangible challenges in encouraging vaccine uptake. While the influenza vaccine is one of the most affordable vaccines ranging between 30 and 40 Singapore Dollars (approximately 22 to 29 US Dollars), most participants wanted the vaccine to be cheaper or even cost-free. Participants reported that the government should provide more financial support for older citizens: “
 <italic>I think people will say it’s expensive for Singaporeans who don’t have enough money</italic>. 
 <italic>The government has to subsidize a bit for the poor people</italic>” (Male, interview 61). One participant also voiced concerns that doctors held profit interests as reasons for why they would recommend the vaccine in the first place. Vaccination was also regarded as an inconvenience given the need to travel and the long waiting hours at polyclinics. Other barriers mentioned included (a) a fear of injections, side effects and pain, (b) a lack of knowledge about the influenza vaccine, (c) religious objections, and (d) a dislike for taking any form of medication.
