  <title>Weekly ILI nowcasts for June 30, 2014 through March 14, 2016 using a non-constant (time-varying) delay distribution and 2-year moving window.</title>
  <p>(A) NobBS nowcasts along with (B) point estimate and uncertainty accuracy, as measured by the score and the prediction error, are compared to (C) nowcasts by the HH approach with (D) corresponding scores and prediction errors. For nowcasting, the number of newly-reported cases each week (blue line) are the only data available in real-time for that week, and help inform the estimate of the total number of cases that will be eventually reported (red line), shown with 95% prediction intervals (pink bands). For the HH approach, the 95% prediction intervals are very narrow and are thus difficult to see. The true number of cases eventually reported (black line) is known only in hindsight and is the nowcast target. The score (brown line) and the difference between the true and mean estimated number of cases (grey line) are shown as a function of time.</p>
