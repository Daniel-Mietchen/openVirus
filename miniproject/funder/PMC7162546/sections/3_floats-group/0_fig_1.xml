  <title>Weekly dengue fever nowcasts for December 23, 1991 through November 29, 2010 using a 2-year moving window.</title>
  <p>(A) Weekly NobBS nowcasts along with (B) point estimate and uncertainty accuracy, as measured by the score and the prediction error, are compared to (C) weekly nowcasts by the HH approach with (D) corresponding scores and prediction errors. For nowcasting, the number of newly-reported cases each week (blue line) are the only data available in real-time for that week, and help inform the estimate of the total number of cases that will be eventually reported (red line), shown with 95% prediction intervals (pink bands). The true number of cases eventually reported (black line) is known only in hindsight and is the nowcast target. Historical information on reporting is available within a 104-week moving window (grey shade) and used to make nowcasts. The score (brown line) and the difference between the true and mean estimated number of cases (grey line) are shown as a function of time.</p>
