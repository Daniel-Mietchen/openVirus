<p>While utilizing a similar modeling structure for case reporting delays as the HH model[
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], NobBS introduces a simple dependency between case counts over time; that is, changes in case counts between weeks are assumed to be related via a first-order random walk process on the logarithmic scale. This feature is critical in the context of infectious disease transmission, where the number of true infections in a given week mechanistically depends in part on the number of true infections in previous weeks due to the infectious process, whether the pathogen is transmitted directly or by vectors[
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hence, variations of autoregressive models are common in disease forecasting[

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Indeed, a recently published study describes a similar approach to NobBS [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], proposing the same model structure (an adaptation of the historic chain-ladder approach) and similar priors (namely, a first-order random walk on the underlying distribution of cases), finding that this approach performed well for two diseases. Two key differences in model structure are that NobBS parameterizes the delay distribution as a Dirichlet as opposed to a random walk, to model the underlying delay distribution as a probability vector, and omits a model intercept. We also aimed to identify and deconstruct the features that contribute to good performance, comparing to a benchmark approach and testing the robustness of NobBS to multiple delay distributions, different moving window sizes, and accuracy metrics. Our results suggest that this approach is robust across disease settings, and offers deeper insights into why: importantly, the temporal dependency between cases in the evolution of an outbreak.
