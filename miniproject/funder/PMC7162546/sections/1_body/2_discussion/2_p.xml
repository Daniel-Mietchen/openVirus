<p>Across diseases, NobBS outperformed the HH approach on accuracy of uncertainty estimates, and produced comparable or better point estimates. For the subset of weeks in which both models could produce forecasts (weeks with at least one case initially reported), point estimates for NobBS were substantially more accurate than the HH model for dengue cases (rRMSE improved by 300%) and slightly less accurate for ILI cases (rRMSE decreased by 19%). However, analysis of the probability distributions of the nowcasts revealed a much more substantial difference; the average score for NobBS was approximately twice as high for dengue and more than 10 times as high for ILI cases (
