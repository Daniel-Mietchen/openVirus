<p>Beyond supporting real-time disease tracking by public health officials, NobBS can complement existing disease forecast efforts by providing more accurate nowcasts to forecasting teams in the place of real-time reporting underestimates. For example, teams participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Epidemic Prediction Initiative (

NobBS can help account for later revisions to these data and therefore improve prospective estimates as well, though we note for FluSight this would require nowcasting not only the total number of cases each week, but also the number of patient visits to achieve the ILI% required for forecasts. To provide guidance in the practical implementation of NobBS, we outline considerations for prior choice, window choice, and other features in
