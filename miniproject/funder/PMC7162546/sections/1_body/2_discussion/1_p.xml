<p>We introduce an approach for Bayesian nowcasting, NobBS, and demonstrate its application in two disease contexts with different reporting systems, investigating the conditions that contribute to successful implementation. We show that NobBS outperforms an existing method in terms of point estimate (reduced RMSE, lower bias) and probabilistic (higher logarithmic score) predictive performance. In particular, NobBS performs well even when the delays in case reporting change over time. We further demonstrate an important trade-off related to moving window sizes for delay distribution estimates; short windows improve the real-time characterization of the delay distribution but are susceptible to over-estimating that variability, potentially decreasing nowcast accuracy. Lacking any disease-specific parameterization, and relying only on historical trends of case reporting as input, this approach can be immediately adapted in a variety of disease settings.</p>
