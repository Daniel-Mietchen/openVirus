<p>As a result, when reporting delays are time-varying, as is often the case in epidemics[
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], we show that the NobBS approach is less accurate compared to its performance in a stable delay distribution, but still shows improvement over the HH approach likely because the NobBS approach is informed by the number of cases experienced in previous weeks, not just the delay distribution, making it more robust to larger fluctuations. As mentioned, the HH approach software includes the option to model a time-varying delay explicitly in the nowcast approach, but requires specifying the time at which the delay distribution is expected to change (the change-point), which is generally not known in real-time. In addition, the authors of the HH approach introduce a feature to model the epidemic curve smoothly, however the implementation is bundled with the change-point model, and is therefore not possible to implement without the change-point component. In the case of the ILI and dengue data, there was no reason to believe reporting changed systematically at any point during the years covered by the data used here, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007735.s010">S4 Fig</xref> illustrates that a change-point model would likely be inappropriate given the irregular fluctuations in the delay probabilities over time. However, both features may improve performance of the HH model depending on the context, in particular when facing time-varying delays.
