<p>We also found that the accuracy of predictions is related at least in part to the number of cases reported to the surveillance system in week 0. When a larger proportion of cases were reported with no delay, as was the case for ILI compared to dengue, the point estimate accuracy was higher. This is not surprising, as a large fraction of true cases reported initially leaves fewer cases left to predict.</p>
