<p>Lastly, the NobBS approach requires a trade-off between flexibility and precision when specifying the moving window size. With a shorter moving window the model will be more sensitive to recent reporting delay data, that could otherwise be “smoothed out” by the additional historical data considered by longer moving windows. While a narrower window allows more flexibility capture time-changes in the delay distribution, estimates of the parameters governing the random walk will be more volatile, with fewer data points from which to be estimated. In our experiments, the combination of shorter moving windows with rapid changes in cases reported produced large estimated variances, which often decreased the accuracy of nowcasts. We note that the moving window size is ultimately a choice by the modeler and should reflect consideration of available data and the desired smoothness of trends to be estimated; we discuss more in
