<p>Nowcasting, or “predicting the present,” is an approach to mitigate the impact of reporting delays. With origins in the insurance claims and actuarial literature[

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], nowcast models aim to estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported events (e.g. insurance claims, disease cases) at any given time based on an incomplete set of reports. In public health settings, nowcasting approaches have been explored for AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s[

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] as a consequence of the long incubation period from HIV infection until development of AIDS. More recently, nowcasting has been applied to infectious disease outbreaks such as foodborne illness outbreaks[

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These studies draw principally on survival analysis and actuarial techniques to model the reporting delay and draw inferences based on historical patterns. A majority of studies have strictly focused on modeling the reporting delay distribution—a legacy of the actuarial techniques giving rise to many of these approaches—and generally neglect a key feature of outbreaks: that future cases are intrinsically linked to past reported cases, a fact that creates potentially strong autocorrelation in the true number of cases over short time intervals. In other words, the infectious disease transmission process provides an additional signal of the number of cases to be expected in the near future that has not been included in common methods such as the reverse-time hazard model[

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and the chain ladder method[
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which model the probability of delays in case reporting and consider the number of cases at successive time points as independent. However, proposals to extend the chain ladder approach to state-space models that account for temporal relationships in reporting have existed in the literature since the development of these techniques[

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and have been applied in at least one infectious disease context[
