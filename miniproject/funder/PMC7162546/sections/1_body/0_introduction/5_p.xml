<p>Here, we implement a relatively disease-agnostic nowcast method in multiple real-world and simulated disease reporting settings, and unpack the features of model structure and implementation that contribute to its performance. We introduce Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing (NobBS), a simple and flexible generalized Bayesian model and associated software package for nowcasting infectious diseases. We demonstrate the robustness of this approach in two very different disease surveillance contexts and identify the conditions that favor its application, especially when the reporting delay distribution is time-varying. Specifically, NobBS allows for both uncertainty in the delay distribution and the time evolution of the epidemic curve, producing smooth, time-correlated estimates of cases. We demonstrate that NobBS performs well for weekly nowcasts of (1) dengue cases in Puerto Rico and (2) influenza-like illness (ILI) cases in the United States, requiring no disease-specific parameterization despite the two pathogens being very different (vector-borne vs. directly transmitted) and exhibiting substantially different reporting delays. Lastly, we test NobBS against a previously developed Bayesian nowcast method for surveillance data[
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and find that NobBS outperforms this established method for both diseases and multiple time periods. In particular, we show that while point estimates of the models are similar when time-to-report distributions are relatively fixed over time, NobBS improves the estimation of uncertainty and accommodates temporal variation in delay probabilities. Our investigation aims to provide deeper insights into these different nowcast approaches and describe the practical implementation of NobBS. We present an R package, “NobBS,” as a tool to complement both routine public health surveillance as well as forecasting efforts.
