<p>Despite the importance of timely surveillance data, substantial challenges exist to collect and report case information in real time. Multiple features of the disease and surveillance system contribute to reporting delays, including: delays in symptoms onset after infection; delays in medical care-seeking after onset; delays in providers obtaining and reporting diagnostic information; level of awareness of disease activity influencing care-seeking and reporting; and system-level processing delays, a result of complex and multi-tiered disease reporting and communication systems interacting at multiple administrative levels[

As a consequence, surveillance data are typically not complete until weeks or months after infections have actually occurred, providing an incomplete picture of current disease activity.
