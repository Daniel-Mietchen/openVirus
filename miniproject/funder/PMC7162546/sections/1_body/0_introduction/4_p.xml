<p>The development of nowcast models is promising for disease surveillance, but equally important is the need to identify and scrutinize the mechanisms by which these approaches are successful in accurately predicting true case reports and, on the other hand, underperform. For example, it is critical to demonstrate performance in a diversity of settings as a majority of disease nowcast models to date have largely focused on performance in specific applications, but not the common challenges that exist across many different diseases. To wit, in this investigation we find that nowcasting is especially challenging when the proportion of cases reported the week they occur (delay 0) is low and reporting delays are highly variable; we know of no investigations that specifically identify models that perform well in these commonly occurring circumstances. As a result, the characteristics of robust and broadly-applicable models are difficult to identify. Additionally, several previous models have largely focused on providing point estimates of the number of cases. Point estimates may be helpful, but quantifying the uncertainty in those estimates is even more important in the context of infectious disease outbreaks because uncertainty is intrinsic, and accounting for plausible outcomes apart from the point prediction is critical.</p>
