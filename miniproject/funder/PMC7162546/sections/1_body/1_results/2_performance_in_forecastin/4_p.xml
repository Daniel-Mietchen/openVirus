<p>To assess the degree of autocorrelation and related smoothness in the NobBS predictions, we calculated the 1-week lagged autocorrelation of predictions (ρ
 <sub>a</sub>) and compared this to the 1-week lagged autocorrelation of cases (ρ
 <sub>c</sub>). In addition, we computed metrics reflecting the accuracy of the approaches in capturing the 
 <italic>change</italic> in cases from week-to-week: the mean absolute error of the change (MAEΔ) and the RMSE of the change (RMSEΔ) (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The magnitude of change was much larger for the ILI data than dengue data, with average absolute value change of 1,312.6 cases/week versus 9.8 cases/week, yet both showed high autocorrelation (ρ
 <sub>c</sub> = 0.958 for dengue and ρ
 <sub>c</sub> = 0.972 for ILI). Comparing the full time series, the nowcasts produced by NobBS exhibited high autocorrelation for both diseases (ρ
 <sub>a</sub> = 0.876 for dengue, 0.973 for ILI) while the HH approach yielded lower autocorrelation for dengue nowcasts, comparatively (ρ
 <sub>a</sub> = 0.631 for dengue, 0.970 for ILI). For dengue, over the weeks in which at least 1 case was initially reported, the NobBS approach achieved both lower mean absolute difference between predicted and observed changes in cases (NobBS MAEΔ = 23 vs. HH MAEΔ = 50) and lower RMSE of the change (NobBS RMSEΔ = 35.8 vs. HH RMSEΔ = 64.6). In addition, NobBS outperformed the HH approach over the full time series of dengue cases (
