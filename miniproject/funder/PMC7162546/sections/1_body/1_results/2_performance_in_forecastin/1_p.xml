 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007735.g002">2</xref> show weekly dengue and ILI nowcasts for NobBS and the HH approach over multiple seasons for both diseases. 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> summarizes the point and probability-based accuracy metrics for each, where higher accuracy is indicated by higher average scores, lower MAE, RMSE, and rRMSE, and lower distance from 0.95 for the 95% PI coverage. Because the NobBS model accounts for both under-reporting and the autocorrelated progression of transmission across successive weeks, it makes predictions even in weeks when there are no cases reported for the week. Conversely, the HH model does not make nowcasts for weeks in which there are no initial case reports (common in the dengue Puerto Rico data), hence the nowcasts in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007735.g001">1C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007735.g002">2C</xref> appear as discontinuous lines. To compare models despite these differences, we report accuracy metrics between NobBS and the HH approach for both (1) the full time series of the data and (2) weeks when at least one case was reported in the first week, i.e. the subset of weeks for which both models could make predictions (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We also computed error metrics for the HH model for the full time series by assigning point estimates of 0 cases for nowcasts in weeks without predictions.
