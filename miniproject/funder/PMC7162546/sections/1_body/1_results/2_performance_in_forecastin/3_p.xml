<p>Nowcast point estimates tracked the ILI time series well for both approaches, though point estimates had greater error by all measures for the NobBS approach (NobBS rRMSE = 0.074 vs. HH rRMSE = 0.062; 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, the NobBS approach produced considerably wider prediction intervals (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007735.g001">1C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007735.g002">2C</xref>) resulting in both higher scores (NobBS average score = 0.218 vs. HH average score = 0.017) and 100% coverage by the 95% prediction intervals compared to 0% coverage for the HH (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We observed that at multiple deciles of the prediction interval, the interval provided conservative coverage, but that the calibration of narrower intervals was better (
