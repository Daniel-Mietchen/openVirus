<p>The HH approach made predictions in only 55% of weeks in the dengue time series (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In this subset of weeks, the NobBS approach achieved relatively smooth and accurate tracking of the dengue time series (rRMSE = 0.464, average score = 0.274) despite low proportions of cases reported on the week of onset (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007735.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). The 95% PI coverage was 0.85, indicating that the 95% PI included the true number of cases for 85% of the nowcasts. In comparison, the HH approach produced substantially less accurate point estimates and slightly broader uncertainty intervals (rRMSE = 1.24, average score = 0.161, 95% PI coverage = 0.90) with greater fluctuation in nowcasts from week-to-week (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007735.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). On average, the HH approach led to more biased estimates and systematically overpredicted the number of cases for both ILI and dengue compared to NobBS. Because many weeks in the dengue data were low incidence, assigning a prediction of 0 to the HH approach’s missing nowcasts improved its rRMSE to 1.14 in the full time series compared to 1.24 for the subset over which nowcasts were generated from the model, though NobBS still surpassed the HH model’s accuracy on this and all other metrics (
