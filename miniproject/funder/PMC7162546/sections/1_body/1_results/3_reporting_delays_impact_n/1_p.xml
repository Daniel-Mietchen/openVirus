<p>The delay distributions between the reporting systems are strikingly different (Figs

In the case of the dengue surveillance system, which includes specimen collection and laboratory testing, only approximately 4% of cases were processed during the week of onset, on average. In contrast, the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness (ILI) Surveillance Network (ILINet) captures only syndromic data reported electronically, with over 80% of ILI cases reported, on average, the same week they present (i.e. with no delay). Overall, we observed that the accuracy of nowcast point estimates (rRMSE) was higher for the ILI data compared to dengue, which may be related to the high proportion of cases reported with 0-weeks delay in these data. Large weekly absolute changes in the number of initial case reports also appeared to be related to increased error, particularly for dengue, which had high fluctuations in the number of initial reports over time (
