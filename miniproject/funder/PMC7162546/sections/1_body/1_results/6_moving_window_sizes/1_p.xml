<p>We initially used moving windows of 104 weeks for dengue (a longer time series) and 27 weeks for ILI (a shorter time series) to leverage a large number of historical training weeks to train nowcast estimates. Moving windows allow for stable estimation of the recent delay distribution as information from very old and potentially less relevant weeks are forgotten. The size of the moving window reflects how quickly and smoothly changes in the data should be realized by the model: longer moving windows tend to produce smoother estimates, but the model may be less sensitive to abrupt changes in the data (e.g. changes in how quickly cases are reported during an outbreak) or shorter-interval secular trends, e.g. seasonality.</p>
