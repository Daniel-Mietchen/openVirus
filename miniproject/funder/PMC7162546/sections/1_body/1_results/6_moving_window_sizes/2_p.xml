<p>While we chose long moving windows for both diseases to capitalize on data availability, these considerations may affect the choice of moving window size and nowcast performance, depending on the data. In light of this, we experimented with moving windows of different lengths on the dengue data to assess the impact on nowcast performance. We tested moving windows of 5, 12, and 27 weeks (approx. 6 months) on the dengue data and, for each moving window, generated a set of nowcasts for December 1991-November 2010 in order to compare performance measures across all moving window sizes (5, 12, 27, and 104 weeks). A 5-week moving window produced substantially lower accuracy nowcasts (rRMSE = 7.381) with several steep case overestimates in 2007–08 and 2010 (
