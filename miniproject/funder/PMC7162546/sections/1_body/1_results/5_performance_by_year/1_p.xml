<p>The performance of both approaches in nowcasting ILI was relatively consistent by year across accuracy measures, but there were fluctuations in the year-to-year performance of dengue nowcasts (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Average scores of the dengue nowcasts (from both approaches) tended to be high in years that experienced a very low number of dengue cases (e.g. 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006), and therefore the performance of both approaches declined during higher incidence years. For dengue, the NobBS model was particularly effective at identifying periods of low incidence, with high probabilities assigned to the lowest outcome bin (0â€“25 cases, details in 
 <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>) when the number of cases eventually reported was low (

On the other hand, during periods of high dengue activity, lower probabilities were assigned to the correct bin, reflecting greater uncertainty. Looking specifically at higher incidence time periods (Epidemiologic Weeks 40 through 20 of the following year for ILI, and all weeks in which the number of cases exceeded 50 for dengue), both nowcast approaches were less accurate and more uncertain than during other time periods (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007735.s005">S4 Table</xref>). Overall, NobBS outperformed the benchmark approach on all performance measures for each year and most higher incidence time periods (
