<p>Both approaches had their lowest accuracy on three high incidence dengue seasons: 1994, 2007, and 2010 (

These scores not only reflect unusually poor point estimate predictions as judged by rRMSE, but also the finding that the predictive distribution for weeks in these years for both approaches rarely included the true value of interest (a consequence of dramatic over- or underestimates during times of high disease activity).
