<p>Time-varying delays may be explicitly modeled in the HH approach, by pre-specifying the temporal change-points at which the delay distribution is expected to changeâ€“information that is rarely known in real-time. We therefore compared NobBS to the HH approach without explicitly modeling a time-varying delay distribution in either method. In the case of ILI and dengue data, we had no reason to believe or anticipate a systematic change in reporting over the time period covered.</p>
