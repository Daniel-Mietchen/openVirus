<p>Dengue and ILI also exhibit differences in the 
 <italic>trends</italic> of reporting delay probabilities 
 <italic>over time</italic>, and we observed strikingly different comparative performance of the two nowcast approaches in these disease settings, namely that the HH approach performed comparably to NobBS for ILI but not for dengue. In the dengue data, we observe a noisier, more time-varying probability of reporting for cases, with more extreme fluctuations in the proportion of initial reports compared to ILI cases, which show more constant (tighter ranges of) reporting probabilities from week-to-week (

Independent of the initial proportion of cases reported (high vs. low), we hypothesized that these trends (relatively constant vs. time-varying) are particularly impactful on the performance of the nowcast, and that relatively constant reporting probabilities, as seen in the ILI data, may be linked to the higher accuracy of these predictions.
