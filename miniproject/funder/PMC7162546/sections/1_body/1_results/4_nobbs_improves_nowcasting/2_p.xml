<p>To test the robustness of the model, we simulated ILI data using the final counts from the true dataset, but imposing a time-varying delay distribution; specifically, with faster initial reporting during weeks of high incidence to reflect heightened awareness of an outbreak and increased urgency of reporting (described in 
 <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>). Using these simulated data, we found that NobBS was relatively robust to changes in reporting delays (

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007735.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). However, in the presence of simulated time-varying reporting delays, NobBS outperformed the HH in terms of confidence (NobBS average score = 0.06 vs. HH average score â‰ˆ 0), point estimates (NobBS rRMSE = 0.302 vs. HH rRMSE = 0.621), and accuracy of the predicted change (
