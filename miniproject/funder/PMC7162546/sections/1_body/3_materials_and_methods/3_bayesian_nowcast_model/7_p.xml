<p>We place weakly informative priors on 
 <italic>θ</italic> representing a small number of hypothetical total cases (n = 10) distributed across delay bins, loosely representing the empirical probability of reporting delays for each delay 
 <italic>d</italic> observed in the first two years of data for dengue and the first 6 months of data for ILI (training periods). As a sensitivity, we also placed weak priors on 
 <italic>θ</italic> treating all delays with equal probability, but there was no material difference in the results.
