<p>The maximum delay 
 <italic>D</italic> can be identified as the maximum observable delay in the data, which may change as the time series extends, or can be fixed at some value 
 <italic>D</italic> thought to represent a very long delay. In the latter case, 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>D</italic>
 </sub> can be modeled as the probability of delay ≥ 
 <italic>D</italic>. For dengue, we choose to fix 
 <italic>D</italic> at 10 weeks, since over 99% of the cases observed in the first two years (prior to producing out-of-sample nowcasts) were reported within 10 weeks. For influenza, we chose 
 <italic>D</italic> to be the longest possible delay within the 27-week moving window, or 
 <italic>D</italic> = 26. The implications of choosing a maximum delay 
 <italic>D</italic> within a moving window of 
 <italic>W</italic> weeks means that the nowcast will include all cases arising with delays greater than or equal to 
 <italic>D</italic> but less than or equal to 
 <italic>W</italic>, thus excluding all cases with delays greater than 
 <italic>W</italic> (see the reporting triangle in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007735.s006">S6 Table</xref>).
