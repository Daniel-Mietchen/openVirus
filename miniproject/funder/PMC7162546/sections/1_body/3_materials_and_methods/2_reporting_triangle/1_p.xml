<p>Delays in reporting are often structurally decomposed into a (
 <italic>T</italic> x 
 <italic>D</italic>) dimensional “reporting triangle,” where 
 <italic>T</italic> is the most recent week (“now”) and 
 <italic>D</italic> is the maximum reporting delay, in weeks, observed in the data. The data are right-truncated, since at any given week 
 <italic>t</italic>, delays longer than 
 <italic>T–t</italic> cannot be observed. For example, at week 
 <italic>t = T</italic>, only the cases reported with delay 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0 are observable; cases reported with longer delays (i.e. 1- or 2-week delays, 
 <italic>d = 1</italic> or 
 <italic>d = 2</italic>) will be known in future weeks. In 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007735.s006">S6 Table</xref>, we present an example of the reporting triangle using ILI data.
