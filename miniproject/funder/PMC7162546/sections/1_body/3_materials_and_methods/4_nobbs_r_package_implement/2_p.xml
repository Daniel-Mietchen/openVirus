<p>However, in “NobBS” all of these features are customizable and it is possible to leverage existing knowledge or historical information to impose more informative priors on the data. For example, it may be already known in the surveillance field that cases of dengue fever are rarely reported the same week they occur (i.e. that the probability of delay 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0 is very low), but that most cases are reported within 4 weeks. In this example, it would be possible to design a stronger prior on 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>d</italic>
 </sub> such that 
 <italic>θ</italic> = (3,30,50,10,4,3), indicating that out of 100 cases distributed across delays, 3% of cases are expected to be reported with no delay, 30% of cases with a 1-week delay, 50% of cases with a 2-week delay, 10% of cases with a 3-week delay, 4% of cases with a 4-week delay, and 3% of cases with a 5-week delay. In other words, the user may directly parameterize the Dirichlet prior using knowledge of the delay distribution, and the sum of 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>d</italic>…
  <italic>D</italic>
 </sub> is related to the strength of the prior. Historical information (e.g. reporting data from the last several months or years) may also be used to inform the Dirichlet prior, such as through plotting the empirical distribution of delays in case reports. In the present study, for example, the observed delay distribution over the initial model training period was used to inform weakly informative Dirichlet priors for dengue and ILI, with the sum of 
 <italic>θ</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>d</italic>…
  <italic>D</italic>
 </sub> being small.
