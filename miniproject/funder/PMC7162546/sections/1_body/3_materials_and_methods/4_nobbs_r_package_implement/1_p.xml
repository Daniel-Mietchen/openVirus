<p>In the R package “NobBS” (

Dates are assumed to be in a sequence of weeks or months, with no gaps in reporting (i.e. no weeks for which reporting did not happen). By default, the model runs a Poisson log-linear model with no moving window (i.e. all historical data is taken into account), a maximum delay 
 <italic>D</italic> equal to 1 minus the length of the reporting time series (i.e. if 12 consecutive weeks of report data are provided, the longest possible delay is equal to 11 weeks), and ignoring any delays longer than 
 <italic>D</italic> (because they are unobserved in the default implementation). By default, a weakly informative Ga(0.01,0.01) prior is placed on the precision of the first-order random walk,
