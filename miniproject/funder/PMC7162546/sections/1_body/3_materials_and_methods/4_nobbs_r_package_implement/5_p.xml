<p>Specifying a moving window size (e.g. a moving window of 27 weeks) may be leveraged for computational advantage (faster runtime) or to reflect the belief that the delay distribution of very old reports is no longer relevant to inform current reports. Alternatively, the user may prefer to let the moving window expand each week, especially to leverage as much prior data as possible to inform the nowcasts in the absence of available historical information. As discussed in Results, the estimation of the parameters is sensitive to how much historical data is used to fit the model, and this decision is up to the user and could depend on the relevant disease reporting system. The moving window acts to consider (or “weight”) all past observations equally, and shortening the moving window reflects the extent to which the user wishes to consider only more recent data as informative–noting also that shorter moving windows produce more volatile estimates of delay probabilities (which generally increases the accuracy of) as well as more volatile estimates of the variance of the random walk (which generally decreases the accuracy of). Still, these parameters may be constrained through their priors as discussed above.</p>
