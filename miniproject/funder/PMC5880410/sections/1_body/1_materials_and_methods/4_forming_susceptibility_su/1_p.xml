 <sup>+</sup> T-cell mediated immune response can only be mounted against a virus if epitopes from the virus are presented by HLA class-I molecules. The binding between the epitope and the passing CTL takes place through a receptor called the T cell receptor (TCR). Not all TCRs are capable of recognising all viral epitopes. Thus if an individual presents a large number of high affinity epitopes, it is reasonable to assume that there is an enhanced probability that one or more of these epitopes can be recognised by their TCRs. Such individuals can be argued to have low susceptibility to the virus. Conversely, the ability of the immune system to present only a small number of epitopes will reduce the chance that they can be recognised. Such individuals can be argued to be more susceptible to the viral infection. This link between HLA class-I genotypes and disease susceptibility is supported, among others, by [
