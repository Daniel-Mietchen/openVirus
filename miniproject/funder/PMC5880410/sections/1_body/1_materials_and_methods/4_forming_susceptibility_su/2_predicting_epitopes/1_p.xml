<p>For a given H1N1 influenza viral strain 
 <italic>V</italic> and particular ethnicity 
 <italic>E</italic> forming an epidemic pair (
 <italic>E</italic>, 
 <italic>V</italic>), we predict the entire set of epitopes presented by each HLA class-I allele in that ethnicity using different algorithms available through the IEDB analysis resource [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. A consensus of three algorithms is used: an artificial neural network [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], a stabilized matrix method [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], and a combinatorial peptide-library based method [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. These three algorithms use very different approaches for predicting epitopes for a given HLA allele. In a study carried out by Sette et. al., all peptides with strong binding affinity, 
 <italic>IC</italic>50 &lt; 50
 <italic>nM</italic>, with their cognate allele were found to be immunogenic [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. We restrict ourselves to predictions with high likelihood of being immunogenic by ensuring coincident prediction by all three algorithms, and by only considering epitopes with predicted 
 <italic>IC</italic>50 &lt; 50
 <italic>nM</italic>. From these results, we compute the number of high affinity epitopes presented by each individual, represented by their HLA genotype, in the population.
