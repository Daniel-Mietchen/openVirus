<p>We note that a long left tail of the distribution represented by 
 <italic>SPV</italic> would result in 
 <italic>Sk</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>) &lt; 0, indicating the presence of a small number of individuals with susceptibility significantly lower than the mean. On the other hand, when the population has a small representation of individuals with susceptibility significantly higher than the mean, we have 
 <italic>Sk</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>) &gt; 0.
