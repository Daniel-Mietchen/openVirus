<p>We represent different epidemic scenarios in terms of 
 <italic>epidemic pairs</italic>, formed by considering both the pathogen (different influenza strains) and the specific population (in this work, ethnicities) with different sub-population structures. We then use the SIR framework to track the spread of influenza through the population. The ordinary differential equations used in the model are coded in Matlab and solved numerically using Matlabâ€™s 
 <italic>ode45</italic> solver.
