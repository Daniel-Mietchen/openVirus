<p>Since individuals in all the ethnicities are considered to be homogeneously mixed and all our numerical computations are carried out with the same number of individuals (
 <italic>N</italic> + 
 <italic>a</italic> = 10
 <sup>4</sup>), we assume the parameter 
 <italic>c</italic> to be the same for all the epidemic pairs under consideration. Further, since our interest is in analysing the impact of susceptibility heterogeneities in the spread dynamics, we take 
 <italic>Î±</italic> to be the same regardless of the epidemic pair (
 <italic>E</italic>, 
 <italic>V</italic>) under consideration. Thus, when comparing the spread dynamics between two epidemic pairs, heterogeneity in susceptibilities emerges as the main factor in our models determining the difference in these dynamics.
