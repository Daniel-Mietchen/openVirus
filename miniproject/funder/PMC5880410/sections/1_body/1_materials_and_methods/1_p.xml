<p>To model epidemics at the population level, we use a deterministic SIR epidemic model. We describe a population as being formed out of a number of sub-populations. Each sub-population is defined according to their specific susceptibility to the viral strain. To define these sub-populations in practice, starting from biological data, we employ the probabilistic method developed in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This method uses well-tested and benchmarked algorithms for epitope prediction [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] to predict the viral epitopes presented by individuals represented by different HLA class-I genotypes. We link these genotypes to individual susceptibility against the pathogen. We can then group individuals with comparable susceptibilities into well-defined sub-populations.
