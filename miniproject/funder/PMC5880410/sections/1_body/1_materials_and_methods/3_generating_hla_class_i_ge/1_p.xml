<p>The frequency of different HLA class-I alleles for different ethnicities estimated through large-scale genotyping is available from public databases [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Each individual possesses three pairs of HLA class-I genes. One HLA-A, -B and -C allele is obtained from each parent. Provided we assume that these 6 alleles occur independent of each other, we can draw 2 genes each from the full set of possible A, B and C alleles, sampling them according to the empirically measured prevalence of that allele in the population. Each combination of 6 alleles is referred to as an HLA genotype. The likelihood of finding an individual with the exact HLA genotype generated, is given by the product of the likelihood of finding each of the 6 alleles comprising the genotype. A generated genotype is only accepted if the likelihood of finding an individual with that genotype is larger than 10
