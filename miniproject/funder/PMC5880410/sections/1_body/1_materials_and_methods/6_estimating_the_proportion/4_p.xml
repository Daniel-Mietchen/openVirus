<p>In this work, we use the value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimated in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] for the Mexico City population for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic originating in Mexico La-Gloria. This was chosen as a reference because HLA class-I allele frequency for this ethnicity, as well as the protein sequence of this viral strain were available. In [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], an exponential curve was fit to the data of number of infections over time during the initial phase of the epidemic. The distribution thus estimated was used to compute 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. The 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimated in this manner was 1.72. We use this 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> to compute 
 <italic>β</italic> for this epidemic pair, and use the epitopes and sub-populations for the pair (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) = (Mexico City Mestizo pop 2, A/Mexico/LaGloria-8/2009) to estimate 
 <italic>y</italic>. We note that we are using a particular 
 <italic>β</italic> estimated in the literature for a specific pair (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) for computing 
 <italic>y</italic>, and then considering 
 <italic>y</italic> to be the same across different pairs. By doing this, we are 
 <italic>scaling</italic> the rate of the 
 <italic>event</italic>
 <italic>S</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> + 
 <italic>I</italic> → 
 <italic>I</italic> + 
 <italic>I</italic> in all the simulations for any pair (
 <italic>E</italic>, 
 <italic>V</italic>) to the value of 
 <italic>β</italic> obtained from data for the given pair (
 <italic>E</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>).
