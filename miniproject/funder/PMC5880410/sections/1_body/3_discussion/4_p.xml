<p>Spatial heterogeneities are known to allow for disease persistence, since asynchrony in the epidemic spread among different sub-populations located in different geographical locations can allow for global persistence, even if the epidemic locally dies out [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Since HLA alleles are inherited, it can be expected that families and households will have similar HLA genotypes, potentially introducing spatial inhomogeneity in the distribution of HLA alleles in a population. If such spatial information regarding HLA genotypes were gathered, it would be interesting to study how this affects epidemic dynamics and persistence. An agent based model incorporating variations in agent susceptibility along the lines indicated here, along with spatial information regarding each susceptible agent, would provide an idea of how such factors might modify the general conclusions described in this paper. A network model incorporating the social structure of individual contacts would indicate if the combination of varied susceptibility with a specified contact network structure between individuals might accelerate epidemic progress or retard it.
