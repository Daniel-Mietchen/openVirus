<p>Theoretical studies on epidemiological spread of disease in the presence of susceptibility heterogeneities have shown that final epidemic size is typically lower when susceptibility sub-populations are factored in, as compared to the case of homogeneous susceptibility [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. We find that this result holds true when the sub-population sizes and disease transmission rates are informed by real-world data about immunological factors. The novelty in our approach is to propose how the susceptibility profile vector can be estimated from genetic sequence data, so that we can then deal with particular
