<p>A limitation of our model is that factors such as age, prior infection history and vaccination are not included. While there have been studies which collect and analyse such data for small cohorts [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], gathering such information on the global scale required for this analysis requires the formation of consortia such as those existing for diseases such as cancer [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Also, we make the strong simplifying assumption that all aspects of the innate and adaptive immune system not affected by HLA class-I presentation can be pooled into a single proportionality constant, and are considered uniform among individuals within an ethnicity, and across ethnicities. While this helped focus the analysis on the role of HLA alleles in disease spread, incorporating other aspects of the immune system into epidemiological models is an important problem that must be addressed. Due to these limitations, predictions made by our model can only be used to draw 
 <italic>comparisons</italic> between different epidemic pairs, particularly epidemic pairs consisting of the same ethnicity and different viral strains, and not for making absolute quantitative predictions.
