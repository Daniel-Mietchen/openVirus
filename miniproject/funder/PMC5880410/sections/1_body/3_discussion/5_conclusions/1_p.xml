<p>The incorporation of within-host immunological information into population-level epidemic models is a major challenge for epidemiological modeling [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this paper, we address this question in a specific case, by modeling the impact of genetic diversity in terms of the HLA class-I genotype on the predicted epidemic dynamics of H1N1 influenza. To do this, we made use of HLA allele frequencies measured across different ethnicities, focusing on the number of high affinity epitopes presented by individuals within 61 ethnicities and for 81 H1N1 influenza A viral strains isolated in 2009 as well as 85 H1N1 influenza A viral strains isolated in other years. Our main hypothesis was that the susceptibility of individuals in a given ethnicity, for a given viral strain, is inversely proportional to the number of high affinity epitopes that these individuals can present. We then used a multi-compartment SIR model to study the spread dynamics of influenza for each (ethnicity, viral strain) epidemic pair, where the final epidemic size
