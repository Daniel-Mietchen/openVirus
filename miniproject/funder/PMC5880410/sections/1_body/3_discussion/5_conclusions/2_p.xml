<p>While the average susceptibility 
 <italic>β</italic> is a central parameter, the susceptibility profile corresponding to each epidemic pair also plays an important role governing epidemic spread. In particular, when analysing epidemics with intermediate values of 
 <italic>β</italic> (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, intermediate values of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>), more heterogeneous susceptibility profiles, as well as profiles showing positive skewness 
 <italic>Sk</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>), are more protective for the population as a whole against H1N1 influenza. Our model only considers heterogeneity from the perspective of the ability of a person’s HLA genotype to present epitopes from a given virus. However, even if at a qualitative level, our results support the idea that having a wide variety of HLA alleles represented among its individuals, resulting in a wide range of susceptibilities, benefits a population as a whole in terms of restricting the spread of an infectious disease.
