<p>Although our model does not incorporate other factors such as social and economic characteristics of each particular population or potential different infectivities for each viral strain, our results qualitatively capture several central trends of influenza spread worldwide. Thus, we can conclude that susceptibility of individuals in terms of the HLA genotype is an important factor that could explain the spread potential of different influenza viral strains among different ethnicities and populations. While some of these trends can just be explained due to larger or smaller values of
