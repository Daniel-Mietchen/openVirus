<p>A number of extensions of the line of work presented in this manuscript are possible. Presentation of epitopes by HLA class-I alleles is preceded by a number of steps including internalisation of the virus, proteasomal cleavage of viral proteins into shorter peptides, and transport of peptides through the TAP transport system [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The epitope prediction tools used in this work do not explicitly consider all these pre-processing steps in any single tool. Also, the prediction algorithms have lower accuracy for rare alleles. The model can be improved by plugging in different epitope prediction methods which overcome these limitations. Also, it would be useful to establish a more accurate, quantitative connection between
