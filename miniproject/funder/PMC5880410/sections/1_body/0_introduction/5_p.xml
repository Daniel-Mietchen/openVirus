<p>A straightforward generalisation of the simplest version of the SIR model involves sub-dividing populations into smaller groups or sub-populations. Individuals in each sub-population can be considered to be homogeneous, but individuals across different sub-populations can be modelled as responding differentially to the disease, as in the models of [

Prior work has mainly focused on the theoretical analysis of these models, and relatively few attempts have been made to incorporate clinical or biological heterogeneities known to be relevant at the individual level, into population-level epidemic models. Incorporating such individual-level immunological information into population-level epidemic models accounting for susceptibility or infectivity heterogeneities has been recently identified as a major challenge for mathematical epidemiology [
