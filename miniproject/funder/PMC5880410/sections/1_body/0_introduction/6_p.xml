<p>Both innate and adaptive immune responses are initiated when an individual is exposed to the influenza virus. The innate response induces chemokine and cytokine production. Type I interferons are among the most important cytokines produced by the innate immune response and act to stimulate dendritic cells (DCs), enhancing their antigen production. The adaptive immune system can recognise the presence of an intracellular virus and mount a response only if a molecule called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) binds to and ‘presents’ fragments of viral proteins (epitopes) to the extracellular environment. Professional antigen presenting cells such as DCs present viral antigens to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells through HLA class-II and to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells through HLA class-I molecules. The CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-helper cells promote a B-cell response and antibody secretion. HLA class-I molecules can be found on the surface of all cells, and interact with T-cell receptors (TCRs) present on CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells [
