<p>In a previous paper [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], we developed a method to group together individuals who can be expected to have a similar CTL response, using the frequency of occurrence of HLA class-I alleles and the full proteome of the pathogen. We formulated an algorithm to generate all possible HLA genotypes given the frequency of occurrence of each allele in a particular population. Algorithms available through the IEDB resource [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] were used to predict the epitopes presented by each such HLA genotype. Clustering was then carried out on these HLA genotypes based on the number of epitopes presented from 
 <italic>each</italic> viral protein. In this work, we use the algorithm presented in [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] to generate HLA genotypes and thereby predict high affinity epitopes presented by each such genotype. We thus identify sub-populations of individuals with comparable susceptibility to the virus. The relevant parameter in this case is the 
 <italic>total</italic> number of such epitopes presented, irrespective of the viral protein from which these epitopes originate. We cluster individuals into groups based on this information, and use the clustering results to calculate the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected. This rate can be connected to the parameter 
 <italic>Î²</italic> which appears in the conventional compartmental SIR model, which can be used to track the progress of the epidemic through the population. The prevalence of different HLA class-I alleles in different parts of the world is available through the Allele Frequency Net Database (AFND) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Each population in the AFND is given an 
 <italic>ethnicity</italic> tag. We predict epidemic sizes using our model for 61 such ethnicities, as well as for 81 strains of influenza A (H1N1) virus isolated in 2009, and 85 strains isolated before or after 2009, for which the genome (and hence proteome) sequence is known [
