<p>Each individual has 6 HLA class-I alleles, the combination of all 6 alleles being referred to as an HLA genotype. Cross-reactivity between HLA alleles can result in two individuals with completely different HLA genotypes presenting the same number of high affinity epitopes [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Also, some alleles correlate with stronger (HLA-A*02 [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]) CTL response to the influenza A virus. This raises a number of questions. Does a high risk allele always correlate with a severe influenza epidemic, or can the presence of diverse HLA alleles offset this risk? Are there specific patterns of susceptibility resulting from diversity in HLA, which can confer greater protection to a population? We answer these questions by using the full HLA genotype of each individual, and with an assumption that a person who presents a larger number of high affinity viral epitopes will mount a stronger CTL immune response than one who presents a smaller number [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We use genetic diversity in HLA alleles to inform epidemiological parameters at the population level and study their influence on the epidemiological spread of H1N1 influenza.
