<p>A central aim of epidemiological studies is to identify factors that place some populations at greater risk of contracting an infectious disease than others [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Such factors can be associated with each of the three legs of the “epidemiologic triad” for infectious diseases, the combination of an external causative agent, a susceptible host, and an environment that links these two together [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Each of these could vary across populations. However, even if the causative agent was unique and environmental factors assumed to be largely common, variations intrinsic to the host can lead to large inhomogeneities in epidemic progression across populations [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Such variations are ignored in standard formulations of compartment models for infectious diseases, which project all properties of the host onto a small set of states describing the host status. These states are typically taken to be susceptible, infected or recovered, with respect to the progress of the disease [
