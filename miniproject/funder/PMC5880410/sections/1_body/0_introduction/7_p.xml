<p>The central role of HLA-mediated presentation of antigens in the magnitude and specificity of CTL response in infectious diseases in general [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and in influenza A in particular [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], have been well studied. A recent study shows that the 
 <italic>targeting efficiency</italic> of HLA, a function of the binding score of a given HLA allele and the conservation score of a given protein, correlates with the magnitude of the CTL response, and also with the mortality due to influenza A infection [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These studies also show that considering a single HLA allele is insufficient to determine the strength of the CTL response [
