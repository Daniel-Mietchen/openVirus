<p>The severity of the H1N1 2009 pandemic can be assessed in terms of the basic reproduction number (
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>), a fundamental dimensionless epidemiological parameter representing the average number of secondary infections caused by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population. An 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1 leads to an expected exponential increase in the number of infected individuals at early times, an increase which saturates before decreasing as infected individuals recover, whereas for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1, the number of infected individuals decreases monotonically. We compile estimates of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> values for the pH1N1 epidemic across several countries from the literature, and list them in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006069.t001">Table 1</xref>. Substantial variation in 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> values, ranging from about 1.2 at the lower end to values of 3 and above at the upper end, is evident from this table. This variation across countries illustrates the need to account for host-specific susceptibilities to disease. The immune response of the host, modulated by prior infections and vaccinations, is usually the central factor influencing

 <sub>0</sub>, although location-specific contact rates and health-seeking behaviour contribute as well. In this work, we study how the spread of influenza in a population is affected by variation in na√Øve host immune response.
