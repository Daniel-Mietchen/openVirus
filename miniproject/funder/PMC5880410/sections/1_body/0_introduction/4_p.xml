<p>Epidemics are typically modelled through deterministic compartmental-type models, represented by coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations. The SIR model is particularly well suited for studying the spread of influenza, since H1N1 is a virus which spreads from person-to-person through contact, without requiring a vector for transmission. The lack of a long incubation period and a relatively rapid recovery makes it possible to ignore the effects of immigration and emigration, as well as of births and deaths due to natural causes [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Models such as the SIR model and related models typically assume that individuals in the population are all alike, which allows one to reduce the number of model parameters to be estimated from data, and leads to mathematical models that can be more feasibly studied from an analytical or computational perspective. However, increasing efforts have been devoted during recent years to assessing the impact of individual heterogeneities in disease spread [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] reasons. Network or individual-based models provide a methodology for simulating each individual as a separate entity (an agent) with a specified susceptibility, an individual-specific ability to infect others as well as a specified time to recovery, while also being flexible enough to incorporate specific interaction patterns between agents. Such models, however, typically require estimating a large number of parameters. Individual-based models come with substantial overheads in terms of computational resources. In addition, their inherent stochasticity makes extensive averaging necessary [
