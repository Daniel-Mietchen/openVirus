<p>Our results show that if we assume that the susceptibility of a given individual is inversely proportional to the number of high affinity epitopes that this individual presents for a given viral strain, we can qualitatively reproduce some known trends of influenza spread worldwide. Moreover, although the basic reproduction number

 <sub>0</sub> for a given population and a given viral strain remains the main parameter that controls the epidemic size, other characteristics of the population can also significantly impact epidemic spread. In particular, we show that a composition of HLA genotypes which results in sub-populations with widely differing susceptibilities confers protection against the spread of influenza. Moreover, populations where most of the individuals are less susceptible but where a small sub-set of individuals is highly susceptible, are better in terms of containing the disease than populations that are otherwise configured, even if they have the same value of

 <sub>0</sub>. We show that the full distribution of susceptibilities across a population is required to predict the final epidemic size, but that one can extract useful information from low order moments of this distribution. Although these results are derived from pH1N1 strains, we find that the same trends apply even for viral strains isolated before or after 2009. We also show that populations with frequent occurrence of an allele associated with high risk for one strain do not always experience severe epidemics when considering influenza strains in general. We verify these conclusions by comparisons to synthetic data.
