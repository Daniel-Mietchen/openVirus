<p>We assume that all other factors affecting disease spread, such as contact patterns [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], health-seeking behaviour [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and migration [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] are uniform among all individuals in a population, and across all populations. Such factors have been studied in the literature [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], largely using theoretical models or data collected for small cohorts. Immunological memory of an individual is also an important aspect of the immune response, and can be affected by factors such as the strain with which an individual was first infected [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], prior history of infections [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and inherited factors [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. For lack of data regarding these factors, the model described in this work does not incorporate age and immunological history explicitly. To offset this limitation, we focus first on H1N1 strains isolated during the 2009 pandemic, for which immunological memory and vaccination proved insufficient to curb the spread of disease [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. We mine this data for characteristics which correlate with epidemic size, and test whether these correlations hold for strains isolated in years other than 2009.
