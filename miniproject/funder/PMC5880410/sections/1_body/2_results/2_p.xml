 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1006069.e010">(10)</xref>) was determined for 61 ethnicities and 81 viral strains isolated in 2009, leading to the study of 4, 941 epidemic pairs. Of these, 1, 392 cases had 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1, and 718 cases had 
 <italic>FI</italic>
 <sub>∞</sub> &gt; 0.5. The distributions of 
 <italic>SPV</italic> characteristics across these 4, 941 epidemic pairs is provided in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006069.g003">Fig 3</xref>. The number 
 <italic>m</italic> of susceptibility sub-populations varied from 1 (578 cases) to 23 (1 case, A/Giessen/6/2009 with Kenya Nandi ethnicity). The most common value for 
 <italic>m</italic> was 5, seen in 647 cases spanning 80 strains and 32 ethnicities. Details regarding ranges of calculated parameters for strains isolated before or after 2009 can be found in the supporting information; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006069.s001">S1 Fig</xref>. All estimated parameters are provided for all epidemic pairs in a supplementary file; see
