We find that the ethnicity USA Alaska Yupik is always predicted to have a worse epidemic than non-indigenous ethnicities from the USA, irrespective of the strain being considered. Since our data set does not include any non-indigenous ethnicities from Australia, we are unable to verify whether or not a similar statement holds true for the Australian aboriginal ethnicities.
