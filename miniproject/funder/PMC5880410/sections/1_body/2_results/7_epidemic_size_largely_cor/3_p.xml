<p>From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006069.g009">Fig 9</xref>, we see that for a given 
 <italic>β</italic>, 
 <italic>FI</italic>
 <sub>∞</sub> decreases with increasing 
 <italic>σ</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>). It also decreases as 
 <italic>Sk</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>) is made more positive, or as 
 <italic>CV</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>) is increased. This shows that for intermediate values of 
 <italic>β</italic> such as the ones shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006069.g009">Fig 9</xref>, a higher spread in 
 <italic>β</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub> values helps to protect the population against the epidemic spread. In other words, a population with higher genetic heterogeneity in susceptibility to a virus, leading to susceptibility sub-populations with a large spread in susceptibilities, can be expected to have a smaller epidemic than a population where most of the people have similar susceptibility, despite both populations being non-homogeneous in susceptibility.
