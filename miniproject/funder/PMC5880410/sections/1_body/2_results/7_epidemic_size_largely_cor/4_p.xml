<p>We also observe that for a given value of 
 <italic>β</italic>, an (
 <italic>E</italic>, 
 <italic>V</italic>) pair with 
 <italic>Sk</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>) &gt; 0 or only slightly negative corresponds to a smaller 
 <italic>FI</italic>
 <sub>∞</sub> than one for which 
 <italic>Sk</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>) is a large negative value. We interpret this in the following way: populations containing a small sub-set of individuals with heightened susceptibility, but in which most of the individuals are less susceptible, are better protected against the disease than populations where the susceptibility is more uniformly distributed, even if the mean susceptibility is the same.
