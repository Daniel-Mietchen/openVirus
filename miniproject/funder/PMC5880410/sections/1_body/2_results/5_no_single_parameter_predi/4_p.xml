<p>In our data, a positive value for

 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 2. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006069.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows that even with such small values for 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, 
 <italic>FI</italic>
 <sub>∞</sub> can take on a wide range of values, going up to 0.8. Yet, epidemic pairs in our data set with positive 
 <italic>Sk</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>) always have 
 <italic>FI</italic>
 <sub>∞</sub> &lt; 0.2; see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006069.g005">Fig 5(a)</xref>. This suggests that having a positive skewness, corresponding to a distribution where most of the people have low susceptibility, but a small number of people have susceptibility significantly larger than the mean, lends some protective effect to the population.
