 <italic>β</italic> and 
 <italic>FI</italic>
 <sub>∞</sub> is shown, it can be seen that a high value of average susceptibility leads to a larger epidemic. The red line corresponds to the epidemic size when the susceptibility compartment is homogeneous (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, 
 <italic>m</italic> = 1). We see that this line forms an upper bound on the 
 <italic>FI</italic>
 <sub>∞</sub> values for epidemic pairs with 
 <italic>m</italic> &gt; 1. It has been proved that the final epidemic size is always lower in an epidemic pair with heterogeneous susceptibility, than an epidemic pair with the same average susceptibility but with homogeneous susceptibility [

 <sub>∞</sub> values when considering epidemic pairs containing heterogeneous susceptibilities and having the same average susceptibility 
 <italic>β</italic>; see 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1006069.e013">Eq (12)</xref>. This shows that heterogeneity plays a role in determining the extent of an epidemic even when the average susceptibility remains constant.
