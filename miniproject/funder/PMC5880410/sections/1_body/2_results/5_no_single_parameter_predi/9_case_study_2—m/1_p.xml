<p>In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006069.g005">Fig 5(d)</xref> there appears to be some negative correlation between 
 <italic>m</italic> and 
 <italic>FI</italic>
 <sub>âˆž</sub>, with larger values of 
 <italic>m</italic> corresponding to smaller epidemic sizes; see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006069.t002">Table 2</xref>. However, we note that this is more an artefact of the data than a predictive trend, and it is possible to have epidemic pairs with a large value of 
 <italic>m</italic> but very different final epidemic sizes and epidemic time-course dynamics. This can be seen for example in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006069.g007">Fig 7</xref> for epidemic pairs 3 and 4 from 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006069.t004">Table 4</xref>. Once again, the pair with higher average susceptibility has both a larger epidemic size, and also a faster time course for the spread of the disease.
