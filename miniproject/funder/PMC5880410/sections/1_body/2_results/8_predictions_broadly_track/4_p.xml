<p>The ethnicity Russia Tuva Pop 2 is predicted to experience moderate epidemics for viral strains isolated in Russia, but a slightly worse epidemic for the strain A/Hyogo/2/2009 (H1N1), isolated in Japan. Thus, our methods bear out the idea that the severity of an influenza epidemic in a given country should not be dictated entirely by the genetic makeup of the hosts, but should also depend on the particular strain of the pathogen circulating in this country. Our predictions suggest that the ability of HLA class-I alleles in the ethnicity Russia Tuva pop 2 to present epitopes from the influenza A (H1N1) virus changes significantly across different viral strains.</p>
