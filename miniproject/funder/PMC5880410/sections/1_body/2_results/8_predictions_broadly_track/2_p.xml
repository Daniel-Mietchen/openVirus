<p>To compare the predictions of our model with these observations, we select viral strains isolated in these regions during the 2009 pandemic, and ethnicities corresponding to these countries. We would like to mention here that our model works with individual ethnicities, while the data available is for countries, which are comprised of multiple ethnicities. We find that different ethnicities from the same country experience widely differing epidemic sizes for the same viral strain; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006069.s005">S1 File</xref>. For this comparison, we select ethnicities available in our data set from each of these countries, for which the predictions most closely resemble the observations in [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006069.g010">Fig 10</xref>, our method predicts that most Chinese ethnicities will experience severe epidemics regardless of the viral strain. On the other hand, Russia and Japan are predicted to experience smaller epidemics for most viral strains. However, we note that for most of the Japanese strains, the Japanese ethnicity will suffer larger epidemic sizes than the Russian one, thus qualitatively agreeing with what can be observed in [
