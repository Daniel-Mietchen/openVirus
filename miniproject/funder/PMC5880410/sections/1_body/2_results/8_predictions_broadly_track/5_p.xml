<p>The results described above show that even with a model that only incorporates susceptibility heterogeneities in terms of epitope presentation through HLA class-I alleles, we can qualitatively explain some essential trends observed across the world during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. This serves as a qualitative validation of our methodology. Moreover, our results suggest that while some trends in influenza spread worldwide can be explained by the average susceptibility of each ethnicity to each strain, others might have an explanation related to the particular genetic diversity within each ethnicity for a given strain. For example, when analysing pairs 5 and 6 in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006069.t006">Table 6</xref>, we can see that the same value of 
 <italic>Î²</italic> can lead to different epidemic sizes for the same strain when considering the China Yunnan Province Lisu and the Japan pop 5 ethnicities. This is likely related to the fact that 
 <italic>Sk</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>) is significantly more negative for the Chinese ethnicity, and the coefficient of variation is smaller, leading to a larger epidemic size. A similar behaviour can be seen when considering pairs 7-9 in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006069.t006">Table 6</xref>. Larger reproduction numbers can still arise from smaller epidemic sizes if 
 <italic>Sk</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>) is closer to 0 (or positive), and for more heterogeneous populations (larger values of 
 <italic>CV</italic>(
 <italic>SPV</italic>)), which might explain smaller epidemic sizes in, for example, the Kenya Luo ethnicity compared to the Chinese ones [
