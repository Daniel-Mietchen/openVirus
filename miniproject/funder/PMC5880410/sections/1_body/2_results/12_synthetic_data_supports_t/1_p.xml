<p>Does the behaviour discussed in the preceding sections rely on correlations between 
 <italic>SPV</italic> characteristics that are specific to the epidemic pairs we analyse? These correlations arise directly from genetic heterogeneities at the HLA genotype level corresponding to the 61 ethnicities and 166 viral strains considered here. However, we could frame our questions more generally. For example, we could ask if a positive skewness of the 
 <italic>SPV</italic> would always be a protective characteristic for the population, given a fixed average
