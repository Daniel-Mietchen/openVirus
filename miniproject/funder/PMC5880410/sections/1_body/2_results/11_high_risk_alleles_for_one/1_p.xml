<p>The frequency of the HLA class-I allele HLA-A*24 has been found to correlate with mortality rate due to the pandemic H1N1 (2009) influenza virus [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1006069.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. We rank ethnicities in our data set in descending order of their average 
 <italic>FI</italic>
 <sub>âˆž</sub> across all 166 strains of influenza, and find that the ethnicity USA Alaska Yupik has the highest prevalence of allele HLA-A*24:02, and also has the worst average epidemic size; see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi.1006069.t008">Table 8</xref>. The ethnicity with the next highest frequency of allele HLA-A*24:02, Japan Central, has very low average epidemic size, and ranks 52

 </sup> among 61 ethnicities. The ethnicity Japan pop 3 has comparable frequency of the allele HLA-A*24:02 as Japan Central, but is ranked 28
 <sup>
  <italic>th</italic>
 </sup> based on its average epidemic size. These results show that an allele whose frequent occurrence correlates with a high risk for one influenza strain, does not always correlate with a severe epidemic when considering influenza strains in general. Rather, we need to estimate the full profile of the
