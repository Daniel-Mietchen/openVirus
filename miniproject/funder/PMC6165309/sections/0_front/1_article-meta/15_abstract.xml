  <italic>Culex tritaeniorhynchus</italic> is an important vector that transmits a variety of human and animal diseases. Japanese encephalitis (JE), an endemic disease in the Asia-Pacific region, is primarily transmitted by 
  <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic>. Insufficient monitoring of vector mosquitoes has led to a poor understanding of the distribution of 
  <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> in China. To delineate the habitat of 
  <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and any host and environmental factors that affect its distribution, we used a maximum entropy modeling method to predict its distribution in China. Our models provided high resolution predictions on the potential distribution of 
  <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic>. The predicted suitable habitats of the JE vector were correlated with areas of high JE incidence in parts of China. Factors driving the distribution of 
  <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> in China were also revealed by our models. Furthermore, human population density and the maximum NDVI were the most important predictors in our models. Bioclimate factors and elevation also significantly impacted the distribution of 
  <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic>. Our findings may serve as a reference for vector and disease control.
