 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> is a mosquito species that is widespread in Asia, the Mediterranean and Afrotropical region [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition to JE, 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> also has the ability to transmit some other human and animal viral diseases such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, Dengue fever and Tembusu virus infection [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is widely accepted that 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> prefers low lying water bodies with abundant plants, so paddy fields are a major habitat of the larvae [

 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As the area for rice planting has expanded in the last 40 years, 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> has gained a broader habitat in countries and regions with developed levels of agriculture [
