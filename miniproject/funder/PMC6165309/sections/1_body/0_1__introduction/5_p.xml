<p>The factors that influence the distribution of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> in China remain unclear. In this study, we applied a maximum entropy (Maxent) niche modelling method to predict the potential suitable habitats of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> in China. By modeling the spatial distribution of this insect vector, we can identify the main areas under threat of JE proliferation and other vector-borne diseases. It is also possible to understand the specific role of environmental factors that drive the distribution of the JE vector in China.
