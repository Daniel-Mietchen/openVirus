<p>Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne zoonosis caused by infection with Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). JEV is a member of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. JE usually manifests as mild central nervous symptoms, primarily in children and adolescents [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A small number of cases cause serious viral encephalitis and the disease has a mortality rate of approximately 20% to 40% [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Permanent neuropsychiatric sequelae may occur in up to 50% of JE survivors with encephalitis symptoms [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. JE is prevalent in most parts of Asia and the Western Pacific, and has been estimated to result in approximately 67,900 cases annually [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. JEV also causes reproductive losses and encephalitis in animals, such as swine, equine and cattle [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Unlike other animal hosts, swine play an important role in the spread of JEV as the major amplifying host [
