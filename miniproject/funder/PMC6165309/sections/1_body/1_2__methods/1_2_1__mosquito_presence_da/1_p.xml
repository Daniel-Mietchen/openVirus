<p>The 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> larvae and adult collections in China, used in our research, were obtained by literature retrieval. Literatures which provided sufficient information on collection locations to confirm coordinates were adopted. The records were taken from the period between 1970 and 2015. Detailed sampling time and literature sources are given in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-15-01848">Table S1</xref>. Google Earth software was used to acquire the coordinates of mosquito collection points in the provided locations, when coordinates were not given in the literature. To match the resolution (1 km Ã— 1 km) of environmental layers used in this study, presence records within 1 km
 <sup>2</sup> were considered as one point.
