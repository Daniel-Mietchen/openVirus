<p>All environmental layers were treated as follows: (1) resampled to the resolution of 1 km Ã— 1 km; (2) defined projection to GCS_WGS_1984; (3) clipped to the geographical area of China; (4) converted to ASCII format. All operations above were accomplished in ArcGIS 10.2. A strong correlation among bioclimate variables usually exists in the modeling, which may unjustifiably affect results [
