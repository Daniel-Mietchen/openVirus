<p>We obtained twenty-seven environmental variable layers in total, including bioclimate data, elevation data, vegetation index and host population densities (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-01848-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Bioclimate variables were downloaded from the WorldClim dataset. Nineteen variables that reflect temperature and precipitation conditions for 1970–2000 were the latest available data. Elevation data was obtained from the NASA’s Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Data. In addition to altitude, slope and aspect were also considered as geographical factors affecting mosquito habitats [

We considered the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a predictor that reflects vegetation coverage. The NDVI value has been widely accepted as an important predictor for the presence of mosquitoes. It has been referenced in mosquito predictive studies, such as identifying mosquito clusters in urban areas and predicting the peak production of mosquitoes in rice fields [

 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The maximum, average and minimum NDVI were derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images captured by satellite Terra. Human population density data for China was provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Pig density data for China was obtained from the Livestock Geo-Wiki [
