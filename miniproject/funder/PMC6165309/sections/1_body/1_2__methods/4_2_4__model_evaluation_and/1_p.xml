<p>Model accuracy can be evaluated by area under the curve (AUC). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was generated by the Maxent software. A completely random prediction leads to an AUC value of 0.5. If the AUC value is more than 0.5, it means that the prediction is better than random. The closer the AUC value is to 1, the better the prediction performance will be. </p>
