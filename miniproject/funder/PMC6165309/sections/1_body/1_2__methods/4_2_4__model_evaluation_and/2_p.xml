<p>A jackknife test, built in Maxent software, was selected to assess the importance of each variable in the model [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The jackknife test is to drop each variable in turn in each run, and then use only each variable in turn in each run. Whether the training gain decreased when the variable was dropped or increased when used alone, this variable can be thought as containing information that no other variables have. This shows the importance of each variable to the model. We can also refer to the “Percent contribution” given by Maxent to judge the relative contribution of each variable to the model. Response curves provided by Maxent represent different models, which were created by using only the corresponding variable. Each curve shows the trend of predictive suitability as the variable varies. This can be interpreted as the specific impact of variables on predictive suitability.
