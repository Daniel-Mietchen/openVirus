<p>Sampling bias is a general problem in the modeling of species distribution [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Sampling locations are usually conveniently accessed and these locations do not reflect the real distribution of the target species. In the default setting, background points are randomly selected by Maxent software in the entire research area. In order to counteract this effect in our models, we selected background points with the same spatial bias as the presence points [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Based on presence points, a surface of sampling intensity was created using the Gaussian kernel density estimator tool in ArcGIS [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This bias file was input into Maxent, and the software weighted the bias file to create 10,000 background points.
