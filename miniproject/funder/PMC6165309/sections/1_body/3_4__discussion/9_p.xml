<p>A mark-release-recapture study has shown the ability of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> to disperse more than 5 km, which may cause additional errors with predictions at the 1 km Ã— 1 km resolution [

As with other presence-only modeling approaches, sampling bias is an unavoidable problem. Although we have performed a selection of background points to reduce the influence of sampling bias on the prediction results, the predictions should be interpreted with caution and need to be corroborated by mosquito surveys [
