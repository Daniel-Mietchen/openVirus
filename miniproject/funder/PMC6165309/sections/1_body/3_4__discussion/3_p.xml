<p>The “Host” model was more conservative whereas the “Without Host” model predicted a more extensive distribution of high-risk areas. Unsurprisingly, human activities led to such a difference. Habitat suitability may be affected by human interventions. According to the response curve, the habitat suitability rose sharply with the increase of population density (

The most obvious impact of human activities on the distribution of mosquitoes is that mosquitoes have an abundant food source (blood) in densely populated areas. Furthermore, manmade structures not only provide shelter for humans, but also provide mosquitoes with a suitable living environment. As expected, the density of pigs also has an impact on the distribution of
