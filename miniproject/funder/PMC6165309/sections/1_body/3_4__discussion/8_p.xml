<p>Our research is novel in our focus on modeling the distribution of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> for the entire territory of China, with consideration for vegetation and host factors. A previous work mapped the distribution of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> within JE risk areas [
 <xref rid="B78-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. However, Tibet, Xinjiang and Qinghai province were not taken into consideration in this study. Human JE cases have been reported in Tibet since 2006, according to the China CDC (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.Chinacdc.cn/en/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.Chinacdc.cn/en/</uri>). And JEV isolates (from mosquitoes, pigs and humans) have been described in Tibet [
 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. This demonstrated that JEV is currently circulating in Tibet, so we think it is necessary to include Tibet in the modeling. Xinjiang and Qinghai should also be considered to provide early warning of possible future JE invasion. Our research also reveals the relationship between habitat preference of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and environmental factors. And the jackknife test and response curves are helpful to understand the conditions that affect the survival of mosquitoes. Compared with the variables used in the previous research (land surface temperature and tasselled cap wetness), we believe that the variables adopted in our research (Bioclimate variables) can better reflect the climate seasonality and complexity, especially for a country with a large territory like China, which crossed several climate zones. In addition, the prediction of the previous model may not be accurate in some areas. For example, there were records of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> in Hainan (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01848-f001">Figure 1</xref>) but the previous prediction for Hainan was extreme low. Sampling bias was also treated reasonably in our model. Based on these efforts, we obtained a more reliable and precise prediction result for China and discovered potential habitats in Xinjiang and Tibet. Furthermore, our study is unique in its purpose of exploring the effects of hosts and environment on 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> distribution. Host factors (densities of humans and pigs) were introduced into our models. By establishing the “Host” model, we investigated the effects of the existence of hosts on mosquitoes. Similarly, by establishing the “Without Host” model, we obtained the true impact of environmental variables on the distribution of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and defined all possible suitable mosquito habitats for breeding, resting, and foraging activities. The results have important significance for guiding the targeted prevention and control of JE in China. Immunization should be promoted for susceptible human and livestock populations in the high-risk areas predicted by our models. The “Without Host” model gave a broader range of suitable areas for the 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> survival, including areas that are sparsely populated at present. Possible future population migration needs to take this into account. At the same time, 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> was also proved to be the vector for other zoonoses, such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever and Dengue fever. Pathogen surveillance in vectors of these diseases is necessary, especially as RVF and WNV have not yet been reported in China. These two exotic animal diseases have been listed in the Medium and Long-term State Strategy of Animal Disease Prevention and Control of China.
