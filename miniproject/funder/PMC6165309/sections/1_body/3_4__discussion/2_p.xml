<p>The predictions were also supported by reports of JE epidemics and the isolation of JEV in recent years. Human JE cases were obtained from literature reports and ProMED mail (

 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The reported locations were mostly located in the high-risk areas predicted by our models (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-15-01848">Table S2</xref>). In addition, there were several reports of JEV infection in pigs. JEV infections in swine were reported in Jiangsu (2008–2009), Shanxi (2009) and Sichuan (2012), places that were also predicted as high suitability habitats [

 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. However, due to the limited numbers of JE cases obtained, this is not sufficient for demonstrating the predictive power of the model. Furthermore, some additional mosquito species within the genus 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> can also transmit JEV in some regions [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Therefore, some of the observed JE cases may not be due to 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> solely. More detailed information on JE cases and future mosquito surveys for suspected high-risk areas are required to make a thorough validation of our model’s predictive accuracy.
