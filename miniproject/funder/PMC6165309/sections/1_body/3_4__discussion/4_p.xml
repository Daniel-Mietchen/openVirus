<p>Bioclimate variables played an important role in the modeling. The curve of Bio 5 (maximum temperature of the warmest month) rose first and then dropped, and the peak was at 32.5 °C. This shows that mosquitoes are benefited from higher temperatures, however, excessive temperatures have a negative effect on their survival. In another study, the upper limit of the suitable temperature for JE vectors was considered to be 34.5 °C in India [

 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> to low temperatures. Although there is evidence that adult 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> can overwinter [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], their activity and number in winter were significantly lower. Only 10 female 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> were collected from January to April in 2008 in a park in Tokyo, while 14,069 females were collected from April to November in 2007 [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The cold winter in northeast China is challenging for the mosquito survival and activity. Bio 14 (precipitation of the driest month) showed the adaptability of mosquitoes to drought. It is known that adequate precipitation is strictly required by 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> eggs to maintain activity and hatch [

 <xref rid="B71-ijerph-15-01848" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Two vast deserts, the Taklimakan Desert and Gurbantunggut Desert, are located in Xinjiang and occupy most of Xinjiang. The lack of precipitation makes the survival of mosquitoes difficult and this explains why there have never been JE cases in Xinjiang. Bio 18 (precipitation of the warmest quarter) demonstrated that summers with abundant rainfall promote the reproduction of mosquitoes.
