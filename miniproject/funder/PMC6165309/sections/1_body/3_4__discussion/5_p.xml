<p>The maximum NDVI was the most powerful predictor in the “Without Host” model. Vegetation coverage helps to avoid high temperatures and rapid evaporation of surface water caused by direct exposure to strong sunlight. Blood is sucked by female mosquitoes for reproduction, while both males and females obtain energy by feeding on sugar [

However, according to the response curve, when the NDVI value was too high (0.55), the suitability began to decline. As observed in a previous study, lush rice led to a dramatic decrease in the number of mosquito larvae [
