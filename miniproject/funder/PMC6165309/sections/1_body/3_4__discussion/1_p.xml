<p>The two models in our study gave similar predictions of the distribution of the JE vector 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> in China. The highly suitable habitats were mainly in the southwestern, central, eastern, and coastal areas of China. This coincides with the spatial distribution of JE in China. Since the 21st century, the southwestern region has experienced the most serious JE epidemics in China. According to the China CDC, the average incidence of JE in Guizhou (2.36/100,000), Chongqing (1.28/100,000), Sichuan (1.02/100,000), and Yunnan (0.91/100,000) ranked in the top four in China, far above the national average (0.37/100,000). Shaanxi (0.61/100,000), Henan (0.52/100,000) and Anhui (0.40/100,000) also had a high incidence of JE, ranking fifth to seventh. In recent years, due to advanced economic levels and higher immunization coverage in the coastal areas of China, the incidence of JE has been relatively low. In the 1970s, areas such as Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong and Guangxi were once the most serious epidemic areas of JE in China [
