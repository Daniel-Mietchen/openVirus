<p>Elevation was also considered to be an important factor that affects the distribution of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> in both models. The response curve dropped rapidly as elevation rose. Low temperatures and thin air at high altitudes lead to sparse blood meal hosts and plants [

 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> decreased rapidly with elevation, and at an altitude of more than 3000 m no mosquitoes were captured [

The high predictive suitability of low altitude regions was reflected in two typical basins in our models, the Sichuan Basin and the Ordos Basin. In fact, the incidence of JE in these two areas is indeed high. On the contrary, Qinghai (free of JE) and Tibet (few JE cases) benefit from the existence of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, the highest plateau in the world.
