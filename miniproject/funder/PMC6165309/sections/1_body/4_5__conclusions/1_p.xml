<p>In our current study, we modelled the spatial distribution of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> in China, based on the Maxent niche modelling method. The central, eastern, southwestern and coastal area of China were predicted to be suitable habitats for 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic>. The most powerful predictors were human population density and maximum NDVI. Several bioclimate factors (Bio 5, Bio 11, Bio 14 and Bio 18) and elevation also had significant impacts on the distribution of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic>. Our research reveals the relationship between habitat preference of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> and environmental factors. The results have important implications for the prevention and control of JE and other vector-borne infectious diseases.
