 <xref rid="ijerph-15-01848-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Both models showed good performance. The model including host population densities gave higher training AUC and test AUC. Compared to the “Host” model, the “Without Host” model predicted a significantly broader exposed area, but a slightly larger exposed population. This indicated that more sparsely populated area was predicted as suitable habitat by the “Without Host” model. Sensitivity equals specificity threshold was applied to generate binary models and calculate test omission rate [
