<p>The percent contribution of each variable in the two models are shown in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-01848-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Bio 5, Bio11, Bio 14, Bio 18, NDVI max and elevation were regarded as variables with greater contributions in both models. In the “Host” model, human population density had the greatest relative contribution with 66.20%, whereas pig density was 0.41%. Maximum NDVI had the highest contribution (35.28%) in the “Without Host” model, followed by Bio 14 (32.21%).
