<p>According to the jackknife test (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01848-f005">Figure 5</xref>), it was obvious that human population density shows the greatest importance to the “Host” model. The increase in training gain when population density was used alone and the reduction when it was discarded were both the largest. In addition to population density, Bio 5, Bio 11, Bio 14, Bio 18, NDVI max, pig density and elevation also showed significant importance to the prediction.
