<p>We found that both models predicted similar geographical areas as having a medium to high probability for the presence of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic>. In central China, southern Shaanxi and Shanxi showed high habitat suitability of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic>. In eastern China, extensive areas in Henan and Anhui, and southeast Shandong showed high probabilities of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> presence, as well as the Yangtze River Delta area. In the southwest of China, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces were the most likely areas for the presence of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic>. Southern Guangxi and Guangdong, and coastal areas of Hainan, Fujian and Taiwan can also be regarded as suitable habitats. It should be noted that both models gave a high prediction for a limited border area in southeast Tibet. The two models showed some disagreements concerning the central and eastern region of China. The model including host population densities gave a prediction of medium probability for eastern Gansu, northern Shaanxi, eastern Hubei and Hunan, whereas the “Without Host” model gave these areas a higher probability. The prediction of “Without Host” model for southeast Shandong, northern Jiangsu and Jiangxi was broader and higher than that of the “Host” model. In general, the “Host” model provided a prediction of more conservative in extent and lower suitability of 
 <italic>Cx. tritaeniorhynchus</italic> habitats in China.
