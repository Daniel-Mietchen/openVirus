<p>Pneumococcal genome detection by 16S rDNA qPCR was performed using the Light Cycler Fast Start DNA Mas (#03003248001) kit as per manufacturer’s instructions. The primers and probe used for the 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> identification were designed according to Corless et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0188325.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In brief, a total of 20 μl PCR mixture was prepared containing 14 μl Mastermix and 6 μl of extracted sample. The Mastermix contains MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10x LC-HYBR (a+b), forward primer Strep-F (
 <monospace>5’-TGCAGAGCGTCCTTTGGTCTAT-3’</monospace>), reverse primer Strep-R (
 <monospace>5’-CTCTTACTCGTGGTTTCCAACTTGA-3’</monospace>) (50 μM each), probe Strep-TM (
 <monospace>5’-ABI-FAM-TGGCGCCCATAAGCAACACTCGAA-3’-ABI-Tamra</monospace>) (20 μM), and H
 <sub>2</sub>O (Roche). Positive and negative controls were included. PCR was carried out on a Light Cycler 2.0 (Roche) with the following program: initial denaturation at 95°C for 7 min, a 50 cycles PCR including a denaturation step at 95°C for 5 sec and an annealing and extension step at 62°C for 45 sec. A final cooling step at 40°C was recommended. PCR results were analyzed using the Light Cycler Software 4.05.
