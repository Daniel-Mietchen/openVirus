<p>The QIAsymphony Sp automate (QIAGEN, Cat No./ID: 9001297) and the QIAsymphony DSP virus/Pathogen Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Austria) were used for the total nucleic acids extraction according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extraction procedure was carried out from a 600 μl original material resulting in a final eluate of 150 μl. For the detection of respiratory pathogens the FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 Kit (Fast-Track Diagnostics, FTD-2-64) was used which allows the identification of influenza virus A (InfV-A), influenza virus B (InfV-B), influenza virus A (H1N1) swl, rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus NL63, 229E, OC43 and HKU1 (CoV-NL63,CoV-229E, CoV-OC43 and CoV-HKU1), parainfluenza virus 1–4 (PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3 and PIV-4), metapneumovirus A and B (MPV A/B), bocavirus (BoV), RSV A/B, adenovirus (AdV), enterovirus (EV), parechovirus (PeV) and

 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>. PCR mixture contains: 12.5 μl of PCR buffer, 1.5 μl of Master Mix (primer and probe set 1 to 5), and 1 μl of reverse transcriptase enzyme. All were mixed with 10 μl of nucleic acids for each primer/probe set. Thermocycling was performed on a Rotor-Gene 6000/Q (QIAGEN) using the following program: reverse transcription reaction at 42°C for 15 min, PCR reaction starting by initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles including a denaturation step at 94°C for 8 sec and annealing and extension step at 60°C for 34 sec.
