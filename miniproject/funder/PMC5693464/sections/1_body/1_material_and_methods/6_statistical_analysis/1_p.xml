<p>The representation of patient’s data and detected pathogens were analyzed using the SPSS 20.0 statistical package. The relation and differences between pathogens infection rates, clinical manifestations and the statistical calculations were performed using the Chi-square (X
 <sup>2</sup>) test or the Fisher’s exact test (where cell counts below 5 were encountered in the statistical table) on SPSS. Additionally, to compare total positive, single, and multiple viral infections with patient’s demographic information and the manifestation of ARTIs, the binary logistic regression test was performed when more than 2 categories in the variable were counted. It evaluates the association between the exposure of 2 properties and their outcome (odds ratio: OR) and estimates the associated 95% confidence interval (95% CI) which indicates the degree of uncertainty associated with the OR. A value of p&lt; = 0.05 was considered as significant.
