<p>Other pathogens such as MPV A/B, PIVs group (including PIV-1 to PIV-4), BoV, EV, PeV, and InfVs group (InfV-A, InfV-B, and InfV-A (H1N1) swl), had detection rates ranging from 16.12% to 1.61%. The rare presence of Influenza infection in this study (1.61% infection rate) may support a published meta-analysis indicating that very young children (&lt;2 years of age) are at significantly lower risk for hospital admission caused by influenza infection compared with the other age groups (84.40% of our population was aged under 12 months) [
