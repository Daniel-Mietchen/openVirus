<p>In contrary to published Tunisian studies, which primarily focused on detection of a single respiratory agent in ARTIs in children [

 <xref rid="pone.0188325.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], this study covers hospitalized, and not-preselected children. We aimed to identify a causative agent of ARTIs and to link these pathogens with the severity of symptoms and available demographic data. A high percentage of cases suffering severe symptoms like apnea (12.90%), respiratory irritation (15.59%), polypnea (50.80%), oxygen saturation &lt;94% (19.08%) and severe dehydration (8.33%) were reported. Complications such as vomiting were found in 20.43% of patients. Furthermore, the present study detected viral co-infections in 235 out of 372 tested samples. RV and RSV A/B were the most common pathogens found in combination with other viruses (RV-AdV in 53/235 total co-infections, then RV-RSV A/B and RV-MPV A/B in 44/235 co-infected samples, each). This finding is supported by Cebey-LÃ³pez et al, who studied viral co-infections in a pediatric environment in which RSV and RV are the most detected pathogens [
