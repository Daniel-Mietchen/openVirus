<p>Beside virus-specific nucleic acids, a total of 143/372 ARTIs were found to be positive for

However, in Tunisia, there is no national vaccination program against pneumococcal in public hospitals. Vaccination is available only in the private hospitals and thus is not accessible to all population [
