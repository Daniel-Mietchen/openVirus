RSV was the most associated virus with respiratory illness reflected by the need for oxygen support, the duration of hospitalization in ICU and nosocomial infections among hospitalized children (p&lt;0.05). PeV came after and was statistically associated with asthma, anemia, and death (p&lt;0.05). Human enterovirus was reported in 8.87% of cases, supporting studies from Vietnam [
