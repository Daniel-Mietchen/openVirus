<p>The most common viruses detected in this study were RV and RSV A/B responsible for 55.64% and 33.06% of infections, respectively. Both of these pathogens were also identified by other studies as the major etiologic agents for ARTIs in infants and young children [

 <xref rid="pone.0188325.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. RSV is well established as a common agent of ARTIs, especially in the manifestation of bronchiolitis. In addition, studies from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia reported RSV infection rates between 18.00% and 29.80% [

 <xref rid="pone.0188325.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast to RSV, few studies were published describing RV epidemiology in the Arab Maghreb. Similar to our findings, Jroundi and collaborators detected a high rate of RV infection (53.00%) in Moroccan children hospitalized with ARTIs [

In another hand, a recent study describing the circulation of respiratory viruses in Tunisia over 3 consecutive years found that RV infection was predominant in only 1 of the 3 years, while RSV was predominant in the other 2 years. Such findings indicate a possible fluctuation of RV and RSV circulation [

According to Vandini et al, RV is the second most common cause of viral bronchiolitis and the most common virus associated with wheezing in children aged 1 to 2 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0188325.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, the detection of RV in asymptomatic children, or its long persistence after an acute respiratory infection has been also described [
