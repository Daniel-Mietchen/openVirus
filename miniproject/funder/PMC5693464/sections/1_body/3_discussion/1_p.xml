<p>This study analyzed the frequencies of ARTIs by respiratory viruses (18 pathogens) and 2 common bacteria (
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>S</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>) using sensitive molecular detection techniques. Collected specimens from 372 hospitalized infants and children aged between 1 month and 5 years from Sousse area in Tunisia were enrolled. In 342 out of 372 tested samples, respiratory pathogens were detected. This high rate of infection (91.93%) is in line with previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0188325.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The differences in detection rates may depend on a variety of factors including heterogeneity of study patients, differences in clinical manifestations diagnosed in patients, the number of tested respiratory pathogens and especially the tests used for their detection [
