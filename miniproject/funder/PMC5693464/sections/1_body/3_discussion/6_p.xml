<p>Although the size of the samples is limited, the present study allows us to analyze putative associations between multiple infections and clinical manifestations (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188325.t005">Table 5</xref>) as the probability of being infected by the combination of at least 2 respiratory viruses increases when children were breastfed after birth, and the risk for developing respiratory irritation raised with viral multiple infections. The association of multiple infections with increased severity of the course of infection is controversial in the literature. Some reports showed no association between multiple virus infections and disease severity, whereas the findings of others indicated that clinical manifestations and illness severity were more prevalent in multiple infected patients, especially in co-infections with RSV [
