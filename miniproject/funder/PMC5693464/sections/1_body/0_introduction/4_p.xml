<p>In the Arab Maghreb, few studies have been published describing the detection and the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens [

 <xref rid="pone.0188325.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In Tunisia for example, studies were limited to few respiratory viruses and focused mostly on mono-detections such as influenza viruses (InfVs) [

 <xref rid="pone.0188325.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and, metapneumovirus (MPV) [
 <xref rid="pone.0188325.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. To our knowledge, a single Tunisian study describes the surveillance of InfVs including the detection of a panel of respiratory viruses by multiplex assay, but no information about patient’s clinical profile and its association with viral infection was provided [
