<p>The current epidemiological situation, patientâ€™s age, clinical symptoms, radiographic and laboratory data and response to treatment may help to differentiate viral from bacterial infections. Even so, no clinical algorithm exists that will distinguish clearly between different causes of childhood respiratory infections [

New technologies permit the detection of more than one pathogen in a single probe and are more relevant than non-multiplex approaches such as conventional PCR, viral cell culture and, immunofluorescence or immunochromatography assays. The recently developed commercial diagnostic assays based on multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR/qRT-PCR) allow sensitive and specific detection of a broad panel of conventional and emerging viruses in respiratory tract specimens. Thus, they have been established as a standard method within the past few years. These technological advances have changed the landscape of virus detection and provide the opportunity to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of respiratory viruses [
