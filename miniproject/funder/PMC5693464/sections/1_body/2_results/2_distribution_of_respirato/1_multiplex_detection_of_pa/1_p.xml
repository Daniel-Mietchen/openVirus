RV was the most frequently identified pathogen (55.64%, 207/372 samples), followed by RSV-A/B (33.06%, 123/372), AdV (25.00%, 93/372), coronavirus group (CoVs, 21.50%, 80/372), MPV-A/B (16.12%, 60/372), parainfluenza virus group (PIVs) with BoV (11.82%, 44/372 each), EV (8.87%, 33/372), PeV (8.06%, 30/372), and influenza virus group (InfVs, 1.61%, 6/372). Among CoVs and PIVs groups, more than the half were positive for CoV-229E (56.25%, 45/80 total CoVs infections) and PIV-3 (56.81%, 25/44 total PIVs infections), respectively. Not a single
