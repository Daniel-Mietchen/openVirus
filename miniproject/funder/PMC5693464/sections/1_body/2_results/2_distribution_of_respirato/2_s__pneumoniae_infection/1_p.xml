 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> positive samples (73.06%) had CRP concentrations equal or above 20 mg/l. Forty-seven of these 53 cases were additionally positive for at least 1 respiratory virus covered by the multiplex qRT-PCR. In 6 further cases with high CRP concentrations (&gt; = 20 mg/l), this bacterium was the single detected pathogen suggesting that these patients were hospitalized due to
