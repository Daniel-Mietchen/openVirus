<p>During September 2013 and December 2014, 372 children hospitalized with URTIs and/or LRTIs under or equal 5 years old were enrolled. Some patients had an incomplete recovery at the time of discharge, and their data were included as “missing data”. The characteristics of the study population are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188325.t001">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0188325.s001">S1 Table</xref>. Most hospitalized patients were males (64.24%), living in an urban environment (70.69%), and with siblings (70.96%). A total of 72/372 of cases was premature at birth (19.35%) and less than 10.00% were diagnosed with asthma. Almost half of the population was hospitalized between January and March 2014 (49.46%). From total hospitalizations, 12.63% were admitted to the PPICU, the rest were hospitalized in the PP ward (87.36%). The median duration of hospitalization was 8 days in the PP ward, and 1 day at the PPICU. The maximum duration of hospitalization at the PPICU was 13 days and 6.45% of cases were admitted for more than 3 days. The clinical profile of hospitalized subjects showed that the majority of patients were diagnosed for LRTIs (bronchiolitis, 69.35%), while URTIs were characterized by rhinitis (21.23%), laryngitis (4.83%) and pharyngitis (2.68%). Symptoms included mostly dyspnea (75.26%), polypnea (50.80%) and cough (34.94%). Oxygen support was required in 29.03% of hospitalized subjects, 15.59% of patients were diagnosed for respiratory irritation, and 7.79% required mechanical ventilation. A total of 32.25% of patients had a concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) ranging from equal to higher than 20 milligrams per liter (mg/l). Due to suspicion of bacterial infections, patients were treated with antibiotics (58.87%) and corticosteroids (59.67%). Recovery was defined by response to treatment and when the need for oxygen therapy was considered to be no longer necessary (88.44%). After hospitalization, 8 patients (2.15%) went home without permission, and a total of 23 cases ended fatal (6.18%).
