Viral infection was more frequent in G1group (76.88% of the 372 tested samples). RV, RSVA/B, CoVs group and MPVA/B were predominant within patients from G1 and G3 groups, while BoV, InfVs group, and EV were most frequently detected in patients belonging to G1 and G4 age groups. PIVs infection was most commonly described in patients aged from 7 to 12 months (G3 group).
