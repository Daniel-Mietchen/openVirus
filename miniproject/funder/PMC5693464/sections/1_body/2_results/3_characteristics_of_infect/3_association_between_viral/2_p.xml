<p>The statistical comparisons between individual viral infection and patient’s information are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188325.t006">Table 6</xref>. RSV A/B and PeV were the most associated pathogens with patient’s demographic situation and the manifestations of ARTIs: RSV A/B infection increases with the increasing number of siblings and occurs more in children with a primary care in the nursery (p&lt;0.05). In addition, RSV A/B was found to increase the need for oxygen support (p = 0.043), the duration of hospitalization in ICU (p = 0.017), and the risk of nosocomial infection (p = 0.031). However, PeV was statistically associated with asthma and anemia (p&lt;0.05). Interestingly, PeV and PIVs group were the single respiratory agents found to increase the risk of death (p = 0.032 and p = 0.013 respectively). RV was found to be statistically associated with a prolonged duration of oxygenation need after hospitalization (p = 0.042), BoV increases the risk for developing pharyngitis (p = 0.003), and EV was statistically related to nosocomial infections (p = 0.049). Infection due to CoVs group was found to increase the risk of bronchiolitis (p = 0.009) and laryngitis (p = 0.017). Vomiting was reported in 20.00% of patients, of which 1/3 were infected by AdV. In all of these cases, co-infections with at least 1 additional virus were found. In addition, AdV was found to be statistically associated with gastroenteritis (p = 0.004). MPV A/B was the single virus not found to be associated with patient’s demographic characteristics and the manifestation of ARTIs. As mentioned above, only 6/372 cases were found to be infected by InfVs. Thus, no statistical comparisons of InfVs and the manifestation of ARTIs were taken into consideration.
