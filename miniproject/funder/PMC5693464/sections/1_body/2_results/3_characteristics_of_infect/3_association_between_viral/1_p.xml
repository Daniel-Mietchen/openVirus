 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0188325.t005">5</xref> summarize the most important patientâ€™s demographic and clinical information found in association with viral infection (total positive, single and multiple). Viral infection increases in subjects living in a humid environment (p = 0.041), and with a primary care in the nursery (p = 0.040). Children breastfeed after birth were at high risk of being infected by a single virus than being infected by multiple viruses (p = 0.001). Multiple infections were found to increase the risk for developing respiratory irritation (p = 0.001).
