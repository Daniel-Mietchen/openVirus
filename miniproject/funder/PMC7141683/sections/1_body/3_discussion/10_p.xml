<p>Our results highlight the significance of using transcriptomics as a new approach to study of IBV-Yamagata lineage infection mechanism. The results demonstrated robust induction of IFN and ISG expression by IBV in human cells. We believe this study reveals a global and comprehensive analysis of host transcriptional changes, providing a foundation for further studies of antiviral drug development and interactions between the host and virus.</p>
