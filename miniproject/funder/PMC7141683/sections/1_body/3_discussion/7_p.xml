<p>The Epstein-Barr virus infection, rheumatoid arthritis, pertussis, and Fanconi anemia pathways were significantly enriched, indicating that there are many common characteristics between IBV and these other disease/infection models. Patients with influenza virus infections are susceptible to secondary bacterial pneumonia, including 
 <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> [

 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] because many bacterial adhesion molecules are up-regulated on the cell surface by influenza virus infection. The bacterial adhesion molecules are to blame for coinfection with synergistic lethality [

 <italic>ITGA10</italic>, 
 <italic>ITGB2</italic>, 
 <italic>ITGAL</italic>, 
 <italic>ITGB8</italic>, 
 <italic>ITGA7</italic>, and 
 <italic>ITGB4</italic> were significantly up-regulated after IBV infection, and this partially explains why IBV is so highly mixed with bacteria. The influenza virus breaks through the first barrier of host defenses, infecting lung epithelial cells, and rapidly activating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [

 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Our results demonstrated that a large number of inflammatory cytokine genes were up-regulated after IBV infection, such as 
 <italic>CXCL10</italic>, 
 <italic>CD163</italic>, and 
 <italic>SERPINA3</italic>, and these inflammatory cytokines elicit significant pulmonary infiltrates and lung injury, which can further lead to complications such as fatal pneumonia.
