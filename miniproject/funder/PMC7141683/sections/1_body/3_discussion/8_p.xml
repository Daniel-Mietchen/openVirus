<p>A group of cytoskeletal proteins, including 
 <italic>ACTB</italic>, 
 <italic>ACTL6A</italic>, 
 <italic>ACTL8</italic>, and 
 <italic>ARPC5L</italic>, were down-regulated after IBV infection, indicating that actin proteins may be crucial for viral genome transcription, budding, and the release of virus particles, consistent with previous research showing that viruses invade living cells and turn them into factories to produce new progeny virions [
 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The expression of host cytoskeleton proteins is down-regulated during virus infection. The virus utilizes actin proteins for invasion, replication, and produce more virions, and evidence for this has been reported with human respiratory syncytial virus and Newcastle disease virus [
