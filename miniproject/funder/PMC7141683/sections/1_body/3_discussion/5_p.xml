<p>While a large number of host natural immune response-related pathways were enriched upon IBV infection, some pathways were involved in the regulation of viral gene replication, indicating that virus and host gene replication has important effects on each other. The NF-kB signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor, and Interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway were significantly enriched, indicating that crosstalk occurred between IFN signaling and others. However, the detailed mechanism of this crosstalk needs further research. Previous studies report that the cross-talk presumably functions as an antiviral response overall [
