<p>Influenza viruses are single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family Orthomyxoviridae, and are phylogenetically grouped into four virus genera: influenza A, B, C, and D viruses [

 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Influenza B virus (IBV) generally causes local mild epidemics, but it may be fatal to individuals, especially infants, pregnant woman, the elderly, and people with impaired immune systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since the 1980s, IBV have two genetically and antigenically differentiated lineages, termed B/Yamagata lineage and B/Victoria lineage, and the antigenic drift rate is slower compared with influenza A viruses[
 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. IBV is a pathogen with very limited host range, and its natural host is mainly humans with fever and cold symptoms. However, seasonal pandemics can break out, such as from the winter of 2017 to the spring of 2018, when the Yamagata lineage strain became the dominant pandemic strain alongside IAV (H1N1 and H3N2) [
