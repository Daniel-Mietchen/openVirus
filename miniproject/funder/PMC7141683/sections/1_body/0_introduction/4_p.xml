<p>As has been demonstrated, the potential cytokines after viral infection can be directly or indirectly identified with the aid of transcriptome analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology has been used to identify differences in gene regulation, which links transcriptional activators to the general transcriptional machinery [
 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the present study, we investigated the host immune responses against IBV infection, using the B/Shanghai/PD114/2018 strain as a model, to study the anti-viral capability of IFNs and ISGs, which released in response to IBV infections. These results give us a glimpse into the host innate immunity and antiviral responses, particularly, multiple signaling pathways and antiviral factors that collectively limit viral replication.
