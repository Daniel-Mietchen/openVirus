<p>The interaction between influenza virus infection and the host anti-viral response has been investigated in depth [

 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the regulatory mechanism of IBV infection is also under investigation. Previous research has already shown that IBV ribonucleoprotein rapidly activates TLR signaling pathways [
