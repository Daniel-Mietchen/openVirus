<p>GO analysis revealed that the DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mitotic nuclear division were most significantly regulated by IBV-Yamagata infection, a large cluster of DEGs involved in nuclear chromosome segregation, sister chromatid segregation were observed. In addition, the catalytic activity, acting on DNA, single-stranded, DNA-dependent ATPase activity, damaged DNA binding, ligase activity, forming carbon-nitrogen bonds, and DNA secondary structure binding processes were subclassed to molecular functions (
