<p>The B-SH viruses, which widely circulated in China from September 2017 to April 2018, especially in the autumn and winter when influenza is most prevalent, are nearly major pandemic strains. The B-SH viruses were the dominant strains isolated during the outbreak. To determine the replication efficiency of B-SH viruses in human cells, and the cells were then infected with B-SH viruses (MOI = 0.1). The expression of NP was determined by immunofluorescence, and the fluorescence intensity gradually increased with infection time. The fluorescence intensity was the most obvious at 12 h post infection, with nearly 80% of cells infected by B-SH (

Plaque assays were used to determine viral titers, and Western blotting was used to confirm. Analysis of viral replication in A549 cells found that propagation of B-SH had reached a peak value over a 24 h period, when the titer reached 5 log
