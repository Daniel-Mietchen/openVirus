<p>B-SH virus titer was quantified by a plaque formation assay. When the A549 cells density reached 90%, the cells were infected with B-SH (MOI = 0.1), and were cultured for 4 h in serum-free DMEM medium. Viral inoculum was removed, cells were washed with PBS, and fresh DMEM medium was added. After infection for 0, 4, 8, and 12 h, cells were collected for total RNA extraction.</p>
