<p>The B/Shanghai/PD114/2018 (B-SH; Yamagata lineage) virus was isolated from patients in Shanghai, China, and was a gift from Prof. Dayan Wang of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus stock was propagated in the allantoic cavities of 9-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs, and the virus titer was determined by 10-fold serial titration in MDCK cells according to plaque assays. The virus was stored at −80°C before use.</p>
