<p>A549 cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates overnight. The cells were proliferated on glass coverslips, infected with B-SH (MOI = 0.1) until a monolayer of cells spread to &gt; 80% of the bottom of the culture glass coverslips, incubated for 1 h, and then the inoculum was displaced with DMEM for continued incubation at 37Â°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells were collected at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h, and the specific steps of immunofluorescence assay, as described by Jing et al [
