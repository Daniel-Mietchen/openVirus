<p>Plaque assays were performed as previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0231039.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, MDCK cells were plated on 6-well culture plates and infected by serially diluted B-SH virus in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 2 μg/mL of TPCK-treated trypsin for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Then, the virus was removed, and the cells were washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Next, the cells were overlaid with phenol red free-DMEM medium containing TPCK-treated trypsin (2 μg/mL), 0.6% low melting point agarose and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Visible plaques were counted 72 h post infection to determine the virus titer. Data of all assays were obtained from at least three independent experiments, and expressed as means ± SD.
