 <p>Influenza B virus (IBV) belongs to the 
  <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family and generally causes sporadic epidemics but is occasionally deadly to individuals. The current research mainly focuses on clinical and pathological characteristics of IBV. However, to better prevent or treat the disease, one must determine the strategies developed by IBV to invade and disrupt cellular proteins and approach to replicate itself, to suppress antiviral innate immunity, and understand how the host responds to IBV infection. The B/Shanghai/PD114/2018 virus was able to infect alveolar epithelial cells (A549) cells, with good potential for replication. To identify host cellular responses against IBV infection, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained using RNA sequencing. The GO and KEGG pathway term enrichment analyses with the DEGs were performed, and we found that the DEGs were primary involved in metabolic processes and cellular function, which may be related to the host response, including the innate immune response against the virus. Our transcriptome analysis results demonstrated robust induction of interferon and interferon-stimulated gene expression by IBV in human cells during the early stages of infection, providing a foundation for further studies focused on antiviral drug development and interactions between the virus and host.
