<p>Where there is an unmet need of priority to the WHO for a new vaccine, the WHO may establish a Blueprint programme 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0079" ref-type="ref">79</xref>. As vaccine candidates for the specific Blueprint programme advance through the development process, and particularly when they have attached clinical data, the WHO may run a prequalification check to determine whether the candidate meets their requirements on behalf of UN agencies that will ultimately purchase vaccines 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0080" ref-type="ref">80</xref>. To do this, WHO will engage with subject matter experts to draft and publish a target product profile (TPP) for a vaccine requirement. WHO will use its Scientific Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) to review vaccine candidate performance against the TPP and to prequalify a vaccine candidate(s) which fulfils the TPP.
