<p>Immune parameters which correlate with protection in the selected animal models may include the total titre of circulating antibody induced to the vaccine and the determination of a minimum cut‐off titre required to confer protection. Alternatively, the titre of functional or neutralizing antibody within that total may provide the correlate, particularly where the neutralization of specific virulence factors produced by the biothreat agent is identified and quantifiable
