<p>In the absence of direct efficacy testing in the human vaccinee, the immune correlate identified above provides a surrogate marker of efficacy. If this is a functional antibody, the titre induced in man needs to be compared with the titre required in the animal model(s) to provide protection. This can be achieved, for example, by the 
 <italic>in‐vitro</italic> neutralization of a specific virulence factor, or by a competitive enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), where the test antibody is competed with a known neutralizing antibody for binding to the target antigen or by the passive transfer of antibody from a human vaccinee into a naive animal, followed by pathogen challenge
