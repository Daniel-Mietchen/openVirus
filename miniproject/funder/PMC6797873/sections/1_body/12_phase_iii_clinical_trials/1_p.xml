<p>The third phase of clinical trials is typically designed to assess efficacy. However, where this is not feasible for either practical/logistical or ethical reasons, Phase III could be regarded as a further, significantly enlarged trial for vaccine safety with adequate follow‚Äêup of vaccinated volunteers. A Phase III field trial of vaccine efficacy may be feasible in the event of an anticipated seasonal outbreak, in which case vaccination could be given prophylactically and well in advance. As long as effective biosurveillance programmes are in place to instigate a rapid response to new infections in an unvaccinated placebo cohort, the latter group may be included in a prophylactic efficacy trial. Conversely, reactive mode vaccination in the context of an actual outbreak is likely to be more complicated, as it would be unethical to omit anyone at risk of infection from the vaccination programme. Hence, sufficient safety data on the candidate vaccine would be required in case of need to administer it to pregnant/nursing mothers, children and elderly people as well as to the general adult population. Additionally, it may be necessary to administer an adjunct to the vaccine, such as an appropriate antibiotic, to both cohorts (vaccinated and placebo). Whatever the context, careful consideration of the trial design needs to be made and approved by the regulators to achieve adequate statistical powering and to determine the need to provide supplementary antimicrobial therapy, and also the need for a placebo cohort.</p>
