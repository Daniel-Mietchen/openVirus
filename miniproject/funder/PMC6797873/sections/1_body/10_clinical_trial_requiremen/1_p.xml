<p>Assuming that the preclinical safety and toxicology testing has been satisfactory, a protocol for Phase I testing of the vaccine candidate may be submitted to the regulatory authorities for approval. The primary objective of the Phase I clinical trial is to test the vaccine candidate for safety in informed and consenting adult volunteers who will be selected according to pre‐agreed inclusion/exclusion criteria. As this is the first time the candidate is being used in man, the Phase I trial is typically small and cautious. If a range of dose‐levels is being tested, it may be necessary to dose a sentinel group of single subjects from each arm of the study to assess safety through week 1 of immunization and starting at the lowest level before proceeding to the next level. The data from the sentinel group would be reviewed before proceeding with the main study. Then the first cohort would be dosed at the lowest level before proceeding to the next level, and so on. Volunteers will be closely monitored for adverse effects in the clinic at each dosing time‐point and will typically maintain a diary at home to record any symptoms arising between time‐points. An independent safety monitoring panel, including medically qualified personnel, will be required to monitor the reporting of adverse effects. Volunteers may also be blood‐sampled to assess vaccine immunogenicity from baseline and serial samples, and depending on vaccine type may be required to supply additional samples which can be collected non‐invasively, e.g. saliva/stool samples. All volunteers may be followed up for a pre‐agreed period on completion of the study, to check for latent adverse events and to monitor, e.g. for maintenance of circulating antibody titres or memory response to the vaccine.</p>
