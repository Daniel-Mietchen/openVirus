<p>After the anthrax letters incident in the United States in 2001 in which anthrax was released through the postal system, resulting in five fatalities and widespread anxiety 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0081" ref-type="ref">81</xref>, the FDA issued the Animal Rule (FDA 21 CFR) 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">82</xref> to expedite the development of vaccines and therapies for biothreat agents for which it is neither feasible nor ethical to carry out Phase III efficacy studies in man. In this situation, the Animal Rule makes provision for the substitution of animal efficacy data for human efficacy data. The animal efficacy data should demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that the candidate vaccine or therapy would be efficacious in man 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">82</xref>. The animal efficacy data should be provided ideally from more than one animal model, or from one model only if that model is well‐characterized and authentically represents the human disease syndrome 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">82</xref>. In addition, the FDA may require supporting data to include pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD data) and a determination of the pathophysiological mechanism of action of the biothreat agent and a ‘reasonable understanding’ of the protective mechanism of the proposed vaccine or therapy. Thus, if the candidate is a vaccine, a reasonable understanding of the protective mechanism(s) being invoked by it requires an identification of the immune correlates of protection.
