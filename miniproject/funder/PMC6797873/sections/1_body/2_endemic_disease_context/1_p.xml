<p>Globally, there are many regions of endemic disease which are maintained by reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens in the local wild animal species. These pathogens comprise viral, bacterial and rickettsial species and some have complex lifecycles, infecting an environmental (e.g. standing water) or animal reservoir and then being transmitted either by direct contact with man or indirectly, via an insect (e.g. mosquito) or mammalian (e.g. bat, civet, camel) vector, to man, from which they may be spread by human‐to‐human transmission. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="cei13284-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). An example of a serious and widespread bacterial infection is mosquito‐transmitted 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, causing malaria in many tropical regions. Malaria causes significant morbidity and co‐morbidity in these regions in which it is endemic. Due to the complex life cycle of the causative bacterium, it has been challenging to achieve a vaccine for malaria. The most advanced candidate is the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>, which is undergoing a pilot implementation in three countries in sub‐Saharan Africa, with a view to determining its impact on disease prior to a wider implementation 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>. Despite the availability of approved vaccines 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref>, typhoid fever and cholera remain significantly debilitating enteric diseases in regions of the world where hygienic living conditions are poor and there is little access to health care. Both infections are caused by bacteria (
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> and 
 <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic>, respectively) which exist in contaminated water and food. Tuberculosis (TB) is a respiratory infection which is widespread globally. Caused by 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, and transmitted to man from zoonotic reservoirs (badgers, cattle) with a high potential for subsequent human‐to‐human transmission, TB is prevalent in susceptible individuals living in overcrowded conditions 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. Although the BCG vaccine has been in routine use for many years, variable efficacy has been reported, depending on region of use 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> with 60–80% reported in the United Kingdom but lower levels in equatorial countries. The emergence of multi‐drug‐resistant TB (MDR TB) in recent years raises the bar for treatment of this disease and makes a high level of vaccine efficacy even more important 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>. Examples of zoonotic reservoirs which maintain endemic viral diseases are numerous and are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="cei13284-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. In particular, viral endemic disease is caused by the coronaviruses (MERS and SARS) in Saudi Arabia and the Eastern Mediterranean countries; and by the Lassa arenavirus, which is endemic in West African countries and caused a serious outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria in 2018 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref>; other viruses which are endemic and cause viral haemorrhagic fever include dengue, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>, the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) which have a zoonotic reservoir in bats in sub‐Saharan Africa 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref>; and yellow fever virus, which is prevalent in Africa, Central and South America and the Caribbean 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref>. Interestingly, the same mosquito (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti)</italic> which spreads yellow fever virus also transmits the dengue, chikungunya and zika viruses 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>. Chikungunya virus has a widespread distribution in Africa, Asia, India and South America and with occasional cases in Europe, and causes a debilitating, but rarely fatal, disease 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref>. Zika virus emerged in Brazil in 2015 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref>, although it was first detected in monkeys in Uganda as early as 1947 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0033" ref-type="ref">33</xref>, and the first documented human case occurred in Nigeria in 1954 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>. The large Brazilian outbreak of Zika viral disease culminated in 2017, with thousands of cases reported 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref>. Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) is another zoonotic virus which is endemic in sub‐Saharan Africa and primarily infects cattle, sheep and goats, but can be transmitted to man by mosquito bite to cause an acute fever
