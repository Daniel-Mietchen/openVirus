<p>An example of a bacterium which has been classed as a re‐emerging pathogen and which is endemic in global regions is 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic>, causative of plague. Bubonic plague is endemic in regions such as Madagascar, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), India and China

 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">39</xref>. Over thousands of years, 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> has evolved away from the enteric yersinia species to become a lethal flea‐transmitted bacterium 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref>. It is transmitted to man, typically from a zoonotic reservoir in infected rats or other rodents (e.g. ground squirrels or prairie dogs), by flea‐bite to cause bubonic plague 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="cei13284-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). If not detected and treated, this can develop into either septicemic plague or the most serious form of all, a secondary pneumonic plague. In turn, individuals with pneumonic plague can transmit this by aerosol droplet to others, to establish a primary pneumonic plague infection. Each year, a few cases of plague are also reported in the Southwestern United States, where the disease has been endemic in the rodent population since the late 1800s 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref>. As well as infecting the rodent population, infected fleas can spread 
 <italic>Y. pestis</italic> to other wildlife species (e.g. rabbits/hares or, rarely, domesticated animals 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">43</xref>) which, in turn, raises the potential of transmission to man by inhalation to cause a primary pneumonic plague. In endemic areas, outbreaks of plague are often associated with seasonal environmental changes, causing rodents to stray closer to human habitation. The plague outbreak in Madagascar during 2017/18 was particularly serious, with an estimated 2671 cases and 239 deaths (8·9% fatality rate) 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">44</xref>. This outbreak was approximately sixfold greater than usual, with an unusual predominance of pneumonic, rather than bubonic plague.
