<p>The second phase of clinical trials typically allows for an enlarged study to assess vaccine safety and to monitor immunogenicity. During this phase, significantly expanded cohorts of volunteers may be dosed with vaccine at dose‐level(s) selected as optimum from the Phase I trial and can be monitored for safety and a more detailed immunogenicity assessment, which may include assays of both serological and cellular memory responses. Once again, volunteers may be blood‐sampled for baseline and serial serum/plasma samples, and depending on vaccine type may be required to supply additional samples which can be collected non‐invasively, e.g. whole blood/saliva/stool. In the event that a Phase III trial for efficacy is not feasible, for ethical or practical reasons, it may be necessary to plan a blood‐sampling regimen in the volunteers which will enable sufficient sample volumes to be available for Animal Rule studies (discussed below).</p>
