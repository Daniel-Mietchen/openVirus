<p>Pathogens which are classed as emerging or re‐emerging are identified through global surveillance programmes and organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO). Although labelled ‘emerging’, most of these pathogens are not new and have either been quiescent in the environment until the conditions are opportune to emerge or have evolved from a parent organism to adapt to the prevailing conditions. Thus, there is an intricate relationship between the environment, the climate, wildlife and human existence and lifestyle. The coronaviruses exemplify this point: the ancestral virus possibly existed approximately 10 000 years ago

 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. It is likely that warm‐blooded flying birds and bats have co‐evolved with the coronaviruses to aid dissemination 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. For example, SARS is thought to have first infected Old World bats, then spreading to horseshoe bats

 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. In the 2003 outbreak of SARS in China and adjacent countries, phylogenetic analysis suggested that the virus spread from bats to humans, possibly through the intermediary civet species. Neither bats or civets showed any clinical signs of infection, and it is thought that bats are the main zoonotic reservoirs for the virus
