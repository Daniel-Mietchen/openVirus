 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> and CDC 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref> also publish lists of pathogens of priority which comprise bacteria and viruses, but categorize these into three groups depending on pathogenicity, accessibility and the availability of vaccines and therapies. All the viruses listed by the WHO also occur on these lists, alongside bacterial pathogens of concern. One of these is 
 <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>, causative of bubonic and pneumonic plague, which is recognized by all three bodies (WHO, CDC, NIAID) as a current priority following the exceptionally large and serious outbreak between September 2017 to April 2018 in Madagascar 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, where the disease is endemic. In addition, NIAID recognizes the added threat to human health posed by the acquisition of AMR by pathogens and WHO has also published a priority list 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> of bacterial species for which R&amp;D is required to develop new antibiotics (Table 
 <xref rid="cei13284-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
