<p>In the United States, the alternative approaches to full marketing approval that are available for vaccines under development and which may be considered through the FDA are to either request an EUA or to request expanded access (EA), sometimes called compassionate use. The EUA is issued in support of potential and actual public health, military and domestic emergencies involving chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear agents (CBRN), including emerging infectious diseases, e.g. pandemic influenza. Such FDA‐approved medical products which may be stockpiled for use in emergencies are referred to as medical countermeasures (MCM) and include biological products, e.g. vaccines, drugs and devices. Specifically, the EUA authority is separate and distinct from use of an investigational medical product held under an IND and must be able to treat serious or life‐threatening diseases or conditions.</p>
