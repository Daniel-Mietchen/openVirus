<p>In Canada, access to drugs through special access programmes (SAPs) exists for serious and life‐threatening conditions, when marketed alternative products are not available or unsuitable and evidence supports the intended use. Priority review of marketing submissions and ‘notice of compliance with conditions’ for such products may also be considered and granted by Health Canada.</p>
