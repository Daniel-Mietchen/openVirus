<p>It is essential to ensure safety of the drug product before entering a clinical trial, and the drug product may be tested in suitable small animal models for the absence of adverse effects under conditions of repeated dosing at the anticipated human dose level, as well as in the intended human schedule, but at multiples of the anticipated human dose‐level. The use of rodent models (mouse or rat) for this testing allows for sufficient statistical powering of such safety/toxicological testing. If the clinical trial is to be conducted in women of child‐bearing age, it may be necessary to carry out reproductive toxicology testing of the drug product; in this case it may be necessary also to use a sensitive rabbit model and to administer the vaccine to pregnant rabbits to screen for adverse effects in the mother and potential teratogenic effects in the F
 <sub>1</sub> generation.
