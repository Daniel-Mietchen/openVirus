<p>From the discovery phase to the clinic, vaccine development requires the completion of a series of steps represented as a generic outline in Fig. 
 <xref rid="cei13284-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The regulatory agencies lay down specific guidance for these steps 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0077" ref-type="ref">77</xref>, 
 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0078" ref-type="ref">78</xref> and this review presumes no authority in this regard, but seeks to give a generalized overview of a generic vaccine development process. Exit from the discovery and preclinical phases requires substantive data demonstrating immunogenicity and efficacy in at least one suitable animal model(s). Where possible, efficacy in the animal model should be demonstrated by direct exposure to the pathogen concerned. Technology transfer for manufacture under good manufacturing practice (GMP) will require a demonstration of known provenance of all essential materials required in the manufacture of the vaccine candidate. This includes seed stocks of cell lines from which recombinant proteins may be expressed, e.g. 
 <italic>Escherichia</italic>
 <italic>coli</italic>, human embryo kidney cells, baculovirus, tobacco mosaic virus; or seed stocks of attenuated vaccine vectors, e.g. viral vectors such as adenovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus, modified Vaccinia Ankara; or bacterial vaccine vectors, e.g. salmonella, listeria; the genetic constructs cloned into the cell line in question; all culture media and components and all formulations and excipients.
