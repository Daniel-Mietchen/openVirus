<p>Transfer of the manufacturing process to GMP may include scale‐up and conversion to, for example, fermentation conditions, or to plant‐based, mammalian cell line or insect cell line expression on an expanded scale. This transfer will probably require the demonstration of consistency between consecutive batches at GMP, which will also enable the development of scaled‐up downstream processing methodology. Vaccine components (the drug substance) from these batches may be formulated (the drug product) as required and used in safety/toxicology studies and for immunogenicity/efficacy in an appropriate second animal model, which will be as representative as possible of the human response. The second animal model is often, but not necessarily, a non‐human primate, and the selection of this second model will depend entirely on the vaccine indication.</p>
