<p>There will also be a requirement to generate sufficient stability data on both the drug substance and the drug product and to demonstrate that the drug product is stable for at least the duration of the intended Phase I clinical trial under prevalent conditions in that location. Clearly, extended stability testing under a range of conditions, including accelerated conditions (high ambient temperature and relative humidity), will also be required to progress the vaccine through development. As well as determining its stability, both the drug substance and product will require characterization for properties such as identity, purity, isoelectric point, osmolality, endotoxin levels and potency, to demonstrate consistency between batches and to allow for release of these for clinical trials.</p>
