<p>Globally, there are a number of emerging and re‐emerging pathogens. Some of these cause endemic disease in regions of the globe, where they are maintained in zoonotic reservoirs and transmitted to man either by direct or indirect contact. For most of the emerging pathogens there are no licensed vaccines available for human use, although there is ongoing research and development. However, given the extensive and increasing list of emerging pathogens and the time and investment required to bring vaccines into clinical use, the task is huge. Overlaid on this task is the risk of anti‐microbial resistance (AMR) acquisition by micro‐organisms which can endow a relatively harmless organism with pathogenic potential. Furthermore, climate change also introduces a challenge by causing some of the insect vectors and environmental conditions prevalent in tropical regions to begin to spread out from these traditional areas, thus increasing the risk of migration of zoonotic disease.</p>
