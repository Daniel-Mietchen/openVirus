<p>Vaccination provides a defence against these emerging pathogens. However, to date, vaccines for pathogens which cause severe, but occasional, disease outbreaks in endemic pockets have suffered from a lack of commercial incentive for development to a clinical standard. While approval of vaccines for diseases caused by such pathogens would make a significant impact on disease outbreaks, taking niche vaccines into clinical development, including Phase III clinical trials for efficacy, requires a large investment in time and money.</p>
