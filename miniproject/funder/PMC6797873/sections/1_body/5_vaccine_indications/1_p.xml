<p>Here it may be worth drawing a distinction between prophylactic vaccination, i.e. general use prophylaxis (GUP), given routinely and not necessarily in the face of specific, predicted outbreaks, in contrast to post‐exposure prophylactic (PEP) vaccination, to be given after a suspected exposure to a pathogen, or to ring‐fence an outbreak or, indeed, post‐exposure therapeutic (PET) vaccination, to be given after an actual exposure. In the PEP and PET contexts, the benefit of vaccination vastly outweighs the risk of disease (i.e. the risk : benefit ratio is low), while in the prophylactic context the risk : benefit ratio may be greater than, or equal to, 1·0). For infections with short incubation times, e.g. less than 72 h, as for pneumonic plague, PEP or PET vaccination may only be useful if administered under antibiotic cover. In the United States, once a vaccine candidate has been thoroughly tested for safety in non‐clinical models, and in an escalating‐dose, statistically powered, Phase I design in the clinic, from then on it may be possible to pursue approval for an EUA, rather than pursue the full‐length pathway to biological licensing authorization (BLA). This can enable the earlier availability of vaccines for use in endemic regions. However, it should be noted that EUA is only available through the Food and Drug Agency (FDA) in the United States. Some alternative regulatory mechanisms that may be considered prior to licensing are outlined below.</p>
