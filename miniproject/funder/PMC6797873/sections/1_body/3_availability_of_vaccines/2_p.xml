 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref>). Additionally, live attenuated plague vaccines, derived from an attenuated mutant strain as the EV series, have been used in the former USSR (fUSSR) and are still used in Asia, notably in Russia and China

 <xref rid="cei13284-bib-0057" ref-type="ref">57</xref>. EV76, the most commonly cited of these, provides protective efficacy against plague, but is licensed for human use only in countries of the fUSSR and is documented to cause serious adverse effects in non‚Äêhuman primates and malaise and adverse effects in human vaccinees [57].
