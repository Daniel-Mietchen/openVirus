<p>In summary, we establish a significant association between low DVGs accumulation and an increase in severe or fatal outcome in human influenza virus infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g009">Fig 9</xref>); we provide genetic support for this association in infected cultured cells and in mice. In addition to the previous reports about the role of DVGs in natural animal infections here we present data indicating that a reduced accumulation of DVGs may be considered a new virulence marker for viral pathogenicity in humans. Evaluation of DVGs phenotype of circulating viruses might predict its potential to induce severe disease. Additional work is needed to define specific DVGs function and the mechanism by which they are produced in humans. These data could contribute substantially to the prediction of influenza disease severity and enable the development of risk-based prevention strategies and policies.
