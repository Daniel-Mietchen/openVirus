<p>Regarding the possible mechanism of PA in low DVGs production, colleagues E. Fodor and G. Brownlee described some years ago that mutation A638R in the PA subunit was involved in the enormous accumulation of DGs in cell culture [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It was there described that this high DGs generation was due to an elongation defect by destabilization of RNA-PA subunit interaction, and that this phenomenon could be reverted by another mutation in the same PA polymerase subunit (C453R). The authors proposed a putative domain involved in elongation activity in the PA-C part of this polymerase subunit. We have localized PAD529N mutation in the viral polymerase structure (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and they are spatially in the same PA-C domain nearby these previously described mutations. This data suggests that PA D529N may be involved in the same elongation process, although this activity would need to be further explored. In addition, Influenza A virus polymerase exists in different oligomerization state [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], which allows different assembly of polymerase monomers during replication [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. A new proposed mechanism suggests that the RNA depending RNA polymerase (vRdRP) dimer bound to viral RNA recruits another free polymerase dimer to form transient tetramer, which initiates replication of viral genome [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. PA D529N mutation localizes on the interaction surface of this proposed dimerization model of the viral polymerase (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). All these data suggest that this mutation (or other mutations on this same area) may alter the possible polymerase dimerization or, it may modify the stability of the RNA- polymerase complex, or additionally it may change the interaction with any cellular required factor, or any combination of them.
