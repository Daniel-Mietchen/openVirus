<p>Although DVGs are produced in the polymerase segments (PB1, PB2 and PA), as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], most viruses studied here also generate DVGs in other segments (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g005">5B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g010">10</xref>). The distribution of DVGs of the different cohorts is interestingly observed in some distinct viral segments, which is specially reduced (23-fold) for the polymerase subunits segments in the severe/fatalâ€”associated case viruses compared to viruses isolated from mild cases (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). These findings suggest that the genomic combination of DVGs produced by each virus, and not only absolute numbers, may also contribute to pathogenicity.
