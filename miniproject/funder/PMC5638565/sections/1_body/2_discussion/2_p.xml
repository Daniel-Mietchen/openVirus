<p>Selection criteria used for determination of putative virulent markers found in 2009 in F-IAV has been updated, and the prevalence of these changes in H1N1 viruses circulating in humans was calculated using all sequences available in the NCBI Influenza Resource database from December 2009 to March 2016. This analysis showed that PA D529N change continues to be a rare mutation specific of F-IAV, but PB2 221 position admitted several changes including T. This data indicates that at position 221 of PB2 changes have been established in addition to the original A in the further circulating viruses after the influenza 2009 pandemic and this position might not be relevant for the increased pathogenicity of the F-IAV (
