<p>Here we adopted a highly restrictive approach to evaluate the potential role of DVGs accumulation as a determinant of severe influenza disease in humans, although a contribution of the immune status of the patient to the infection outcome cannot be excluded. We analyzed influenza viruses from a select cohort of patients, under 65 years and over 4 years of age, who suffered severe or fatal influenza infection. These viruses were compared with those obtained from a cohort of mild infected patients detected through the regular surveillance system. Deep sequencing identified an inverse correlation between DVGs accumulation and virus pathogenicity in these cohorts (

Those patients with no known comorbidities infected with low DVGs producer viruses developed a severe outcome, and those who showed comorbid conditions eventually died, indicating that both factors may contribute to the fatal outcome of the infection. The later data is in agreement with our previous study where we found that, besides being infected with the virulent F-IAV, which accumulates a reduced amount of DVGs, the infected patient presented a new confirmed genetic risk factor, a truncated form of

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, both the high virulence of the infecting virus, and the genetic risk factor, may have contributed to the fatal outcome of the patient.
