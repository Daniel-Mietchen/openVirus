<p>Influenza virus pathogenicity has been studied in depth for many years, and several amino acid changes have been identified as virulence determinants [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], however, a general pathogenicity determinant has not been characterized. Although DVGs have been described in natural animal infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and in pandemic AH1N1pdm09- and other respiratory virus-infected individuals [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] their role in viral pathogenicity in patients has not been evaluated. The correlation between DVGs accumulation and severe disease observed in the severe/fatal- and mild-case viruses isolated from respiratory samples suggests that DVGs generation is a critical feature of severe influenza virus infection. We tested this hypothesis genetically by analyzing recombinant viruses bearing mutations identified in a fatal-outcome virus (F-IAV, mutations PB2 A221T and PA D529N) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] or described elsewhere (mutations M1 S30N + M2 V86S) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Whereas the non-pathogenic mutation PB2 A221T accumulates high levels of DVGs in cultured cells and is attenuated in mice (PB2

 <italic>mut</italic> versus M 
 <italic>mut</italic>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). Moreover, recombinant viruses carrying PA D529N mutation displayed increased viral pathogenicity in the infected mice (PB2/PA 
 <italic>mut</italic> and PA 
 <italic>mut</italic>) (
