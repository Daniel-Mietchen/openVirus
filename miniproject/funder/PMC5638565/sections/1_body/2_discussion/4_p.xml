<p>None of the severe/fatal cohort viruses bore PA D529N change. This result suggest that low DVGs accumulation in severe/fatal-case viruses might be mediated by various changes other than D529N in PA polymerase subunit, or in distinct polymerase subunits (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s018">S3 Table</xref>), or in several viral proteins; this coincides with the complex, multigenic nature of the pathogenesis mechanisms [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] modulate DVGs production in cell culture. Mutations in M1 and M2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] also modulate DVGs accumulation, probably by altering DVGs encapsidation in progeny virions [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, reduced accumulation of DVGs constitutes a virulent factor itself, regardless the mutations responsible.
