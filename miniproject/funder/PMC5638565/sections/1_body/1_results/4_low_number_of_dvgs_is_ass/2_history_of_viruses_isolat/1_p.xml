<p>All these viruses were obtained from exudates of the upper respiratory tract. Similarly to the described above for F- and M-IAV, we isolated the viruses from each clinical sample and the titer of each isolated viruses was determined for this first passage. To obtain the required amounts to purify the corresponding virions, all viruses were grown in cell culture in normalized conditions at a controlled low multiplicity of infection to limit the production of DVGs, as indicated in the material and methods section. This procedure would eliminate RNA amount differences due to the clinical status, time or site of sampling and genetic background of the infected patients and viruses obtained from this passage were used for deep-sequencing (
