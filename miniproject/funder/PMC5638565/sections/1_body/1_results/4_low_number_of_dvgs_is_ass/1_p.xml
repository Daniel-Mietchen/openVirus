<p>Next, we wanted to examine whether accumulation of DVGs play a role in the pathogenicity of influenza viruses in humans. Deep-sequencing of RNA from viruses isolated from respiratory samples of a select cohort of A(H1N1)pdm09-like virus-infected patients was performed. This cohort includes patients with highly severe outcome including severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) with mechanical ventilation and endotracheal intubation for more than 96 hours (
