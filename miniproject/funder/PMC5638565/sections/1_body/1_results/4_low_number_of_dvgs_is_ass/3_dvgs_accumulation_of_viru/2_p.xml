<p>In addition to the viral full-length RNAs, DVGs were observed in all samples. The proportion between sequence reads corresponding to DVGs deletion sites (junction reads) and total virus reads was calculated for each virus (DVGs proportion); we observed a 10-fold reduction in the DVGs proportion in viruses isolated from severe/fatal cases (n = 6) compared to those from mild patients (n = 6; p = 0.0152) (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we have additionally statistically evaluated the amount of DVGs generated exclusively in those segments (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). It can be observed that the difference in these three segments is indeed greater (23-fold; p = 0.0124) than in the whole viral genome. These both data support the notion that viruses with low DVGs abundance have a role in the severe and fatal outcome in IAV infected patients.
