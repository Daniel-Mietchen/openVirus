<p>We have obtained the consensus sequence of all mild and severe/fatal viruses and none of the previous DVGs modulating mutations were detected in any of them. Additionally we analyzed in detail the consensus sequence of the three-polymerase subunits for all the evaluated viruses and mutations found in any of the severe/fatal viruses that were not present in mild viruses were selected. The prevalence of these changes in H1N1 viruses circulating in humans was calculated using all sequences available in the NCBI Influenza Resource database up to March 2016. Those mutations present in &lt;1% of the circulating viruses were selected as additional putative severe/fatal exclusive mutations (
