<p>The activity of the reconstituted polymerases of these three mutant viruses and the wild-type virus was first evaluated in a mini-replicon assay, which showed not significant differences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Next, growth kinetics in cell culture showed that all recombinant viruses accumulates similar levels of viral proteins in a single cycle replication assay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and replicated at a similar rate in a multiple cycle assay (
