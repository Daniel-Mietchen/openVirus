<p>Next, the induction of the antiviral response by the different recombinant viruses was evaluated by monitoring the accumulation of antiviral proteins Mx and ISG56 by western blot at 16 hpi. Treatment with IFN or infection with Del NS1 virus was used as positive control of induction of the antiviral response in these cells. PB2 mut infected cells accumulate higher amount of Mx than the other CAL, PA mut or PB2/PA mut recombinant viruses infected cells (4.4-fold, 2.0-fold and 3.5-fold, p&lt;0.001, respectively) (
