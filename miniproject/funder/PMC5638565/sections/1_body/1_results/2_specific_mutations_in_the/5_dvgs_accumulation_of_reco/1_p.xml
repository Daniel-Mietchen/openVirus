<p>Similarly to F- and M-IAV, we evaluated DVGs accumulation of viral stocks by analyzing the amount of DVGs versus complete viral RNA of the same genome segment by RT-PCR as described previously (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). This analysis showed that the PB2 mut virus stock had more DVGs than CAL wt virus or virus carrying PA 529N mutation (PA 
 <italic>mut</italic>) and, that PA mutation is able to reduce this large accumulation (compare PB2 
 <italic>mut</italic> vs PB2/PA 
 <italic>mut</italic>

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) and sequenced to corroborate that they correspond to viral RNA segments with large internal deletions (

In addition, cultures of human lung epithelial cells were infected at 3 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell and accumulation of DVGs over time was evaluated for each mutant virus in these conditions in which the production of DVGs is exacerbated [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). This analysis showed that all viruses generate and accumulate DVGs in the infected cells and PB2 
 <italic>mut</italic> virus produces DVGs at higher rate than PA 
 <italic>mut</italic> virus (5.4-fold, p&lt;0.05 at 4hpi and 9-fold, p&lt;0.001 at 8hpi) and PB2/PA mut virus (13-fold, p&lt;0.01 at 4hpi and 5.8-fold, p&lt;0.001 at 8hpi) (
