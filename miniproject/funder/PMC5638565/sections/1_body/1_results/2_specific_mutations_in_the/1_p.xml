<p>Comparison of the F- and M-IAV consensus sequences showed nine amino acid changes in the F isolate [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] taken the A/California/04/2009 strain as reference. Changes in the viral polymerase PA (D529N) and PB2 (A221T) subunits and the surface glycoprotein HA (S127L) found in &lt;1% of viruses circulating during 2009 influenza season were considered specific and potentially responsible for the difference in virulence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since DVGs are mainly produced by the viral polymerase, PA D529N and PB2 A 221T changes in the polymerase subunits were selected as putative responsible for low DVGs production and increased pathogenicity of F-IAV.
