<p>To confirm that the PA D529N mutation in F-IAV has a major effect on the ability to produce low DVGs numbers, we generated recombinant CAL viruses bearing mutations in genes other than polymerase subunits, such as matrix 1 (M1) and matrix 2 (M2) viral genes (M1 S30N + M2 V86S). These mutations enable influenza virus to accumulate large numbers of DVGs in an H3N2 viral strain [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We deep-sequenced RNA from virions purified from recombinant viruses with these M1/M2 mutations, alone (M 
 <italic>mut</italic>) or with these M1/M2 mutations and PA D529N mutation (M-PA 
 <italic>mut</italic>). DVGs number and distribution in these virions are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g005">Fig 5C and 5B</xref>, right columns. We found a 37-fold DVGs increase in M 
 <italic>mut</italic> compared to wild-type (wt) CAL virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), in accordance with the ability of the M1/M2 mutations to increase DVGs in an H3N2 influenza virus [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As predicted, introduction of the PA D529N mutation on the M 
 <italic>mut</italic> background decreased the DVGs proportion (4-fold;
