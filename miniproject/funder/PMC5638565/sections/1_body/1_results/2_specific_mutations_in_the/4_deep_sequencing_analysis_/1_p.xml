<p>Deep sequencing of RNA from purified virions of wild-type and mutant recombinant viruses showed that CAL virus accumulates low DVGs levels, which coincides with the reported high virulence of the CAL reference strain [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and is similar to the F-IAV (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). The PB2/PA mut and PA mut viruses showed DVGs accumulation similar to CAL virus (2.6- and 1.3-fold change, respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), whereas PB2 mut had a 27-fold higher DVG ratio than CAL virus, which was almost 11-fold higher than PB2/PA mut (with the F-like polymerase) (
