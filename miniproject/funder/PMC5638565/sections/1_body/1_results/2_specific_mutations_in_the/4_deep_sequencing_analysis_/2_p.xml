<p>DVGs proportion of CAL virus is taken as 1 and DVGs proportion of the other recombinant viruses are indicated as CAL fold-change. We determined DVGs distribution per viral segment for all DVGs found in each recombinant virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, left columns), and observed that the DVGs derive from several segments. These data indicated that the PB2 A221T mutation enabled high DVGs accumulation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g005">Fig 5A</xref>; compare PB2
