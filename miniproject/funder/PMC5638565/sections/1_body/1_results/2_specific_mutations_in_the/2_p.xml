<p>To further characterize the role of mutations in the F-IAV polymerase subunits as virulence determinants, we generated on the A/H1N1/California/04/09 virus backbone (CAL), recombinant influenza viruses bearing the combination of PA D529N and PB2 A221T mutations (PB2/PA 
 <italic>mut</italic>; F-IAV-like polymerase), or viruses bearing single PA D529N (PA 
 <italic>mut</italic>) or PB2 A221T (PB2 
 <italic>mut</italic>) mutations (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat.1006650.t001">Table 1</xref>). These viruses were grown in cell culture at a low moi (0.0001) to limit the production of DVGs and viruses obtained from this passage were used for the following assays.
