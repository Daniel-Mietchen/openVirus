<p>To evaluate the pathogenesis induced by the different recombinant viruses carrying mutations present in F-IAV, we infected mice with various virus doses of CAL, PB2 
 <italic>mut</italic>, PA 
 <italic>mut</italic> or PB2/PA 
 <italic>mut</italic> viruses or with DMEM as control. Survival (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) and body weight (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s009">S9 Fig</xref>) were monitored daily for two weeks and the lethal dose 50 (LD50) for each virus was determined. CAL, PB2 
 <italic>mut</italic>, PA 
 <italic>mut</italic> and PB2/PA 
 <italic>mut</italic> viruses showed an LD50 of 1x10
 <sup>5</sup>, &gt;10
 <sup>6</sup>, 3 x 10
 <sup>3</sup> and 3.5 x 10
 <sup>4</sup>, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). These data confirmed that CAL virus is pathogenic in mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and indicated that the PA D529N mutation greatly increased pathogenicity, suggesting a decisive effect of this polymerase change on disease outcome. PB2 
 <italic>mut</italic>, which accumulates high DVG levels, was greatly attenuated compared with the CAL virus. Reconstitution of the F-like polymerase-containing virus (PB2/PA 
 <italic>mut</italic>) notably reduced DVGs accumulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) and led to higher pathogenicity compared with PB2 
 <italic>mut</italic> virus (
