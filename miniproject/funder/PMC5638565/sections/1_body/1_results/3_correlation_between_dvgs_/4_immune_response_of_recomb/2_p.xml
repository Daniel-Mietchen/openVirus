<p>Altogether, these data demonstrate that a mutated PA D529N derived from a fatal-case IAV decreases DVGs generation and support the idea that reduced DG accumulation is a pathogenic determinant for influenza virus in mice. These results corroborate the importance of low DG abundance in fatal influenza outcome.</p>
