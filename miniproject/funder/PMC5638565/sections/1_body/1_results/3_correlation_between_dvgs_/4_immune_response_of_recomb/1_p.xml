<p>Virus pathogenicity depends on the nature of the virus, the host conditions and its rapid and adequate response to the infection. We have previously described the higher lung tissue damage induced by F-IAV compared to M-IAV infected mice [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, we have observed that F-IAV seems to induce higher inflammation in the lungs of the infected animals than M-IAV; proliferation of macrophages as a representative lesion of interstitial pneumonia together with vasculitis as accumulation of neutrophils was shown (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). To see if the recombinant viruses produced different immune response, we monitored by flow cytometry analysis the presence of neutrophils and alveolar macrophages in PA 
 <italic>mut</italic>, PB2 
 <italic>mut</italic> or PB2/PA 
 <italic>mut</italic>- infected lungs at several days post-infection of sub-lethal infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). Recombinant viruses with PA D529N change (PA 
 <italic>mut</italic> and PB2/PA 
 <italic>mut</italic>) induced higher infiltration of neutrophils and significant depletion of alveolar macrophages than attenuated PB2 
 <italic>mut</italic> virus at 2dpi in the lungs of infected animals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). These two alterations in cellular immune response observed for viruses carrying PA D529N change have been described as essential factors for lethal influenza virus infections [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and agree with the role of PA D529N change in pathogenicity in vivo.
