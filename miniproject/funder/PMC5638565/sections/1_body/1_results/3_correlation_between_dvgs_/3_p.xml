<p>To further evaluate the pathogenicity differences among viruses bearing mutations present in F-IAV, mice were infected with a sub-lethal dose (10
 <sup>3</sup> pfu) of recombinant mutant viruses, or were mock-infected. Samples were recovered at several days post-infection (dpi) and viral titers determined in lung (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). PA 
 <italic>mut</italic>-infected mice showed the highest titers at 1, 2, and 4 dpi and the most rapid virus replication kinetics, whereas PB2 
 <italic>mut</italic>-infected mice showed the lowest titers at all times tested.
