<p>We additionally evaluated the pathogenicity of M mut and M-PA mut viruses in the same way indicated above and the results show that the introduction of the M1+M2 mutations on the CAL wt or PA mut backgrounds led to clear virus attenuation in mice, as the LD50 increased from 1 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> or 3 x 10
 <sup>3</sup>, respectively, to &gt;5 x 10
 <sup>5</sup> in both cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). M-PA mut virus pathogenicity was greater than that of M mut virus, as indicated by body weight loss after sublethal infection (
