<p>F- and M-IAV were isolated from upper respiratory tract samples of the infected patients. The viruses were grown in cell culture and in normalized conditions to eliminate possible differences due to the clinical status, time of sampling and genetic background of the infected patients. For that, viral stocks of F- and M-IAV were generated by infection of cell cultures at a low multiplicity of infection (0.0001 moi) to limit the production of DVGs [
