<p>Since F-IAV is more virulent than M-IAV in the murine model [

 <italic>in vivo</italic>; the accumulation of DVGs and viral genome was analyzed in the lungs of M- and F-IAV-infected mice. In whole lung tissue (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s005">S5A Fig</xref>) and in virions purified from lung (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s005">S5B Fig</xref>), DVGs accumulation was greater in M- than in F-IAV-infected mice. There is thus a clear correlation between DVGs accumulation mediated by F- and M-IAV and their pathogenicity in the murine model [
