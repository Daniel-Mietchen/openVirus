<p>These cells were infected with M- or F-IAV at moi 3, or mock infected. As a positive control, cells were infected with Del NS1 virus, an influenza virus that cannot counteract the antiviral response [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. GFP production was quantified by flow cytometry at 8, 15 or 24 hpi, and the results indicated that DelNS1 virus induces large amounts of GFP and F-IAV was a worse IFN inducer than M-IAV (0.27-fold, p&lt;0.001 at 15hpi and 0.33, p&lt;0.001 at 24hpi) (

To further evaluate the antiviral response mediated by these viruses, A549 cells were infected with DelNS1, M- or F-IAV, or were mock infected, and accumulation of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), Mx and ISG56 proteins, was monitored by western blot. F-IAV infected cells accumulated lower levels of Mx and ISG56 proteins than M-IAV (0.29- and 0.48-fold, respectively, p&lt;0.01) (
