<p>To monitor the activation of the cellular antiviral response induced by these viruses, we evaluated the interferon (IFN) induction cascade upon infection of A549 cells that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the IFN promoter (A549/pr(IFN-ÃŸ).GFP cells). GFP expression acts as a marker for activation of the IFN induction pathway in these cells [
