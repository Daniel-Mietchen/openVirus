<p>As described, F-IAV grows faster in cell culture and is more pathogenic in mice than M-IAV [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Viral genome RNA obtained from purified virions were deep-sequenced and consensus sequence comparison showed several amino acid changes that might be responsible for their distinct pathogenicity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Detailed analysis of the RNA deep-sequences showed that in addition to the viral full-length RNAs, defective genomic RNAs (DVGs) were observed in these samples (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s016">S1 Table</xref>). Large internal deletions that generate small DVGs activate the innate immune response [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and influenza viral RNAs preferably â‰¤1000 nucleotides (nt) bind the viral sensor RIG-I [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]); thus, only DVGs up to 1000 nt were analyzed in this study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The proportion between sequences reads corresponding to DVGs deletion sites (junction reads) and total virus reads was calculated for each virus (DVGs proportion); we observed a 10-fold lower DVGs proportion in the F-IAV than the M-IAV (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). DVGs found in F- and M-IAV derived from the RNA segments encoding the viral polymerase subunits as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g001">Fig 1C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s016">S1 Table</xref>). To estimate the ability of these viruses to generate DVGs, we analyze the amount of DVGs versus complete viral RNA of the same genome segment by RT-PCR both, in the initial stocks and during the viral replication cycle, performing serial blind passages of F- and M- IAV stocks at 3 pfu/cell. This condition of high multiplicity of infection, would allow an exacerbated generation of DVGs [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g002">Fig 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), showed that the initial M-IAV stock contained more DVGs than the F-IAV isolate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and this difference was observed also in three independent plaque-purified clones of F- and M-IAV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Both, F- and M-IAV accumulated more DVGs along serial passages. However, M-IAV did so more rapidly than F-IAV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). The distinct ability to generate DVGs by these viruses was corroborated using two different viral stocks (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>), and one plaque purified clone of F- or M-IAV (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Some DVGs amplified by RT-PCR (indicated with asterisks in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>) were cloned and sequenced to corroborate that this short amplification products correspond to viral RNA segments with large internal deletions (
