<p>Specific mutations were engineered in recombinant virus genomic pHH plasmids derived from the A/H1N1/California/04/2009 strain using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer. These materials were developed using the Licensed technology (Ref. Kawaoka-P99264US Recombinant Influenza viruses for vaccines and gene therapy). The mutations were rescued into infectious virus by standard techniques [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Briefly, to rescue infectious virus from cDNAs, 105 293T HEK cells were cotransfected with a mixture of 12 plasmid DNAs (100 ng each) including (i) 8 genomic plasmids each carrying a viral segment cDNA under the control of the polI promoter and (ii) 4 expression plasmids encoding the three polymerase subunits and the NP. Transfection was carried out at with Lipofectamine Plus (Gibco) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. At 16 h post-transfection, transfected cells were plated onto an excess of MDCK cells. When a cytopathic effect was apparent, the supernatant medium was collected and used for plaque assay on MDCK cells to estimate viral titer. The supernatant was used to produce a viral stock at low multiplicity of infection. The identity of rescued mutant viruses was ascertained by sequencing of DNAs derived from the PA and PB2 RNA segments by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification.
