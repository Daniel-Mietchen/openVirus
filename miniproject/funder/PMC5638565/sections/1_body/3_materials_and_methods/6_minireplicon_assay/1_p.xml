<p>The recombinant minireplicon assay was performed essentially as described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In brief, cultures of HEK293T cells (2.5 Ã— 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells) were transfected with a mixture of plasmids expressing the RNP components (pCMVPA, 2.5 ng; pCMVPB1, 12.5 ng; pCMVPB2, 12.5 ng; and pCMVNP, 500 ng) and a genomic plasmid expressing a viral RNA (vRNA)-like chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene (pHHCAT, 500 ng) using the calcium phosphate technique [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. At 20 h posttransfection, total cell extracts were prepared and CAT accumulation determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; GE Healthcare), using purified CAT enzyme as a standard.
