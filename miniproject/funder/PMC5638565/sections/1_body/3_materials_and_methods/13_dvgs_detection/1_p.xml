<p>RT-PCR for the PA or PB2 segments was used to determine the presence of DVGs and their relative amount to the full-length RNA of the same viral segment. To detect full-length segments, internal primers were used to amplify a central fragment, which is not present in DVGs. To detect DVGs, the same RNA sample and external primers of the PA segment were used in a separate reaction. Short amplification times were applied for the detection of both, internal fragment corresponding to full-length segment and DVGs, to allow detection of RNAs up to 1000nt in length. The method is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g002">Fig 2A</xref>. The reverse transcription reaction was performed for 30 min (42°C), followed by PCR (35 rounds at 94°C for 30 s, 53°/58°C for 40 s, and 68°C for 40 sec using the Titan-One RT-PCR kit (Roche)). As a specificity control, the primers and RT-PCR conditions for DVGs amplification were used with a plasmid encoding the full-length PA segment, and no amplification product was obtained (
