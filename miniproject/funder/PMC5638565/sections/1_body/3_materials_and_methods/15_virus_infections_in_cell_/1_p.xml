<p>Cultured human lung alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were infected at 10
 <sup>âˆ’3</sup> pfu/cell (low multiplicity of infection; moi) or 3 pfu/cell (high moi). After 1 h, non-bound virus was rinsed off with acidic PBS (pH 5.3) and at various times (hours post-infection; hpi), cell supernatants were collected and used for virus titration by plaque assay.
