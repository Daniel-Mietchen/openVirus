<p>All influenza A viruses were isolated at the National Influenza Centre (CNM, ISCIII) from respiratory samples sent for virological characterization by the Spanish Influenza Surveillance System (SISS). The National Influenza Center in Madrid and other regional laboratories constitute the ReLEG network of the SISS, which monitors virus circulation each influenza season as a part of the countrywide surveillance. All viruses from either mild or severe/fatal patients were isolated from the upper respiratory tract, pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal exudates. Semi-confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were used for primary viral isolation. The monolayers were inoculated with 200 μl of homogenized samples; when the cytopathic effect was 75–100%, cultures were harvested and the supernatants used for virus stock generation by inoculation of MDCK cells.</p>
