<p>Viruses used in the present study were selected according to the following criteria for the patients from whom the viruses were isolated. Patients included in the severe/fatal cohort were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 confirmed cases, aged over 4 and under 65, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and with the information related to risk factors reflected in their clinical history. Those patients who developed highly severe disease did not display any comorbidities associated to severe influenza A virus infection, and deceased patients presented some comorbid conditions. Mild patients were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 confirmed cases, aged over 4 and under 65, who developed mild disease and were monitored by sentinel medical centers included in the Spanish National Influenza Surveillance System. Selection of cases for this mild cohort was randomly made within the patients who meet the described above criteria and whose isolated virus were from the same Saint-Petersburg phylogenetic lineage as those from the severe/fatal cohort, accordingly to their HA gene. Respiratory samples were collected in virus transport medium (MEM, 200 U/ml penicillin, 200 Î¼g/ml streptomycin, 200 U/ml mycostatin and 0.25% bovine serum albumin fraction V) and delivered to the Spanish National Influenza Center.</p>
