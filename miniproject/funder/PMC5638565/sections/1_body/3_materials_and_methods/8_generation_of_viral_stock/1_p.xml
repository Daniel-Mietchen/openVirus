<p>Supernatants of harvested cells inoculated with clinical samples or transfected with plasmids for the generation of recombinant viruses were titred by standard plaque assay. These first passages of every virus were used to inoculate fresh MDCK cells at indicated controlled low multiplicity of infection (0.0001 moi). All viral stocks used for further studies had a viral titer about 10
 <sup>7</sup> pfu/ml.
