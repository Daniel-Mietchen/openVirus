<p>DVGs from cell cultured purified virions and from infected mice lung tissues were amplified by RT-PCR (Titan-One RT-PCR kit, Roche) as indicated above. Obtained products were amplified with Taq Polymerase (Sigma) for further cloning into pGEM-T vector using pGEM-T Easy kit (Promega). Selected clones were sequenced by Sanger method and obtained sequences were analyzed to confirm that they corresponded to defective genomes, including the 3′and 5′ends and a large internal deletion of the full-length viral segment.</p>
