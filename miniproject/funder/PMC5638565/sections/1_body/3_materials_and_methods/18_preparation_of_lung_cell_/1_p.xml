<p>Lungs samples were kept in RMPI medium at 4°C. Tissue samples were grinded into very small pieces prior to digestion with 180 μg/ml 
 <italic>liberase</italic> (
 <italic>Roche</italic>) and 40 μg/ml 
 <italic>DNase I</italic> (
 <italic>Roche</italic>) in RMPI medium for 30 minutes at 37°C. Digested fragments were filtrated with 
 <italic>40mm Nylon Cell Strainer</italic> (
 <italic>BD Falcon</italic>) and resuspended with RMPI- 3%FBS. After centrifugation of samples (1640 rmp, 5 min, 4°C) additional step for erythrocyte lysis were performed. Cell pellet was incubated for 1.5–2 min with 1ml of erythrocyte lysis buffer at RT. Lysis is inhibited by adding 9ml of PBS-5mM EDTA-3%FBS. Samples were then filtrated again with 40mm Nylon Cell Strainer and pelleted by centrifugation (1640rpm, 5 min, 4°C).
