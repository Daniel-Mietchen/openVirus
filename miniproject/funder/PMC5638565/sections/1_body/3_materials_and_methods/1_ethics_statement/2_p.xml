<p>The National Influenza Center in Madrid (Instituto de Salud Carlos III) and other regional laboratories from different Spanish regions, constituted the ReLEG network included in the Spanish Influenza Surveillance System (SISS), which monitored the circulation of influenza viruses each influenza season as a part of the countrywide surveillance. The viruses described in this study have been detected within this surveillance activity. An informed consent is not needed for this study since the patients from whom these viruses were isolated were anonymized.</p>
