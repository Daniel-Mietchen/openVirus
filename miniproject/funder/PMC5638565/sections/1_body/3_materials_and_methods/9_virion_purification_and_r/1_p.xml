<p>For virus purification, culture supernatants of 10
 <sup>−4</sup> moi-infected MDCK cells were centrifuged (10 min, 3110 
 <italic>g</italic>, 4°C). Supernatants were sedimented through a sucrose step gradient (TNE buffer; 50% and 33% sucrose in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) (1 h, 274000 
 <italic>g</italic>, 4°C). The 50 to 33% interphase was collected, diluted in TNE buffer, and pelleted through a cushion of 33% sucrose in TNE (2 h, 112000 
 <italic>g</italic>, 4°C). For purification of viruses isolated from infected mouse lung, the previous protocol was used with modification of the sucrose gradient volume and rotors according to sample volume. For isolation, RNA in purified virions was treated with 0.5% SDS and 200μg/ml proteinase K in TNE (2 h, 37°C), followed by extraction with phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol-hydroxyquinolein and ethanol precipitation [
