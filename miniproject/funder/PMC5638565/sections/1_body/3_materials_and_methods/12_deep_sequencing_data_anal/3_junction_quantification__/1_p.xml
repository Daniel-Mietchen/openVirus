<p>Only defective segments generated by two or more jumping reads spanning exactly the same coordinates and that generate a theoretical final RNA segment size of â‰¤1000 nucleotides were selected. For samples from the year 2009, read orientation could not be determined as the sequencing protocol applied was not strand-specific. In the remaining samples, only reads from genomic RNA strand were counted. For each sample, values for jumping reads per million (RPM) were calculated as the sum of all selected jumping reads divided by the number of total reads that aligned with the influenza genome, then multiplied by 10
 <sup>6</sup>. For analysis of jumping reads per segment, RPM values were normalized to total reads aligned with each RNA segment of the genome.
