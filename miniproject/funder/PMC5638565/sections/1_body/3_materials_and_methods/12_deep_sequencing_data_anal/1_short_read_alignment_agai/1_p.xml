<p>For each sample, FASTQ sequences were aligned against the influenza (A/California/04/09) genome with TopHat2 [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], allowing intron size ranges between 5 and 100000 nucleotides. Samtools [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] was used to extract reads that aligned as two separate fragments (jumping reads) from the BAM files generated by TopHat2. Only reads that were split into two fragments that align at distant segment positions (jumping reads) were selected. Alignments were made using all default parameters with just one exception: we have been more restrictive than the default program and have taken into account just jumping reads supported by at least four nucleotides on one side of the junction. Additionally, only primary alignments were taken into account and secondary alignments proposed by the program were discarded. Reads which align with total viral genome and with each viral segment, and jumping reads in each sample are shown in
