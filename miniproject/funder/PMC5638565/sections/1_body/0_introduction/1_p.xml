<p>Acute respiratory infections are a main cause of severe illness and death worldwide. Influenza A virus (IAV) causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics with potentially fatal outcome [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; the global burden of seasonal influenza is &gt;600 million cases, with 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths each year. Annual influenza epidemics affect all age groups, although infants, the elderly, and individuals with underlying medical conditions are most severely affected. The existence of co-morbid conditions and the immune status may contribute to the patient outcome. Comorbid conditions for influenza include diabetes, chronic metabolic of lung, renal and cardiac diseases, immunosuppression, pregnancy and obesity [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although comorbidities are found in many severe or even fatal cases, a considerable number of apparently healthy individuals nonetheless suffer severe infection, which suggests the coexistence of influenza strains with increased virulence among circulating viruses.
