<p>We previously tested this hypothesis by characterizing two IAV strains from the AH1N1 2009 pandemic (AH1N1pdm09), one isolated from a fatal case in a person with no known previously described comorbidities (F-IAV, fatal-case IAV) and the other from a patient with mild symptoms (M-IAV, mild-case IAV) [
