<p>A proportion of influenza virus particles have defective genome RNAs (DVGs) due to internal deletions of viral segments [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The DVGs have the 3’ and 5’ ends of the parental RNA segments, and most have a single, large central deletion that generates viral RNAs of 180–1000 nucleotides [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. DVGs have been found for all viral segments, but most derive from PB2, PB1 and PA RNAs [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The presence of DVGs potentiates the host response in cultured cells [
