<p>Although our understanding of influenza pathogenesis is considerable, a potential general virulence determinant in humans remains to be identified. Here we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to evaluate the role of defective genomes in the pathogenicity of influenza virus circulating in the human population. We found that the low amount of DVGs accumulated in tissue culture cells correlates with increased pathogenicity in mice both, in natural isolates or recombinant viruses. To corroborate these findings we performed a genomic analysis of viruses isolated from respiratory samples of a select cohort of IAV A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients who suffered severe or fatal outcome, or from a cohort of infected patients with mild disease. The former viruses showed significantly less accumulation of DVGs than the latter. We suggest that low DVGs abundance has a major role in the severe outcome of IAV-infected patients.</p>
