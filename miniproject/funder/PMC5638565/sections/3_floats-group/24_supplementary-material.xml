  <title>Structural localization of PA mutations in the viral polymerase complex.</title>
  <p>Structure of the viral polymerase complex in Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession 4WSB has been used as template for structural localization of PA 529N (red) mutations with UCSF Chimera 1.10.2. PA 638A and 453R mutations previously described [Fodor et al;. 2003] are shown in yellow. RNA viral promoter is shown in blue.</p>
