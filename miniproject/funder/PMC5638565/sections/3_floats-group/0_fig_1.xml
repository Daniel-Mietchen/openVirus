  <title>Different amounts of defective genomes are detected in viruses from a fatal or a mild case.</title>
  <p>(A) Scheme of influenza virus defective genomes (DVGs). Black squares denote the jumping reads. (B) DVGs proportion, calculated as jumping reads/ reads per million (RPM) that align the viral genome, determined in purified virions from a fatal (F) or a mild case (M) of IAV 2009 pandemic infection. DVGs proportion of M-IAV is taken as 1 and fold change for F-IAV is shown. (C). Log scale representation of DVGs distribution per segment calculated as jumping RPM that align each viral segment, analyzed in purified virions from F- and M-IAV. Viral segments, PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, NS.</p>
