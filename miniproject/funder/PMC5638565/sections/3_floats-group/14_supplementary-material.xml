  <title>Quantitative accumulation of antiviral proteins in F-and M-IAV-infected cells.</title>
  <p>(A) Cultured human lung epithelial cells (A549) were infected with F- and M-IAV stocks or (B) with plaque purified clones of F- or M-IAV at moi 3. At 24 hours post-infection (hpi), samples were used to detect the indicated proteins by Western blot. MOCK cells treated with PBS as negative control and were used as background for quantitative analysis. β- actin antibody was used as loading control. Error bars indicate mean ± SD of three independent experiments (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01 by t-Student test).</p>
