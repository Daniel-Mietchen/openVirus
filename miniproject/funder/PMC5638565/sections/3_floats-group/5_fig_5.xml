  <title>Mutation PA D529N present in a virus from a fatal case reduces DVGs levels in virions of recombinant viruses with two different genetic backgrounds.</title>
  <p>(A) DVGs proportion calculated as jumping reads/ reads per million (RPM) that align the viral genome, analyzed in purified virions from recombinant viruses generated on the A/H1N1/California/04/09 background. DVGs proportion of the CAL recombinant virus is taken as 1 and fold change is shown for mutant viruses versus CAL. CAL, wild type recombinant virus; PB2 
   <italic>mut</italic>, recombinant virus bearing PB2 221T mutation; PA 
   <italic>mut</italic>, recombinant virus bearing PA 529N mutation; PB2/PA 
   <italic>mut</italic> recombinant virus bearing PB2 221T and PA 529N (F-like-polymerase) mutations. (B) DVGs distribution per segment calculated as jumping RPM that align each viral segment, analyzed in purified virions from CAL, PB2 
   <italic>mut</italic>, PA 
   <italic>mut</italic> and PB2/PA 
   <italic>mut</italic>, M 
   <italic>mut</italic> and M-PA 
   <italic>mut</italic> recombinant viruses. (C) DVGs proportion as described in part A, CAL recombinant virus is taken as 1. M 
   <italic>mut</italic> bearing M1 S30N and M2 V86S mutations; M-PA 
   <italic>mut</italic>, recombinant virus bearing M1 S30N, M2 V86S and PA 529N mutations. (D) DVGs proportion, as described in (A) and (C), of all recombinant viruses. CAL is taken as 1 and fold change is shown for the other viruses. Viral segments, PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, NS.
