  <title>Viruses isolated from severe/fatal-outcome influenza-infected patients have low DVGs numbers.</title>
  <p>(A) Characteristics of patients included in this study. Male (M), female (F). 
   <sup>1</sup>: ICU, intensive care unit. 
   <sup>2</sup>: MV and ETI &gt;96h, requirement of mechanical ventilation and endotracheal intubation for more than 96 hours. 
   <sup>3</sup>: ARDS, Acute respiratory distress syndrome. 
   <sup>4</sup>: Comorbid factors include cardiopathy, diabetes, pregnancy, pulmonary disease, immunodeficiency, renal failure, obesity or cardiopulmonary disease. (B) Scatter plot representation of DVGs proportions, calculated as jumping reads/reads per million (RPM) that align the viral genome, found in virions isolated from influenza A virus infected patients. Red and blue boxes indicate the interquartiles with values representing the intermediate 50% of the population. Severe/Fatal cases, n = 6; Mild cases, n = 6. Horizontal bars inside each box indicate the median value. Significance was determined by a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test; p = 0.0152 (* p &lt;0.05).
