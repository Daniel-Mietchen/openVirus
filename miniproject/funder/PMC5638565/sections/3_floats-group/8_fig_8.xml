  <title>Mutation PA D529N present in a virus from a fatal case increases pathogenicity and induces altered immune response in vivo.</title>
  <p>Mice (n = 5) were inoculated intranasally with a sublethal dose (10
   <sup>3</sup> pfu) of each recombinant virus or PBS (MOCK) as control. At indicated dpi, viral titers were determined in the lungs (pfu/g tissue) (A). Neutrophils (B) and alveolar macrophages (C) were quantified in the lungs (% of cells) at indicated dpi. Significance was determined by Studentâ€™s t test (* p &lt;0.05, ** p &lt;0.01, *** p &lt;0.001). Insets show gating information for identification of neutrophil and alveolar macrophage populations.
