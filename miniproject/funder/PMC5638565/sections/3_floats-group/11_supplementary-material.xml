  <title>Defective viral genomes are produced during influenza F- and M-IAV infection.</title>
  <p>(A, B) Accumulation of DVGs after serial passages (P1, P2, P3) of two different M-IAV and F-IAV stocks. DNA ladder size indicated in nucleotides. (C) RT-PCR specificity controls. Primers and amplification conditions for internal fragment corresponding to full-length segment (Int primers) were used with a plasmid encoding the full-length PB2 segment (1 or 1/100 dilution) or with purified DVGs (1 or 1/100 dilution). The primers and RT-PCR conditions for DVGs amplification (Ext primers) were used with a plasmid encoding the full-length PB2 segment (1 or 1/100 dilution) or with purified DVGs (1 or 1/100 dilution).</p>
