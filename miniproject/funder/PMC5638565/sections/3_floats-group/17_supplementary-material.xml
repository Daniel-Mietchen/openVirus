  <title>Quantitative accumulation of DVGs in recombinant virus-infected cells.</title>
  <p>Cultured human lung epithelial cells (A549) were infected with indicated mutant viruses stocks at moi 1. Intracellular accumulation of DVGs was determined at indicated hours post-infection (hpi) as the ratio between DVGs and full length viral genomes (as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Error bars indicate mean Â± SD of three independent experiments (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001 by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test).
