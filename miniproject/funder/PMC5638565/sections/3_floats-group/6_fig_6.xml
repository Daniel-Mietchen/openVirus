  <title>Different amount of defective genomes and activation of antiviral response is produced during recombinant influenza viruses infection.</title>
  <p>(A) Detection of DVGs of PA segment in virions of CAL, PA 
   <italic>mut</italic>, PB2 
   <italic>mut</italic> and PB2/PA 
   <italic>mut</italic> recombinant viruses. Asterisks denote bands corresponding to cloned and sequenced DVGs. (B) Cultured human lung epithelial cells (A549) were infected with PB2 
   <italic>mut</italic>, PA 
   <italic>mut</italic> or PB2/PA 
   <italic>mut</italic> recombinant virus stocks at moi 1. Intracellular accumulation of DVGs was determined at indicated hours post-infection (hpi). DNA ladder size indicated in nucleotides. (C) Cultured human lung epithelial cells (A549) were infected with CAL, PB2 
   <italic>mut</italic>, PA 
   <italic>mut</italic> or PB2/PA 
   <italic>mut</italic> recombinant virus stocks at moi 1. At 16 hours post-infection (hpi), samples were used to detect the indicated proteins by Western blot. MOCK, cells treated with PBS as negative control; ΔNS1, cells infected with influenza virus lacking NS1 protein as a positive control of innate immune response activation after influenza virus infection. Virus infection was detected with antibody specific for NP, using β-actin as loading control. The experiments B and C were performed in triplicates and one representative data is shown. Quantification and significance analysis of triplicates are shown in
