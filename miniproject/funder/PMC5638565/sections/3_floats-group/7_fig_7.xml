  <title>Mutation PA D529N present in a virus from a fatal case increases mortality in vivo.</title>
  <p>(A) Mice (n = 5) were inoculated intranasally with 10
   <sup>6</sup>âˆ’10
   <sup>2</sup> pfu of each recombinant virus or were mock-infected as control. Survival rate for each group of animals was monitored daily for 14 days post-infection (dpi). (B) The dose that caused 50% mortality of mice in each infection (LD50) is shown. (C) Mice (n = 5) were inoculated intranasally with a sublethal dose of each recombinant virus or PBS (MOCK) as control. Body weights were determined daily for 10 days and are shown as a percentage of body weight at inoculation (time 0). Significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test (* p &lt;0.05, ** p &lt;0.01, *** p &lt;0.001).
