  <title>DVGs distribution per viral segment in IAV from highly severe/fatal and mild cases.</title>
  <p>Absolute numbers of DVGs distribution per segment calculated as jumping RPM that align each viral segment, analyzed in purified virions from A) Severe/fatal-case viruses, SF1-SF6; B) mild-case viruses, M1-M6. Viral segments, PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, NS. Note that these DGs distributions are relative to all DGs found in each virus, and their amounts are not strictly comparable from one virus to the others.</p>
