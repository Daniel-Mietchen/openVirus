  <title>Histological injuries found in lungs of mice inoculated with M- or F-IAV.</title>
  <p>(A,B) Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&amp;E) of mice lung inoculated with M-IAV. (A) Congestion and diffuse lymphoid infiltrates in the interstitium. bar = 50 μm, (B) Mild perivasculitis: note mild inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes around a small arteriole and diffuse in the interstictial tissue. bar = 50 μm. (C-E); H&amp;E of of mouse lung inoculated with F-IAV. (C) Moderate inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytes around a dilated bronchiole. bar = 50 μm, (D) Severe hyperplasia of phagocytic cells in the interstitium. bar = 20 μm, (E) Mild perivasculitis: moderate amount of lymphoid cell infiltrates around a pulmonary arteriole. bar = 50 μm. The arrows show some examples of the lesion indicated in every case.</p>
