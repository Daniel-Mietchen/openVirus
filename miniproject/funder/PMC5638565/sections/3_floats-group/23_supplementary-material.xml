  <title>Viruses isolated from severe/fatal-outcome influenza-infected patients have low DVGs numbers in the three polymerase subunits segments.</title>
  <p>Scatter plot representation of DVGs proportions, calculated as jumping reads/reads per million (RPM) that align the viral genome, found in virions isolated from influenza A virus infected patients. Red and blue boxes indicate the interquartiles with values representing the intermediate 50% of the population. Severe/Fatal cases, n = 6; Mild cases, n = 6. Horizontal bars inside each box indicate the median value. Significance was determined by a two-tailed Mann-Whitney test; p = 0.0124 (* p &lt;0.05).</p>
