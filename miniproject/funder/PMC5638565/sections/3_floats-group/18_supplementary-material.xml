  <title>Quantitative accumulation of antiviral proteins in recombinant virus-infected cells.</title>
  <p>Cultured human lung epithelial cells (A549) were infected with CAL or mutant viruses stocks at moi 1. At 16 hours post-infection (hpi), samples were used to detect (A) Mx protein or (B) ISG56 protein by Western blot. MOCK cells treated with PBS as negative control and were used as background for quantitative analysis. β-actin antibody was used as loading control. Error bars indicate mean ± SD of three independent experiments (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001 by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test).</p>
