  <title>Structural localization of relevant PA mutations in the multi-polymerase complex.</title>
  <p>Structure of the dimer polymerase complex in Protein Data Bank (PDB) under accession 3J9B has been used as template for structural localization of PA mutations with UCSF Chimera 1.10.2. PA mutations described in the severe-fatal case viruses in the present study (PA 529 and PA 312) are shown in red. RNA viral promoter is shown in blue.</p>
