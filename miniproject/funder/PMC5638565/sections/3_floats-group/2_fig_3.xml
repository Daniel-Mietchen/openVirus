  <title>Different induction levels of antiviral response in F- or M-IAV infected cells.</title>
  <p>(A) Induction of GFP expression after infection of A549/pr(IFN- β) at moi 3.GFP cells were quantified by FACS, using ΔNS1 virus as reference and percentage of GFP positive cells is represented. The results shown are representative of 3 independent experiments, in which 10,000 events were measured for each sample. Significance was determined by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc test, *p&lt;0.05; ***p&lt;0.001. (B) Cultured human lung epithelial cells (A549) were infected at moi 3 with F- and M-IAV stocks or (C) with plaque purified clones of F- or M-IAV. At indicated hours post-infection (hpi), samples were used to detect the indicated proteins by Western blot. MOCK, cells treated with PBS as negative control; ΔNS1, cells infected with influenza virus lacking NS1 protein as a positive control of innate immune response activation after influenza virus infection. Virus infection was detected with antibody specific for NP, using β-actin as loading control. The experiments B and C were performed in triplicates and one representative data are shown. Quantification and significance analysis of triplicates is shown in
