  <title>CAL recombinant virus has as low DVGs numbers as F-IAV.</title>
  <p>DVGs proportion in CAL recombinant virus and F- and M-IAV clinical isolates. CAL recombinant virus has been used as backbone for mutant viruses in the present study. Scatter plot representation of DVGs proportions, calculated as jumping reads/reads per million (RPM) that align the viral genome. Black indicates CAL wild-type recombinant virus, red indicates F-IAV,-Blue indicates M-IAV.</p>
