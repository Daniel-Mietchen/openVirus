  <title>DVGs distribution per viral segment in severe/fatal and mild cases of IAV.</title>
  <p>Log scale representation of DVGs distribution per segment calculated as jumping reads per million (RPM) that align each viral segment, analyzed in purified virions from A) Severe/fatal case viruses, SF1-SF6; B) mild-case viruses, M1-M6. Viral segments, PB1, PB2, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, NS. Note that these DVGs distributions are relative to all DVGs found in each virus, and their amounts are not strictly comparable from one virus to the others.</p>
