Infection of apparently healthy individuals nonetheless accounts for many severe disease cases and deaths, suggesting that viruses with increased pathogenicity co-circulate with pandemic or epidemic viruses. Looking for potential virulence factors, we have identified a polymerase PA D529N mutation detected in a fatal IAV case, whose introduction into two different recombinant virus backbones, led to reduced defective viral genomes (DVGs) production. This mutation conferred low induction of antiviral response in infected cells and increased pathogenesis in mice. To analyze the association between low DVGs production and pathogenesis in humans, we performed a genomic analysis of viruses isolated from a cohort of previously healthy individuals who suffered highly severe IAV infection requiring admission to Intensive Care Unit and patients with fatal outcome who additionally showed underlying medical conditions. These viruses were compared with those isolated from a cohort of mild IAV patients. Viruses with fewer DVGs accumulation were observed in patients with highly severe/fatal outcome than in those with mild disease, suggesting that low DVGs abundance constitutes a new virulence pathogenic marker in humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Influenza A viruses are the causative agents of annual epidemics, sporadic zoonotic outbreaks and occasionally pandemics. Worldwide, acute respiratory infections caused by influenza A viruses continue to be one of the main causes of acute illness and death. The appearance in 2009 of a new H1N1 pandemic influenza strain reinforced the search to identify viral pathogenicity determinants for evaluation of the consequences of virus epidemics and potential pandemics for human health. Here we identify a new general virulence determinant found in a cohort of severe/fatal influenza virus-infected patients, a reduced accumulation of viral defective genomes. These molecules are incomplete viral genome segments that activate the innate immune response. This data will contribute to the prediction of influenza disease severity, to improved guidance of patient treatment and will enable the development of risk-based prevention strategies and policies.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness</institution></funding-source><award-id>BFU2011-26175</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nieto</surname><given-names>Amelia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness</institution></funding-source><award-id>BFU2014-57797-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nieto</surname><given-names>Amelia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>Network Ciber de Enfermedades Respiratorias (CIBERES)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nieto</surname><given-names>Amelia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>La Caixa Foundation International Fellowship Programme (La Caixa/CNB)</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1627-9379</contrib-id><name><surname>Vasilijevic</surname><given-names>Jasmina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>JV is a PhD fellow of the La Caixa Foundation International Fellowship Programme (La Caixa/CNB).

Influenza A virus (IAV) causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics with potentially fatal outcome [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; the global burden of seasonal influenza is &#x0003e;600 million cases, with 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths each year. Annual influenza epidemics affect all age groups, although infants, the elderly, and individuals with underlying medical conditions are most severely affected. The existence of co-morbid conditions and the immune status may contribute to the patient outcome. Comorbid conditions for influenza include diabetes, chronic metabolic of lung, renal and cardiac diseases, immunosuppression, pregnancy and obesity [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Although comorbidities are found in many severe or even fatal cases, a considerable number of apparently healthy individuals nonetheless suffer severe infection, which suggests the coexistence of influenza strains with increased virulence among circulating viruses.</p><p>We previously tested this hypothesis by characterizing two IAV strains from the AH1N1 2009 pandemic (AH1N1pdm09), one isolated from a fatal case in a person with no known previously described comorbidities (F-IAV, fatal-case IAV) and the other from a patient with mild symptoms (M-IAV, mild-case IAV) [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. F-IAV virulence was greater than that of M-IAV in cell culture, and showed higher pathogenicity in the <italic>in vivo</italic> murine model [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>IAV virulence and pathogenesis are dependent on complex, multigenic mechanisms involving the viral genetic characteristics, the host conditions, the virus-host interactions, and the host response to the infection. Special effort has been previously made to identify virulence determinants of AH1N1pdm09 viruses and AH1N1 seasonal viruses. As a result, some residues distributed all over the genome have been associated to increased virulence of specific viral isolates [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These determinants map mainly to the polymerase genes (PB1, PB2, PA), the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) (reviewed in [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). Attenuating factors have also been described in cell culture [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>A proportion of influenza virus particles have defective genome RNAs (DVGs) due to internal deletions of viral segments [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The DVGs have the 3&#x02019; and 5&#x02019; ends of the parental RNA segments, and most have a single, large central deletion that generates viral RNAs of 180&#x02013;1000 nucleotides [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

Here we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to evaluate the role of defective genomes in the pathogenicity of influenza virus circulating in the human population. We found that the low amount of DVGs accumulated in tissue culture cells correlates with increased pathogenicity in mice both, in natural isolates or recombinant viruses. To corroborate these findings we performed a genomic analysis of viruses isolated from respiratory samples of a select cohort of IAV A(H1N1)pdm09-infected patients who suffered severe or fatal outcome, or from a cohort of infected patients with mild disease. The former viruses showed significantly less accumulation of DVGs than the latter.

Thus, both the high virulence of the infecting virus, and the genetic risk factor, may have contributed to the fatal outcome of the patient.</p><p>None of the severe/fatal cohort viruses bore PA D529N change. This result suggest that low DVGs accumulation in severe/fatal-case viruses might be mediated by various changes other than D529N in PA polymerase subunit, or in distinct polymerase subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s018">S3 Table</xref>), or in several viral proteins; this coincides with the complex, multigenic nature of the pathogenesis mechanisms [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Actually, changes in the polymerase [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and in NS2 protein [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] modulate DVGs production in cell culture. Mutations in M1 and M2 [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] also modulate DVGs accumulation, probably by altering DVGs encapsidation in progeny virions [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, reduced accumulation of DVGs constitutes a virulent factor itself, regardless the mutations responsible.</p><p>Regarding the possible mechanism of PA in low DVGs production, colleagues E. Fodor and G. Brownlee described some years ago that mutation A638R in the PA subunit was involved in the enormous accumulation of DGs in cell culture [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It was there described that this high DGs generation was due to an elongation defect by destabilization of RNA-PA subunit interaction, and that this phenomenon could be reverted by another mutation in the same PA polymerase subunit (C453R). The authors proposed a putative domain involved in elongation activity in the PA-C part of this polymerase subunit. We have localized PAD529N mutation in the viral polymerase structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s014">S14 Fig</xref>) [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and they are spatially in the same PA-C domain nearby these previously described mutations. This data suggests that PA D529N may be involved in the same elongation process, although this activity would need to be further explored. In addition, Influenza A virus polymerase exists in different oligomerization state [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], which allows different assembly of polymerase monomers during replication [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. A new proposed mechanism suggests that the RNA depending RNA polymerase (vRdRP) dimer bound to viral RNA recruits another free polymerase dimer to form transient tetramer, which initiates replication of viral genome [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. PA D529N mutation localizes on the interaction surface of this proposed dimerization model of the viral polymerase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). All these data suggest that this mutation (or other mutations on this same area) may alter the possible polymerase dimerization or, it may modify the stability of the RNA- polymerase complex, or additionally it may change the interaction with any cellular required factor, or any combination of them.</p><p>The role of DVGs in inducing the innate immune response has been demonstrated in cell culture [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and animal models [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Studies in several animal models have led to proposals for the use of DG molecules or viruses modified to generate them in large numbers as protective elements against influenza virus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. It would be likely that the reduced activation of the antiviral state of cells infected with low DVGs producer viruses might induce an impaired immune response in infected animals or patients. The initially reduced antiviral state of the infected cells (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g006">6C</xref>) may allow the virus to grow uncontrolled for a short time and then this would induce an exacerbated immune response and inflammation which was described for severe IAV infected patients in the 2009 pandemic [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In viral infections, neutrophils and alveolar macrophages play a key role in clearance and control of viral growth in infected lungs, thus their substantial migration to the site of inflammation in infected tissue contributes to overall viral pathogenicity. Depletion of alveolar macrophages leads to an uncontrolled viral proliferation and fatal outcome in infected mice [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] while high influx of neutrophils in lungs and excessive inflammation has been associated with severe illness and high mortality rate in influenza infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The depletion of alveolar macrophages perfectly correlates with increased viral titers in lung tissue of PA <italic>mut</italic> and PB2/PA <italic>mut</italic> infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g008">Fig 8A and 8C</xref>), emphasizing again the crucial role of these cells in viral clearance and control of viral growth. In addition, an increased influx of neutrophils, which is associated with lethal influenza virus infection [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], has been observed in recombinant viruses carrying a mutation (PA <italic>mut</italic> and PB2/PA <italic>mut</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) present in a fatal-case virus, which produce reduced amount of DVGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).</p><p>Although DVGs are produced in the polymerase segments (PB1, PB2 and PA), as previously described [<xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1006650.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], most viruses studied here also generate DVGs in other segments (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g005">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g010">10</xref>). The distribution of DVGs of the different cohorts is interestingly observed in some distinct viral segments, which is specially reduced (23-fold) for the polymerase subunits segments in the severe/fatal&#x02014;associated case viruses compared to viruses isolated from mild cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g010">Fig 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006650.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). These findings suggest that the genomic combination of DVGs produced by each virus, and not only absolute numbers, may also contribute to pathogenicity.</p><p>In summary, we establish a significant association between low DVGs accumulation and an increase in severe or fatal outcome in human influenza virus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006650.g009">Fig 9</xref>); we provide genetic support for this association in infected cultured cells and in mice. In addition to the previous reports about the role of DVGs in natural animal infections here we present data indicating that a reduced accumulation of DVGs may be considered a new virulence marker for viral pathogenicity in humans. Evaluation of DVGs phenotype of circulating viruses might predict its potential to induce severe disease. Additional work is needed to define specific DVGs function and the mechanism by which they are produced in humans. These data could contribute substantially to the prediction of influenza disease severity and enable the development of risk-based prevention strategies and policies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec018"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec019"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All procedures that required the use of animals complied with Spanish and European legislation concerning vivisection and the use of genetically modified organisms, and the protocols were approved by the National Center for Biotechnology Ethics Committees on Animal Experimentation and the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient&#x000ed;ficas (CSIC) Bioethics Subcommittee (permit 11014).
