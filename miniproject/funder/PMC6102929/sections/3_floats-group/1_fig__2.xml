 <caption>
  <p>Whole genome phylogeny of chikungunya viruses and other alphaviruses. The tree illustrates the genetic clustering of available whole genomic sequences of CHIKV, ONNV, Mayaro virus (MAYV), and RRV extracted from GenBank. The evolutionary distance was inferred by using the neighbor-joining method based on the Kimura two-parameter distance model. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA6</p>
