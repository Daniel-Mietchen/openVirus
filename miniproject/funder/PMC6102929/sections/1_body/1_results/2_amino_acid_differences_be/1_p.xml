<p id="Par30">In the non-structural proteins, SZ1050 showed 32 aa changes (1.29%) compared to the African prototype strain S27 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Most substitutions located in the nsP1 and nsP3 (0.44%). 9 out of 11 aa changes were concentrated between positions 326 and 524 in the nsP3 of SZ1050. This indicated that the fragment from 326 to 524 of nsP3 was a highly variable region, which is consistent with previous reports [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, three mutations were observed in SZ1050 at relatively conserved positions: nsP2–374, nsP4–254 and nsP4–500, which were also found in certain Indian Ocean isolates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the structural protein of SZ1050, 27 aa changes (2.16%) were identified compared to S27 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Notably, the envelop protein E2 showed the highest variation that contained 15 aa changes, significantly higher than the envelop protein E1 (0.32%) and the capsid protein (0.24%). Although E1-A226V was not found, another interesting substitution (E1-D284E) was present in SZ1050, which was also observed in some other Indian Ocean isolates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. E1–284 is a highly conserved position, which displays an Asp (D) in the majority of alphaviruses including CHIKV-S27, CHIKV-ROSS, o’nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), Equine Encephalitis virus (EEV), Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and Ross River virus (RRV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Further study reported that E1–284 was located on the surface of the virus particle and is involved in the contacts that make up the icosahedral E1 scaffold [
