<p id="Par31">The amino acid variations between SZ1239 and S27 were more prominent than those between SZ1050 and S27. As illustrated in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, 67 (2.71%) and 44 (3.53%) aa changes were identified in the non-structural proteins and structural proteins, respectively. Similar to SZ1050, E1-A226V was also not detected in SZ1239 and the mutation E2-I211T was present in both strains. E1-A98T in the fusion loop of the E1 protein (E1: 83–100 aa) was detected in SZ1239 compared with that of S27. Mutation E2-I211T was present in both strains. Most of mutations were observed in the nsP3 (29 out of 67, 1.17%) and envelop protein E2 (23 out of 44, 1.84%). Of note, there was a gap in the nsP3 of SZ1239 containing 7 amino acids (HTLPSAT, 1710–1716 in the nsP3 of S27) compared to S27. Interestingly, this gap was also found in several other CHIKV isolates of Asian lineage emerged in Indonesia recently (e.g. JMB-154, GenBank: KX097982.1, 2015; DH130003, GenBank: KM673291.1, 2013).
