<p id="Par33">To test the differences between SZ1050 and SZ1239 in cell tropism in blood cells, we selected three monocyte cell lines, K562, U937 and THP-1, as well as a macrophage cell line, Ana-1. Our data suggested that SZ1050 and SZ1239 could replicate in K562 cells (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). However, both viruses failed to establish a productive infection in U937, Ana-1, and THP-1 cells (Fig.

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">b</xref>, and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). Unlike the obvious CPE in epithelial cells, no significant morphological changes were observed in these suspension cells (Table
