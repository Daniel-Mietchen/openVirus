<p id="Par29">On the basis of sequence analysis, the genome of SZ1050 showed the highest identity (99.94%) with that of GZ1029 (GenBank: JQ065891.1), which was identified earlier from an imported case who traveled from India to China in 2008 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Compared to GZ1029, there was only one amino acid change (nsP3-X524R) and one amino acid deletion (nsP1-3P) in SZ1050. SZ1239 showed the highest identity (98.5%) with the strain DH130003 (GenBank: KM673291.1), which was isolated from a patient who returned China from Indonesia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Only 4 aa and 2 aa changes were observed in the non-structural proteins (nsP2–306, nsP3–450, nsP3–517 and nsP4–100) and the structural proteins (E3–33 and E2–370), respectively.
