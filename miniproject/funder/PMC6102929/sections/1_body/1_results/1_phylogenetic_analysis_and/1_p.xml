<p id="Par27">The complete genome sequences of SZ1050 (11,844 nt) and SZ1239 (12,000 nt) were obtained and submitted to GenBank (SZ1050: MG664850; SZ1239: MG664851). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the length of the structural protein was 1244 aa for both SZ1050 and SZ1239, while there was 7 aa absence in the non-structural protein of SZ1239 (2467 aa) compared to that of SZ1050 (2474 aa). In the 3’ UTR, there were three repeated sequence elements (RSEs, 35 nt) in SZ1050. Nucleotide sequence alignment revealed that there were three nucleotide differences between the first RSE (11392–11,426) of SZ1050 and that (11382–11,416) of S27 (GenBank: AF369024). There was only one nucleotide difference between the second RSE (11521–11,555) of SZ1050 and that (11525–11,559) of S27. The third RSE (11607–11,641) of SZ1050 contained the same sequence as that (11611–11,646) of S27. However, only two RSEs were observed in the 3’ UTR of SZ1239. The first RSE of S27 was absent in SZ1239. There were two nucleotide differences between the first RSE (11495–11,529) of SZ1239 and the second RSE of S27. The second RSE (11580–11,614) of SZ1239 was the same as the third RSE of S27.
