<p id="Par28">To classify the genotype of SZ1050 and SZ1239, phylogenetic analysis was performed based on their complete genomes as well as 33 other CHIKV sequences previously reported in the GenBank (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). SZ1050 was observed to be in the same cluster with other CHIKV isolates of the IOL lineage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. SZ1239 clustered with other Asian strains isolated from Indonesia and the Caribbean Island. Thus, SZ1050 belonged to the IOL lineage while SZ1239 was grouped with the Asian lineage.
