<p id="Par34">Since the vectors of chikungunya virus include 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], we selected 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cell line Aag-2 and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> cell line C6/36 as mosquito cell models to investigate the cell tropisms of the two CHIKV isolates. Our results showed that both cell lines were susceptible to viral infection. The viral RNA copies were significantly increased at 24 h.p.i. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>&amp;
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref>), similar to the trend observed in the epithelial cells. Through comparing the increasing folds after infection at 24 h, we found that SZ1050 showed a higher viral RNA increase in C6/36 than that of Aag-2, while SZ1239 displayed more rapid viral RNA increase in the supernatant of Aag-2 than in that of C6/36 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Of note, virus infected C6/36 exhibited cell shrinkage and apoptosis, but no significant CPE was observed in Aag-2 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
