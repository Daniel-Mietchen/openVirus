<p id="Par32">To investigate the differences in cell tropism between SZ1050 and SZ1239, we inoculated the two virus isolates into seven mammalian epithelial cells. Both SZ1050 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) and SZ1239 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) demonstrated a significant increase in viral RNA in the supernatants of BHK-21, Vero, RD, HepG2 and 293 at 24 h post inoculation. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, viral RNA load was increased by more than 100-folds for both SZ1239 and SZ1050. SZ1239 replicated more efficiently than SZ1050 in Vero (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0013), 293 (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0321) and HeLa cells (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.045), while SZ1050 replicated better than SZ1239 in BHK-21 as suggested by the higher viral RNA detected in both the supernatant (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>) and cell lysate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The replication of both viruses appeared to be less efficient in MDCK and HeLa cell lines in comparison to the other epithelial cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>&amp;
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S2). The typical CHIKV-specific cytopathic effects (CPE) (shrinkage, fusion, apoptosis and shedding) were obvious in BHK-21, Vero, RD and 293 cells (Table
