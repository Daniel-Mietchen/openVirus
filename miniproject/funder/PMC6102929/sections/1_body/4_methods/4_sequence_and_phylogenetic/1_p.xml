<p id="Par50">Viral first strand cDNA was obtained by using the ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (TOYOBO, Japan). The nucleotide sequence of the S27 strain was used for primer designing (GenBank accession no. AF369024) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The whole genome was sequenced by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Amplification was achieved using an AccuPrime™ Taq DNA Polymerase, High Fidelity (12346–086, Invitrogen). The 5’ UTR and 3’ UTR were sequenced by using the SMARTer RACE 5′/3’ Kit (TAKARA, Japan). All the sequences were then assembled with DNAMAN 5.2.2.
