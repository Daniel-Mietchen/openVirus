<p id="Par52">To detect the cell susceptibility of both strains, seven mammalian adherent epithelial or fibroblast cells were infected with both SZ1050 and SZ1239 in 24-well plates at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1PFU/cell. After incubation with virus for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were washed for three times with 1XPBS, and replaced with 1 ml maintaining medium (DMEM+ 2%HIFBS+ 1%P/S). Then, cells were further incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for three days.
