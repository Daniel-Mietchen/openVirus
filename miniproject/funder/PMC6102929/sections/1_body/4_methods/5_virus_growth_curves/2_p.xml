<p id="Par53">Similarly, four suspension blood cells were infected with both CHIKV strains in 24-well plates at a MOI of 5 PFU/cell. Cells were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2% FBS and 1% P/S after incubation and washing. Two 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> cell lines C6/36 and Aag-2 were also inoculated with two CHIKV isolates and cultured at 28 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for three days. Supernatants and infected cells were harvested at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h.p.i. by RT-QPCR and plaque assay, as described previously. The primers for QPCR were designed in the conserved N-terminal of nsP3 (108-146aa). CHIKV-F: TCCTCTCCACAGGTGTATACTCAGG (4398–4422 in S27), CHIKV-R: CTTGTCTCGGCAGTAGATGACCAC (4490–4513 in S27).
