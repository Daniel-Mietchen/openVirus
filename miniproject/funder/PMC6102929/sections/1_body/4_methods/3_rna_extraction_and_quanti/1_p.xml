<p id="Par49">Viral RNA was extracted from supernatant with a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommended procedures. Briefly, 140 μl of each sample was first treated with 560 μl of AVL buffer containing 10 μg/ml of carrier RNA, followed by alcohol precipitations. The precipitations were then applied onto the QIAamp Mini columns and the viral nucleic acids were absorbed onto the silica-gel membrane after centrifugation. Finally, the viral pellet was resolved in 50 μl of RNase-free water. Viral RNA copies were quantified using qRT-PCR, as described previously [
