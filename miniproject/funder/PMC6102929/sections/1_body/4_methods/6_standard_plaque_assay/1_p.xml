<p id="Par54">To determine the titer of infectious virus in the supernatant, we performed standard plaque assay as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in 6-well plate the day before test. Next day, when the cell confluence reached up to approximately 100%, cells were inoculated with ten-fold diluted virus. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C with constant agitation, the supernatant was discarded, and DMEM medium supplemented with 2% HIFBS and 1% low melting point gel was added to each well. Plates were incubated for further 48–72 h at 37 °C. Then the wells were fixed and stained. Plaques were counted by naked eyes. Each experiment was done independently in triplicate.
