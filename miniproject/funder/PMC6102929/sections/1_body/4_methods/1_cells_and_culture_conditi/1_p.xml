<p id="Par47">BHK-21 (ATCC® CCL-10™), HepG2 (ATCC® HB-8065™), Hela (ATCC® CCL-2™), RD (ATCC® CCL-136™), MDCK (ATCC® CCL-34™), THP-1 (ATCC® TIB-202™), U937 (ATCC® CRL-1593.2™), K562 (ATCC® CCL-243™), 293 (ATCC® CRL-1573™) and C6/36 (ATCC® CRL-1660™) were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture collection, Manassas, VA). Ana-1 and Vero cell were kept in our laboratory. The 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cell line Aag-2 was kindly provided by Professor Gong Cheng, Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, China. BHK-21, HepG2, 293, Vero, MDCK, Hela and RD cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5%CO
 <sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Gibco, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HIFBS; Gibco, Invitrogen) and 100 units of penicillin and 100μg streptomycin/ml (1%P/S). C6/36 cells were cultured at 28 °C, 5%CO
 <sub>2</sub> in DMEM supplemented with 10% HIFBS and 1%P/S as described previously [
