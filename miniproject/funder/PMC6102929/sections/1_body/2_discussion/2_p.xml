<p id="Par37">Based on the sequence analysis, we found that SZ1050 was phylogenetically most related to GZ1029, another reported CHIKV strain of IOL lineage isolated from an imported foreign case travelled from India to China in 2010 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This suggested that SZ1050 was potentially a circulating CHIKV strain in India in 2010. On the other hand, SZ1239 was indicated to belong to the Asian lineage. The highest genetic identity was found between SZ1239 and another strain DH130003 of the Asian lineage, which was isolated in 2012 from a patient who traveled back to Bali from Indonesia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. CHIKV from the Asian lineage was the major causative agent for the increased CHIKV-infected cases in Indonesia in 2008, 2009 and 2011 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Therefore, the SZ1239 strain also represented a recently circulating isolate of the Asian lineage. More recently, CHIKV of Asian lineage was also found in the pacific region and America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], indicating the Asian lineage as the major prevalent genotype of the current CHIKV outbreak.
