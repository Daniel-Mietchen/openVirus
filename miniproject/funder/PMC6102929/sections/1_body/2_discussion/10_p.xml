<p id="Par45">This was not consistent with the findings of another study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In that study, the authors found chikungunya virus of the ECSA lineage not able to effectively infect the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cell line CCL-125 cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Possible explanation might come from the differences on the sources and contaminated pathogens between the two 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cell lines (Aag-2 and CCL-125). On one hand, Aag-2 was derived from embryonic 
 <italic>A. aegypti</italic> while CCL-125 was larvae originated; on the other hand, Aag-2 was contaminated with Phasi charoen-like virus (PCLV) and Cell-fusing agent virus (CFAV), while CCL-125 was onlyinfected with PCLV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The single infection of CFAV was believed to promote the infection of DENV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that CFAV in Aag-2 can modulate the infection of CHIKV.
