<p id="Par41">In addition, the E1-A226V mutation, which was reported to relate to the adaption in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], was not detected in SZ1050 and SZ1239. In the previous two small-scale outbreaks in China in 2010, E1-226Â V was observed in all four isolated CHIKV strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the possibility of the SZ1050- or SZ1239-induced CHIKV outbreak in China would be low because 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is the major vector responsible for arbovirus transmission in most Chinese regions. Interestingly, another mutation, I211T, was found in E2 of both SZ1050 and SZ1239, which was also found in the West African lineage and Asian lineage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Virus containing E1-A226V and E2-I211T showed enhanced infectivity of CHIKV in 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Whether the single E2-I211T mutation could contribute to the transmission advantages of the virus in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> remains largely unkown.
