<p id="Par39">Compared to the amino acid sequences of S27, most variations in both SZ1050 and SZ1239 were observed in the nsP3 and the E2 protein (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) in line with other studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The mutations in nsP3 were focused in 326–524 aa, which was a variable region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A gap of seven amino acids (1710–1716 in S27, 377–383 aa in the nsP3) located in the nsP3 of SZ1239 compared to S27 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This gap should not be an occasional deletion caused by viral culture in vitro because it was also observed in an isolate in 2006 (MY/06/37350,GenBank: FN295484, Malaysia) and many recent circulating isolates of the Asian lineage such as NC/2011–568 (GenBank: HE806461.1, 2011, New Caledonia) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], DH130003 (GenBank: KM673291.1, 2013, Indonesia) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and JMB-154 (GenBank: KX097982.1, 2015, Indonesia) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. More interestingly, compared to S27, there was a small gap of four amino acids (LPSA, 1712–1715 in S27) in the middle of this seven amino acid-gap in the nsP3 of some CHIKV isolates found in Micronesia: Yap State in 2013 (strain 3807,GenBank: KJ451622.1, 2013) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and America (isolate 14.02217, GenBank: KY435477.1, 2014) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, there was no gap for the CHIKV isolates identified in Malaysia in 2007 or before (strain MY002IMR/06/BP, GenBank: EU703759.1; strain MY003IMR/06/BP, GenBank: EU703760.1; strain M125, GenBank: KM923917.1). This suggested that the four amino acids (1712–1715) might play a key role in the evolution of CHIKV.
