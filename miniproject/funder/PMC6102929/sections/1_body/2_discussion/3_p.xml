<p id="Par38">Of note, the first RSE in S27 was deleted in the 3â€™ UTR of SZ1239. Similar gene gap was also found in other three CHIKV isolates from Indonesia (JMB-154, DH130003 and JMB-230), suggesting the absence of the first RSE might be due to an evolution process of CHIKV. It was reported that RSE regulated viral RNA synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A deletion of RSEs in model alphaviruses might affect the interaction of unknown cellular proteins involved in virus production and/or tissue specificity and leads to a reduced and delayed viral release in different cell types [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The consequence of the deletion of the first RSE in SZ1239 is currently unknown.
