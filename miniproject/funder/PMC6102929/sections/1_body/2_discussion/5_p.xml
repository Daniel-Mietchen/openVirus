<p id="Par40">It was reported that the C-terminal hypervariable domain of nsP3 (398–406 aa) prevented stress granule formation through sequestration of GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain)-binding proteins (G3BPs) during the mammalian stress response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Depletion of G3BPs caused severely reduced levels of negative-stranded (and consequently also positive-stranded) RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Fross et al. also identified the hypervariable C-terminal domain (475–501 aa) of nsP3 as a critical factor for granular localization and sequestration of mosquito Rin (G3BP homologue Rin in live mosquitoes) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The 18 amino acid deletion in nsP3 (386–403 aa) in Sindbis virus strain AR86 affected neurovirulence in mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Whether the gap (377–383 aa) in the nsP3 of SZ1239 would affect the interaction between G3BPs and nsP3 or contribute to the neurovirulence requires further investigation.
