<p id="Par44">As CHIKV is an arbovirus, it is very important to evaluate the virus tropism in the mosquito vectors. In this study, 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> cell line Aag-2 and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> cell line C6/36 were selected to serve as two mosquito cell models. Our results suggested that both cell lines were susceptible to these two strains. Of note, in our study, Aag-2 cells were very susceptible to both CHIKV isolates but had no CPE after infection.
