<p id="Par43">Beside adherent cells, suspension blood cells were also detected to compare their susceptibility to these two CHIKV strains. Our results showed that U937 cells were refractory to CHIKV infection in agreement with other reports [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A previous study found that CHIKV was able to bind to a cell membrane protein–prohibitins in U937 cells but could not replicate in them [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The detailed mechanism is unclear. Similarly, our result showed that Ana-1 was refractory to infection by SZ1050 from the IOL lineage. In addition, we also infected PMA-stimulated THP-1 with SZ1050 and SZ1239. Although SZ1239 showed higher viral RNA copies in the supernatant than that of SZ1050, it was hard to confirm that it could effectively replicate in THP-1 due to the minimal viral RNA load changes between time points. It was reported that CHIKV (La Reunion isolate of IOL lineage) could neither bind THP-1 at 4 °C nor produce infective viruses at 37 °C [
