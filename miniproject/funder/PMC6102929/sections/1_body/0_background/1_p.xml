<p id="Par23">Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted arbovirus belonging to the alphavirus genus of the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The major vectors of CHIKV are 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. Importantly, CHIKV is the etiologic agent of chikungunya fever (CHIKF), a rheumatic-like disease typically characterized by high fever, prolonged polyarthralgia, myalgia, rash and sometimes death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, to date no effective vaccine or specific therapeutic is available to prevent or treat CHIKV infection [
