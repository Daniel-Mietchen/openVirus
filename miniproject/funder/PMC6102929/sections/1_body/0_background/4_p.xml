<p id="Par26">In our previous study, two virus strains, SZ1050 and SZ1239, were successfully isolated from human serum samples using C6/36 cells. SZ1050 was isolated in 2010 and was from a patient returned from India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. SZ1239 was isolated in 2012 from a female traveler who had visited Indonesia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Here, we cultured these two strains with BHK-21 cells and sequenced their whole viral genomes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that SZ1050 belonged to the IOL lineage while SZ1239 was a strain of the Asian lineage. Next, we inoculated these two virus strains into a range of cells lines derived from different tissues of various hosts, including 293 (human embryonic kidney), HepG2 (human hepatocarcinoma), RD (human Rhabdomyosarcoma), HeLa (human cervical epithelial), THP-1 (peripheral blood monocytes from monocytic leukemia), K562 (human erythroleukemia), U937 (human histiocytic lymphoma), Ana-1 (the murinal celiac macrophage), BHK-21 (baby hamster kidney, fibroblast), MDCK (dog kidney epithelial), Vero (African Green Monkey Kidney), C6/36 (

 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>). The viral RNA loads in the supernatant and cell lysate were evaluated.
