<p id="Par25">To date, the cell surface receptors for CHIKV in both mosquito cells and vertebrate cells remain incompletely understood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus, to better understand the pathology of CHIKV infection, it is very important to confirm the cell types that CHIKV can attach to and productively infect. Previous studies found that different CHIKV lineages showed different cell tropisms in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and pathogenesis in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For example, the 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> cell line C6/36 was found to be significantly more permissive to the recently prevalent CHIKV isolates of the ECSA lineage than the original ROSS strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In another study, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> showed a higher disseminated infection and a more rapid transmission of the IOL lineage sooner after ingesting viral blood meal, while 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> displayed a more severe infection and more rapid transmission of the Asian lineage after viral blood meal infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Suckling mice infected with a CHIKV strain of the Asian lineage showed a lower weight gain and higher mortality than mice infected with a strain of the ECSA lineage after intra-cerebral inoculation, despite displaying similar viral load in the brains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Further gene expression studies found that the higher mortality caused by the Asian lineage was due to a differential gene expression profile involved in host immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, studies that compared the differences between the Asian lineage and the IOL lineage on cell susceptibility in mammalian and mosquito cell lines are limited.
