<p id="Par24">CHIKV is an enveloped, spherical, positive sense, and single stranded RNA virus. The genome size of CHIKV is approximately 11.8Kb containing a 5′-methylguanylate cap and a 3′-polyadenylate tail as well as two open reading frames (ORFs). The first ORF encodes for four nonstructural proteins (nsP1 to nsP4), while the second ORF encodes for three structural proteins (C, E1 and E2) and two small peptides (E3 and 6 K) [
