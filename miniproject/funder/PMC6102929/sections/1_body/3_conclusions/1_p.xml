<p id="Par46">To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the differences of the genome characters and cell tropisms between CHIKV strains of the Asian lineage and the IOL lineage. We found some mutations and gaps in our viral genomes compared to the sequence of S27. Both viruses could efficiently replicate in most evaluated epithelia or fibroblast cells and two
