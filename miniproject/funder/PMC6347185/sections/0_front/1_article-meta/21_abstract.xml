 <p>We characterized 419 
  <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic> isolates collected between 2011 and 2017 in Osaka prefecture of Japan. This analysis revealed high prevalence of macrolide-resistant 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (MRMP) in Osaka during 2011 and 2014 with annual detection rates of MRMP strains between 71.4% and 81.8%. However, in 2015 and after, the detection rate of MRMP decreased significantly and did not exceed 50%. Genotyping of the 
  <italic>p1</italic> gene of these isolates showed that most of MRMP strains harbored type 1 
  <italic>p1</italic> gene. In contrast, strains expressing 
  <italic>p1</italic> gene type 2 or its variant were largely macrolide-susceptible 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>pneumoniae</italic> (MSMP) strains. There was a strong correlation between 
  <italic>p1</italic> gene genotype and the presence of mutations conferring macrolide resistance in 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>pneumoniae</italic> isolated in Osaka. These results indicate that lower incidence of MRMP strains in Osaka from 2015 was associated with the relative increase of 
  <italic>p1</italic> gene type 2 lineage strains. During these experiments, we also isolated three 
  <italic>M</italic>. 
  <italic>pneumoniae</italic> strains that showed irregular typing pattern in the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the 
  <italic>p1</italic> gene. Two of these strains harbored new variants of type 2 
  <italic>p1</italic> gene and were designated as type 2f and 2g. The remaining strain with an irregular typing pattern had a large deletion in the 
  <italic>p1</italic> operon.
