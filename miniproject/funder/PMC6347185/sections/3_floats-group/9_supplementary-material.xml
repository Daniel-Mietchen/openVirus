  <title>Schematic illustration of the 
   <italic>p1</italic> operon regions of FH and M241 strains.
  </title>
  <p>The light blue arrows indicate the 
   <italic>p1</italic> and 
   <italic>orf6</italic> genes. The 
   <italic>p1</italic> gene of strain M241 had a truncation at the C-terminus due to DNA recombination between the repetitive sequence regions RepMP2/3-d and RepMP2/3_e (also see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209938.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Small orange arrows indicate approximate positions of PCR primer binding sites (ADH1, ADH2, ADH3, ADH4, and 23e-R1). The lower right panel is an electrophoresis pattern in 0.8% agarose gel of DNA fragments obtained as PCR products from FH and M241 strain genomes by using ADH3 and 23e-R1 primers. The regions corresponding to the PCR products are indicated by red arrows. A faint 1.9 kb band in FH strain suggests a presence of similar recombination event in growth population of FH strain.
