  <title>Comparison and classification of 
   <italic>p1</italic> and 
   <italic>orf6</italic> gene subtypes in 
   <italic>M</italic>.

  <p>(A) Schematic illustration of the 
   <italic>p1</italic> operon region and comparison of 11 
   <italic>p1</italic> subtypes. Three light blue arrows indicate 
   <italic>orf4</italic> (MPN140), 
   <italic>p1</italic> (MPN141), and 
   <italic>orf6</italic> (MPN142) genes of the 
   <italic>p1</italic> operon. The approximate size of the operon is shown above in base pairs (bp). The positions correspond to P40 and P90 proteins are shown in the 
   <italic>orf6</italic> gene. Pink, green, and blue rectangles below the 
   <italic>p1</italic> and 
   <italic>orf6</italic> genes indicate approximate positions of RepMP repetitive sequence regions (RepMP4-c, RepMP2/3-d, and RepMP5-c). Black rectangles indicate approximate positions of sequence variations of 
   <italic>p1</italic> and 
   <italic>orf6</italic> genes using type 2 strain FH as reference. Probable origins of the variation of these sequences (suffixes of RepMPs are identical to the variations) are indicated next to gray rectangles (also see panel B). Representative strains that harbor genes of the corresponding subtype are indicated on the left. Accession numbers of the subtype sequences are shown on the right. Type 2b is also referred to as type 2V in other reports [
   <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
   <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,
   <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Sequence information of the 
   <italic>orf6</italic> gene of the type 2c2 strain P53 was kindly provided by Dr. Fei Zhao of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The 
   <italic>orf6</italic> sequence of the type 2e strain Mp100 has not yet been reported [
   <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. (B) Distribution of RepMP regions in 
   <italic>M</italic>. 
   <italic>pneumoniae</italic> genome. Approximate positions of 8 RepMP4, 12 RepMP2/3, and 8 RepMP5 regions in 
   <italic>M</italic>. 
   <italic>pneumoniae</italic> genome are indicated by colored boxes. Two RepMP2/3 regions (RepMP2/3-k and -l) were newly identified during genome sequencing analysis of KCH-402 and KCH-405 strains (GenBank accession nos. AP017318 and AP017319) [
   <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Suffixes of RepMP regions (-a to -k) are based on the nomenclature system proposed by Spuesens 
   <italic>et al</italic>. previously [
