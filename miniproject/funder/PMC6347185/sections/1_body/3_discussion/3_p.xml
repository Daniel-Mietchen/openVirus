<p>Correlation between MR and 
 <italic>p1</italic> type of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> has also been reported in studies of recent clinical isolates in China and Korea [
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Probably, the clinical usage of macrolides and dominant 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene type trend in these countries are similar to those in Japan. Geographic location may also affect distribution of similar 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> strains. However, MR and 
 <italic>p1</italic> type did not correlate closely in the studies performed in the United States and other countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In the United States, the MR rate did not change over time despite fluctuations in dominant 
 <italic>p1</italic> type [
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The lack of correlation may be attributed to the generally low MR rate in these countries at the time of observation (under 30%), similar to the situation in Japan around year 2000 [
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The preservation of the low MR rate of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> in these countries may be related to the frequency of macrolide usage in clinical treatments in these countries. The selection of MRMPs with specific 
 <italic>p1</italic> type has not yet occurred in these countries.
