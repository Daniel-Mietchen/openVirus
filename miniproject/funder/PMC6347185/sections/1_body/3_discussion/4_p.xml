However, the use of tetracyclines in children younger than 8 years old presents a significant risk because of adverse effects. There is also an ongoing debate regarding the therapeutic effects of fluoroquinolones (tosufloxacin) used for the treatment of

However, the fraction of MRMP strains inferred by the epidemiological studies may be different from the actual prevalence of MR in the community, depending on the study design. In other words, MR rate may be higher in large hospitals than in clinics because

 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> pneumonia patients who do not recover after the treatment with macrolides and exhibit severe symptoms tend to transfer from clinics to larger hospitals. In these serious cases, pathology is usually caused by MRMP strains. Therefore, we compared the fractions of MR isolates in clinics and in hospitals in 2015 and 2016. As expected, the MR rate in hospitals was higher than that in clinics (
