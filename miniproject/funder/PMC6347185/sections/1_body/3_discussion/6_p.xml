<p>In this study, we have characterized 419 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> isolates collected in Osaka between 2011 and 2017. This analysis revealed a correlation between the decrease of MRMP strains and increase of 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene type 2 lineage 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> in Japan in recent years. The limitation of this study was the highly variable number of strains isolated in different years, which ultimately depended on the annual number of pneumonia patients (

 <xref rid="pone.0209938.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This made the comparison of MR rate and 
 <italic>p1</italic> type data between different years complicated. However, information obtained in our present analyses may be useful for future epidemiological studies. Continuous efforts for the collection of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> isolates and genotyping analysis are important for better understanding of epidemiology of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> infections.
