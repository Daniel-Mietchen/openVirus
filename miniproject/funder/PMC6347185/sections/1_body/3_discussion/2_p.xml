<p>The real mechanism underlying the correlation between MR and 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene type revealed in this study is unknown, however the probable reasons may be as follows. Type 2 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> was frequently isolated in Japan in 1990s [

 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, in early studies of MR of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> in Japan, no correlation between MR and 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene type was noted [
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, after 2003, type 1 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> became dominant, and this continued for about 10 years in Japan [

 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Most of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> pneumonia cases in that period might have been caused by type 1 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic>. In this situation, chemotherapy using macrolides might select resistant strains from type 1 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> rather than type 2 lineage. Then, type 1 MRMP strains spread widely in the community until the epidemic period in 2011 and 2012. However, after then, the occurrence of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> type 2 lineage increased, probably because of the type shift phenomenon of the pathogen as a result of interactions between antigenicity of pathogens and immunological status of human population [
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. At present, type 2 lineage strains isolated from patients are still considered as being macrolide-sensitive. To assess these hypotheses, it is particularly important to continue surveillance and carry out genetic characterization of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> isolates to establish whether the number of MRMP isolates of 
 <italic>p1</italic> type 2 lineage increases after this point.
