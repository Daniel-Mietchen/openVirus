<p>Currently, the reason for the periodic occurrence of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> pneumonia epidemics is not fully understood. In addition, it is unclear whether the emergence and wide spreading of MRMP strains affects epidemiological patterns of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> pneumonia. For better understanding of these aspects of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> infections, it is important to isolate 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> strains from patients continuously and to examine their genetic properties. In this study, 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> isolates were collected from 419 patients with respiratory infections between 2011 at 2017 in Osaka prefecture, the second largest metropolitan area in Japan (population of Osaka prefecture is approximately 9 million). We report here the results of MR analysis and genotyping of these 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> isolates.
