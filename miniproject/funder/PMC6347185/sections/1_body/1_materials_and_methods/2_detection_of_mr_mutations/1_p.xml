<p>MR of 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> isolates was determined by sequencing of the domain V region of the 23S rRNA gene. PCR primers Myco23S-F (
 <monospace>5′-TCTCGGCTATAGACTCGGTGA-3′</monospace>, positions 1998–2018 of the 23S rRNA gene) and Myco23S-R (
 <monospace>5′-TAAGAGGTGTCCTCGCTTCG-3′</monospace>, positions 2673–2692) were designed and used to amplify the region that contains the known MR mutation sites (in mycoplasma numbering, positions 2063, 2064, 2067, and 2617 of 23S rRNA gene). The amplified PCR products were sequenced by using the same primers on an ABI 3130 genetic analyzer (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) to detect the mutations.
