<p>Isolate 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene (MPN141) types were determined by using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) typing method [
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, genomic DNA of the isolates was extracted from the PPLO culture medium using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan). Two pairs of primers (ADH1-ADH2 and ADH3-ADH4) were used to amplify the polymorphic regions of the 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene (containing RepMP4 or RepMP2/3 regions) by PCR from genomic DNA. PCR products were digested with 
 <italic>Hae</italic>III restriction endonuclease and electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel. After gel staining, RFLP patterns of the PCR products were compared to determine 
 <italic>p1</italic> types.
