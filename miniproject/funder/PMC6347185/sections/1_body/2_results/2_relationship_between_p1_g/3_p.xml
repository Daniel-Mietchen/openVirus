<p>Three non-typable 
 <italic>p1</italic> isolates were collected in 2016 and designated as strains M241, M282, and K708 (Tables 
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.t003" ref-type="table">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.t004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). In the RepMP4 region analysis, these strains exhibited known PCR-RFLP patterns. The patterns of strains M282 and M241 were identical to that of type 2c strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209938.g002">Fig 2</xref>, lanes 6 and 8). Furthermore, the RepMP4 pattern of strain K708 was identical to that of type 2, 2a, or 2b strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209938.g002">Fig 2</xref>, lane 7). RepMP2/3 region patterns of these strains were however different from those of known strain types (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209938.g002">Fig 2</xref>, lanes 14â€“16). RepMP2/3 patterns of strains M282 and K708 were novel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209938.g002">Fig 2</xref>, lanes 14 and 15). The RepMP2/3 region of strain M241 could not be analyzed due to the lack of PCR amplification when ADH3 and ADH4 primers were used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209938.g002">Fig 2</xref>, lane 16).
