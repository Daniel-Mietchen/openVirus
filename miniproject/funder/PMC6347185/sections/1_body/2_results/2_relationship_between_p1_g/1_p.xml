<p>By using the PCR-RFLP method [
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we carried out 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene typing of 419 isolates. As a result of this typing analysis, 223 isolates were classified as type 1 (53.2%), 102 isolates were type 2 (24.3%), 6 were type 2a (1.4%), 1 was type 2b (0.2%), 84 were type 2c (20%), and 3 were non-typable (0.7%) (
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene type 1 isolates were highly prevalent between 2011 and 2014 (71.4–90.9%), however after this period, type 2 and type 2c isolates increased significantly (

 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> strains decreased to 43.3–62.5% between 2015 and 2017 (
