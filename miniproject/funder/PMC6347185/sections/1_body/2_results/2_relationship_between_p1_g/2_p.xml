<p>We then examined whether 
 <italic>p1</italic> typing results correlated with the presence of MR mutations in isolates and found that the presence of MR mutations in isolates was highly dependent on 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene type. Most of type 1 isolates harbored MR mutations (204/223 isolates, 91.5%). In contrast, only one type 2 (1/102, 1%) and five type 2c (5/84, 6%) isolates harbored A2063G mutation (
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). The total isolates with MR mutation in type 2 lineage (2, 2a, 2b, and 2c) was 3.1% (6/193). Thus, the presence of MR mutations was strongly determined by the 
 <italic>p1</italic> type (between type 1 and 2 lineages) (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, Fisherâ€™s exact test).
