<p>To determine the prevalence of MR in these isolates, we analyzed the domain V region of the 23S rRNA gene in all isolates by PCR and DNA sequencing. MR mutations were found in 210 out of 419 isolates (50.1%). The fraction of MRMP strains was higher than 70% between 2011 and 2014 (71.4–81.8%), whereas in 2015 and after, it decreased significantly to 41.4–50% (
