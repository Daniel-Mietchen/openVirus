<p>We also compared the fractions of isolates with MR in clinics (primary medical institutions) with that in hospitals (higher order medical institutions) in 2015 and 2016 to establish if MR incidence depended on the scale of the medical institutions (
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). In 2015, the fractions of MR isolates were significantly higher in hospitals (59/110, 53.6%) than in clinics (6/47, 12.8%;

 <italic>P</italic> = 0.061, Fisher’s exact test). Thus, the incidence of MR in isolates from hospitals was higher than that in isolates from clinics.
