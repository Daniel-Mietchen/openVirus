<p>The 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene of strain M241 could not be amplified with PCR primers used for the analysis of M282 and K708 
 <italic>p1</italic> genes. Because a large sequence change was expected at the 3′ end of M241 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene, we designed several PCR primers that correspond to downstream of the 
 <italic>p1</italic> operon. Using one of these reverse primers, designated as 23e-R1, which was specific to the site about 2.5 kb downstream of the 
 <italic>p1</italic> operon (downstream of the 
 <italic>orf6</italic> gene), we achieved amplification of M241 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene region. The PCR product size was about 6.8 kb shorter than expected (

 <italic>p1</italic> operon of M241 strain due to DNA recombination between the RepMP2/3 region in the 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene and another RepMP2/3 located downstream of the 
 <italic>p1</italic> operon (GenBank accession no. LC390171). This deletion caused a loss of the ADH4 primer binding site and entire 
 <italic>orf6</italic> gene (

 <italic>p1</italic> gene and loss of the 
 <italic>orf6</italic> gene), strain M241 had no cytadherence activity in the conventional hemadsorption assay [
