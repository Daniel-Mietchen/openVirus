<p>The recently obtained 
 <italic>M</italic>. 
 <italic>pneumoniae</italic> whole genome sequence datasets suggest that 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene type 2b and 2c strains have common sequence variations in the 
 <italic>orf6</italic> gene (MPN142), which differentiate these strains from other type 2 strains [
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0209938.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, we have sequenced the 
 <italic>orf6</italic> region of strains M282 and K708 and revealed that the type 2f strain M282 had a novel, 90-bp long sequence variation at the 5â€² end of the 
 <italic>orf6</italic> gene (GenBank accession no. LC390170) (

 <italic>orf6</italic> sequence of the type 2f strain K708 (GenBank accession no. LC420352) was identical to that of the type 2 strain FH (GenBank accession no. CP017327) (
