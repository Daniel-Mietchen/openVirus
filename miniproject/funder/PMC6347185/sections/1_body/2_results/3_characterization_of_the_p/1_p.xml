<p>To establish the reason for the irregular RFLP patterns of strains M241, M282, and K708 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209938.g002">Fig 2</xref>), we analyzed the 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene region of these strains by sequencing. The entire 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene regions of strains M282 and K708 were amplified from the genomic DNA by PCR and sequenced. These analyses identified novel sequence variations in the RepMP2/3 region of strains M282 and K708. The theoretical 
 <italic>Hae</italic>III digestion patterns of ADH3-4 amplicon were in good agreement with experimental data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209938.g002">Fig 2</xref>, lanes 14 and 15; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0209938.g003">Fig 3</xref>). In the 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene region of strain K708, a minor variation was also identified in the RepMP4 region (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209938.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This minor variation in the RepMP4 region did not affect the 
 <italic>Hae</italic>III site and RFLP pattern. The 
 <italic>p1</italic> genes of M282 and K708 strains are thought to have originated from type 2c and type 2 
 <italic>p1</italic> genes, respectively. However, novel variation sequences of these genes were partially similar to the type 1 
 <italic>p1</italic> gene sequence (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0209938.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). We therefore designated the 
 <italic>p1</italic> genes of strains M282 and K708 as type 2f and 2g, respectively (GenBank accession nos. LC311244 and LC385984). These variations were presumably generated by gene conversion-like DNA recombination between RepMP2/3 sequences within and outside of the 
 <italic>p1</italic> operon [
