<p>Analysis of available genome sequences for 28 human and 21 environmental isolates of highly pathogenic H7N9 found that 25/28 human and all of the environmental samples had a reversion of the HA mutation at position 226 from leucine (L) to glutamine (Q) (H3 numbering) [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. All of these isolates maintained the HA mutation G186V (H3 numbering) that is associated with enhanced binding to α2,6-SAs. In the viral polymerase, 14 and 4 of the human isolates had the substitutions PB2 E627K and D701N, respectively [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], while none of the environmental isolates carried these mutations. The reversion of the HA L226Q mutation was surprising as the 226L mutation was previously shown to enhance binding to α2,6-SAs [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. When receptor-binding preference of the highly pathogenic human isolate A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (H7N9) was evaluated using glycan arrays, the virus displayed an α2,3-SAs binding preference. In contrast, when binding preference was assayed using biolayer interferometry, binding to both α2,3 and α2,6-SAs was observed [
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>], and this was consistent with receptor-binding studies on the A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 and A/Guangdong/17SF006/2017 (H7N9) isolates using an ELISA-based assay [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Together, these studies indicate that the highly pathogenic H7N9 viruses retain the dual receptor-specificity observed with the low pathogenic precursor viruses, although it is unclear if reversion of the HA L226Q mutation reduced or altered the affinity of the highly pathogenic HA for α2,6-SAs. Importantly, as noted above, reversion of this mutation in the low pathogenic A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus reduced the pH of fusion [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>], and it is possible that this mutation may have been selected to stabilize the HA.
