 <xref rid="B146-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>] during the 5th epidemic wave. Sequence analysis indicated that HA cleavage site contained a polybasic motif, indicating a highly pathogenic phenotype in poultry. From December 2016 until September 2017, a total of 32 human infections with highly pathogenic H7N9 were reported [
