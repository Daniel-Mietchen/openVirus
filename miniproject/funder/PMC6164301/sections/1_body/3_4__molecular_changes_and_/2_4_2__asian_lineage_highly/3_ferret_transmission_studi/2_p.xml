<p>Imai et al. studied the human isolate A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD/3) and performed a deep sequencing analysis of variant populations [
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. This analysis identified a subpopulation of variants that contained the mutation NA R294K, a known neuraminidase inhibitor resistance marker. As a result, the wild-type egg-passaged virus, and two recombinant viruses carrying either the NA 294R or 294K mutations on the GD/3 backbone were generated [
 <xref rid="B152-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. In differentiated NHBE cells, the recombinant GD/3 virus carrying N294R (rGD/3 NA 294R) grew to comparable titers to the low pathogenic A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus at both 33 and 37 °C, while the wild-type virus and GD/3 NA 294K virus displayed reduced growth at 33 °C. In contrast, at 37 °C, only the rGD/3 NA 294K virus displayed reduced growth kinetics demonstrating that this mutation attenuated the virus. Similarly, in ferrets on day 3 post-infection, all three highly pathogenic viruses and the low pathogenic A/Anhui/1/2013 virus replicated efficiently in the nasal turbinates and lungs, although the rGD/3 NA 294K virus replicated to significantly lower titers in the lungs. On day 6 post-infection, all of the highly pathogenic viruses grew to comparable titers in the lungs and nasal turbinates, and replication of the low pathogenic A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus was reduced in the lungs.
