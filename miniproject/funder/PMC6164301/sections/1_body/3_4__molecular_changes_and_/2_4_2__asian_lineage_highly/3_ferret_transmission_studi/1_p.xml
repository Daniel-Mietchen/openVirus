<p>To date, one human and one chicken isolate of highly pathogenic H7N9 have been evaluated for transmissibility in ferrets [

 <xref rid="B152-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. In studies by Shi et al., the highly pathogenic poultry isolate A/chicken/Guangdong/SD008/2017 (H7N9) [CK/SD008] was compared to the low pathogenic A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus. Both viruses were found to bind α2,3-SA and α2,6-SAs, and the CK/SD008 virus displayed slightly enhanced thermostability relative to A/Anhui/1/2013. In respiratory transmission studies, the CK/SD008 virus transmitted to one out of four respiratory contact ferrets. By performing limiting dilutions on viruses recovered from infected ferret lung tissues, Shi et al. isolated variants carrying the PB2 627K or 701N mutations. When these polymerase variant viruses were used to initiate airborne transmission studies, the PB2 627K-CK/SD008 virus transmitted to 100% of the respiratory contact animals, while the PB2 701N-CK/SD008 virus transmitted to 66% of contacts. These studies suggest that the highly pathogenic CK/SD008 virus has the potential to readily adapt to mammals and may be capable of on-ward transmission. However, while the polymerase variants displayed enhanced transmission relative to the wild-type CK/SD008 virus, when transmission of the low pathogenic A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus was evaluated in parallel, 100% of the respiratory contacts also became infected. Given that this is one of the few studies to report transmission of the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) virus to 100% of the respiratory contacts, it is difficult to determine if the highly pathogenic viruses carrying polymerase mutations have enhanced potential relative to the low pathogenic strains to transmit via the airborne route [
