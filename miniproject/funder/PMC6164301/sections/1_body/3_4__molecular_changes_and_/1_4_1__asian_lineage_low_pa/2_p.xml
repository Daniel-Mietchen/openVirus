<p>Following the emergence of the H7N9 viruses, multiple research groups rapidly characterized the viruses and assessed transmission in ferrets. Sequence analysis of the early isolates and viruses from subsequent epidemic waves found that the majority of isolates carried the HA mutations G186V and Q226L (H3 numbering), which enhance binding to α2,6-SAs [

 <xref rid="B118-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Biochemical characterization of the H7N9 HA revealed that the early viruses displayed an α2,3-SA binding preference, while also exhibiting binding to α2,6-SAs [

 <xref rid="B124-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. Subsequent studies have confirmed that these characteristics are maintained in viruses from the 5th epidemic wave [

 <xref rid="B126-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. As a result, H7N9 viruses are considered to have dual receptor specificity. Furthermore, the H7 HA was found to lack a glycosylation site at position 158–160 that promoted airborne transmission of the highly pathogenic A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) virus. Therefore, it is possible that the loss of this site may contribute to the ability of these viruses to infect humans [
