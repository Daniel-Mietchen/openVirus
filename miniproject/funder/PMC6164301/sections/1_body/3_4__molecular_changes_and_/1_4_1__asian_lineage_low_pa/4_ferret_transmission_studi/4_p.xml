<p>Importantly, gain-of-transmission studies and molecular characterization of mammalian adaptive mutations have been performed with other H7 virus strains. These strains include a highly pathogenic H7N1 isolate and two H7N7 viruses. While these strains belong to the Eurasian lineage of H7 viruses, they are distantly related to the Asian lineage H7N9 viruses [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>,
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>,
 <xref rid="B144-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. In these studies, after 10 serial passages of a highly pathogenic H7N1 virus carrying the PB2 E627K mutation, five amino acid mutations were enriched and the virus exhibited the ability to transmit to two out of three respiratory contact ferrets. One of the mutations was in the stalk region of the HA (K/R304R H3 numbering, K/R295R, H7 numbering) suggesting a potential role in stabilizing the HA, while the remaining mutations were in the PB2, NP, and M genes. The location of these later mutations suggested that they may enhance polymerase activity or modify the stability of the virion [

 <xref rid="B143-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. These studies suggest that H7 viruses may adapt to mammals and evolve the ability to transmit via the airborne route through previously undefined or understudied mechanisms. Therefore, future studies should focus on both genetic signatures of transmission and biological characterization of emerging H7N9 viruses.
