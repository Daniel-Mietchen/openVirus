<p>To evaluate if viruses from the second and third epidemic waves exhibited enhanced transmission, four second-wave and two third-wave viruses were compared [
 <xref rid="B140-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. The majority of viruses carried the PB2 627K and HA 217Q (226Q H3 numbering) mutations, and all of the viruses replicated in human bronchial epithelial cells at 37 째C, although there were strain specific differences. When viral replication was evaluated at 33 째C, all of the viruses displayed reduced replication at 12 and 24 h post-infection but reached similar titers to those obtained at 37 째C by 48 h. These findings indicated that the viruses have not yet acquired the ability to efficiently replicate at 33 째C. Using a virus-induced hemolysis assay as a surrogate for pH of fusion, the A/Anhui/1/2013 virus and all of the second epidemic wave viruses displayed fusion at pH 5.8, while the third wave viruses exhibited a pH of fusion of 5.6. These data suggests that the third wave viruses may be adapting to mammals. Representative second- and third-wave viruses, A/Hong Kong/5942/2013 and A/British Columbia/1/2015, respectively, were then evaluated for direct and respiratory contact transmission in ferrets. Both viruses transmitted to three out of three direct contacts and one out of three respiratory contacts. The transmission kinetics and proportion of animals that became infected were similar to that of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), and all of the viruses exhibited delayed transmission to the respiratory contacts [

These studies indicate that the H7N9 viruses are not capable of efficient respiratory transmission, and consistent with these findings, the H7N9 viruses have not shown evidence of enhanced or sustained human-to-human transmission over the five epidemic waves [
