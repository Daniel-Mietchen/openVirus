<p>Several groups performed a sequence analysis of viruses isolated from the respiratory contact ferrets that became infected with the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) isolate [

 <xref rid="B134-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Xu et al. reported transmission to one of four respiratory contact animals, and the virus isolated from the respiratory contact had four mutations: HA R140K (R157K H3 numbering), NA T10I, PB2 D678Y, and NP I109T [
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. The R140K mutation is located on the rim of the receptor-binding pocket and could alter glycan-binding [
 <xref rid="B138-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]; however, the role of this mutation and the other identified mutations has not been explored. In studies by Watanabe et al., a single respiratory contact animal became infected and the mutations HA T71I, R131K, and A135T (H3 numbering), and NA A27T were identified [
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. The HA mutations R131K and A135T are located in close proximity to the receptor-binding pocket suggesting they may enhance the affinity of the HA for α2,6-SAs, while the T71I mutation is located underneath this pocket indicating it may play a role in stabilizing the HA [
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. In transmission studies by Richard et al., three out of four respiratory contact animals became infected, and a second round of respiratory transmission was initiated using the virus isolated from a respiratory contact that had the fewest substitutions. In this second round of transmission, only one in four respiratory contacts became infected [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>], yet all of the respiratory contacts in both rounds of transmission had the HA mutations N123D (N133D H3 numbering) and N149D (located between amino acids 158 and 159 in H3 numbering). These mutations are also located adjacent to the receptor-binding site, but do not interact directly with sialic acids. When the role of these mutations was examined using recombinant viruses, introduction of the N123D and N149D mutations resulted in a modest 2–4-fold increase in binding to α2,6-SAs [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Further evaluation of the pH of fusion demonstrated that the HA of A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) underwent fusion at pH 5.6 and neither the N123D or N149D mutations modified this property. In two respiratory contacts, the mutation PB1 M523I was also identified, although this mutation did not alter polymerase activity at 33 or 37 °C. In addition to the HA N123D and N149D mutations, deep sequence analysis identified the receptor binding variant HA L217Q (L226Q H3 numbering) at relatively low frequencies (i.e., ~9–24.5%) in three donor ferrets. This mutation was not present in the respiratory contact animals, but was later shown to decrease the pH of fusion from 5.6 to 5.4, while also increasing the temperature stability of the virus [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. The role of the HA G219S (G228S H3 numbering) mutation, which is known to promote binding to α2,6-SAs in H3 and H2 influenza viruses and enhance binding of H7N9 viruses to human trachea and alveolar epithelium, was also evaluated. This mutation was found to increase the pH of fusion to 6.0 and decrease the temperature stability of the virus [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. Jointly, these studies indicate that the H7N9 HA is not optimally stabilized for airborne transmission, and the introduction of mutations known to enhance glycan binding or transmission may not readily stabilize the HA.
