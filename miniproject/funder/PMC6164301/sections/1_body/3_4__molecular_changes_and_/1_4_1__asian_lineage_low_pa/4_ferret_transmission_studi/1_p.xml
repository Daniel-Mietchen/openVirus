<p>In ferrets, infection with the novel H7N9 viruses isolated in 2013 caused minimal clinical disease and did not result in mortality [

 <xref rid="B137-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], while different research groups reported variation in proportion of respiratory contacts that became infected. Specifically, the H7N9 viruses were found to transmit to between 33% (i.e., 1 out of 3) to 75 or 100% (i.e., 3/4 or 4/4) of respiratory contact ferrets [

 <xref rid="B137-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Importantly, the H7N9 viruses displayed delayed transmission kinetics with viral shedding from the respiratory contacts starting on days 3–7 post-exposure, while respiratory contacts exposed to donor ferrets infected with human H1N1 or H3N2 viruses began shedding on days 1–3 post-exposure [
