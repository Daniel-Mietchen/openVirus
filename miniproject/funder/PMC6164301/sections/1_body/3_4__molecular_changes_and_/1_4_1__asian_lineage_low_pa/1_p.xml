<p>In the spring of 2013, a novel H7N9 virus emerged in China and began infecting visitors at live-bird markets [

 <xref rid="B110-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Phylogenic analysis indicated that the virus emerged through multiple reassortment events in wild birds. Circulating H9N2 viruses donated the internal genes, and separate viruses carrying the H7 and N9 genes provided the HA and NA gene segments. The H7N9 viruses were then introduced into domestic chickens and this species has become the predominant host for these viruses [

 <xref rid="B113-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Since emerging, the H7N9 viruses have caused five annual epidemic waves of human infections with a total of 1567 cases and 615 deaths [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. After the first wave of infections during the spring and early summer of 2013, each successive wave started during the winter months (i.e., October–November) and subsided by June. The epidemic wave in 2016–2017 was the most severe with 759 confirmed human cases; this increase in cases most likely resulted from geographical spread of the virus from eastern China throughout the country [
 <xref rid="B114-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Each epidemic wave arose from viruses during the previous wave, and there are currently two separate lineages of H7N9 viruses: the Pearl River Delta lineage and Yangtze River Delta lineage [

 <xref rid="B117-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. Phylogenic analysis of the H7N9 viruses indicates that the NA and internal genes have continued to undergo reassortment with other H7N9 viruses in chickens, while no additional combinations of the H7 HA and different NA subtypes have emerged and caused zoonotic infections [
