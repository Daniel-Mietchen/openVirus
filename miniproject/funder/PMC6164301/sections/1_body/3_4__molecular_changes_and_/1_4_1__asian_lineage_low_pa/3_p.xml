<p>The vast majority of early isolates were also found to carry mutations in the viral polymerase such as PB2 E627K and D701N [

 <xref rid="B130-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. During the 5th wave of human infections, the frequency of virus isolates carrying the E627K and D701N mutations did not change; however, the number of isolates with PB2 A588V increased to 81%, and earlier studies demonstrated that this mutation combined with PB2 627K increased virulence in mice [

 <xref rid="B131-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. Collectively, these studies revealed that the H7N9 viruses carried several mutations indicative of the ability to infect and potentially transmit in humans. This was consistent with the observed epidemiology and warranted evaluation of the viruses for their ability to transmit in animal models.
