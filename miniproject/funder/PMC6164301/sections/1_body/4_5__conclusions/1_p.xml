<p>Highly pathogenic GsGd H5 viruses and Asian lineage H7N9 viruses pose a significant pandemic threat. While the number of zoonotic infections with these viruses has decreased in the past year, H5 viruses remain endemic in poultry in the Middle East, and H7N9 viruses continue to circulate and cause poultry outbreaks in China. Both H5 and H7 viruses carry several molecular markers indicative of the ability to infect and transmit in humans, although the HA molecule of these viruses is relatively unstable and this likely represents the most significant obstacle to emergence of a virus capable of efficient airborne transmission. As the initiation of a pandemic requires the optimal balance of viral properties to be combined in a single virus, the presence of viruses circulating in nature with several of these changes that are also capable of causing severe disease in humans warrants significant pandemic preparedness efforts. Indeed, the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic is a stark reminder of the potential for influenza viruses to impart a devastating global disease burden. Surveillance efforts and laboratory characterization are fundamental to assess the threat posed by emerging H5 and H7 viruses, and significant emphasis should be focused on understanding the mutations or changes that would stabilize the HA. On-going research is needed to develop pandemic influenza vaccines, and combined with basic research, both approaches could enhance our ability to predict and potentially reduce the burden of an H5 or H7 influenza virus pandemic.</p>
