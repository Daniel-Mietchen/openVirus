<p>To determine if the H5N1 viruses that were circulating in Egypt represented an increased pandemic threat, nine poultry viruses isolated between 2014 and 2015 were evaluated for their ability to transmit in ferrets [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In initial studies, two viruses, A/duck/Dakahlia/1536CAG/2015 and A/duck/Giza/1529S/2015, transmitted to two of two respiratory contact animals, while the remaining viruses failed to transmit in ferrets. When the transmission studies were repeated, neither the A/duck/Dakahlia/1536CAG/2015 nor the A/duck/Giza/1529S/2015 viruses transmitted to respiratory contact animals in three separate experiments. Using glycan and tissue binding assays, both viruses had a strong binding preference for α2,3-SAs while also exhibiting limited binding to α2,6-SAs [

These findings indicate that the viruses were not capable of efficient transmission, but may be able to bind cells in the human upper respiratory tract. Collectively, recent GsGd H5N1 viruses endemic to poultry in Egypt display some propensity to bind α2,6-SAs and this may allow these viruses to establish infections in the upper airways. Still, the viruses have limited ability to transmit via the airborne route, and additional mutations in the HA or reassortment events are likely required for the emergence of a virus that is capable of onwards spread in humans.
