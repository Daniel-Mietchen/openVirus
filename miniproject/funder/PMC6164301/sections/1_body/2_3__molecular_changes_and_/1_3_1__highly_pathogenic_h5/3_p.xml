<p>At the same time, gain-of-function studies using a reassortant virus carrying the GsGd lineage H5 HA from A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) (Clade 1) combined with the remaining seven gene segments from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus were also being performed. In these studies, using a combination of reverse genetics and selection of viral variants, four amino acid changes in the HA N224K, Q226L, N158K, and T318I (H3 numbering) were shown to promote airborne transmission of the reassortant H5N1 virus in ferrets. The HA N224K and Q226L mutations enhanced binding to α2,6-SAs, while the N158K mutation resulted in the loss of a glycosylation site and increased viral replication. Consistent with studies using the A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) virus, the T318I mutation was shown to decrease the pH of fusion and enhance the thermostability of the virus [

Combined, these studies verified that binding to α2,6-SAs and a mammalian adaptation of the viral polymerase are required for airborne transmission, while also identifying the role of reduced pH of fusion and enhanced thermostability of the HA in transmission of avian influenza viruses.
