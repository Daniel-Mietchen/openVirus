<p>The first reported human infection with highly pathogenic H5N1 was described in Hong Kong in 1997 [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and the isolated virus belonged to the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage (GsGd). In 2003, H5N1 viruses from this lineage again caused human infections, and to date a total of 860 confirmed infections with 454 fatalities have been reported to the WHO [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. After emerging in China, these viruses have spread to multiple countries and have become endemic in poultry in Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, and Vietnam [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. As a result of evolution by drift and reassortment, the GsGd lineage viruses have diversified into 10 clades (0â€“9) with additional high-order subclades [
 <xref rid="B84-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. From 2014 to present, zoonotic infections with highly pathogenic H5N1 have occurred predominantly in Egypt and Indonesia, and these infections have been caused by viruses from clades 2.1 and 2.2, respectively [
