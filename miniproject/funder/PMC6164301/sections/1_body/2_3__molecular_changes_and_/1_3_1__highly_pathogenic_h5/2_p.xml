<p>In 2012, landmark gain-of-function studies with the highly pathogenic A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) virus demonstrated that an H5N1 virus could evolve to become airborne transmissible in ferrets via the accumulation of point mutations [

Specifically, introduction of the mutations HA Q222L and G224S (Q226L and G228S, H3 numbering), and PB2 E627K, followed by 10 serial passages, resulted in the acquisition of additional mutations PB1 H99Y, HA H103Y and T156A (H110Y and T160A, H3 numbering) [

The HA mutation H103Y was found to reduce the pH of fusion and increase the temperature stability of the virus, while the T156A mutation enhanced binding to both α2,3 and α2,6-SAs. Introduction of the PB2 E627K mutation increased viral replication and polymerase activity that was further enhanced when combined with the PB1 H99Y mutation [
