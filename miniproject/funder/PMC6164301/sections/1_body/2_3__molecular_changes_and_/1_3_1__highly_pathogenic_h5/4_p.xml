<p>From 2010 to 2015, the majority of human infections with highly pathogenic H5N1 occurred in Egypt, with a total of 256 infections [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Since 2016, the number of zoonotic H5N1 infections has decreased to less than 10 per year; however, despite this reduction, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses remain endemic in domestic poultry in Egypt and other countries. As a result, H5N1 viruses continue to evolve and could potentially acquire mutations that promote transmission to humans. Indeed, phylogenic analysis in 2012 of 46 available H5N1 isolates from Egypt indicated that these viruses lack the HA glycosylation site near residue 156 (158–160 H3 numbering), while also carrying the PB2 E627K mutation [

Subsequent, in silico analysis predicated that mutations HA K153D, S223N, and G272S (K157D, S227N, and G275S H3 numbering) that are present in H5N1 viruses circulating in Egypt would result in enhanced binding to α2,6-SAs. When these mutations were introduced into either pseudo-typed retrovirus particles or recombinant influenza viruses they enhanced binding and replication, respectively, to MDCK cells overexpressing α2,6-SAs [

Furthermore, evaluation of mutations identified in human isolates from Egypt, including HA H125Y, H125Y/N94D, N182K/T195I/N94D, S223N, and S223N/ S128Δ/I151T (H3 numbering HA H130Y, H230Y/N101D, N186K/T199I/N101D, S227N, and S227N/ S133Δ/I155T), indicated that these mutations enhance binding of recombinant viruses to α2,6-SAs as well as viral replication in primary human airway epithelial cells. However, these mutations also increased the pH of fusion and decreased thermostability of the viruses indicating that the mutations may be destabilizing the HA [
