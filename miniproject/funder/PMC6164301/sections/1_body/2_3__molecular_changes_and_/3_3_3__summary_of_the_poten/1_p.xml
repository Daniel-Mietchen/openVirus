<p>In summary, studies on both the GsGd clade 2.1 and 2.2 virus from Egypt and the clade 2.3.4.4 viruses from multiple countries indicate that these viruses have a limited ability to transmit via the airborne route. While the number of zoonotic infections with clade 2.1 and 2.2 viruses has decreased, these viruses remain a significant threat to human health. The viruses continue to circulate in domestic poultry in the Egypt and could again infect humans in close-contact with these birds. The studies on H5N8 and H5N2 viruses from clade 2.3.4.4 demonstrate that these viruses pose a limited public health risk. While some H5N8 and H5N2 isolates bind to α2,6-SAs, the viruses replicate poorly in mammals and do not transmit between ferrets. In contrast, H5N6 viruses have several characteristics that suggest these viruses will continue to cause zoonotic infections. In particular, some H5N6 viruses display a high degree of binding to α2,6-SAs, in combination with high polymerase activity and the ability to transmit to direct contact ferrets. Based on our current understanding of influenza transmission, it is clear that several of these viruses have attributes that promote airborne transmission. However, the clade 2.3.4.4. H5 HA appears to be relatively unstable with a pH of fusion above 5.5 and low thermostability. Therefore, as with the H5N1 viruses that are endemic in poultry in Egypt, it is likely that additional mutations are required to stabilize the HA molecule and support airborne transmission.</p>
