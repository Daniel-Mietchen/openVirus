<p>Building upon these observations, detailed studies were performed to characterize the A/Guangzhou/39715/2014 (H5N6) human isolate [
 <xref rid="B108-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. This virus displayed a distinct α2,3-SA binding preference and did not bind to α2,6-SAs. The virus also had a higher pH of fusion (i.e., 5.6 vs. 5.3) and reduced thermostability relative to a human H3N2 virus. Surprisingly, at both 33 and 37 °C the A/Guangzhou/39715/2014 (H5N6) isolate exhibited significantly higher polymerase activity compared to a human H1N1 strain and the airborne transmissible A/Indonesia/5/2005 (H5N1) virus. This polymerase activity was shown to be mediated by the PB2 mutation E627K as reversion of the mutation dramatically reduced polymerase activity [

 <sup>5</sup> TCID50/mL in the nasal washes of inoculated donor animals. However, the virus did not transmit to respiratory contact ferrets [
