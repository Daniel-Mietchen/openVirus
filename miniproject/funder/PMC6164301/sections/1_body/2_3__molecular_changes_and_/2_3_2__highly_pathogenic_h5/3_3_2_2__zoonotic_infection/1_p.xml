<p>While the GsGd clade 2.3.4.4 viruses have been widely disseminated and have caused poultry outbreaks in multiple countries, zoonotic infections have only been reported in China. Importantly, these human infections have only been caused by viruses of the H5N6 subtype. Since the first human case in 2014, a total of 19 laboratory confirmed cases of human infections have been reported, with six fatalities [

 <xref rid="B106-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Surprisingly, all four viruses displayed comparable binding to both α2,3 and α2,6-SAs. Two of the viruses were further evaluated in ferrets and infected animals did not display clinical signs; however, both viruses grew to significantly higher titers in upper respiratory tract tissues and grew to comparable or reduced titers in the lungs relative to a highly pathogenic H5N1 isolate. In transmission studies, both H5N6 viruses transmitted within four days to three of three direct contact animals, but failed to transmit to respiratory contact ferrets [
