<p>In response to increases in the number of reported human infections in 2016, a sequence analysis of nine available human H5N6 isolates was performed [
 <xref rid="B107-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. This analysis found that all of the viruses maintained the amino acids 226Q and 228G in the HA (H3 numbering) indicative of an α2,3-SA binding preference, while eight of nine viruses carried mutations that resulted in a loss of the glycosylation site at position 158, suggesting a limited degree of binding α2,6-SAs. In addition, the PB2 E627K mutation was identified in five human isolates, while the PB2 D701N mutation was found in a single virus [
