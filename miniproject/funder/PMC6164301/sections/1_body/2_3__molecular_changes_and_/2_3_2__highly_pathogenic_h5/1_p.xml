<p>In 2008, highly pathogenic H5 viruses in clade 2.3.4 of the GsGd lineage underwent reassortment in avian hosts. As a result, several NA subtypes including N2, N5, N6, and N8 [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>] were introduced and viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4 emerged. From this clade, H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8 viruses were carried by migrating birds from China to several countries leading to outbreaks in domestic poultry [

 <xref rid="B95-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Genetic analysis indicated that viruses within clade 2.3.4.4 evolved into four distinct groups (Groups A–D). Group A consisted of H5N8 viruses that caused outbreaks in China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Canada, the United States, and Europe in 2014–2015. Group B H5N8 viruses caused outbreaks in China in 2013 and 2014, and Korea in 2014. Group C included H5N6 and H5N1 viruses in China and Laos in 2013–2014, and H5N1 viruses in China and Vietnam in 2014, respectively. Lastly, Group D consisted of H5N6 viruses that were identified in China and Vietnam in 2013–2014 [

 <xref rid="B95-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. In particular, the Group A viruses had a significant economic impact, as they were carried out of Asia down the west coast of Canada and the United States, where they underwent reassortment with North American avian influenza viruses to generate novel H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8 viruses. These viruses were then introduced into commercial poultry farms and spread east across the continent. During these outbreaks H5N2 viruses predominated, and control was finally achieved in the summer of 2015 after 48 million birds were culled at an estimated economic cost of $1.6 billion [

 <xref rid="B98-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. In contrast to the parental highly pathogenic GsGd H5N1 viruses, no zoonotic infections were reported during the outbreaks in North America, but have been reported in China with clade 2.3.4.4 viruses of the H5N6 subtype.
