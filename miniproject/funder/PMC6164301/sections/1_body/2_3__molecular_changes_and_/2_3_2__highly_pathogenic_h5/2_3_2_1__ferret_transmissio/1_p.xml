<p>As viruses from the GsGd lineage had historically caused zoonotic infections, virus isolates from outbreaks in multiple countries were evaluated for molecular markers indicative of transmission and select isolates were characterized in ferrets. In response to outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N8 in Korea in January of 2014, the isolate A/mallard duck/Korea/W452/2014 (H5N8) was characterized in human respiratory tissues and ferrets. Relative to a 2009 pandemic H1N1 isolate, the virus grew to 0.5–1 log lower titers in primary human nasal mucosa epithelium, while replicating to comparable titers in human lung tissue explants. The virus maintained a distinct α2,3-SA binding preference, while displaying some binding to α2,6-SAs at high glycan concentrations. In ferrets, both direct contact and respiratory droplet transmission were evaluated. For both modes of transmission, none of the contact animals shed virus; however, two direct contact animals seroconverted indicating low level and inefficient transmission [

In particular, the identification of two mutations, PB2 R699K and HA A185E (A189E H3 numbering), which are located adjacent to position 627 in PB2 and are known to change the antigenicity of H5 viruses, respectively, prompted assessment of the transmissibility of the A/chicken/Netherlands/EMC-3/2014 (H5N8) isolate in ferrets. Following virus inoculation, viral titers declined rapidly in both throat and nasal swabs, and the virus was not transmitted to respiratory droplet contact animals [
