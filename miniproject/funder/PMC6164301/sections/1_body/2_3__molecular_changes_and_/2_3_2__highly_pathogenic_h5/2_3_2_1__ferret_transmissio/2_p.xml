<p>Following the introduction of H5 viruses to North America, two isolates, A/northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014 (H5N2) and A/gyrofalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014 (H5N8) were evaluated for their ability to replicate in a human bronchial epithelial cell line (Calu-3). When cultured at 33 °C, both viruses grew to reduced (e.g., 10-fold lower) titers relative to a human H3N2 virus, and while the viruses were capable of replicating in inoculated ferrets and caused mild clinical illness, neither virus was capable of direct contact transmission to naïve cage mates [

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. All of the viruses exhibited a strong α2,3-SA binding preference with minimal binding to α2, 6-SAs. Fusion was found to occur at pH values of 5.9 or 6.0, and relative to a 2009 pandemic H1N1 isolate, all of the viruses grew to significantly lower titers (&gt;100-fold) in differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells. Subsequently, six viruses were evaluated for their ability to replicate in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, and the viruses replicated poorly with peak titers less than 10
 <sup>3</sup> and 10
 <sup>1</sup> EID50/mL on days 3 and 5 post-infection, respectively. As in the two previous studies, none of the viruses displayed transmission to direct contact ferrets [
