<p>Avian influenza viruses of a specific HA subtype are phylogenetically divided into two main lineages, Eurasian and North American, and these lineages have largely evolved independently due to limited contact between birds on the two continents [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="B71-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Historically, low pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses in both lineages have mutated to become highly pathogenic and have caused outbreaks in poultry [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Within the Eurasian lineage, highly pathogenic H5 viruses belonging to the A/goose/Guangdong/1/1996 lineage (GsGd) emerged in the late 1990s and these viruses have caused several hundred zoonotic infections [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Recently, viruses from this lineage have been carried outside Asia by migratory birds and have caused outbreaks in North America. Within the H7 subtype, novel H7N9 viruses emerged in China in 2013 and these viruses have since caused annual epidemics of zoonotic infections [
 <xref rid="B77-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Given that both H5 and H7 viruses have displayed the propensity to infect humans, there is heightened concerned that they may evolve the ability to transmit between people and initiate a pandemic.
