<p>Avian influenza viruses are classified as low or highly pathogenic based on their pathogenicity in domestic chickens [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Most avian influenza viruses cause a gastrointestinal infection in birds with minimal clinical signs and are classified as low pathogenic. Upon circulation in domestic poultry, viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes can evolve to become highly pathogenic. Pathogenicity is the result of the accumulation of multiple basic amino acids in the HA cleavage site (termed polybasic cleavage site or polybasic motif) allowing the HA molecule to mature outside of the gastrointestinal tract and establish a systemic infection. Infection of poultry with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus is characterized by rapid onset and progression of disease associated with high mortality rates [
 <xref rid="B63-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Importantly, some low pathogenic and highly pathogenic H5 and H7 viruses also display virulence in mammals, and some highly pathogenic viruses can cause a systemic infection in animal models [

 <xref rid="B65-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Furthermore, the presence of a multiple basic cleavage site is considered a mammalian virulence factor [
