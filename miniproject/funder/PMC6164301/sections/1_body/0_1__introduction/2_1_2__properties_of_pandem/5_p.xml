<p>In recent years, influenza viruses of the H5 and H7 subtypes have each caused several hundred human infections with mortality rates exceeding 30%. Severe disease and death are the result of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Secondary bacterial infections have been observed in a limited number of patients, but these infections do not appear to play a large role in disease progression and severity [

 <xref rid="B62-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. As illustrated by the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, if an H5 or H7 virus evolves the ability to transmit via the airborne route it could have a devastating disease burden worldwide. Therefore, the goal of this review is to examine the current literature on recent zoonotic H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses with a focus on studies that have characterized transmission in animal models and molecular properties that promote transmission.
