<p>To start a pandemic, an influenza virus must overcome two major obstacles. First, the virus must be antigenically novel to humans, and secondly, the virus must be able to spread efficiently from person-to-person. Humans have no pre-existing immunity to H5 or H7 avian influenza viruses. Thus, if an H5 or H7 virus is introduced into the human population and can spread between people, particularly via the airborne route, it will initiate a pandemic. With this in mind, both the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) use airborne transmission (also referred to as respiratory droplet transmission) between experimental animals to assess the pandemic potential or risk posed by an emerging influenza virus [
