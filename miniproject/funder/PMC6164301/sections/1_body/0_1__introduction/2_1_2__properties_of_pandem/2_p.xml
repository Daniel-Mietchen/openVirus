<p>Experimental animals used to assess and model airborne transmission in humans include ferrets and guinea pigs [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Ferrets are the preferred model because they exhibit clinical signs upon influenza infection [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], have similar cell surface receptor (i.e., sialic acid) distribution in the respiratory tract to humans [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and efficiently transmit (i.e., transmission to 75–100% of contacts) pandemic influenza viruses via direct contact and respiratory droplets [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Transmission studies in guinea pigs have largely reproduced the findings in ferrets, and due to the reduced cost and ease of handling, guinea pigs can be utilized in larger numbers [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; however, unlike ferrets, guinea pigs do not develop clinical disease upon infection with human or avian influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Avian species are not used to evaluate airborne transmission because the routes of natural infection (i.e., the fecal–oral route in avian species) differ between mammals and birds, and experimental studies indicate that airborne transmission efficiency of avian influenza viruses in domestic chickens is low [
