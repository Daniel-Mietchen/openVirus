<p>Based on biochemical characterization and animal studies, several biological changes in a virus are postulated to be required for airborne transmission (extensively reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]). These changes include mutations in the polymerase genes to enhance replication in the upper respiratory tract at 33 °C (i.e., PB2 E627K or PB2 D701N) [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], a change in the HA receptor-binding preference to promote binding to “human-like” α2,6-linked sialic acids (α2,6-SA) with or without a loss of binding to “avian-like” α2,3-linked sialic acids (α2,3-SA) [

 <xref rid="B47-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], a decrease in the pH of fusion from 5.7–6.0 to 5.0–5.5 [

 <xref rid="B53-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], an increase in the thermostability of the viral HA [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], a balancing of neuraminidase (NA) cleavage activity with HA affinity for sialic acids (termed HA–NA balance) [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], and a change in virion morphology from spherical to filamentous particles [

 <xref rid="B59-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. This paradigm is largely based upon loss-of-function studies with pandemic influenza viruses (i.e., H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2 viruses) [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] and two gain-of-transmission studies with H5N1 viruses [
 <xref rid="B54-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Thus, while these changes are considered to be required for airborne transmission of an avian influenza virus, they are not necessarily sufficient and additional properties that have not yet been elucidated are also likely to contribute.
