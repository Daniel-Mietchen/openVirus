<p>Influenza A viruses are subtyped based on their combination of HA and NA surface glycoproteins, and there are 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Sixteen HA subtypes and nine NA subtypes circulate in wild aquatic birds, which are considered the natural reservoir for influenza A viruses [

 <xref rid="B14-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Two subtypes, H17N10 and H18N11, have been identified in bats using viral RNA sequence analysis [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. After the 1918 pandemic, H1N1 viruses continued to circulate in humans and these viruses displayed reduced morbidity and mortality. In 1957 an H2N2 virus emerged and initiated a pandemic. This virus replaced the circulating H1N1 viruses and circulated until 1968, when it was replaced by a pandemic H3N2 virus [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In 1977, an H1N1 virus again initiated a pandemic. This H1N1 virus originated in China or Russia and shared high sequence identity with the H1N1 viruses that circulated prior to 1957 [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Due to this high degree of similarity and a lack of mutations that would indicate circulation in another host, the reemergence of these viruses has been attributed to an accidental release or failed vaccine trial [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In contrast to the previous influenza pandemics, the 1977 H1N1 viruses did not replace the circulating H3N2 viruses, and both the H3N2 and H1N1 viruses began to co-circulate in humans. When the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus emerged, this virus replaced the circulating H1N1 viruses, but again H3N2 viruses continued to circulate. With the exception of the 1977 H1N1 viruses, all pandemic viruses since 1918 have been reassortant viruses that derived the viral HA from avian (i.e., H2 and H3) or swine (i.e., 2009 H1N1) influenza viruses [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Humans, therefore, had little or no pre-existing immunity to these viruses, which allowed the viruses to spread rapidly in the population. In recent years, avian viruses of the H5, H7, H9, and H10 subtypes have caused zoonotic infections with H5 and H7 viruses often causing severe disease. As a result, there is significant concern that viruses from these subtypes could evolve and initiate the next pandemic.
