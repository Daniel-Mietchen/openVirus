<p>This year marks 100 years since the 1918 H1N1 “Spanish Influenza” pandemic. This was the most severe pandemic in modern history and is estimated to have infected 500 million people worldwide (one-third of the global population) [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, this analysis was controversial due to limited contemporary avian influenza gene sequences and conflicting phylogenic analyses [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Recent analysis using a host-specific molecular clock to evaluate the evolution of the 1918 H1N1 virus strongly indicates that the polymerase basic 2 (PB2), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase acidic (PA), nucleoprotein (NP), neuraminidase (NA), matrix (M), and non-structural (NS) gene segments were derived directly from an avian host, while the H1 hemagglutinin (HA) may have been contributed via reassortment with a human virus that emerged between 1915 and 1917 [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-10-00461" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, while more recent influenza pandemics emerged via reassortment of multiple gene segments, the 1918 H1N1 virus is unique as most of the genes were derived directly from an avian influenza virus. Moreover, as all subsequent pandemic influenza viruses have contained gene segments derived from the 1918 H1N1 virus, this virus has earned the designation as the “mother” of all pandemics [
