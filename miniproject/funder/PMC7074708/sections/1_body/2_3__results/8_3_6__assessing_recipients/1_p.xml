<p>Incorrectly inferred transmission relationships were seen in 12/36 patients. Of these, 5/12 were predicted to be infected by another sampled patient. The sequences of these 5/12 patients were placed in closer vicinity with the other sampled patients than the actual source, leading to the incorrectly inferred relationship. Thus, using BEAST2 ML estimates of genetic similarity failed to recapitulate transmission 5/36 times. Seven out of twelve were predicted to be infected by an unsampled patient instead of the actual source. For these 7/12 patients, the within-host process modelled by TransPhylo incorrectly assumed the presence of an unsampled patient. Thus, using a simple model of coalescent evolution failed to recapitulate transmission 7 out of 36 times.</p>
