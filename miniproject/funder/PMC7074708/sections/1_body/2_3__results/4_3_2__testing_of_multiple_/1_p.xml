<p>After extensive testing of multiple parameters, a set of “Adjusted” parameters were obtained (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-08-00196">Supplementary Tables S2 and S3</xref>). These parameters were selected based on their mean accuracy and 95% confidence interval. The adjusted BEAST2 parameters predicted on average that 27 more patients were infected after 1989 than the default parameters in conjunction with adjusted TransPhylo parameters (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-00196-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This was considered more clinically realistic than the default, as all 87 patients with known infection ranges bounded by LN and FP could only have been infected in or after 1992. The default BEAST2 and TransPhylo parameters therefore did not realistically model the transmission dynamics of the local HIV epidemic and did not predict transmission relationships and infection dates accurately (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-00196-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). We therefore designed the second set of parameters (“Adjusted”) to better reflect the SAC epidemic conditions, as well as HIV genetics. Many of these choices centered on changing the default models for priors to better reflect known properties of the HIV epidemic, such as within-patient evolution. For example, assuming coalescent evolution with a strict molecular clock rate would likely not be an accurate model of HIV within-host evolution, so a relaxed clock model instead of sampling from a log-normal distribution was used. The relaxed model allowed each branch to have its own mutation rate, while the log-normal distribution allowed for most HIV populations (i.e., infections) to diverge from the founder strain at a median rate, and a few to mutate extremely quickly. All BEAST2 and TransPhylo parameters that differ between the Default and Adjusted parameter sets are detailed in
