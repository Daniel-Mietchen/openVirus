<p>We used the Recipients and Donor patients, and the LN and FN data as the benchmark (“gold standard”) for assessing the inference accuracy of each parameter combination. The replicate with the largest number of accurately recovered transmission relationships, 17.48/36 on average, was generated using MUSCLE, adjusted BEAST2 parameters, and adjusted TransPhylo parameters (

 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-00196-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Despite the many inaccuracies with regards to transmission inference, the default TransPhylo parameters provided more accurate inferences of infection date. The adjusted parameters demonstrated a tendency to predict infection dates that were older than the patient’s LN. This showed that in choosing TransPhylo parameters, there was a trade-off between transmission relationship and infection date inference accuracy.
