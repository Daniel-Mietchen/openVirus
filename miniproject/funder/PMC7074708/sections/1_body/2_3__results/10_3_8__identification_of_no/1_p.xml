<p>During our analyses, several novel and unknown transmission clusters were predicted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00196-f004">Figure 4</xref>). The tree branches involved in each cluster are indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00196-f003">Figure 3</xref>. They ranged in size from 3 to 12 people. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00196-f004">Figure 4</xref>A,B depicts clusters of sampled patients already in known transmission relationships (Recipients and Donors), whereas 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00196-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D is largely composed of novel inferences (Recipients-3). The 12-patient cluster was predicted to span 16 years of infection history (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00196-f004">Figure 4</xref>D). When we looked back at the data captured in the clinic database for these patients, there are actually public health contact and blood transfusion trace back indicators that would support that these are likely credible transmission relationships. However, further in depth trace back analysis will be required that falls beyond our ethics approval. There were numerous instances of sampled patients infecting unsampled patients, especially earlier than 1989, when the SAC started operation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00196-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D). These unsampled patients were predicted by the model to have been the source of HIV for sampled patients in later years.
