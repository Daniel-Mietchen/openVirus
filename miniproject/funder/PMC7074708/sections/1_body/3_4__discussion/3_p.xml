<p>In the absence of even more precise “gold standard” datasets such as the one used in this study, P2P transmission is generally difficult to verify. Thus, we have developed summary statistics that can be used to prioritize transmission trees for further analysis based on their agreement with verifiable transmission event information based on clinical and patient reporting within the affected populations. Though these are not direct indicators of accurately inferred transmission relationships and infection dates, they are useful in identifying the parameter combinations that best describe the underlying transmission dynamics of the population of interest.</p>
