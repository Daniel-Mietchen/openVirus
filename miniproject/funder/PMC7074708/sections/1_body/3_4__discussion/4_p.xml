<p>The closer the summary statistics are to clinical predictions of the PLWH population, the better the parameter combination was at recovering accurate transmission relationships, at the expense of predicting a larger proportion of false positives (

 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-00196-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) was much larger than the number of known sampled-to-sampled transmissions (
 <italic>n</italic> = 36). The difference between the estimated and actual numbers consisted of infection relationships between the right patient pair but in the wrong direction (for example, predicting (b) → (a) transmission in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-08-00196-f002">Figure 2</xref>, with the actual relationship being (a) → (b), but also included novel transmission predictions between patients (for example, (a) → unsampled patient). The more unsampled patients predicted in the tree, the better the parameter combination was at predicting infection dates that fell in viable infection ranges, but simultaneously, worse at predicting P2P transmissions. The estimated ratio of multiple-to-single secondary patients was also calculated to determine how well TransPhylo captured the relative risk of being infected by PLWH engaging in high-risk behaviour, resulting in multiple secondary infections [

 <xref rid="B41-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The ratio was significantly higher with adjusted BEAST2 parameters than the default. There was a relative increase in the number of multiple-secondary-case patients when the adjusted TransPhylo parameters are applied. Since transmission trees predict not only P2P relationships but the directionality of entire novel transmission clusters, the epidemiological properties of especially high-risk groups can be described. Parallel efforts involving simulated epidemics indicate that implementation of prevention strategies targeted at high-risk groups reduce the rate of cluster growth [

From a public health standpoint, an ability to characterize the epidemic at a person-to-person level would help determine if the epidemic is being driven by a small number of individuals with repetitive high-risk behaviour or by a larger population with lower frequency risk events. Such information would help target public health interventions and policies. However, this does raise both an ethical and potential legal concern, with regard to identifying directionality of transmission. Utmost care needs be taken and the data needs to be anonymized so only risk groups can be identified and not specific individuals. This approach can give insight and better estimates of numbers of infected individuals not in care out in the community, which helps to inform overarching public health interventions (i.e., testing, prevention and educational programs), while avoiding marginalizing any of the risk groups identified through these types of analyses.
