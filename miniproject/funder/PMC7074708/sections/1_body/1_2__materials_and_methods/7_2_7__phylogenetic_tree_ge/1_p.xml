<p>Generation of rooted, maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees from the HIV sequences was accomplished using the program BEAST2 [

 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Along with the shape of the tree and the date of the most recent common ancestral sequence of the input sequences, the underlying evolutionary model of the tree was inferred by the Bayesian analysis. Tips were dated with sampling dates provided by SAC. All further transmission inference analysis was conducted on the single ML tree from each run of BEAST2. Two combinations of BEAST2 parameters were used to generate ML phylogenetic trees. The first (“Default”) consisted of the default parameters that would be used for a coalescent population with constant size. The second (“Adjusted”) set of parameters was based on the Bayesian birth–death skyline model, which allows the tree parameters to vary through time in a piecewise fashion (
