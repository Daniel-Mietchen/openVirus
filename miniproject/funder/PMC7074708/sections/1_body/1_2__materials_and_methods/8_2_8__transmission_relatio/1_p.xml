<p>Transmission trees were generated using TransPhylo, a Bayesian program that uses the structure of phylogenetic trees to infer the presence and date of person-to-person transmission relationships as well as the underlying epidemiological parameters [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. TransPhylo allows for the presence unsampled patients and can assign these unsampled patients in the tree. Sampled patients refer to the 139 patients in the SAC “gold standard dataset”. Unsampled patients refer to any patients not included in the dataset (e.g., they would represent PLWH not in clinical care at the clinic). Both TransPhylo default parameters and adjusted parameters were used to conduct transmission relationship and infection date inferences (detailed in
