<p>Alignment was accomplished with either a purely distance-based aligner, MUSCLE, or a codon-aware aligner in conjunction with a curated database of homologs, HIVAlign [
 <xref rid="B43-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B44-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Upon inspection of the output alignments, few indel gaps were observed and the sequences were largely uniform in length. Any differences in length were due to differing coverage during PCR amplification and sequencing approaches.
