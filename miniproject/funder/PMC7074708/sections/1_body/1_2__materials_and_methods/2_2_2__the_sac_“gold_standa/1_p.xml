<p>The Southern Alberta HIV Clinic (SAC) (Calgary, Alberta, Canada) is relatively geographically isolated and is the single point-of-care clinic for PLWH in Southern Alberta, Canada. This has allowed for comprehensive and longitudinal epidemiologic data to be collected on close to 5000 PLWH since 1989, comprising three decades of data. Currently, 1800 PLWH are active at the clinic. The dataset used in this study was composed of patient HIV sequences and clinical information curated by the SAC database to characterize a sample of the local infection dynamics.</p>
