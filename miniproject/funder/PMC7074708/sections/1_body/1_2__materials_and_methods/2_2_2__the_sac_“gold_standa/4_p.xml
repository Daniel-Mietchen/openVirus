<p>Nucleotide positions associated with drug responses were not removed from the Sanger consensus sequences prior to analysis. However, there is reason to expect that these sequences, though obtained from GART procedures, are largely naive to antiretroviral therapy (ART)-based selection. Prior to 2008, GART was only administered to patients failing ART and pregnant women according to International AIDS Society guidelines. 25/139 (18.0%) of the included patient records had a first-positive HIV test result prior to 2008. As such, the consensus HIV sequence associated with their oldest GART test would have been obtained at treatment failure, significantly later than their date of infection. Although this was not investigated, these reverse transcriptase sequences from these patients may contain resistance mutations since they were obtained at the point of clinical treatment failure [

If any of the 25/139 patients took the same ART drugs, their within-host HIV populations would have been exposed to the same selection pressure, and their consensus sequences would have been similar not due to transmission proximity but convergent evolution [
 <xref rid="B41-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In total, however, the HIV sequences associated with 82% of all patients would have been obtained prior to start of ART, so no overt selection pressure due to ART is present for the majority of cases.
