<p>Since some of the patients in our cohort were on cART prior to receiving the GART for Sanger sequencing, convergent evolution from similar selective pressures is a concern for 25/139 of the patients [
 <xref rid="B40-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Differences in immune selection based on differences in HLA type amongst patients could potentially be a source of convergent evolution as well [
 <xref rid="B42-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, the proportion of accurately reconstructed relationships indicates that there are enough patient-lineage-specific mutations that P2P relationships can be identified, without ART or HLA being a confounding factor.
