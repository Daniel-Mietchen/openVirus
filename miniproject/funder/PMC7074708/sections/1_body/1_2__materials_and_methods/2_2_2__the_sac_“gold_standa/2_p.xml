<p>HIV sequences (HIV polymerase (
 <italic>pol</italic>) region) from 139 PLWH collected as part of routine genotypic antiretroviral drug resistance testing (GART) were used for this study. The patients were selected to model a realistic epidemic, which consist of a mix of clinically reported transmission relationships and infections of unknown origin (detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-08-00196">Supplementary Data and Table S1</xref>). There were 65 patients selected for which we had thorough clinically reported or confirmed transmission relationships (e.g., known spouse/sexual contact of PLWH or a child of a PLWH). The remainder of the patients were chosen at random from the SAC Database. All clinical patient data has been de-identified. All data is presented as grouped data and analyses cannot be linked back to any individual. The study design, scope of the analyses presented, and the use of this non-nominal data has been approved by the University of Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board (Ethics ID REB18-2035, original approval 18 December 2018, renewed 18 December 2019).
