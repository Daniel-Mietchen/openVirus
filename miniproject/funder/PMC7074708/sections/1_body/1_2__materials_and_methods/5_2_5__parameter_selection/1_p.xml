<p>In the selection of the most suitable parameters, the analysis was first conducted using the default BEAST2 and TransPhylo parameters. From the data obtained from these initial parameters, a baseline set of improved, ‘Adjusted’ parameters were determined. The adjusted parameters were designed to better simulate the HIV progression, infection rate and within host evolution in PLWH. The adjusted parameters also took into account the effect of cART and the sampling rates at the SAC (the underlying a priori distribution and assumptions are detailed in
