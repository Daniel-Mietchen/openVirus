<p>The properties of a transmission tree were distilled into a set of seven summary statistics describing the study population. Each value in 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-00196-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> is the average from transmission trees generated by four independent runs of TransPhylo using each of the parameter combinations (detailed in 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-00196-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These were designed to be compared to known information about the population to prioritize trees likely to contain accurate P2P transmission inferences in cases where gold-standard associations between sequences and P2P transmissions are not available (detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-08-00196">Supplementary Data and Table S1</xref>).
