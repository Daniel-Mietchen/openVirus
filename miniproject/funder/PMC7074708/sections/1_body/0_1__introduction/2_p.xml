<p>Assessing if the infection dynamics in a population is driven by a small number of individuals with repetitive high-risk behaviour or by a larger population with lower frequency risk events allows for the implementation of better-targeted public health interventions and policies. This could be done at a population level without necessarily having to identify specific individuals, thereby minimizing concerns around privacy and marginalization. To provide evidence-based prevention approaches, we need tools that predict P2P transmissions from readily available data. Using HIV sequence data, transmission relationships can be computationally inferred through phylogenetic methods, which compare the genetic similarity of viral sequences to determine the connectivity of HIV transmission in a population [
