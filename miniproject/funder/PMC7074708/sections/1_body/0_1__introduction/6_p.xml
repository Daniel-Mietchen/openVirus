<p>Our work shows that using the low resolution consensus sequence data obtained through Sanger sequencing, combined with optimized TransPhylo settings allowed for a good approximation of person-to-person transmissions and novel transmission clusters. We also defined a set of summary statistics based on tree topology that will prioritize candidate transmission trees with the most accurate inferences for analyses where clinical corroboration may be difficult. This pipeline can be easily used and allows one to get valuable insights into the transmission dynamics of a geographically defined epidemic, in clinical settings where next-generation sequencing technologies are not readily available or impractical.</p>
