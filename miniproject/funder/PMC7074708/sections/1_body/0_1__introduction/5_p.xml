<p>We describe the development and evaluation of a phylogeny-based analysis pipeline to infer transmission relationships and infection data using routinely collected and easily accessible patient HIV consensus sequences at the Southern Alberta Clinic (SAC). The pipeline consists of rooted phylogenetic tree generation by BEAST2 [

 <xref rid="B33-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and transmission analysis using TransPhylo [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], compared to thoroughly corroborated clinical infection transmission data. TransPhylo has been previously designed for outbreaks of slowly evolving pathogens such as 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) [
 <xref rid="B34-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. HIVâ€™s intrinsic rate of mutation is much higher than MTB. However, extensive use of suppressive cART in a population slows the rate of viral evolution, which makes the TransPhylo algorithm suited for analysis of HIV transmission networks with minor modifications [
