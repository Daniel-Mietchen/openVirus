<p>At present there are various tools available for HIV transmission analysis, and examples are HIV-TRACE [

 <xref rid="B29-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These particular tools are capable of identifying clusters of the viral infection in a cohort but do not provide the direction of infection or the link between direct infection of patients or indirect infection of patients through other (unsampled) individuals situated between source and recipients [

 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, the prediction of HIV transmission clusters using Sanger sequencing requires an individualâ€™s entire viral population to be represented by a single HIV-1 consensus sequence. Due to the lower resolution of Sanger sequences, the genetic differences between the HIV populations of two patients cannot be used to resolve the direction of transmission. Therefore, transmission analysis tools require the date of viral infection, which is typically difficult to pin-point [
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-08-00196" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The objective of the current work was to develop a pipeline that is able to overcome both shortcomings by predicting its own transmission dates as well as predicting unsampled patients to get a better view of the infection dynamics in a particular population.
