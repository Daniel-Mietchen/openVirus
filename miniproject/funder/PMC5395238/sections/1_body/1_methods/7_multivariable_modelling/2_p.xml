<p>Subsequently, a multivariable model containing the minimal number of explanatory variables was developed by backward elimination regression modelling. Variables that were the least strongly associated with the outcome (based on the largest p-value in the likelihood ratio test) were eliminated from the model in an iterative process until reaching a model containing only variables associated with the outcome (based on likelihood ratio test). For each epidemic, validation of the model was performed by comparing observed and predicted incidence rates and analyzing the residuals (see Supporting Information).</p>
