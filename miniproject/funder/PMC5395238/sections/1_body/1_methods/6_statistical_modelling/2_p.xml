 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. The majority of variables were more closely associated with dengue incidence rates once categorized into quintiles rather than as continuous variables (based on likelihood ratio test). Most variables in quintiles did not show departure from linearity (based on the departure from linearity test). Therefore, to maintain consistency across variables and comparability between the two epidemics, all explanatory variables were categorized into ordered quintiles for analysis as described in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005471.s007">S2 Table</xref>. Associations of dengue incidence with explanatory variables were reported as incidence rate ratios (IRR), which describe the relative increase or decrease in incidence rate when the explanatory variable increases from one quintile to the next. Statistical analysis was performed using R 3.2.0 [
