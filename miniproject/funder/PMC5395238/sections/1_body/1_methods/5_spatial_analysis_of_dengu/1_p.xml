<p>Choropleth maps representing the incidence rate of dengue in each neighborhood relative to the average incidence rate throughout the entire city were generated using QGIS 2.10 (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qgis.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.qgis.org</ext-link>). The presence of spatial autocorrelation of dengue incidence rates throughout the neighborhoods was assessed using the global Moran’s 
 <italic>I</italic> statistic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Clusters of neighborhoods of high or low incidence were identified using the local Moran’s 
 <italic>I</italic> statistic, a local indicator of spatial association (LISA) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Both local and global Moran’s 
 <italic>I</italic> were computed using a weighing matrix based on a Euclidian distance of 4km using the software GeoDa 1.6.7 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].
