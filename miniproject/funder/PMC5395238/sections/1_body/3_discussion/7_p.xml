<p>The spatial pattern of dengue incidence differed markedly between the two epidemics: with a north-south gradient in incidence rates for 2008–2009 and widely homogenous incidence rates for 2012–2013, perhaps explaining why associations with socioeconomic factors differed between the two epidemics. The 2008–2009 epidemic was unusual because it was characterized by the prolonged co-circulation of two serotypes: first DENV1, which had been circulating in the Pacific Islands for years, replaced later by DENV4, which had not been reported in the Pacific for over 20 years but caused most of the cases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The difference in circulating serotypes may contribute to the observed differences in spatial structure between both epidemics, as it has been previously suggested that dengue clustering patterns within a city are serotype-dependent [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition, DENV1 had been circulating regularly in the Pacific region and in New Caledonia while DENV4 re-emerged in 2008–2009 after decades of absence. Therefore, the pre-epidemic immunological status of the population was certainly different for DENV1 and for DENV4 (population immunity to DENV4 was probably lower than for DENV1), which is likely to have influenced the spatial distribution of dengue cases, and possibly blurred association with socioeconomic factors during the 2012–13 epidemic.
