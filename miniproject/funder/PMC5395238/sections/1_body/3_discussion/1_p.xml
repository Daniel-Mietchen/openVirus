<p>We performed an ecological study to investigate the association between dengue incidence during two major dengue epidemics (2008–2009 and 2012–2013) and various socioeconomic and environmental factors in Nouméa. The 2008–2009 epidemic featured a more pronounced geographic variation in dengue incidence across the city, with high incidence neighborhoods in the north, and low incidence neighborhoods in the south. In contrast, the 2012–2013 epidemic was more homogenously distributed throughout the city. We found that incidence rates were associated with socioeconomic and environmental factors during both epidemics.</p>
