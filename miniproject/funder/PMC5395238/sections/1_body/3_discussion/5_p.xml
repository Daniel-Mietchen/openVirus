<p>While vegetation coverage was positively associated with dengue in 2008–09 using the neighborhood as aggregation unit, it was associated with lower incidence at the finer “block of house” aggregation scale. This is an example of the “modifiable area unit problem” [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.ref075" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], which suggests that analyzing the same data using another size and/or shape of the aggregation units can generate different results. Perhaps due to the limited flight range of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (usually remaining within a 400m radius circle during their lifetime [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.ref076" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]), association with vegetation coverages is different at this smaller aggregation unit. Alternatively, it could be due to the use of different databases (25% missing cases at the “block of house scale”).
