<p>Variables related to the built and natural environment (proportion of apartments in all lodgings, proportion of old houses, proportion of cement lodgings, vegetation coverage) were also associated with dengue incidence, but the factors associated were not always the same during both epidemics and across all models. This suggests that environmental factors may not correlate with dengue incidence as consistently as socioeconomic status. Nevertheless, a higher proportion of apartments in all lodgings was associated with lower dengue incidence during both epidemics, and in all models but one. One can speculate that reduced garden space in apartment complexes results in fewer breeding sites and mosquitoes [

Perhaps older houses lack equipment such as air-tight windows, and air conditioning, which all reduce the number of mosquitoes found inside the house, as suggested previously [
