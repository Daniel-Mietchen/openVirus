 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. From September 2008 to August 2009, New Caledonia suffered an epidemic with 8,586 reported dengue cases [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], initially caused by dengue serotype 1 (DENV1), until dengue serotype 4 (DENV4) started to co-circulate, causing the majority of reported cases [
