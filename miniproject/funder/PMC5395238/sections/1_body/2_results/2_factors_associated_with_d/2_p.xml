 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005471.s005">S4 Fig</xref>. The 2008–2009 multivariable model closely described the dengue incidence rates, including their spatial structure. The regression coefficient between the observed and predicted incidence rates was 0.73 (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, 95% CI: 0.57–0.89). For the 2012–2013 epidemic, our model reliably associated some variables with dengue incidence, but failed to fully describe the variation of incidence rate across the different neighborhoods. The regression coefficient between the observed and predicted incidence rates was only 0.33 (
 <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, 95% CI: 0.16–0.51). Moreover, for 2012–2013, residuals were positively correlated with incidence rates, suggesting that some important explicative variable may be missing.
