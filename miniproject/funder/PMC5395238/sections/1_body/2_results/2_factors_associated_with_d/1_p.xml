<p>Univariable regression analysis identified 13 variables associated (
 <italic>p</italic>≤0.05) with dengue incidence rates during the 2008–2009 epidemic and 6 variables associated during the 2012–2013 epidemic (
 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The results of the multivariable analysis are presented in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0005471.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. In 2008–2009, dengue incidence rates were higher in neighborhoods with higher unemployment (IRR = 1.25, 95%CI: 1.14–1.36), higher vegetation coverage (IRR = 1.14, 95%CI: 1.04–1.24), higher percentage of old houses (IRR = 1.12, 95%CI: 1.03–1.21), and lower percentage of apartments (IRR = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.84–0.98). For 2012–2013, higher dengue incidence rates were associated with lower revenue (IRR = 0.88, 95%CI: 0.82–0.95), lower percentage of apartments (IRR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84–0.97) and higher percentage of cement lodgings (IRR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04–1.21). The distribution of these variables throughout the neighborhoods of Nouméa is represented in
