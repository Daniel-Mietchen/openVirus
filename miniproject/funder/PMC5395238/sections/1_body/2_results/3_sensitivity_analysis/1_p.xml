<p>The model resulting from backward elimination modelling using variables categorized in terciles is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005471.s009">S4 Table</xref>. For 2008–2009, the sensitivity analysis confirmed the association between vegetation coverage and unemployment, but percentage of old houses and percentage of apartments were not present in the final model. For 2012–2013, median revenue, percentage of apartments and percentage of cement lodgings were all associated with dengue incidence rates, similarly to the model using variables in quintiles. For both epidemics, the original model using variables categorized in quintiles had a better fit (lower AIC) compared to the model using variables categorized in terciles.
