<p>Neighborhood-specific incidence rates ranged from 7.2 to 70.9 (cases/1000 P-Y) in 2008–2009 and from 6.4 to 60.6 in 2012–2013 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0005471.s006">S1 Table</xref>). The relative incidence rates in each neighborhood (compared to the incidence throughout the entire city) seemed to follow a north-south gradient during 2008–2009 epidemic, but were distributed more homogeneously throughout the city during the 2012–2013 epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005471.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This was confirmed by the presence of spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of the relative dengue incidence rates in 2008–2009 (global Moran’s I of 0.336, p&lt;0.001, 95%CI: 0.183–0.489), but not in 2012–2013 (global Moran’s I of 0.036, p = 0.416, 95% CI: -0.053–0.125).
