  <title>Dengue incidence rates for each quintile of the variables associated with the 2008–09 (left) and 2012–13 (right) epidemics.</title>
  <p>Each boxplot represents the first, second and third quartiles of incidence rates across neighborhoods in the quintile of the explanatory variable, whiskers represent 1.5 of the inter-quartile range, empty dots are outliers (neighborhoods with incidence rates outside the inter-quartile range), filled triangle is the mean incidence rate across all neighborhoods in the quintile.</p>
