  <title>Relative dengue incidence rate in the neighborhoods of Nouméa during the 2008–2009 and 2012–2013 epidemics.</title>
  <p>The relative incidence rate was obtained by dividing the incidence rate in each neighborhood by the average incidence rate in the whole city. Shades of green indicate an incidence lower than average, shades of red indicate an incidence higher than average (see color scale).</p>
