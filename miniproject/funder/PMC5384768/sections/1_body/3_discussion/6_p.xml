<p>The spread of dengue usually occurs in centrifugal waves as a pattern of expansion [

Until December 2012, an intense transmission was practically restricted to the areas of the clusters 1 and 3. However, in January 2013, dengue dispersed to different areas with notable intensity in other low-income clusters. After April 2013, areas surrounding low-income clusters presented increased incidence, possibly influenced by their proximity to these places. The isolation of cluster 6, which is surrounded by the airport and the industrial park, seems to contribute to a distinct pattern of dengue occurrence across the time within its territory, without suffering influences of other populations. The relative isolation of the cluster 11 from other clusters seem to contribute to the delayed incidence increment. Therefore, living in high-income areas seems to contribute to a late increase in dengue incidence.
