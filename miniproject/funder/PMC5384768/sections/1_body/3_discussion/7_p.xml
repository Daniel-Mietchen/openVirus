<p>This study presents limitations inherent to its ecological approach, since the analyses are not based on individual, but aggregated data. In addition, the study utilized secondary data collected for surveillance purposes, thus absence of data on patient addresses resulted in the exclusion of 2.8% of the sampled population (n = 536). Dengue is a disease with mandatory reporting. However, due to its nonspecific signs and symptoms, dengue could be confounded with other diseases. This may lead to both over- and underreporting, depending on the degree of alertness towards dengue in the attending health care worker. In addition, dengue presents a high proportion of asymptomatic or subclinical cases, precluding the capture of the real number of incident infections, restricting the sample size to cases that sought treatment in health services. The study included also cases that were not confirmed by laboratory tests, thus, the presence of erroneous diagnoses of dengue could have occurred. Therefore, the inclusion of other DENV serotypes (1, 2 and 3) or other viral infections, including those transmitted by

 <italic>aegypti</italic> with dengue-like symptoms, could have occurred, despite the fact that the first identifications for example of Chikungunya virus and Zika virus in the city are dated from 2015. The use of MMQGIS for geocoding implies a certain degree of imprecision higher than when using GPS equipment, since the geocode by MMQGIS depends on algorithms and matching with the database of Google Maps â„¢ API, which can vary in quality across locations. Nevertheless, all geocoded points were checked individually in order to minimize non-matches. Among them, 99.5% were geocoded in street level and 0.5% in district level.
