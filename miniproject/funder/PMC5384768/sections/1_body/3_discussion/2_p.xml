<p>In these clusters with lower TTI, the limited increase in incidence over the time possibly occurred due to the depletion of susceptible individuals, since four of these clusters (clusters 1, 2, 4, and 5) remained with a medium potential for dengue transmission according to the HI in March 2013. It corroborates the observations of Medronho [

 <xref rid="pone.0175432.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], in whose opinion the modulation of the epidemic process has been occurring in Brazil due to the immunity of the population and not due to vector control programs. Residents of clusters with lower TTI presented lower income than those living in clusters with higher TTI. Generally, low-income areas present poor infrastructure with a deficient garbage collection and poor provision of tap water, which in turn lead to water storage for human consumption in barrels and other recipients, contributing to the presence of breeding sites. These types of water storages were found in 12.5% of breeding sites in cluster 2, 28.6% - 60% in cluster 3 and 35.7% in cluster 5, in October 2012.
