<p>Despite the income and RR contrast, the HI difference between clusters with lower and higher TTI was not significant in any period. It was not possible to conclude whether the sampling for HI calculation affected the results, for example by not describing adequately the entomological scenario in areas with lower TTI. It has to be noted that HI has previously been reported to be an inaccurate measurement of mosquito procreation and an imprecise indicator of potential of dengue transmission [
