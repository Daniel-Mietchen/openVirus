<p>The study has a circumstantial advantage since the immune status of the population regarding DENV-4 protection did not influence the dengue distribution in the beginning of the epidemic, considering that the circulation of DENV-4 was unprecedented in the territory. The results also indicate areas to be prioritized in future preventive actions in urban areas facing introduction of a new DENV serotype. The use of geographic information systems should be encouraged in dengue surveillance, since knowledge on the distribution of cases at different time points not only favors immediate actions but also helps to predict spatial distribution of cases, since the dispersion is partially influenced by the immunity of local population and by the proximity to hotspots [
 <xref rid="pone.0175432.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In a city with an unprecedented circulation of a certain DENV serotype and, consequently, a highly susceptible population, low-income areas seem to be more prone to suffer from intense transmission of dengue. Therefore, the identification of a new serotype in a city requires preventive actions prioritized in these areas. Thus, successful preventive actions could minimize dengue spread in low-income areas and its adjacencies, and decrease the magnitude of dengue dispersion.
