<p>Clusters with higher TTI presented an HI increment from October 2012 to March 2013, although not significantly different from the clusters with lower TTI. Nevertheless, according to HI in March 2013, three clusters with higher TTI presented a high potential for dengue transmission (clusters 7, 8 and 9), and three presented medium potential (clusters 6, 10 and 11). Probably, a higher density of vectors in this period contributed to an increasing incidence. Interestingly, populations living in clusters with higher TTI presented, overall, low RR for acquiring dengue infection despite the elevated HI. The PD in these clusters was not significantly different from clusters with lower TTI. Possibly, the poor housing conditions in low-income areas increase the contact of the population with the vector, and consequently the dengue transmission.</p>
