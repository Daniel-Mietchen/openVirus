<p>The present study assessed the dispersion of dengue after the first introduction of DENV-4 in the highly susceptible population of Vit√≥ria, Brazil. Furthermore, the study evaluated the influence of factors, such as HI, PD, and income, in the dispersion pattern of the disease. The epidemic was more intense during the warm and rainy season, from January 2013 to March 2013, similar to the dengue seasonal pattern in previous years. During this epidemic, clusters with lower TTI presented a higher RR for dengue acquisition than clusters with higher TTI. In clusters with lower TTI, the incidence was explosive in the beginning of the epidemic and did not suffer a high increase over the time compared to clusters with higher TTI.</p>
