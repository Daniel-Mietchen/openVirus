<p>Dengue is endemic in approximately 120 countries located in tropical and subtropical areas [

 <italic>Dengue virus</italic> (DENV) presents four serotypes that are antigenically distinct. Therefore, an infection by a certain serotype does not confer lifelong immune protection against the other serotypes [
 <xref rid="pone.0175432.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A recent study also presented cases with reinfection by the same serotype, opposing the previous idea of lifelong protection to homotypic reinfection [
 <xref rid="pone.0175432.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The immunity profile of a given population affects partially the magnitude of dengue occurrence, thus allowing explosive epidemics when a new serotype is introduced in a naive and therefore highly susceptible population. The epidemics weaken in the course of time due to the depletion of the susceptible population [
