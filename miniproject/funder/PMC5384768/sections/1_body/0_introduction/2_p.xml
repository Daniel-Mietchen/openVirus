<p>The presence of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito, the vector of dengue, also influences the transmission intensity and is related to climatic conditions and to the availability of breeding sites constituted by stagnant water. Breeding site formation is favored by the lack of basic sanitation, garbage collection, water supply, and inadequate water storage [
