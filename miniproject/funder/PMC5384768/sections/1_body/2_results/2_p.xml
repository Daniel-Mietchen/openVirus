 <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.01). The TTI in Vit√≥ria as a whole was 635.85%. Five clusters presented a lower TTI than the overall study population (clusters 1 to 5), varying from 42.91% (cluster 1) to 356.62% (cluster 5). In clusters with lower TTI, the RR ranged from 1.26 (cluster 3) to 3.05 (cluster 4). The HI in October 2012 varied from 0.7 (cluster 4) to 3.0 (clusters 2 and 5), and in March 2013 the HI varied from 0.9 (cluster 3) to 3.0 (cluster 5). Clusters 2 and 3 presented a reduction in the HI from October 2012 to March 2013, the HI remained similar in cluster 5, and the HI increased over time in clusters 1 and 4 (
