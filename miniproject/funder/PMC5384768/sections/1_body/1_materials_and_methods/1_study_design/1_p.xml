<p>An analysis of spatial variation in temporal trend was performed to detect clusters. The study comprised 18,861 cases of dengue detected in public and private health services and reported to the Health Department of Vitória, from September 2012 to June 2013. The cases were confirmed by laboratory (n = 3,801; 20.2%) or clinical-epidemiological criteria (n = 15,060; 79.8%). Determination of the serotype was possible in 74 cases (0.4%), and all were caused by DENV-4. This period of ten months was selected in order to comprise the immediate epidemic after the first detection of DENV-4 in Vitória, in April 2012. An ecological study was applied to evaluate factors associated with dengue dispersion.</p>
