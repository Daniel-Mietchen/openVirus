<p>Dengue case corresponds to a patient with acute febrile illness lasting up to seven days, accompanied by at least two of the following signs or symptoms: headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, prostration, malaise or rash associated or not with bleedings or hemorrhages, confirmed by laboratory or clinical-epidemiological criteria [
 <xref rid="pone.0175432.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A cluster is defined as a spatial conglomerate of dengue cases, where the time trend increase (TTI) inside is different from the TTI outside [
 <xref rid="pone.0175432.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. TTI is defined as the relative increase of dengue incidence inside and outside the cluster on the log-linear scale, being the percent increase constant over time [
 <xref rid="pone.0175432.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Location of the dengue case is defined as the address of residence as indicated by the patient in the report form. Districts are intra-urban subdivisions legally established by laws of the municipal assembly and sanctioned by the city mayor. Income is the monthly average remuneration per capita of inhabitants living in city districts, in Brazilian currency (Reais). PD is the total number of inhabitants living in a certain district, divided by the area of the district, in square kilometers (inhabitants/km
 <sup>2</sup>). HI is the number of buildings where larvae of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> could be identified, divided by the number of buildings evaluated, expressed as a percentage [

 <xref rid="pone.0175432.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. HI is a parameter to measure the presence of a vector population, and by extension, the potential for dengue transmission. HI evaluates the presence of larvae in buildings randomly selected. The sampling involved districts included in strata based on social and environmental similarities between them. The HI value of a district was considered the same value of the HI in the strata to which it belonged in the survey performed by the Center of Surveillance in Environmental Health of Vit√≥ria. The HI of a cluster is defined as the median of the HI of the districts that compose the cluster. An HI lower than 1% is considered to correspond to a low potential for dengue transmission, between 1% and 3.9% to a medium potential and higher than 3.9% to a high potential [
 <xref rid="pone.0175432.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The values of HI used in the study were those available for the period, corresponding to the months of October 2012 and March 2013.
