<p>Kernel method was applied to construct heat maps, using the exact location of the cases reported and configured with an area of 1 km of diameter in the software QGIS 2.8.2-Wien. The Kernel map was presented in order to illustrate the fluctuation of a total number of new cases reported in each individual area per month. It does not permit a comparison of the force of the infection between different clusters since the method does not consider differences in the base population. In order to provide the information of the force of the infection, the dengue incidence per month in each cluster was calculated in the software Microsoft Excel 2013 and displayed in a graph.</p>
