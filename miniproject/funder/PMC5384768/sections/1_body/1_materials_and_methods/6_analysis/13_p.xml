<p>The clusters were grouped into lower and higher TTI, considering the TTI of the overall study population as the cutoff. The use of this value (635.85) as a cutoff considers its proximity with the values of TTI outside all clusters, which ranged from 564.49 to 748.03. The closeness of these values occurs because the TTI outside the cluster considers almost the overall study population, only excluding the population inside the cluster. Therefore, the cutoff does not generate implications in the grouping of the clusters, even with the LLR analysis considering the TTI outside the cluster as a parameter to define a significant cluster. In the software R version 3.0.1 (

The level of significance has been set to 0.05.
