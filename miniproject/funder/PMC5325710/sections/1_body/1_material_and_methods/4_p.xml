<p>The plasma samples analyzed in this study were collected from April 2016 to May 2016 during the chikungunya outbreak in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Patients were assisted at the Hospital Rio Laranjeiras (HRL) where an infectious disease physician collected data on demographic characteristics, symptoms and physical signs using a structured questionnaire. Chikungunya suspected cases (n=91) were obtained during an active surveillance performed by the Laboratory of Viral Immunology, IOC/FIOCRUZ. All cases were submitted to the Real Time RT-PCR for CHIKV genome detection

Chikungunya infection was laboratorially confirmed by at least one diagnostic method in 76.97% (70/91) of the cases, 48.57 (34/70) by serology and 84.28 (59/70), by Real Time RT-PCR. Moreover, 35.85% (23/70) of the cases were confirmed by both methods. Chikungunya positive cases (n=10) by Real Time RT-PCR, were randomly selected for partial sequencing (E1 gene) and phylogenetic analysis. The epidemiological data and clinical manifestations from the confirmed cases sequenced in this study are available on
