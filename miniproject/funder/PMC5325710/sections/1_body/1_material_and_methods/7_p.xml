<p>The fragments generated were purified using PCR Purification Kit or Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Germany) and sequenced in both directions using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction version 3.1 kit (Applied Biosystems®, California, USA). The thermocycling conditions consisted of 40 cycles of denaturation (94°C/10 sec), annealing (50°C/5 sec) and extension (60°C/4 min). Sequencing was performed on an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer, Applied Biosystems®, California, USA 
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. The sequences analysis was performed using BioEdit (http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.htmL), sequences’ identity was performed using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and alignments using CLUSTAL OMEGA (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/). The data set was constructed with sequences previously deposited on GenBank and representative of each genotype and with sequences identified using BLAST. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the MEGA 6 (http://www.megasoftware.net/), by the "Neighbor-Joining" method and Maximum-Likelihood, Kimura-2 parameter model (K2), with a bootstrap of 1,000 replications. Both methods were used as confirmation of the results. The trees was built based on the analysis of the best fit for model, as provided by the software. Partial CHIKV genome sequences were deposited in GenBank and accession number were as follow: KX966400 to KX966409.
