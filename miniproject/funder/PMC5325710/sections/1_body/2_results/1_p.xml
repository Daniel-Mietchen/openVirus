<p>The molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of representative strains (n=10) of CHIKV detected in infected patients during the 2016 outbreak in Rio de Janeiro was performed in comparison to reference sequences available on Genbank and were used to represent the Asian, ECSA and West Africa genotypes. The results, based on a 375-basepair fragment, showed that all the analyzed strains grouped in the ECSA genotype branch, together with a sequence from a sample identified in Bahia in 2014 (
