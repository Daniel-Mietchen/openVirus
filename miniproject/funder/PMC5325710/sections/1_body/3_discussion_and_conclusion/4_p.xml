<p>From our knowledge, this is the first report on the ECSA genotype circulation during the 2016 outbreak in Rio de Janeiro. This genotype was first reported in Feira de Santana, Bahia, Northeast region of Brazil, during 2014 and studies revealed that the strains originated from Angola (West Africa). Moreover, it was the first time that this genotype was reported in Americas. The other CHIKV introduction in Brazil was from the Asian genotype in Oiapoque, Amap√°, North Brazil, also during 2014 and, studies revealed that those strains were originated from the Caribbean and South America

Additionally, the molecular characterization the E1 gene fragment analyzed showed that an alanine was present at the E226 position, therefore showing no A226V mutation. Studies performed during the 2005-2006 epidemic occurred in the Reunion Island characterized that this mutation was responsible for generating the IOL, responsible for an increased CHIKV transmission by the vector Ae. albopictus

The former substitution was not identified in the strains from Bahia, which has a Lysine (K) as in the reference strain (Angola/1962). Further studies are needed to clarify the consequences of those mutations, including to the mosquitoes fitness and the human immune system, but other studies suggest that new mutations such as L210Q, I211T and G60D in the E2 region of the IOL also offer advantages for the transmission of CHIKV by Ae. albopictus
