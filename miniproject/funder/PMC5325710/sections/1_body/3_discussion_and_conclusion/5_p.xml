<p>This study provides the first genotype surveillance of autochthonous CHIKV cases during the 2016 epidemic in Rio de Janeiro and stress the need for monitoring the spread of the distinct genotypes and the identification of possible mutations that may facilitate the viral transmission by the mosquitoes’ vectors. None of the chikungunya patients were hospitalized or had other complications related to classic rheumatologic chikungunya syndrome. Rio de Janeiro is an important port of entrance and spread of arboviruses, as observed for the distinct DENV serotypes. The recent events occurred in Rio de Janeiro also reinforces the need for viruses’ surveillance and characterization.</p>
