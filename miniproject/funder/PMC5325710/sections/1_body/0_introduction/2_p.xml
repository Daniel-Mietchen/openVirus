<p>CHIKV was first described in 1952 on the Makonde Plains, between Tanzania and Mozambique (East Africa), and since its Discovery, the virus has been responsible for important emerging and re-emerging epidemics in several tropical and temperate regions of the world 
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. Distinct CHIKV genotypes have been identified - West African, East-Central South African (ECSA) and Asian. Moreover, the Indian Ocean Lineage (IOL) has emerged in Kenya in 2004 as a descendant lineage of ECSA and caused several outbreaks in Indian Ocean Islands, India and Asia from 2005 to 2014

 <italic>aegypti </italic>mosquito has been highlighted as the main vector for the urban cycle of CHIKV, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> has also demonstrated a high vectorial competence for the v√≠rus transmission due to an A226V mutation in the E1 gene of ECSA genotype that generated the IOL and which promoted an increased infectivity in the midgut, dissemination to the salivary glands and transmission
