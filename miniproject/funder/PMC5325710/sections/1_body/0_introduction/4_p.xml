<p>The exponential growth of chikungunya cases in Rio de Janeiro represents a serious public health problem, especially due to the current co-circulation with dengue and zika. As both Asian and ECSA genotypes were introduced in Brazil in 2014, the viral surveillance is of great importance to access the impact over a population, as the role of distinct genotypes in the disease severity and chronicity are still not well understood. Moreover, the monitoring and characterization of CHIKV genotypes allow the identification of possible mutations such as the E1-A226V, of described epidemiological impact
