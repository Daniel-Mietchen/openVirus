<p>As with other MVD outbreaks in Central and Eastern Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], the initial case in this outbreak, KWN001, appears to have been linked to activities taking place within a cave harbouring 
 <italic>Rousettus</italic> bats that are a known reservoir of Marburg virus [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. KWN001 lived and worked in an area surrounded by cliffs within the Mt. Elgon Forest Reserve range, approximately 800m from a cave inhabited by these bats. It is possible that mining salt and collection of manure from the caves exposed KWN001 to excreta and/or other Marburg virus-contaminated material from these bats, and that this is the most probable initial source of virus exposure in this outbreak.
