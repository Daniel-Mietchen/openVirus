<p>The observed case-fatality rate (CFR) of 75% is higher than what has historically been reported in other parts of Uganda. Apart from outbreaks with single fatal cases [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], most outbreaks of MVD have reported CFRs of below 50% [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,

 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Only two outbreaks have reported a large number of cases; the first occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 1998 where 154 cases were recorded, and the second occurred in Angola in 2004 with 254 recorded cases. These outbreaks had CFRs of 83% and 90%, respectively [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although the CFR in the Kween outbreak is considered high, the rapid recognition of a MVD outbreak and epidemiological response could have resulted in the small number of cases. The high CFR seen in this outbreak might be attributed to the cases seeking healthcare late in the course of illness, at which point supportive care is typically less effective [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is also believed that the all four initially sought treatment from traditional healers, and only later sought care from local clinics, at which point their illness was more severe. Additionally, the high CFR in this outbreak may be attributed to other host factors such as immunological status at the time of infection and host genetic factors since all fatalities were in related family members. Further analysis into other factors, such as viral genetic attributes or route of transmission, contributing high CRF should be investigated.
