<p>Marburg Virus Disease (MVD) is a severe infectious disease caused by Marburg virus, a member of the 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic> family, which also includes Ebola viruses. Marburg virus was first recognized in 1967 when outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever occurred in laboratories located in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany and Belgrade, Yugoslavia (present-day Serbia) [

 <italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic> fruit bats or their faeces or contact with infected primates [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007257.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Human-to-human transmission occurs through direct contact with blood, body fluids, secretions and tissues of infected individuals or dead bodies. Marburg virus can be transmitted sexually and studies of Ebolavirus have shown that viral RNA can be detected in semen for up to 407 days [
