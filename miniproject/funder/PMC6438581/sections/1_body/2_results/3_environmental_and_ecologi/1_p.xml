<p>The bats inhabiting the caves visited in Kween district were identified as 
 <italic>Rousettus</italic> species. However, the ecological investigation team was unable to conclusively identify the bats as 
 <italic>R</italic>. 
 <italic>aegyptiacus</italic> since trapping of the bats was not performed. Gross visual and physical identification supports the 
 <italic>R</italic>. spp. identification. Additional ecological studies are needed to identify the species of 
 <italic>Rousettus</italic> observed 
 <italic>and</italic> confirm Marburg virus presence in the bat population inhabiting these caves (
