<p>The full genomic sequence of MARV (MBG201708608 and MBG201708609, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007257.g004">Fig 4</xref>, red) falls into a cluster that consists of MARV sequences isolated from humans and bats in Uganda between 2007–9 and 2014 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007257.g004">Fig 4</xref>, blue) but are distinct from Marburg virus sequences collected during a previous outbreak in Kabale, Uganda in 2012 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007257.g004">Fig 4</xref>, KC545387 and KC545388). The 2017 Marburg virus sequences share a recent common ancestor with other Marburg virus sequences collected from Uganda. These include a human MVD case detected in 2014 living in Kampala and Kasese districts (KP985768), a virus sequence collected from a miner who worked in the Kitaka mine in July 2007 (3,7) and from virus sequences obtained from bats that were collected from either Python Cave or the Kitaka mine during 2007–2009. The sequences from the 2017 cases were indistinguishable from each other, suggesting person-to-person transmission.
