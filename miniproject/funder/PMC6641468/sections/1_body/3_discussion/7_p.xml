<p>The study had some limitations as well. First, the cases of influenza presented in this study were reported from hospital-based sentinel surveillance sites, thus, missing out an unknown proportion of cases in the community who could not visit the facilities due to poor access or did not require hospital care due to mild symptoms or visited the private sector and other levels of health care. Second, the prediction models are generally used for short-term forecasts because the relative bias of prediction increases with time. This might be explained by antigenic drift of the influenza virus and many unknown factors that affect disease transmission. Third, we could only infer associations, but not causality, between influenza activity and various meteorological parameters. As a result, the associations we found may act only as proxies for factors not considered in this study.</p>
