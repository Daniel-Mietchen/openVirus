<p>The study has some significant strong points. First, the influenza surveillance data were part of a US-CDC supported laboratory based sentinel surveillance project in tertiary care hospitals across the country with high patient influx. Confirmation of diagnosis of influenza was done using real time RT-PCR which is the gold standard test. Second, five-year historical data (2008â€“17) on influenza surveillance in two major cities of the country allows a better understanding of the trend and accurate forecasting of the disease. The quality and consistency of the surveillance data is likely to produce meaningful predictions for policy decisions.</p>
