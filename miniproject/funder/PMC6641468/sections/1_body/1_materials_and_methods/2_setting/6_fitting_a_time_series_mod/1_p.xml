<p>We used exponential smoothing models to describe autocorrelations in the data and forecast influenza activity for the next 12 months [
 <xref rid="pone.0219376.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Expert modeler of SPSS version 21 was used to choose the best fitting model for the time series data. The Expert Modeler tries to identify the best-fitting ARIMA or exponential smoothing model, thus eliminating the need to identify an appropriate model through trial and error.Seasonal adjusted factor (SAF) was used to measure seasonal variation and identify the seasonal peak. The Ljung-Box Q test statistic was used to determine if the model fits well with the data.The autocorrelation function (ACF) plots of the residuals and Ljung-Box tests were used to determine if there is any autocorrelation in the residuals [
