<p>There are three mediating mechanisms that might help in explaining influenza activity and epidemics: 1) Contact rate, 2) Viral survival and 3) Host immunity [

It has been speculated that low indoor humidity, cool temperature and less solar radiations support viral activity, especially during the winter epidemics in the temperate zone. Recent evidence shows that rainy season favours viral survival and disease transmission in tropics [
