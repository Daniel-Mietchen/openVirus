<p>Pakistan is situated in South-East Asia with tropical to temperate climatic conditions and arid environment in the southern region. The country had a robust laboratory-based influenza sentinel surveillance system in eight sites from 2009â€“2016. This provided an opportunity to study the relationship between meteorological parameters (humidity, precipitation and temperature) and influenza activity in two major cities of Pakistan, Islamabad and Multan in the post 2011 pandemic period. We also sought to explore the seasonality of influenza activity and predict influenza peak based on historical surveillance time series data.</p>
