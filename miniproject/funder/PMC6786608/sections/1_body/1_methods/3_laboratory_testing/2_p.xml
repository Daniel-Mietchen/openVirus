<p>This study analyzed plasma samples from HIV-infected index participants collected at the enrollment visit; the analysis was limited to samples with viral loads &gt;400 copies/mL to provide sufficient HIV RNA for analysis. HIV genotyping was performed using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping System v2.0 (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, IL). This system generates HIV 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene sequences encoding HIV protease (amino acids 1–99) and reverse transcriptase (amino acids 1–335). Major HIV drug resistance mutations to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and protease inhibitors (PIs) were assessed using the ViroSeq resistance report. FASTA files were submitted to GenBank (accession numbers: MK228137-MK228585). HIV-1 subtyping was performed by phylogenetic analysis of ViroSeq-derived 
 <italic>pol</italic> region sequences using PHYLIP v3.695 (

 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Agreement among at least three HIV subtyping methods was required to assign an HIV subtype. ARV drug testing was performed using a qualitative, high-throughput, assay that detects 20 ARV drugs in five classes (six NRTIs, three NNRTIs, nine PIs, one CCR5 receptor antagonist, and one integrase strand transfer inhibitor). The limit of quantification for the assay is 2 or 20 ng/mL, depending on the drug [
