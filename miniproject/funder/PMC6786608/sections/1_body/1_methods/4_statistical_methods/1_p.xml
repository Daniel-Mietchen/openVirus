<p>HIV-infected participants were classified as newly diagnosed with HIV infection if they did not report a prior positive HIV test result and had no ARV drugs detected. Exploratory analyses were conducted to identify potential associations between participant characteristics and two study outcomes: HIV drug resistance and viral suppression. Univariate logistic regression was used to estimate unadjusted associations (odds ratios) between participant characteristics and each of the two outcome variables of interest; multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted associations (adjusted odds ratios). Covariates were chosen 
 <italic>a priori</italic> for the adjusted models based on their potential for confounding and/or effect mediation. Two covariates were chosen for the adjusted modeling of drug resistance: study site and ARV drug detection. Five covariates were chosen for the adjusted modeling of viral suppression: study site, ARV drug detection, baseline viral load, baseline drug resistance, and study arm. Geographic location (study site) is likely an important confounder due to its strong association with both outcome variables, and its correlation with many demographic and clinical characteristics. The remaining covariates are known to be associated with the respective outcome variables and therefore are expected to have relevant mediation effects. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.4.
