<p>ARV drugs were detected in 51 (11.4%) of the 449 samples tested (17/112 [15.2%] from Indonesia; 4/165 [2.4%] from Ukraine; and 30/172 [17.4%] from Vietnam;

Among the 51 participants who had ARV drugs detected, 30 (58.8%) had HIV drug resistance. In 30 cases, both ARV drugs and resistance were detected (

The mutations K103N, Y181C, and G190A, which confer high-level resistance to NNRTI drugs efavirenz [EFV] and nevirapine [NVP], were detected alone and in combination in all 30 participants; EFV or NVP was detected in samples from 29 (97%) of the 30 participants. Twenty-four (80%) of the 30 participants also had resistance mutations to NRTIs (mostly M184V); 22 of the 24 participants also had NRTI drugs detected (mostly lamivudine [3TC]).
