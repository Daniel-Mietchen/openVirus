<p>We next evaluated the relationship between self-reported ART and HIV drug resistance. Among 85 participants who reported prior ART and 42 participants who reported current ART, 29 (34.1%) and 21 (50.0%) had resistance detected, respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Among 364 who did not report prior or current ART, 25 (6.9%) had resistance detected. Participants who reported that they had ever been on ART were more likely to have resistance than those who reported that they had never been on ART (29/85 [34.1%] vs. 25/364 [6.9%], p&lt;0.001). Participants who reported that they were on ART at the enrollment visit were also more likely to have resistance than those who reported that they were not on ART at enrollment (21/42 [50.0%] vs. 33/407 [8.1%], p&lt;0.001).
