<p>Twenty-three participants had ARV drugs detected, but did not have resistance mutations corresponding to one or more of the classes of drugs detected. One had PIs and 3TC detected, but only had NNRTI resistance; one had EFV and 3TC detected, but only had NNRTI resistance. The remaining 21 participants had ARV drugs detected (NNRTIs and/or NRTIs) with no resistance (

Because these participants were not virally suppressed, they were at risk of acquiring resistance to the additional classes of ARV drugs detected. Among the 398 participants with no ARV drugs detected, 24 (6.0%) had resistance (
