<p>We next evaluated the association between demographic, behavioral, clinical, and laboratory characteristics with HIV drug resistance (
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The proportion of participants with resistance was significantly higher among those with ARV drugs detected compared to those with no ARV drugs detected in both univariate and multivariable models (p&lt;0.001 in both models). The frequency of resistance also differed by study site (greater in Indonesia vs. Ukraine or Vietnam) and was higher among participants who reported a history of incarceration. Other factors were significantly associated with resistance in univariate models, but not in the multivariable models (CD4 cell count, injection amphetamine use, non-injection stimulant use, and hazardous alcohol use).
