<p>As a final step, we evaluated the association between participant characteristics, including HIV drug resistance, and viral suppression (defined as a viral load â‰¤40 copies/mL after 52 weeks of study follow-up). This analysis included 342 participants who had a baseline resistance result and a viral load result from the week 52 study visit. In both study arms, baseline resistance was associated with a reduced frequency of viral suppression. In the standard of care arm, 2/27 (7.4%) participants with baseline resistance were virally suppressed at week 52, compared to 62/217 (28.6%) participants who did not have resistance (OR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.87; p = 0.032). In the intervention arm, 2/14 (14.3%) participants with baseline resistance were virally suppressed at week 52, compared to 42/84 (50.0%) participants who did not have baseline resistance (OR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.79; p = 0.024). In multivariable analysis, after adjusting for study site and other factors (ARV drugs detected at baseline, baseline viral load, baseline drug resistance, and study arm), three factors were significantly associated with a lower rate of viral suppression: baseline drug resistance, being in the standard of care study arm, and study site (Indonesia vs. Vietnam,
