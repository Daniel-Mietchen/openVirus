<p>Injection of illicit drugs carries a high risk of HIV transmission due to sharing of contaminated equipment. High HIV incidence and prevalence among persons who inject drugs (PWID) have been reported in many regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Unfortunately, most PWID have limited access to HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and other health services due to social stigmatization, criminalization of injection drug use, and other factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. PWID often face barriers to HIV care, which can delay ART initiation [
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. ART has also been systematically withheld in some populations of PWID [
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] due to concerns that PWID may be more likely to develop HIV drug resistance [
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and that drug-resistant HIV will spread through drug-injection practices [
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. PWID often have unstable lives and may be less likely to adhere to ART, which would promote development of resistance [
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, in some settings, PWID had similar rates of ART adherence and resistance to those who do not inject drugs [
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The frequency and patterns of resistance are important in this setting, since resistance impacts the ability of ART to suppress viral replication and prevent HIV transmission.
