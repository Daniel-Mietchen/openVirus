<p>At study entry, 12.0% of the 449 participants had drug-resistant HIV and more than half of the participants with HIV drug resistance had multiclass resistance. The proportion of participants with resistance was significantly higher among those who were using ARV drugs compared to those with no drugs detected (58.8% vs. 6.0%). Participants who reported prior or current ART were more likely to have resistance. However, almost half of those with resistance did not report prior or current ART, even though some of those participants had ARV drugs detected in their study samples. A separate report provides more information on the accuracy of self-reported data in the HPTN 074 cohort [
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We found an association between resistance and prior incarceration; however, it is important to note that only 14/449 (3.1%) participants reported having been incarcerated. Injection drug use is criminalized in many regions of the world and PWID often face higher incarceration rates; this could impact consistent accessibility to ART and exacerbate development of resistance in this population. This indicates that enhanced HIV care may be particularly important in PWID who have a history of incarceration, and that HIV care programs need to be accessible to those on ART when they are incarcerated, for continuity of care.
