<p>A limitation of this study is that population (consensus) sequencing is not sensitive for detection of low-level (minority) variants. Another limitation is the possible overestimation of TDR. Our use of an objective measure of ARV drug use in addition to self-report increases the accuracy of TDR estimates. However, the prevalence of TDR may still be overestimated if participants previously used ARV drugs for pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, prevention of mother-to-child transmission, or other reasons without reporting this to study staff. The ARV drug assay used in this report only detects drugs taken close to the time of sample collection.</p>
