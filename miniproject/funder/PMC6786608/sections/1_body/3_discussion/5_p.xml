<p>A key feature of this study was that data on HIV drug resistance were analyzed in the context of data from ARV drug testing. This approach allowed us to assess whether the resistance mutations detected were consistent with ARV drugs detected in the same samples. In this cohort, the majority of participants with resistance had mutations detected that confer resistance to the classes of ARV drugs detected. We were also able to assess whether participants were at risk of acquiring additional resistance to additional classes of ARV drugs. In this cohort, 23 participants who were not virally suppressed were taking ARV drugs, but did not have mutations that conferred resistance to one or both classes of ARV drugs detected; acquisition of resistance to those drugs with continued non-suppressive ARV drug exposure would further limit their treatment options.</p>
