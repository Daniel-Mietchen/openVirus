<p>Data from ARV drug testing and self-report of prior positive HIV status also allowed us to assess whether some of the participants in HPTN 074 may have had transmitted HIV drug resistance (TDR). We detected resistance mutations in samples from 10 (5.6%) of 177 newly-diagnosed participants (6 from Indonesia; 0 from Ukraine; 4 from Vietnam); in all 10 cases, the mutations identified were included in a list of mutations recommended for assessing TDR (
