<p>The proportion of participants in HPTN 074 who had HIV drug resistance differed by study site (24.1% Indonesia, 2.4% in Ukraine, and 13.4% in Vietnam), which may reflect regional differences in ARV drug use at the time the study was performed. Only 8% of index participants in Ukraine reported prior ART and none had ARV drugs detected at enrollment. In comparison, 56% and 34% of participants in Indonesia and Vietnam reported prior ART and 82% and 53% had ARV drugs detected, respectively. ARV drugs detected were mostly consistent with first-line ART regimens recommended at the study sites at the time the study was performed. Two participants had unusual combinations of ARV drugs detected (two NNRTIs plus an NRTI). Those individuals may have been taking medications without medical guidance. Further research is needed to assess how PWID in these regions access ARV drugs for treatment. We recognize that other local factors, such as recruitment methods or venues, may have influenced the proportion of index participants enrolled who had prior or current ART or other exposures to ARV drugs that could have contributed to resistance.</p>
