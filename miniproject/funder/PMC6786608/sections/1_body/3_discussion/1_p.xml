<p>We assessed HIV drug resistance and ARV drug use in a large cohort of PWID in Eastern Europe and Asia who were not virally suppressed. In the HPTN 074 trial, index participants in the intervention arm were more likely to be virally suppressed after 52 weeks of follow-up. We identified behavioral and geographic factors associated with baseline resistance in index participants and demonstrated that those with baseline drug resistance were less likely to achieve viral suppression, independent of study arm.</p>
