<p>In conclusion, this study highlights challenges of using ART for HIV prevention among PWID. Significant resources are needed to identify those with HIV drug resistance, offer appropriate second- or third-line treatment regimens, and provide enhanced adherence support to ensure that these individuals achieve durable viral suppression for their own health and to reduce transmission of drug-resistant HIV to injection and sexual partners. Optimized HIV care is also needed for those starting ART to avoid emergence of resistance strains. A multi-component package for HIV prevention may help prevent HIV transmission from PWID who chose not to start ART or fail ART due to suboptimal adherence, resistance, or other factors. Interventions designed to reduce injection drug use, such as medication-assisted treatment for substance use, may also reduce the risk of superinfection with drug-resistant HIV strains, which could limit treatment options or lead to ART failure. Future studies are planned to assess the impact of baseline resistance on ART outcomes in HPTN 074, and the impact of study interventions (referral and support for ART and medication assisted treatment for substance use) on emergence of resistance during study follow-up.</p>
