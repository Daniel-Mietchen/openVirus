<p>This study demonstrated that participants in HPTN 074 who had baseline HIV drug resistance were less likely to achieve viral suppression, independent of study arm. The level of viral suppression achieved in both study arms was low (41% in the intervention arm; 24% in the control arm) [
 <xref rid="pone.0223829.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Because of the cost and complexity of resistance testing, it is not available in many settings. In HPTN 074, HIV care was provided at local care centers where resistance testing was not routinely performed before initiating ART or at ART failure. This likely contributed to ART failure in some cases.
