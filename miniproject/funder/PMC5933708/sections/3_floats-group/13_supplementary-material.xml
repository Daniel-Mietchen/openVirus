  <title>Pre-exposure profile as a function of the force of infection for (a) Brazil, (b) Thailand.</title>
  <p>The seroprevalence of the population is estimated using a system of ordinary differential equations with state variables denoting the proportion of the population pre-exposed to 0â€“4 serotypes. Transition to pre-exposure state i occurs at a rate (4-i)FoI. Individuals entering a new pre-exposure state retain temporary heterologous immunity to all serotypes for an average duration of 2 years [
