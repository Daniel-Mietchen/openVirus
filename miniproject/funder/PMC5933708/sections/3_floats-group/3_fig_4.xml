  <title>Pre-exposure history (A and C) and infection class (B and D) stratification by age and for FoI values of 0.01 (top) and 0.1 (bottom).</title>
  <p>An individuals’ susceptibility to infection and clinical outcome depend on pre-exposure history. Serohistory by age (A and C) is estimated using a system of ordinary differential equations with state variables denoting the proportion of the population pre-exposed to 0–4 serotypes. Transition to pre-exposure state 
   <italic>i</italic> occurs at rate 
   <italic>i</italic>FoI. Individuals entering a new pre-exposure state have temporary heterologous immunity (gray) to all serotypes before later becoming susceptible again to each serotype to which they do not have a history of exposure. After four infections with four different serotypes, individuals are assumed fully immune (black) to all serotypes.
