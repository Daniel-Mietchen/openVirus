  <p>Our overall approach consisted of three steps, depicted in the three columns. The products of all three combine to yield our estimate of the relative contribution to overall force of infection from each infection class. Likewise, uncertainty in each component of the analysis is propagated into other components of the analysis through repeated Monte Carlo sampling, with Monte Carlo samples from one portion of the analysis flowing to others according to the arrows and providing the basis for credible intervals reported in the 
   <italic>Results</italic> section. Details of how the sub-steps indicated in this figure were performed are described in subsections of the 
   <italic>Materials and Methods</italic> section.
