  <title>Mean contribution of infection classes to total FoI in an emerging setting.</title>
  <p>The contribution to the total FoI of a class is derived from the ratio between FoI attributable to this class and total FoI, as in Eq (
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="ppat.1006965.e001">1</xref>). The respective net infectiousness is derived from the 3,000 random samples displayed in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006965.g003">Fig 3</xref>. The infections are further distributed according to the estimated proportion of net infectiousness to occur before and after symptom onset (pre-symptomatic (Eq (
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="ppat.1006965.e005">5</xref>)) and post-symptomatic (hatched lines) (Eq (
   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="ppat.1006965.e006">6</xref>)). The histogram shows the distribution of FoI contributions by asymptomatic infections at FoI = 0.1, accounting for parameter uncertainty.
