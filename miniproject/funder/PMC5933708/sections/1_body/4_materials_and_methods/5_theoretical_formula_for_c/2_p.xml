<p>To account for the population stratification that is necessary for our analysis, we derived a formula for the FoI that is more generalizable than the classic formula in that it allows for distinct contributions to FoI from different host groups (i.e., As, IS, UAS, and DAS infections with different pre-exposure histories). Specifically, each host group differed in its infectiousness and its overall prevalence in the population. By separating contributions from different host groups to mosquito infectiousness and, in turn, to the FoI on susceptible hosts, we calculated the proportional contribution of people with As infections to FoI by calculating the ratio between the FoI resulting from As infections alone and the total FoI, and similarly for IS, UAS, and DAS infections.</p>
