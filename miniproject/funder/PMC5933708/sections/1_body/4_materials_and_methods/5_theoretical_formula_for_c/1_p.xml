<p>Classical epidemiological theory for mosquito-borne pathogen transmission posits that FoI—i.e., the rate at which susceptible individuals become infected—is a function of a number of factors, including infection prevalence among hosts (
 <italic>X</italic>) and the infectiousness of infected hosts [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. On a per capita basis, FoI = 
 <italic>bmaY</italic> in Ross-Macdonald models, where 
 <italic>b</italic> is the probability that a susceptible host becomes infected after being bitten by an infectious vector, 
 <italic>m</italic> is the ratio of vectors to hosts, 
 <italic>a</italic> is the daily rate of at which a vector bites, and 
 <italic>Y</italic> is the infection prevalence among vectors. The latter depends further on the daily vector mortality rate 
 <italic>g</italic>, the incubation period 
 <italic>n</italic> in the vector, human infection prevalence 
 <italic>X</italic>, and the probability 
 <italic>c</italic> that a susceptible mosquito becomes infected upon biting an infectious host [
