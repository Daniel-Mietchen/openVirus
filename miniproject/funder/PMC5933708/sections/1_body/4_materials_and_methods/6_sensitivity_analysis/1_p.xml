<p>We performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of uncertainty in As:IS:AS ratios among 1° and 2° infections on the relative contributions to the overall FoI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006965.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Additionally, we examined what the contribution of inapparent infections to the FoI would be under the assumption that post-2° infections are similarly infectious as 2° infections and using estimates from the meta-analysis presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006965.s005">S3 Table</xref> to estimate the proportion of post-2° infections to be apparent. This and the assumption we effectively made in our primary analysis—i.e., that post-2° infections make no contribution to transmission—represent two different extremes and therefore provide bounds on the potential sensitivity of our results to alternative assumptions about the contributions to transmission from post-2° infections. Similarly, we addressed uncertainty around the net infectiousness of IS infections by first assuming their net infectiousness to be similar to As infections rather than AS infections, as in the core analysis. We then examined the impact of severe AS infections by adopting fitted dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) viremia trajectories [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], DHF rates among S infections of 0.8% and 3% for primary and post-primary infections, respectively [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and the assumption that all DHF cases are detected. The latter assumption provides an upper bound for the potential contribution of DAS infections for a given detection rate.
