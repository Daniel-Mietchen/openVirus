<p>The parameter 
 <italic>A</italic> denotes the daily production rate of target cells, which die at rate γ and become infected proportional to the concentration of free viral particles at rate β, assuming random mixing. Infected cells die at rate δ and are cleared of infection at a rate proportional to the size of the immune response and the removal rate α. Free viral particles are produced by infected cells at rate ω and are cleared at rate κ. The immune response grows proportional to the number of infected cells at rate η. This model was fitted to individual plasma viral titers from primary (1°) and secondary (2°) apparent symptomatic (AS) DENV-1 infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We used 
 <italic>n</italic> = 3,000 random samples from the joint posteriors from that analysis to model viremia trajectories for 1° and 2° AS infections. Inapparent symptomatic (IS) infections are assumed to have similar viremia as AS infections. To adapt this approach to model viremia trajectories of As infections, we relied on the observation by Duong et al. [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] that log
 <sub>10</sub> viral titers of As infections were lower on average than those of S infections (76%, CI: 63–88%). To account for uncertainty in this relationship, we took the ratio of 3,000 random samples from the normal distributions of symptomatic (mean: 6.27 +/- SE 0.14 log
 <sub>10</sub> cDNA copies/mL) and asymptomatic observed viremia (mean: 4.75 +/- SE 0.39 log
 <sub>10</sub> cDNA copies/mL) and reduced each viremia trajectories of AS infections by a random draw from the distribution of fractions to approximate the trajectories of As infections. In doing so, we assumed the duration of viremia to be similar in As and S infections on the basis of limited data from the study performed by Duong et al. [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which revealed no detectable differences in the duration of viremia between A and S infections.
