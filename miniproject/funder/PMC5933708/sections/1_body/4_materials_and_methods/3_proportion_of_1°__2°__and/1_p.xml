<p>We calculated the proportion of the population previously exposed to 0 to 4 serotypes as a function of the populationâ€™s age distribution and the time-averaged, serotype-specific FoI to which the population is subject. The time-averaged FoI metric (defined below) that we used was assumed to be constant with respect to virus serotype and space. Although DENV FoI is known to exhibit substantial variation with respect to these factors [
