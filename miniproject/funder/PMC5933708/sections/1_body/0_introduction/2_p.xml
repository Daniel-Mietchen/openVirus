<p>Of the 390 million dengue virus (DENV) infections that occur globally each year, an estimated 300 million do not result in symptoms severe enough for a person to seek treatment [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], meaning that they likely go undetected by most surveillance systems. The four closely related DENV1-4 serotypes are transmitted predominantly by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and infection with one serotype is believed to be followed by short-term, heterologous cross-immunity and life-long homologous immunity [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on observed positive correlations between DENV viremia and disease severity [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it has been assumed that the 300 million annual clinically inapparent infections contribute little to onward transmission because their viremia levels are too low to efficiently infect mosquitoes. On the other hand, high sero-conversion rates coinciding with few reported cases in some areas suggest that inapparent infections may contribute appreciably to silent DENV transmission [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Furthermore, recent blood-feeding experiments with 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes demonstrated that people with asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic DENV infections are indeed capable of infecting mosquitoes [
