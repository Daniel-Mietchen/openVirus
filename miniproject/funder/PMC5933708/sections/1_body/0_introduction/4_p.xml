<p>We addressed this question by estimating the net infectiousness (NI) of DENV-infected individuals with different clinical manifestations, including asymptomatic infections, and quantifying the relative contributions of these clinically distinct classes to the overall force of infection (FoI) of DENV. Our approach involved three distinct steps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006965.g001">Fig 1</xref>). First, we estimated the net infectiousness of different classes of DENV infections by combining class-specific estimates of DENV viremia trajectories and class-specific estimates of the relationship between DENV viremia and infectiousness to mosquitoes. Second, we estimated the proportion of infections of each class by first quantifying the proportion of primary, secondary, and post-secondary DENV infections in a population with a given level of transmission intensity. We then translated those proportions of primary, secondary, and post-secondary infections into proportions of each infection class based on estimates of those relationships from the literature. Third, we used a novel formulation of DENV force of infection to combine estimates of individual-level net infectiousness of each infection class and estimates of the proportion of each infection class in a hypothetical population to estimate the proportional contribution of each infection class to overall DENV force of infection.
