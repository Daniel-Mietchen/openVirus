<p>Heterogeneous infectiousness coupled with heterogeneity in disease symptoms is common across a wide range of pathogens [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A more thorough, quantitative understanding of the factors underlying these heterogeneities and their role in pathogen transmission is critical for a more complete understanding of pathogen dynamics and, in turn, enhanced disease prevention [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Our results advance understanding of these heterogeneities for dengue, showing that they are significant at both individual and population levels. In particular, our findings suggest that failing to acknowledge these coupled heterogeneities may significantly handicap understanding of DENV transmission dynamics, the effectiveness of dengue outbreak response efforts, and the evaluation of novel interventions for dengue prevention and control. These results show that additional emphasis on model-based approaches that bridge individual-level infection and population-level transmission processes have the potential to provide valuable insights for infectious disease prevention and control and for the identification of high-priority needs for future data collection.
