 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], our modeling analysis suggests that inapparent infections contribute appreciably to DENV transmission and its disease burden via infection of others who develop clinical symptoms. In large part, our results stem from the large numerical prominence of As and IS DENV infections and the finding that differences in the viremia profiles of As and S infections are insufficient to result in considerable differences in net infectiousness. Moreover, our finding that approximately one quarter of an individualâ€™s infectiousness occurs prior to symptom onset supports the hypothesis that a large proportion of human-to-mosquito transmission is silent; i.e., it happens when there is no detectable illness [
