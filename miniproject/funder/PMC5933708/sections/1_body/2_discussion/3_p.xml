<p>Our results also highlight the potential significance of a key uncertainty in projections of the population-level impact of the recently licensed Dengvaxia vaccine, which is thought to protect some vaccine recipients against apparent disease but not infection [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Although spared from disease, our results imply that breakthrough infections in these individuals could appreciably contribute to transmission and, therefore, limit the indirect effects of vaccination [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. If individuals with asymptomatic or inapparent infections are as infectious as their apparent symptomatic counterparts, positive indirect effects of vaccine implementation in highly endemic settings would be reduced [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Conversely, adverse effects of vaccination in low-transmission settings, due to higher rates of severe disease in DENV-na√Øve vaccine recipients [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], would be offset to some degree if inapparent infections are important contributors to transmission given that this would increase the projected indirect effects of vaccination in those settings [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
