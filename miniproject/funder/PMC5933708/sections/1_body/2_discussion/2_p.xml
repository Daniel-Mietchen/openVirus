<p>The substantial role that inapparent infections play during dengue epidemics may result in more rapid transmission and geographic spread [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and, as a result, more widespread transmission prior to case-driven outbreak detection and onset of control efforts [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The considerable potential for pre-symptomatic transmission further impedes the use of case data to predict whether an outbreak will occur and, if it does, what its final size will be [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Despite increasing recognition of the importance of silent transmission to the epidemiology of a variety of pathogens, it is rarely taken into account in dengue models [
