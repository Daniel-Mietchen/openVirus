<p>The contribution of silent infections to transmission helps explain the difficulty of carrying out control efforts in response to reported cases, particularly in intense transmission settings [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. That approach could be further impeded by substantial inter-individual variability in pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectiousness [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. If some people with silent infections are substantially more infectious than those with apparent infections, a significant portion of DENV transmission clusters would not be detected or contained by traditional surveillance efforts. Additional data are required to determine to what extent the observed variability in infectiousness results from uncertainty in the data or variability among individuals [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Improving strategies with enhanced potential to prevent infections, silent or otherwise, requires a deeper understanding of the spatial and temporal scales of transmission [
