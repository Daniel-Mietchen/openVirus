<p>We distinguished four classes of infections (

 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The remaining people with symptomatic (S) infections were divided into: (1) inapparent symptomatic (IS), people whose symptoms are sufficiently mild to not disrupt their daily routine and thus do not prompt healthcare seeking [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; and (2) apparent symptomatic (AS) individuals, whose clinical presentation does disrupt their daily routine according to the WHO definition of “at least fever and two dengue symptoms” [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Detected apparent symptomatic individuals (DAS) are identified by health surveillance systems if they seek clinical consultation and are diagnosed as a confirmed dengue case. Others remain undetected (UAS) (
