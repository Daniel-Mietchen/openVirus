<p>The median NI to

 <italic>aegypti</italic> of As infections was lower than that of S infections, but of similar magnitude (1°: 87%, 95% CI: 0–151%; 2°: 74%, 95% CI: 0–137%). The median NI of 1° infections was greater than that of corresponding 2° infections (As: 140%, 95% CI: 111–275%; S: 120%, 95% CI: 100–235%) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006965.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Approximately one quarter of the NI of S infections occurred before symptom onset (1°: 21%, 95% CI: 1–56%, 2°: 27%, 95% CI: 0–97%). By calculating the probability that a random draw from the NI distribution of one infection class was lower than a random draw from another class (Pr), we confirmed that As infections are more likely to be less infectious than S infections (1°: Pr = 0.55; 2°: Pr = 0.58) and 2° infections are more likely to be less infectious than 1° infections (As: Pr = 0.56; S: Pr = 0.62) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006965.s004">S2 Table</xref>). There was wide variability in the NI of As infections, however, with both two-fold lesser or greater infectiousness compared to S infections appearing probable (lesser, 1°: 0.38, 2°: 0.42; greater, 1°: 0.16, 2°: 0.20). Overall, 1° As infections were not significantly less infectious than 2° S infections (Wilcoxon rank sum test, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.97).
