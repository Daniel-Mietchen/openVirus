<p>We quantified differences in the net infectiousness to mosquitoes of individuals with As, IS, and AS infections. We modeled viral transmission dynamics of each of these infection types by using a mechanistic model of the within-host dynamics of DENV fitted to plasma viral titers over time for patients with S infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and adjusted these trajectories using an empirically informed distribution of correction ratios to model trajectories of As infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Secondary (2°) infections were parameterized to exhibit faster cell entry and accelerated clearance of viral particles than primary (1°) infections, consistent with theory for antibody-dependent enhancement and increased activation of the immune system [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This resulted in a shorter duration of detectable, and potentially infectious, viremia [

 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Post-2° infections were excluded from consideration for our primary analysis due to a combination of low risk of apparent disease and high rates of cross-reactive antibodies for this group [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Nonetheless, because there is no conclusive evidence about viremia of post-2° infections [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], we performed a sensitivity analysis in which an upper limit for post-2° viremia was assumed similar to that of 2° infections given that the dynamics of both are limited by varying degrees of immunity (
