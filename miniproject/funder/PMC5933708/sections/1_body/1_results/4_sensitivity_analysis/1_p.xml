<p>Data on viremia and infectiousness in asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic, and post-2Â° infections are sparse [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], resulting in substantial uncertainty around our estimates. We performed a variance-based sensitivity analysis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to identify the primary sources of uncertainty for estimating net infectiousness and the proportion of net infectiousness occurring prior to symptom onset. Limited data on the viremia-to-infectiousness relationship of asymptomatic infections drove the majority of uncertainty in estimates of their net infectiousness, whereas uncertainty in time until symptom onset was responsible for the majority of uncertainty in estimates of the proportion of net infectiousness prior to symptom onset (
