<p>The estimated contributions to FoI by each infection class were robust across different transmission settings (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006965.g005">Fig 5</xref>) and in settings where DENV is newly emerging (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006965.s011">S5 Fig</xref>), but not when allowing for contributions to transmission from post-2° infections (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006965.s007">S1 Fig</xref>). Under the assumption that the net infectiousness of post-2° infections is equivalent to that of 2° infections, we estimated the contribution of inapparent infections to be up to 11% (95% CI: 10–13%) higher than if post-2° infections had not been assumed to contribute to transmission (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006965.s007">S1 Fig</xref>). This increase resulted from the relatively high proportion of IS infections among post-2° infections, who made up a larger proportion of the infectious reservoir in more intense transmission settings. Under the assumption that IS infections are more similar in their infectiousness to As than to AS infections, the estimated contribution of inapparent infections was reduced from 84% to 73% (95% CI: 0–91%), reflecting a lower bound on this assumption. The impact of accounting for the differential viral trajectories of severe dengue cases [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] was minor due to their small numerical prominence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but their inclusion did increase the contribution of post-symptomatic DAS infections from 1.0% (95% CI: 0.8–1.1%) to 2.1% (95% CI: 0.8–3.6).
