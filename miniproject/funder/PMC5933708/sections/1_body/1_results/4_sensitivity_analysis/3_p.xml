<p>As:IS:UAS:DAS ratios can fluctuate in space and time; for instance, as a result of serotype differences in virulence [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The contribution of inapparent (As+IS) infections across the spectrum of As:IS:AS ratios is driven by the ratio of As to IS infections, with the total contribution of As+IS infections generally being similar to their numerical prominence in the infected population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1006965.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Although variability in As:IS:AS ratios likely does drive some variability in the contribution of As+IS infections, our analysis suggests that their contribution is unlikely to be less than 81% of their numerical prominence (
