<p>Next, we estimated the proportion of each infection class in a hypothetical population and derived each class’ relative contribution to FoI, the rate at which susceptible people become infected. We assumed an equal probability of being bitten by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> across infection classes. To quantify the proportion of people with As, IS, UAS, and DAS infections (and thus the pool of individuals who could potentially give rise to new infections among susceptibles), we used estimates from a recent meta-analysis on published (As+IS):AS ratios for primary and secondary infections (1°: 82%, 95% CI: 81–84; 2°: 76%, 95% CI: 74–78) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Post-2° infections were assessed separately, using studies compiled by [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A beta-binomial model of these proportions was supported over a binomial model (deviance information criterion (DIC) binomial: 163, beta-binomial: 34). We estimated the (As+IS):AS ratio among post-2° infections to be higher than that of 1° and 2° infections (86%, 95% CI: 63–97). For all pre-exposure histories we adopted an As:(IS+AS) ratio of 9.2% (95% CI: 4.4–14.0%), which reflects the proportion of asymptomatic infections detected among cluster participants in [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and a detection rate of AS infections of 8% (95% CI: 5–15%) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1006965.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec006">sensitivity analysis</xref> for an assessment of the full range of As:IS:AS ratios).
