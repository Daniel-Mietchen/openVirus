<p>Based on our metric of relative FoI, we estimated that 88% (95% CI: 77–92%) of human DENV infections are attributable to individuals that do not present with apparent symptoms at the time when they are bitten by a susceptible mosquito (i.e., As, IS, and pre-symptomatic AS) (Figs

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1006965.s009">S3</xref> for Thailand). We estimated that As and IS infections could together be responsible for causing 84% (95% CI: 82–86%) of all human DENV infections, reflecting a near one-to-one relationship with their representation in the population. Of the remaining 16% (95% CI: 14–18%) of infections, 76% (95% CI: 21–100%) are attributable to bites by mosquitoes on people whose infection eventually becomes apparent, and thus potentially detectable, after onset of symptoms. At a detection rate of 8% [
