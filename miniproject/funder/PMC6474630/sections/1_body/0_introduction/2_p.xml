<p>The dynamics of zoonotic infections at the human-animal interface could be divided into different stages of transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As A (H7N9) virus originates from and persists in animal reservoirs with sporadic human-human transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we could divide the transmission into two stages: index-case potential, described the transition from animal hosts to human beings, resulting in an index case; and epidemic potential, characterized the subsequent widely spread of the virus in human due to exposure to poultry or human-human transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Additionally, previous studies mainly focused on the risk assessment of index-case potential based on the 
 <italic>Poisson</italic> process with the memory of past human infections or using stochastic dynamic modelling framework [

 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The 
 <italic>Poisson</italic> process is constrained by the piecewise linear trend [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while the mathematical dynamic model, including susceptibility, exposure, infection, and recovery compartments is not suitable for the overdispersed data [

 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Due to the lack of relevant data, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), a kind of knowledge-driven modelling methods, has been used as an alternative mathematical approaches to evaluate the infection risk of H5N1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], but a group of experts are needed to support statistical analysis for their different background and experience in the MCDA. the Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) model, a species distribution model increasingly used in ecological suitability modelling for vector-borne and zoonotic diseases [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], has also been used to assess the population at risk of A (H7N9). The capacity of modelling interactions between independent variables as well as non-linear relationships between the independent and predictor variables enables BRT model suitable for the risk assessment of diseases transmitted from animals to humans [
