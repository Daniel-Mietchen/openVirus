<p>Moreover, the risk assessment should include the epidemiological, socioeconomic and other factors to define the epidemic potential broadly, but not only limit in animal-human level. The initiatives, i.e. the Rapid Risk Assessment of Acute Public Health Events by the World Health Organization (WHO), have reinforced a need for proactive approaches to emerging infectious diseases risk assessment [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT), a risk assessment framework, has been used to evaluate the risk for emergence and impact dimensions [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, both tools above are based on qualitative approaches, and IRAT lacks the vulnerability dimension in risk assessment. Another framework, named the FAO-OIE-WHO Four Way Linking Framework, encourages the governments to share information of human health, laboratory, epidemiology and animal health [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It has been commonly used at the human-animal interface but is difficult to quantify the risk. Additionally, Geerlings et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] developed a composite risk index to evaluate the vulnerability of avian influenza H5N1 in Egypt through questionnaires, but the assessment just includes the vulnerability of the risk together with the limitation of timeliness. Therefore, a comprehensive risk assessment framework is needed to evaluate the A (H7N9) epidemic potential proactively and quantitively, by integrating the estimates of index-case and epidemic potentials to optimize surveillance, control and treatments.
