<p>The Index for Risk Management (INFORM) model, a tool widely used for global humanitarian risk analysis by UN agencies, donors, NGOs and research institutions, defines risk through three dimensions: hazards and exposure to risks, vulnerability, and lack of coping capacity [

 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], but it has not been used for avian influenza risk assessment. In this study, we aimed to build a unified framework based on BRT and INFORM to evaluate the risk of avian influenza A (H7N9) in humans quantitively and proactively at the provincial level. Our study may help the health departments to formulate the strategy and allocate resources for H7N9 surveillance, preventive measures, and treatments.
