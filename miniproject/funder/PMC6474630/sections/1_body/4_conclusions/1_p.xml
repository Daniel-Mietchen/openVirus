<p>This analysis provides an integrated risk assessment framework for A (H7N9) epidemic potential in humans. The norther coastal province has the index-case potential for the relative humidity and temperature. The provinces in central China has the epidemic potential for the vulnerability and lack of capacity. The two-stage risk and its heterogeneity among provinces in mainland China detected in our study will be helpful for governments or health departments for proactively health preparedness. With the two-stage evaluation, the governments at-risk provinces should improve surveillance, diagnostic capabilities, and health promotion for the A (H7N9) transmission. The framework could also contribute to the proactive and quantitative risk assessment of other devastating pathogens.</p>
