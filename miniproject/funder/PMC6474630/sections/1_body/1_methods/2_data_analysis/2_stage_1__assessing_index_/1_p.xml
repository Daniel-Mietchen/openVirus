<p>The BRT model was established using the number of A (H7N9) human cases as the dependent variable. Due to the importance of poultry and climatic factors on A (H7N9) transmission [

 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], the poultry density and meteorological variables were included as independent variables in the BRT model. As described in previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], both presence and absence data were included to build the BRT model, and pseudo-absences were generated throughout the points in locations [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Pseudo-absences were twice as many as A (H7N9) human cases in the model. The data was divided into two parts, training data for building the model with 75% of cases, and testing data for evaluating the model’s goodness of fit using 25% of cases. We chose the ‘Bernoulli’ as the error structure and learning rate was 0.05, and bag fraction was 0.75, with the tree complexity of 5 as a start. Then we predicted the probability of A (H7N9) case occurrence based on the model. The area under the curve (AUC) statistic, sensitivity and Kappa were used to assess model accuracy [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The probability was aggregated as geomean at the provincial level and standardized on a scale of 0–10.
