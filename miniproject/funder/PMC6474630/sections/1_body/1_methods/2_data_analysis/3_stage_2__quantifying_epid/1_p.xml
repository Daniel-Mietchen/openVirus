<p>We synthesized the variables upon INFORM to measure the epidemic risk from three dimensions: hazards and exposure probability, vulnerability and the lack of coping capacity [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In this stage, we used the results of Stage 1 as the exposure probability. Constrained by the data availability, we only collected data at the provincial level for stage 2. Therefore, we have to aggregate the outcomes of stage 1 to match the level of coarse data used in stage 2. The vulnerability is the susceptibility of communities to those hazards; lack of capacity is the shortage of resources that can help absorb the shock [

 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The indicators of vulnerability included population density, poultry production, distance of highway, passenger capacity, internet penetration and teledensity [

 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Poultry production was different from the poultry density in stage 1. Poultry density is the density of the live chicken or ducks in natural environment, while poultry production includes eggs or chicken for peopleâ€™s consumption. In stage 1, the index-case may present because of the contact with the live chicken in the farming; and in stage 2, more people may be infected through selling or buying the production in the live poultry market, therefore we used poultry density in the stage 1 and poultry production in the stage 2. The lack of coping capacity dimension included the indicators of healthcare institutions and community health service centers [
