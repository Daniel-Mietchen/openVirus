<p>As the INFORM model needs at least 5 years of data to reduce variation, we used the geomeans of 2011–16 data in the model. A geometric mean is often used when comparing different items, when each item has multiple properties that have different numeric ranges. Because the factors included the probability, counts, and other types of data, the geometric means might be more suitable to describe the central tendency, and this indicator was also recommended by the INFORM [

The lower values of indicators, the higher risk, except poultry production, population density, distance of highway, and passenger capacity. Therefore, we standardized inputs to a 0–10 scale using the INFORM methods, with 10 represents the worst situation [
