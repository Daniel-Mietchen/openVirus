<p>The predicted probability at provincial level was summarized and transformed into INFORM outputs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0215857.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Across mainland China, the ranking of subnational regions in Stage 1, identification of locations with index cases potential, informed that the higher index potential was in coastal provinces, especially Shanghai and Jiangsu. Many locations ranking highly were in provinces with higher morbidity in 2013â€“17, and several provinces with lower previous morbidity had increasing index-case potential, i.e. Tianjin and Liaoning.
