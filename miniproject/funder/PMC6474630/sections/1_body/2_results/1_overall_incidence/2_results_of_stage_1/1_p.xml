<p>We built a BRT model to predict the probability of A (H7N9) in humans and took 50 draws from the datasets for the uncertainty estimates. The fixed number of 1000 (IQR: 200) trees for the fitting. Mean total deviance was 1.282 (IQR: 0.008), and mean residual deviance was 0.188 (IQR: 0.017). The AUC of the training data was 0.97 (95%CI: 0.96~0.98), with Kappa was 0.54 (IQR: 0.11), and sensitivity was 0.42 (IQR: 0.10). The indicators with higher relative influence proportion were poultry density (24.59%) and mean temperature of warmest season (22.57%), precipitation of driest month (8.91%). The relative influence of the variables in the BRT model and the predicted probability of human A (H7N9) cases in mainland China are presented in
