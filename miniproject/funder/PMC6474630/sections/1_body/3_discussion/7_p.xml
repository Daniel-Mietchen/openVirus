<p>There are some limitations in this study. First, we used proxy covariate factors rather than specific drivers because of the data accessibility, therefore the data gaps still existed. For example, the indicator of live-poultry markets is crucial to control the epidemic [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but we just used poultry production indicator. Second, it is hard to collect the resources at the county level, so we ranked the INFORM at the province level, but it may vary at city or county level. The third, the indicators were chosed according to the literature and limited by data availability. At last, as the clinical severity of infections and the capacity of human-to-human transmission have not changed substantially across epidemics since 2013[
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], we used 5-year data to explore the index-case potential at the average level of the intensity across five waves. However, the difference of risks between the five waves might be existing, and they will be investigated in our future research. However, these limitations will be a line of investigation for the future. Although we were short of more direct and continuous data, our study also detected the at-risk provinces accordance to epidemiological stages, and applied the health departments special treatments to deal with A (H7N9).
