<p>For the index-case potential defined by BRT model in Stage 1, provinces in eastern China were ranked in the higher quantile, and there was spillover risk in other coastal provinces where only sporadic cases have been reported. Most cases occurred in southeast China around Yangtze River delta, but northern coastal China even had the high incidence risk for the relative humidity and temperature. The results of BRT models showed that the precipitation, poultry density and temperature had high impacts on the index-case potential, which is consistent with Fang et al research [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The poultry density of northern coastal China was high, but the timing of peaks of avian influenza A(H7N9) infections in humans in northern coastal China was later than the season of southern coastal regions, which might be related to the weather factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The results suggested that A (H7N9) might spread wider than the cases having been reported, which was in line with the trend of A (H7N9) epidemic[
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The poultry density, live poultry markets and climatic factors might all drive the high risk of A (H7N9) infections in humans. A (H7N9) virus might be undetected in poultry farms as its low pathogenicity in avian, and proactive surveillance in chicken or duck is needed to detect the A (H7N9) as early as possible [
