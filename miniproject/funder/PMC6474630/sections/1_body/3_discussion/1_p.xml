<p>Based on a two-stage risk assessment framework by integrating BRT model and INFORM models, we demonstrated the locations with index-case potential and epidemic potential of human infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in China. Some coastal provinces or municipalities, such as Tianjin, Liaoning, with lower former morbidity had the spillover risk, while provinces in central China had higher epidemic potential once the index case happened. According to the risk highlighted in this study, strengthening the surveillance, diagnosis capacity, and health promotion in high risk regions of China will be crucial to prevent and control the A (H7N9) epidemic.</p>
