<p>Li et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] explored the risk distribution of avian influenza A (H7N9) in humans with BRT model and found that density of poultry, coverage of shrub and temperature played important roles for human H7N9 infection. Base on ecological niche models, Xu et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0215857.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] investigated the relationships between the occurrence of H7N9 and environmental factors including meteorological variables, human population density, bird migratory routes, wetland distribution, farms, and live poultry markets, and found that the distribution of poultry, farms, and human population density were the top three determinants. Based on the evidence from previous studies, therefore, we just analysed the poultry density and meteorological factors in the index-case potential analysis and included the population density in the epidemic potential analysis. The mean total deviance of the BRT model was 1.287, and the mean residual deviance was 0.189. It means the factors included in the model could explain 85.3% of the results.
