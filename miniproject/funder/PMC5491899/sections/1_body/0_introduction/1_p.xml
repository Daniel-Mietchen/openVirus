<p>In light of the rapidly growing availability of “big data” from both diagnostic and prediagnostic (syndromic) sources in health care and public health settings, a new generation of epidemiological and statistical methods is needed for reliable analyses and modeling [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This need of new methods adapted to extensive but heterogeneous datasets extends to algorithms for detection and prediction of winter influenza seasons and influenza pandemics. Each year epidemics of influenza occur in communities worldwide and cause extensive morbidity and mortality [

 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Preparing for and responding appropriately to winter influenza seasons and pandemics is a critical function of public health. However, a concern regarding forecasting algorithms is that reports of methods used for analyses of extensive datasets originating from different sources do not always meet basic standards. The reports fail with regard to the requirement that evaluators should be able to assess the design and performance of the methods when building the next generation of algorithms [
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, regardless of the transparency problems in reporting, the potential of big data analyses in infectious disease control is widely recognized. For instance, autoregressive models for influenza forecasts have shown satisfactory performances when applied on large populations [
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This implies that the area where the knowledge need presently is most immediate is the detection and prediction of influenza activity at local levels [
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Such granular views, in turn, can provide input into large-scale models and accurate prediction of influenza spread in wide geographical areas.
