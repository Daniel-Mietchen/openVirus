<p>During the recent decade, a multitude of algorithms for influenza detection or prediction have been reported [
 <xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Unlike meteorology where methods for integrated very-short and long-term predictions have been used in practice settings for several decades (see eg, [
 <xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]), surprisingly few such approaches have been reported for influenza surveillance. Our integrated detection and prediction method is one of the first designed for application on naturally occurring local influenza epidemics. The results of this study indicate that further prospective evaluations of the method are justified.
