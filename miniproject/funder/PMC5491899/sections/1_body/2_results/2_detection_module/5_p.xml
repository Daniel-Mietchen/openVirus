 <sub>0</sub> now combines the current level of number of infected and probability of visiting the local health care service without any possibility to separate them. As daily data are used in the analysis, weekday effects, 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>w</sub>, are also calculated and used as an offset variable in the exponential regression analysis. The weekday effects are calculated as follows: let 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>Monday</sub> be the average number of events on Mondays during previous epidemics and denote the values for other weekdays by 
 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>Tuesday</sub>
 <italic>, A</italic>

 <italic>A</italic>
 <sub>Total</sub>
 <italic>=(A</italic>
 <sub>Monday</sub>

 <sub>Monday</sub>
 <italic>/A</italic>
 <sub>Total</sub> and so on. The weekday effects are included in the model:
