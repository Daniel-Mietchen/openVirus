<p>where 
 <italic>T</italic> is the total number of health care visits of the whole epidemic, 
 <italic>w</italic> is the weekday effects, 
 <italic>f</italic> is the normal distribution density function, 
 <italic>t</italic> is the day number, 
 <italic>m</italic> is the center of the epidemic (which coincides with 
 <italic>t</italic> for the peak), and 
 <italic>s</italic> is the spread in time. Since 
 <italic>t</italic>, 
 <italic>w</italic>, and 
 <italic>m</italic> are known, only the parameters 
 <italic>T</italic> and 
 <italic>s</italic> are estimated using 
 <italic>y</italic> in such way so that the likelihood is maximized. However, in order to do that, first appropriate starting values for these parameters need to be selected. Finally, using the known parameter 
 <italic>m</italic> and the estimated parameters 
 <italic>T</italic> and 
 <italic>s</italic>, the peak intensity at time 
 <italic>m</italic> is calculated by replacing 
 <italic>t</italic> with 
 <italic>m</italic> in equation (8).
