ABSTRACT</div> <p>Current influenza vaccines provide hemagglutinin strain-specific protection, but rarely provide cross-protection against divergent strains. It is, therefore, particularly important to develop a universal vaccine against conserved proteins or conserved regions of the virus. In this study, we used N-terminal extracellular region of the influenza virus M2 protein (M2e) as the target antigen and constructed two optimized M2e DNA vaccines (p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e) with increased antigenic epitope density and enhanced antigen secretion. Both vaccines induced high M2e-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in the vaccinated mice. These two vaccines also conferred protection against a lethal infection of homo-subtypic H1N1 virus, with p-tPA-p3M2e being the most effective. In addition, p-tPA-p3M2e also showed cross-protection against different subtypes of the influenza virus (H9N2, H6N6, and H10N8) at varying rates (80%, 40%, and 20%, respectively). After passive immunization, M2e DNA vaccine-induced antibodies in the sera provided complete protection against homologous virus challenge. An analysis of the mechanism underlying this immunization-mediated protection indicates that M2e-specific IgG and T-cell immune responses may play critical roles in the prevention of infection and viral clearance. Taken together, our results indicate that this optimized M2e DNA vaccine is a promising candidate for the development of a universal, broad-spectrum influenza virus vaccine.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p>Influenza is caused by the influenza virus, an important human respiratory infectious disease, which causes 250,000–500,000 deaths worldwide every year [<a href="#CIT0001">1</a>]. In recent years, drug-resistant strains and new types of influenza are continuously emerging, causing the influenza epidemic to be a constant and serious issue [<a href="#CIT0002">2</a>,<a href="#CIT0003">3</a>]. Vaccinations are the most effective way to control influenza. However, most of the influenza vaccines currently available are subtype-specific and fail to protect patients against other types or antigenic variants of the virus. Furthermore, the influenza virus undergoes frequent and unpredictable mutations that necessitate annual vaccine updates [<a href="#CIT0004">4</a>,<a href="#CIT0005">5</a>]. This not only limits the applicability of the vaccine but also wastes manpower and material resources. Thus, the development of universal vaccines that provide broad protection to control seasonal influenza epidemics and the occasional outbreak of pandemics is essential.</p> <p>Influenza virus M2 protein is an integral membrane protein expressed on the viral surface in low quantities, while being abundantly present on the surface of infected cells [<a href="#CIT0006">6</a>,<a href="#CIT0007">7</a>]. This expression pattern plays an important role in viral replication. The M2 protein consists of an N-terminal extracellular region (M2e), transmembrane region, and C-terminal cytoplasmic tail region. The M2e is composed of 24 amino acids and is highly conserved among different influenza A subtypes [<a href="#CIT0008">8</a>]. Thus, this region may be a good candidate epitope for the preparation of a universal vaccine. However, in its natural state, viral M2e has low immunogenicity and abundance. To improve immunogenicity, previous studies have used multimeric forms of M2e created by fusing M2e to highly immunogenic carriers or by applying them in conjunction with adjuvants. The main types of vaccines include peptide vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, and virus-like particles [<a href="#CIT0009">9–13</a>]. Currently, several M2e universal vaccines have entered clinical trials. However, some problems surfaced during clinical trials, which prevented the commercialization of these vaccines [<a href="#CIT0013">13</a>,<a href="#CIT0014">14</a>]. Some of the more prominent problems include unsatisfactory immune efficacy and certain side effects. These problems may be due to the vaccine containing multiple ingredients [<a href="#CIT0015">15</a>]. Moreover, this type of vaccine has a relatively high cost of production and a complex manufacturing technique, which further limits its development. Therefore, further research on M2e vaccine is necessary. Among the various types of vaccines, DNA vaccines are particularly attractive because of their simplicity, ease of production, and lack of anti-vector immune responses. Though the development of novel cross-protective influenza vaccines based on M2e DNA is a promising strategy, few of the enhanced immunogenic vaccine strategies have been successful. Thus, further research is necessary.</p> <p>In this study, we used a combination strategy to improve the immunogenicity of the M2e DNA vaccine. First, we increased M2e epitope density using a combined gene construct containing three M2e genes in tandem (3M2e). Next, 3M2e gene codon optimization (p3M2e) was performed to increase expression. Finally, we coupled p3M2e with the secretory signal sequence of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to form tPA-p3M2e to improve protein secretion. These enhanced M2e DNA vaccines were then tested in mice to determine the protective effects against the influenza virus. To our knowledge, this is the first time an optimized M2e DNA vaccine with these particular modifications has been tested <i>in vivo</i> against both homologous and heterologous viruses.</p> </div> <div class="results" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Enhanced expression and secretion of optimized M2e in vitro</div> <p>Three sequential repeats of the M2e gene, conjugated with linkers, were joined to the C-terminus of tPA (p-tPA-p3M2e) or without tPA (p-p3M2e) (<a href="#F0001">Figure 1</a>(A)). To detect expression <i>in vitro</i>, p-p3M2e and p-tPA-p3M2e were transfected into 293T cells and western blotting was performed. As shown in <a href="#F0001">Figure 1</a>(B) and (C), the p-tPA-p3M2e was more highly expressed than p-p3M2e in the cell lysates and supernatants. In fact, M2e protein expression was undetectable in the supernatants of the cells transfected with p-p3M2e. These data indicate that the addition of the tPA signalling sequence greatly enhanced the expression and secretion of 3M2e protein in 293T cells. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 1.</span></a></div>   <p>Construction and characterization of the M2e DNA constructs.

The levels of M2e-speci�?c antibodies were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using synthesized M2e peptide as the antigen. Our results show that M2e-specific antibodies are present in both the p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e immunized groups 2 weeks after the initial immunization (<a href="#F0003">Figure 3</a>(A)). Furthermore, while antibody titer increased following each immunization for both groups, the levels were higher in the group immunized with p-tPA-p3M2e than those observed for the p-p3M2e group (<a href="#F0003">Figure 3</a>(A), (D), (G)). Notably, no M2e-specific antibodies were detected in the p-tPA-pM2e, p-pM2e, or pVAX1 immunized groups. To further evaluate the T-cell-related immune effects of p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e, specifically the Th1/Th2 immune response, we tested the IgG1 and IgG2a titers in the serum samples. High levels of IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were induced in both the p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e immunized groups, suggesting that they both induce a Th1/Th2-related immune response (<a href="#F0003">Figure 3</a>(B), (E), (H)). Moreover, the M2e-specific IgG1 and M2e-specific IgG2a titers were similar, indicating that p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e induced a balanced Th1/Th2 immune response. To determine whether the antibodies produced following M2e DNA vaccination recognize native M2 protein, we performed a whole-cell ELISA assay. Our results show that the serum of mice immunized with p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e specifically binds to H1N1-infected MDCK cells, indicating that the M2e-specific antibodies induced by p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e immunization recognize the M2 protein on the surface of cells infected with influenza virus (Figure S1). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Figure 2.</span></a></div>   <p>Schematic of the study.

Optimized M2e conferred protection against heterologous avian influenza virus infection</div> <p>To further determine the potential universal effects of p-tPA-p3M2e DNA vaccination against heterologous viruses, mice were infected with avian origin, mouse-adapted H9N2, H6N6, and H10N8 viruses. As shown in <a href="#F0005">Figure 5</a>(A), (D), (G), we found that the protection rates of p-tPA-p3M2e immunization against heterologous viral infection with H9N2, H6N6, and H10N8 were 80%, 40%, and 20%, respectively. However, this immunization-mediated protection was only significant for the H9N2 infected group compared to the viral challenged control group that was immunized with empty pVAX1 (<i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05). The differences between the immunized H6N6 and H10N8 groups and their respective control groups were not significant.

Protective efficacy is correlated with humoral and cellular immune responses</div> <p>To better understand the relationship between protective efficiency and the humoral and cellular immune responses, correlation coefficients were calculated.

Discussion</div> <p>At present, conventional influenza vaccines must be evaluated almost every year to follow the antigenic drift and shift of the target virus [<a href="#CIT0005">5</a>]. Mismatch between the circulating strains of influenza virus and vaccine strain may result in excessive influenza-related morbidity and mortality. This makes it necessary to develop a universal vaccine based on conserved epitopes, such as M2e. In this study, we created a novel M2e DNA vaccine which induced significant humoral and cellular immune responses and reduced lung virus titer and weight loss rate. This vaccine not only provided better protection against homologous viruses but also had good cross-protection effect with other heterologous viruses. To our knowledge, this is the first time an optimized M2e DNA vaccine with these particular modifications has been tested <i>in vivo</i> against both homologous and heterologous viruses.</p> <p>M2e is known to have low immunogenicity. Previous studies have indicated that multiple tandem copies of M2e in a vaccine construct elicit higher M2e IgG titers than constructs containing a single copy [<a href="#CIT0011">11–13</a>]. In the present study, p3M2e was created and appears to induce higher production of M2e-specific antibodies than single-copy vaccines, which is consistent with previous research result. It has also been reported that secretory antigens can induce stronger immune responses than their cell-associated counterparts [<a href="#CIT0016">16–19</a>]. tPA is a signalling peptide located in the endoplasmic reticulum that is commonly used to promote the secretion of foreign proteins. Therefore, we coupled p3M2e with tPA to increase protein expression and secretion. Indeed, our results indicate that p-tPA-p3M2e vaccination induced higher expression and secretion of M2e protein and also induced greater humoral and cellular immune responses than p-p3M2e (<a href="#F0003">Figure 3</a>). Moreover, when challenged with homologous virus (H1N1), p-tPA-p3M2e achieved complete protection after only two immunizations, while p-p3M2e failed to achieve complete protection even after three immunizations. Taken together, these results not only demonstrate that increasing the expression of secreted M2e protein enhances its immune effects but also highlight the effectiveness of the particular modifications used in this study.</p> <p>The mechanism underlying the observed M2e vaccination-mediated increase in immune protection is not completely clear at present. However, other reports have also shown that M2e-specific antibodies play an important role in protective immunity [<a href="#CIT0020">20–22</a>]. Indeed, anti-M2e antibody titer has been closely correlated to dose-dependent disruption of the viral life cycle and death of the infected cells via antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [<a href="#CIT0022">22</a>,<a href="#CIT0023">23</a>]. In the present study, high antibody titers were induced in the p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e immunization groups, both of which demonstrated increased protection against challenge with homologous virus (H1N1). In addition, mice with M2e antibody-mediated passive immunity were also shown to be completely protected against H1N1 challenge, further indicating that M2e-specific antibodies play an important role in protective immunity. We also observed M2e-specific IFN-γ-secreting lymphocytes in the spleens of vaccinated animals, and these levels were found to be significantly correlated with protection. Notably, the p-tPA-p3M2e vaccine induced a higher T-cell response than p-p3M2e, which is likely related to the ability of the secreted protein to affect other cell types.</p> <p>In cross-protection experiments on p-tPA-p3M2e DNA immunized mice, vaccination also appears to be effective against the heterologous viruses H9N2, H6N6, and H10N8. The difference in cross-protection rates (80%, 40%, and 20%, respectively) is likely due to the differences in the M2e sequence between the heterologous viruses and the H1N1 virus (<a href="#T0001">Table 1</a>). The M2e sequences of H9N2, H10N8, and H6N6 differ from that of H1N1 by four, six, and seven residues, respectively. These differences, which affect antibody binding to the heterologous M2e protein, result in failure of the vaccine to effectively clear the virus. Indeed, serum IgG antibodies from mice vaccinated with p-tPA-p3M2e appear to recognize M2e of these three viruses expressed on infected MDCK cells, but bind to them more weakly compared to H1N1-infected MDCK cells (data not shown). <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" id="T0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 1.</span> </div></p><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

After incubation, the cells were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Boster, Wuhan, China) for 1 h at 37°C, followed by TMB Horseradish Peroxidase Color Development Solution for ELISA (Beyotine Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 50 μL of 2 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and the OD<sub>450</sub> was measured on a microplate spectrophotometer.

Viral titration</div> <p>MDCK cells were seeded (<i>n</i> = 4) at 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well in a 96-well plate. After being cultured for 12 h, the cells were infected with 100 μL of a 1/10-dilution series of lung homogenate supernatant and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The supernatants were then replaced with 200 μL of serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing a cocktail of antibiotics. The cytopathic effects in the infected MDCK cells were observed daily. After incubating for 3 days, virus titer was assayed in the supernatant by measuring hemagglutinating activity and processing these data using the calculations of Reed and Muench.</p> </div> <div class="enzyme-linkedimmunospot(elispot)assay" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay</div> <p>Splenocytes were isolated from mice for ELISPOT assays 2 weeks after the final immunization. According to manufacturer’s instructions (U-CyTech, Netherlands), the immunospot plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were coated with rat anti-mouse interferon (IFN)-γ monoclonal antibody and incubated at 4°C overnight. The plates were washed three times with sterile PBS and then blocked with 200 µL of blocking solution R. Next, 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> splenocytes were added to the wells in triplicate. After stimulating the splenocytes with 10 µg/mL of M2e peptide at 37°C for 18 h, biotinylated anti-mouse IFN-γ antibody was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently, diluted streptavidin-HRP conjugate solution was added and incubated at RT for 2 h. Finally, the plates were treated with 100 µL of AEC substrate solution and incubated at RT for 20 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped by washing with demineralized water.

Passive immunization and viral challenge</div> <p>To prepare a high titer of M2e-immune serum, BALB/c mice (<i>n</i> = 30) were immunized with 50 μg p-tPA-p3M2e vaccine construct as described above. A second group of mice (<i>n</i> = 30) was immunized with empty pVAX1 vector. Mice were immunized three times at 2-week intervals. Two weeks after the final immunization, 20 mice were killed and the other 10 mice from each group were used as controls. Blood samples were collected, and serum was prepared by clotting the blood at 37°C for 30 min followed by centrifugation. A total of 10 naive mice were immunized by tail vein injection with 300 μL of pooled serum from the mice immunized with p-tPA-p3M2e. Another group of 10 naive mice received the same amount of pooled serum from the mice immunized with only pVAX1. After 24 h, the mice were anesthetized and challenged with H1N1 influenza virus as described above. Mortality and morbidity (weight loss) were monitored for 21 days after challenge [<a href="#CIT0030">30</a>].</p> </div> <div class="statistics" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
