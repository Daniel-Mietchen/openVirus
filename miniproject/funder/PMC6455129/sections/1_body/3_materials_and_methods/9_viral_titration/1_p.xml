<p>MDCK cells were seeded (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) at 2 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well in a 96-well plate. After being cultured for 12 h, the cells were infected with 100 μL of a 1/10-dilution series of lung homogenate supernatant and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The supernatants were then replaced with 200 μL of serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing a cocktail of antibiotics. The cytopathic effects in the infected MDCK cells were observed daily. After incubating for 3 days, virus titer was assayed in the supernatant by measuring hemagglutinating activity and processing these data using the calculations of Reed and Muench.
