<p>Whole-cell ELISA for M2e-specific antibodies was performed in 96 well plates using a previously published procedure with some modifications [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In brief, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells were grown in 96-well culture plates in minimum essential medium (MEM) complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C until the cells were almost conﬂuent. The cells were then incubated with 10
 <sup>6</sup> EID
 <sub>50</sub> of H1N1 viruses (100 μL) in PBS or with medium alone (for uninfected controls). After incubating for 2 h at 37°C, 200 μL of complete medium was added to each well and plates were incubated at 37°C for 16 h. The plates were then washed with PBS and ﬁxed with 10% formalin at RT for 10 min. Then, the cells were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 200 μL/well PBS/3% BSA for 2 h at 37°C. Serial dilutions of tested sera were added to the wells and incubated for 1–2 h at 37°C. After incubation, the cells were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Boster, Wuhan, China) for 1 h at 37°C, followed by TMB Horseradish Peroxidase Color Development Solution for ELISA (Beyotine Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) for 10 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 50 μL of 2 mol/L H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub> and the OD
 <sub>450</sub> was measured on a microplate spectrophotometer. Data reﬂect the mean change in OD (infected–uninfected) of triplicate wells per sample.
