<p>Statistical analyses were conducted by one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-test using SPSS for Windows software (ver. 17, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). An unpaired two-tailed Student’s 
 <italic>t-test</italic> was used to compare the means between different groups. A 
 <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The differences in survival rate between the groups were analysed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Results are expressed as the means ± standard deviations (SD).
