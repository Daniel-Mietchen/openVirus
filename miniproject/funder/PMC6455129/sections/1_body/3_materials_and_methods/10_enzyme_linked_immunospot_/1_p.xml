<p>Splenocytes were isolated from mice for ELISPOT assays 2 weeks after the final immunization. According to manufacturer’s instructions (U-CyTech, Netherlands), the immunospot plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA) were coated with rat anti-mouse interferon (IFN)-γ monoclonal antibody and incubated at 4°C overnight. The plates were washed three times with sterile PBS and then blocked with 200 µL of blocking solution R. Next, 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> splenocytes were added to the wells in triplicate. After stimulating the splenocytes with 10 µg/mL of M2e peptide at 37°C for 18 h, biotinylated anti-mouse IFN-γ antibody was added to each well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently, diluted streptavidin-HRP conjugate solution was added and incubated at RT for 2 h. Finally, the plates were treated with 100 µL of AEC substrate solution and incubated at RT for 20 min in the dark. The reaction was stopped by washing with demineralized water. Spots were quantified with an ELISPOT reader (Bioreader 4000; Bio-sys, Germany).
