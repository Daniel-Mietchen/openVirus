<p>M2e-specific antibodies were tested using plates coated with 10 μg/mL of M2e synthetic peptides in 96 well plates by ELISA as described previously [
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To identify the M2e-specific antibody isotypes, the serum samples were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin-PBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature (RT). After washing, 100 μL of biotinylated anti-mouse IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., USA) conjugated to streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were added and incubated for 1 h at RT. The samples were then incubated with 3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate for 10 min, and then the reaction was stopped with 1 M phosphoric acid. The end-point ELISA titers are expressed as the highest dilution that yielded an optical density greater than the mean plus two times the standard deviation of a similarly diluted negative control sample.
