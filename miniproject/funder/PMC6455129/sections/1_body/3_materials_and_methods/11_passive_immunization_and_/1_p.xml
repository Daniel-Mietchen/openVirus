<p>To prepare a high titer of M2e-immune serum, BALB/c mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 30) were immunized with 50 μg p-tPA-p3M2e vaccine construct as described above. A second group of mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 30) was immunized with empty pVAX1 vector. Mice were immunized three times at 2-week intervals. Two weeks after the final immunization, 20 mice were killed and the other 10 mice from each group were used as controls. Blood samples were collected, and serum was prepared by clotting the blood at 37°C for 30 min followed by centrifugation. A total of 10 naive mice were immunized by tail vein injection with 300 μL of pooled serum from the mice immunized with p-tPA-p3M2e. Another group of 10 naive mice received the same amount of pooled serum from the mice immunized with only pVAX1. After 24 h, the mice were anesthetized and challenged with H1N1 influenza virus as described above. Mortality and morbidity (weight loss) were monitored for 21 days after challenge [
