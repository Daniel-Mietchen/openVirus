<p>Blood was collected 14 days after each immunization, and serum was isolated for antibody detection. Serum samples were stored at −20°C until use. Mice from each group (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) were sacrificed 3 days after viral challenge with H1N1, H9N2, H10N8, or H6N6 and their lungs were isolated. Lung homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatants were collected for viral titration via TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay.
