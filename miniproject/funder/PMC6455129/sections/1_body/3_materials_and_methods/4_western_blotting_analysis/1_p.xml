<p>293T cells were plated onto six-well plates. Approximately 24 h after plating, the cells were transfected with the vector plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells and supernatants were collected separately 48 h after transfection. The proteins in the cell lysates and supernatants were separated using non-reducing SDS-PAGE (12% gel) and blotted onto PVDF membranes. The membranes were then immunoblotted with influenza A M2 Monoclonal Antibody14C2 (Abcam, UK).</p>
