 <italic>In vivo</italic> electroporation was performed according to the method described by Aihara and Miyazaki [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To evaluate the capability of DNA vaccination to protect against homologous influenza infection, a total of nine groups of 6-week-old BALB/c mice (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13 mice per group) were respectively immunized with 50 μg of p-p3M2e (three groups immunized once, twice, and three times, respectively), p-tPA-p3M2e (three groups immunized once, twice, and three times, respectively), p-tPA-pM2e (1 group immunized three times), p-pM2e (1 group immunized three times), and empty pVAX1 (1 group immunized three times). This also allowed us to examine the effects of immunization time on the protective effects of p-p3M2e and p-tPa-p3M2e. The p-tPA-pM2e, p-pM2e, and pVAX1 immunizations were used as a reference. Notably, the different plasmids (in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)) were injected into the right quadricep muscle of each mouse. After injection, a pair of electrode needles were inserted into the muscle 5 mm apart to cover the DNA injection sites, and electric pulses were delivered using an electric pulse generator (ECM830; BTX, San Diego, CA). Two weeks after the last immunization, the mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (C

 <sub>3</sub>) at a dose of 50 mg kg mL
 <sup>−1</sup> for each animal and challenged with 20 μL of the viral suspension containing 10 times the LD
 <sub>50</sub> of H1N1, the homologous virus, by intranasal drip. After viral challenge (3 days), three mice were taken from each group for blood collection, and their lungs were removed to prepare lung homogenates for measuring the virus titration. The remaining mice were observed for 21 days to record the survival rates and weight loss.
