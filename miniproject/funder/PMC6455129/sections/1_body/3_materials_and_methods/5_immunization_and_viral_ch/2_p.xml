<p>As p-tPA-p3M2e immunization induced high titer and homogenous M2e-specific antibody production, we focused on this immunization group for the heterologous virus challenge experiment. A total of 78 mice were divided into six groups (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13 mice per group). Three groups were immunized three times with 50 μg of p-tPA-p3M2e at 2-week intervals. The other three groups were immunized with empty pVAX1 as a control. Two weeks after the third immunization, the p-tPA-p3M2e and pVAX1 immunization groups were challenged with nasal drips of 10 times the LD
 <sub>50</sub> of H9N2, H10N8, and H6N6 influenza viruses, respectively. The mice were observed for 21 days after viral challenge, during which weight loss and survival rate were recorded. Virus titers in the lungs collected at day 3 post-challenge were tested via TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay.
