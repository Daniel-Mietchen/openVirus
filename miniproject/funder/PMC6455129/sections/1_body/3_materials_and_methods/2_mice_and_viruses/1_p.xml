<p>The influenza viruses used were a mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), influenza virus A/Chicken/Jiangsu/7/2002 (H9N2), influenza virus A/environment/Dongting Lake/Hunan/3–9/2007 (H10N8), and influenza virus A/Duck/HB/5/2010 (H6N6). The H9N2, H10N8, and H6N6 influenza viruses were passaged and adapted for mouse studies as described in our previous studies [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24–26</xref>]. The prepared viruses were then frozen at −80°C until use. Notably, the H9N2, H10N8, and H6N6 viruses were all used in a biosafety level 2 containment facility at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
