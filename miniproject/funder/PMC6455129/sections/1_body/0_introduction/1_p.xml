<p>Influenza is caused by the influenza virus, an important human respiratory infectious disease, which causes 250,000â€“500,000 deaths worldwide every year [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In recent years, drug-resistant strains and new types of influenza are continuously emerging, causing the influenza epidemic to be a constant and serious issue [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Vaccinations are the most effective way to control influenza. However, most of the influenza vaccines currently available are subtype-specific and fail to protect patients against other types or antigenic variants of the virus. Furthermore, the influenza virus undergoes frequent and unpredictable mutations that necessitate annual vaccine updates [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This not only limits the applicability of the vaccine but also wastes manpower and material resources. Thus, the development of universal vaccines that provide broad protection to control seasonal influenza epidemics and the occasional outbreak of pandemics is essential.
