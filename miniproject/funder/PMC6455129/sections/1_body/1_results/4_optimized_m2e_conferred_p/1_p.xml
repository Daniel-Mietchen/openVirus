<p>To further determine the potential universal effects of p-tPA-p3M2e DNA vaccination against heterologous viruses, mice were infected with avian origin, mouse-adapted H9N2, H6N6, and H10N8 viruses. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(A), (D), (G), we found that the protection rates of p-tPA-p3M2e immunization against heterologous viral infection with H9N2, H6N6, and H10N8 were 80%, 40%, and 20%, respectively. However, this immunization-mediated protection was only significant for the H9N2 infected group compared to the viral challenged control group that was immunized with empty pVAX1 (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), but the differences in the H6N6 and H10N8 challenged groups immunized with p-tPA-p3M2e compared to their respective control groups were not significant (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(B), (E), (H)). The weight loss rates of the p-tPA-p3M2e immunization groups were also lower than those in the respective control groups. Indeed, the surviving mice in the immunized groups began to recover by day 11 post-viral challenge (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(C), (F), (I)), while mice in the control immunized groups died within 11 days of the challenge and had body weight losses of over 25%. The above results demonstrate that vaccination with p-tPA-p3M2e protects mice from lethal infection with heterologous avian influenza strains, especially the H9N2 virus.
