<p>Three sequential repeats of the M2e gene, conjugated with linkers, were joined to the C-terminus of tPA (p-tPA-p3M2e) or without tPA (p-p3M2e) (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(A)). To detect expression 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, p-p3M2e and p-tPA-p3M2e were transfected into 293T cells and western blotting was performed. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(B) and (C), the p-tPA-p3M2e was more highly expressed than p-p3M2e in the cell lysates and supernatants. In fact, M2e protein expression was undetectable in the supernatants of the cells transfected with p-p3M2e. These data indicate that the addition of the tPA signalling sequence greatly enhanced the expression and secretion of 3M2e protein in 293T cells.
