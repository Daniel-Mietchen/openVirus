<p>Secretion of IFN-γ by spleen cells is known to reflect the cellular immune response after immunization. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(C), the number of spots produced after two immunizations with p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e was significantly higher than that of the control group (
 <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.01). The number of spots also gradually increased with each immunization for both groups (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>(F), (I)). These results further confirm the induction of an M2e-specific Th1/Th2 cell response following immunization with p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e. The control group also had several nonspecific spots (spot number ≤10/10
 <sup>6</sup> cells).
