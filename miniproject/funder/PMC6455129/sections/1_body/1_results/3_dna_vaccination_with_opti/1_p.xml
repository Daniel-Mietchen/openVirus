<p>To determine the protective effects of p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e vaccination, mice were infected with lethal mouse-adapted H1N1 virus. As shown in 
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>(A), (D), (G), p-p3M2e and p-tPA-p3M2e DNA was immunized once, twice, or three times. In the p-p3M2e, the survival rates of mice after viral challenge were 30%, 70%, and 90%, respectively, while those for the p-tPA-p3M2e group were 80%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Thus, the survival rate of the p-tPA-p3M2e group was better than that of the p-p3M2e group with the same number of immunizations and was particularly significant for single immunization (
