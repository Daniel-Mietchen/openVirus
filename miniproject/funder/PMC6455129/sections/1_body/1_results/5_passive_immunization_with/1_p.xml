<p>Passive immunization was also performed to examine the protective efficacy of the immune serum of p-tPA-p3M2e or naked pVAX1 (controls) vaccinated mice. All mice injected with serum containing M2e-specific antibodies presented some clinical symptoms (eg ruffled hair and flocking together) after the challenge, but none of them died (
