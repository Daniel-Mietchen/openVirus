<p>To better understand the relationship between protective efficiency and the humoral and cellular immune responses, correlation coefficients were calculated. With respect to the humoral immune response, the survival percentage induced by 3M2e immunization was highly related to the total M2e-specific IgG antibody levels (Figure S2A). Moreover, the survival percentage was also markedly related to the M2e-specific cellular immune response (Figure S2B). Thus, the protective efficacy of 3M2e immunization appears to be related to both the humoral and cellular immune responses.</p>
