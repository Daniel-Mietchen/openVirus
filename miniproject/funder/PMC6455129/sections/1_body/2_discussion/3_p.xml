<p>The mechanism underlying the observed M2e vaccination-mediated increase in immune protection is not completely clear at present. However, other reports have also shown that M2e-specific antibodies play an important role in protective immunity [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20–22</xref>]. Indeed, anti-M2e antibody titer has been closely correlated to dose-dependent disruption of the viral life cycle and death of the infected cells via antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In the present study, high antibody titers were induced in the p-tPA-p3M2e and p-p3M2e immunization groups, both of which demonstrated increased protection against challenge with homologous virus (H1N1). In addition, mice with M2e antibody-mediated passive immunity were also shown to be completely protected against H1N1 challenge, further indicating that M2e-specific antibodies play an important role in protective immunity. We also observed M2e-specific IFN-γ-secreting lymphocytes in the spleens of vaccinated animals, and these levels were found to be significantly correlated with protection. Notably, the p-tPA-p3M2e vaccine induced a higher T-cell response than p-p3M2e, which is likely related to the ability of the secreted protein to affect other cell types.
