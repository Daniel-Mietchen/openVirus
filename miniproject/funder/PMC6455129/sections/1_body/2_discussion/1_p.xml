<p>At present, conventional influenza vaccines must be evaluated almost every year to follow the antigenic drift and shift of the target virus [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Mismatch between the circulating strains of influenza virus and vaccine strain may result in excessive influenza-related morbidity and mortality. This makes it necessary to develop a universal vaccine based on conserved epitopes, such as M2e. In this study, we created a novel M2e DNA vaccine which induced significant humoral and cellular immune responses and reduced lung virus titer and weight loss rate. This vaccine not only provided better protection against homologous viruses but also had good cross-protection effect with other heterologous viruses. To our knowledge, this is the first time an optimized M2e DNA vaccine with these particular modifications has been tested 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> against both homologous and heterologous viruses.
