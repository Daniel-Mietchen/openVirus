<p>In conclusion, we have described a potential universal influenza vaccine that provides protection against homo- and hetero-subtypic influenza in mice. Immunization with p-tPA-p3M2e, without any adjuvant, induced high level, M2e-specific antibody production, humoral/cellular immune responses, and protected BALB/c mice from lethal infections of homo- and hetero-subtypic viruses. The combined vaccine strategy offers promising prospects for further vaccine development.</p>
