<p id="Par10">Dr Scott O’Neill (Monash University, Vietnam) provided an update on the use of the intracellular bacteria 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> by the World Mosquito Programme (WMP) to disrupt dengue, Zika and chikungunya transmission by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> without the need to suppress the mosquito population. The aim of the WMP is to introduce 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected mosquitoes (male and female) into wild mosquito populations to increase the frequency of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> carrying mosquitoes and hence to interrupt disease transmission (known as a population replacement strategy) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Deployment of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> into 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations can be scaled to areas around 100 km
 <sup>2</sup> by releasing approximately 2–5 mosquitoes per person per week [

 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. The WMP has developed methods for low-cost, large-scale application across urban areas in countries affected by mosquito-borne diseases. The programme is now conducting efficacy trials in 11 countries (including Sri Lanka, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Kribati, Vanuatu, Fiji, New Caledonia, Mexico, Colombia and Brazil) in order to generate data in various epidemiological settings.
