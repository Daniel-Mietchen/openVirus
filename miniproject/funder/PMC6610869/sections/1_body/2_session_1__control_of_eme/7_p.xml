<p id="Par14">During the ensuing general discussion, members of the audience raised concerns about the deliberate introduction of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes as a key component of the deployment of the 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> technology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Indeed, this may favor the survival of released mosquitoes in areas where insecticides are in common use and might contribute to the spread and homogenization of resistance in natural populations. Dr O’Neill stated that the 
 <italic>Wolbachia-</italic>carrying mosquito strain was back-crossed with a local strain and that the resistance profile of released 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mosquitoes simply matched that of the local “wild type”. Dr O’Neill encouraged the integration of routine monitoring of insecticide resistance in future efficacy trials with 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-carrying mosquitoes.
