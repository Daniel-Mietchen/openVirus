<p id="Par11">Dr Didier Fontenille (Institut Pasteur, Cambodia) gave a talk entitled “
 <italic>Arbovirus vectors in South East Asia: a plea of ignorance</italic>”. Numerous factors such as deforestation/reforestation, climate change, urbanization, land use, pesticide use and human behavior contribute to the transmission risk. In Southeast Asia, particularly Cambodia, numerous gaps remain in our knowledge of the biology and ecology of arbovirus vectors and those gaps will remain as long as there is failure to develop the local research facilities and capacities required to address that goal. The recent introduction of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in several locations of Phnom Penh and the increasing resistance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> to public health pesticides may compromise vector control efforts. More than 6000 dengue cases were declared in Cambodia in 2018. Yellow fever is on the rise and the risk of autochthonous transmission in Asia-Pacific region has never been so high [

 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>) are urgently needed to improve the control of invasive mosquitoes and to prevent new arbovirus epidemics in the region.
