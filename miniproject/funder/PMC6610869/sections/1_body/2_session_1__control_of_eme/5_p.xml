<p id="Par12">Professor Lee Ching Ng (National Environment Agency, Singapore) presented progress and limitations during the implementation of the “
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> Singapore” project. The National Environment Agency (NEA) is evaluating the use of 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> males with the aim of breaking the dengue transmission through vector suppression (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This project relies on 4 pillars: surveillance; prevention and control; outbreak management; and community engagement. The Phase 1 field study implemented since October 2016 demonstrated that the released male 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes successfully competed with the urban male mosquitoes and were able to mate with the urban female mosquitoes. Most of the captured 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> males were collected within a short distance from the release point but did show a good distribution throughout the area. As a result, the releases led to a 50% suppression of the urban 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito population in the study sites. Since April 2018, NEA is conducting a Phase 2 study for improving the release methodologies to mitigate the problems presented by Singapore’s high density and high-rise urban landscape.
