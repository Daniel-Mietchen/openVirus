<p id="Par58">Typically, an epidemic is over by the time vector control is initiated. The ability to prevent an ABV epidemic, and furthermore measures preventative impacts of an existing or alternative VCT requires precise and rigorous early-warning systems for both immatures and adults, implemented by vector control units. These units must have appropriate technical expertise and leadership. Participants noted that technical capacity is missing and that many ABV endemic countries may not take these responsibilities. Leveraging the experience of the malaria control units to apply to arbovirus control was deemed a viable approach to consider overcoming this gap; however, it remains at a core that political will and financial support is ultimately needed. A proposed “Global Fund” for arboviral diseases should be a discussion point across stakeholders in order to facilitate building in-country capacity to respond more effectively to these threats.</p>
