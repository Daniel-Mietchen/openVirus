<p id="Par25">Mrs Erly Sintya Dewi (Universitas Warmadewa, Indonesia) presented the status of insecticide resistance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in the Indonesian island of Bali and its implications for dengue control. WHO tube tests carried out on field-caught 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquitoes showed low mortality rates when exposed to diagnostic concentrations of permethrin (5% mortality), alpha-cypermethrin (14% mortality) and to a lesser extent, malathion (60% mortality). Mosquitoes surviving permethrin exposure exhibited higher frequencies of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> S989P and V1016G alleles than those killed [

The use of “free-flight” tests in patchily treated rooms demonstrated that the Bali strain was far less affected by permethrin (48% mortality) than the susceptible Australian 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> strain used as a reference (94% mortality). Under similar conditions, malathion killed 100% of both 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> strains. This study demonstrates that insecticide resistance may compromise dengue vector operations relying on pyrethroids and the use of malathion represents the most pragmatic choice for the control of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> in Bali.
