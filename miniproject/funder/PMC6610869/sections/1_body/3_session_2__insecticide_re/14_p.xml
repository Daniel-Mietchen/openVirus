<p id="Par28">This session ended with a presentation from Dr Fabrice Chandre (Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, France) about insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategies applicable to mosquito vectors of arboviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This work coordinated by the Worldwide Insecticide Resistance Network (WIN) aimed at defining the principles and concepts underlying IRM, identifying the main factors affecting the evolution of resistance and evaluating the value of existing tools for resistance monitoring (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Based on the lessons taken from resistance management strategies used for other vector species and agricultural pests, the speaker emphasized on the need for urgent action to contain insecticide resistance in invasive mosquitoes and proposed a roadmap for the implementation of a global plan for IRM in
