<p id="Par23">Dr Jean-Philippe David (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Grenoble, France) presented the advantages of using an integrated approach combining experimental evolution, quantitative genetics and next-generation sequencing to identify novel genetic markers of insecticide resistance in the dengue mosquito 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti.</italic> Whilst there are well-established markers for target-site mechanisms, reliable markers for metabolic resistance remain rare. Recently, deep targeted DNA-sequencing successfully identified several copy number variations (CNV) affecting cytochrome P450s (Cyp6 &amp; Cyp9 families) that were associated with deltamethrin resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The number of CNV was significantly correlated with increased gene expression levels obtained from RNA-seq [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Molecular investigations of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> samples from Laos showed that genomic amplification of an esterase cluster previously associated with temephos resistance in larvae was also strongly associated with adult resistance to malathion. These findings demonstrate that CNVs are promising DNA markers for tracking metabolic resistance because (i) they are frequent in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, and (ii) they showed good association with resistance phenotype. These results pave the way for the development of novel diagnostic tools able to concomitantly track the whole range of insecticide resistance mechanisms in order to improve resistance monitoring and management.
