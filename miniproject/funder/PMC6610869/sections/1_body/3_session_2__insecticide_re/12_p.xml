<p id="Par26">The presentation of Dr Gabriela Gonzalez-Olvera (Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán, Mexico) focused on the impact of household aerosolized insecticides on pyrethroid-resistant 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti.</italic> Mismatch between the frequency of pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes and the occurrence of pyrethroid-based insecticide applications for vector control has been observed in many places in Latin America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and could be due to the intense household use of commercial insecticide products. Through experimental assays quantifying phenotypic and genotypic responses of mosquitoes exposed to commonly used household aerosols, the authors showed significantly lower mortality rates (40–50%) of three pyrethroid-resistant field 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> strains compared to the laboratory susceptible strain (99%). Applying insecticides as surface sprays led to a significant increase in the frequency of 
 <italic>kdr</italic> V1016I homozygotes in surviving 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, suggesting strong selection pressure for this allele [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Given the large-scale use of household aerosol insecticide products in areas that are endemic for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>-transmitted diseases, their role in selecting pyrethroid resistance, should be taken into consideration when designing resistance management plans.
