<p id="Par18">Dr Jo√£o Pinto (Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical, Portugal) reported the origin and insecticide susceptibility status of a recently introduced 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> population from Portugal. During the summer of 2017, two independent introduction events of the invasive mosquito 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were reported in Portugal from Hotel resorts located in Penafiel, Porto and Vilamoura, Faro. A preliminary analysis of 16 microsatellite loci suggest two independent origins for the introductions of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in north and south of Portugal [

 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to permethrin (0.25%), deltamethrin (0.03%), cyfluthrin (0.15%), and fenitrothion (1%), and suspected resistance to bendiocarb (1%) according to WHO criteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is important to continue mosquito surveillance and insecticide resistance monitoring to prevent the establishment and spread of invasive mosquitoes in Portugal.
