<p id="Par24">Dr Shinji Kasai (National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan) described the first occurrence of the knockdown resistance (
 <italic>kdr</italic>) allele V1016G in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in Asia and Europe. Overall, 30 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations were collected in Vietnam, Italy, Singapore, Brazil and Taiwan. Bioassays revealed that most populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were highly susceptible to permethrin but a few from Italy, Vietnam and Singapore, exhibited resistance. Genotyping studies detected the 
 <italic>kdr</italic> alleles F1534C in Vietnam and Singapore and F1534S in Vietnam and V1016G in samples from Vietnam and Italy for the first time in history [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Establishment of colonies homozygous for each 
 <italic>kdr</italic> allele showed that 1016G allele caused much greater levels of pyrethroid resistance (5- to 13-fold) than 1534C or 1534S. The occurrence of the V1016G 
 <italic>kdr</italic> mutation in the tiger mosquito represents a new threat to the control of this species worldwide.
