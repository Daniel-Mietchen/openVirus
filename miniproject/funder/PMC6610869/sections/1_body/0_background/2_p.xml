<p id="Par3">A recent systematic review [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] highlights that 57 countries already reported resistance or suspected resistance to at least one chemical class of insecticides in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. Resistance is now recognized as a major threat for the control of ABVs and has likely contributed to their re-emergence and spread in some parts of the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Important knowledge gaps remain on mosquito resistance including its distribution, dynamics, mechanisms, fitness costs and its impact on vector control efficacy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to review progress and achievements made in the deployment of integrated approaches and innovative technologies for the surveillance and control of arbovirus vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and to discuss their potential for mitigating insecticide resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].
