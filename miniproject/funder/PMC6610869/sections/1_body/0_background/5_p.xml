<p id="Par6">During this second conference, three scientific plenary sessions were organized: the first session dedicated to the “
 <italic>Control of emerging arboviral diseases</italic>” addressed the public health priorities and responses for reducing the burden of arboviral diseases. The second session was dedicated to “
 <italic>Insecticide resistance</italic>” and focused on the levels, spatial distribution, mechanisms and impact of insecticide resistance on arbovirus control and resistance management options. The last plenary session was dedicated to “
 <italic>Innovative vector control approaches</italic>” and presented community-based and integrated approaches for 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito control and discussed the latest developments (chemical, biological and genetic tools) for reducing arbovirus transmission. Each plenary session comprised multiple presentations by scientists followed by open discussions with all participants. Scientific sessions were followed by a plenary “
 <italic>Public-private initiatives in public health</italic>”, where representatives of the agrochemical sector, research institutions, vector control consortium and international organizations presented initiatives for fostering innovation in public health. In addition, 25 posters were presented by scientists and industry. Finally, two round tables open to all participants were organized to leverage the knowledge of the audience into strategies that may accelerate the translation of vector research into policies and programmes. The meeting agenda, list of speakers, registered participants and presentations are available at
