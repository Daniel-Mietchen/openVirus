<p id="Par44">Mr Jason Nash (Bayer, Singapore) focused on Fludora Co-Max®, a new space spray combination for mosquito resistance management programmes. The rationale for developing this product was to look at active ingredients originally developed for agriculture that meet the requirements to be used in public health. This formulation combines two active ingredients with different modes of action (i.e. flupyradifurone, a butenolide, and transfluthrin, a pyrethroid) to enhance the control of insecticide resistance mosquitoes. Outdoor vehicle-mounted ULV spray in the USA and Brazil showed optimal control of insecticide-resistant
