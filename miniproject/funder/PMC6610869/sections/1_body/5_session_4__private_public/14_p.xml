Since its creation, the WIN has published 6 review papers to fill knowledge gaps on topics related to vector resistance and IVM and has organized biannual international conferences to foster innovation and strengthening mosquito control and surveillance efforts worldwide [

The network has gained international recognition for its role in mosquito resistance and is now expanding to a membership organization aiming at gathering all actors involved in vector-borne disease control (i.e. academia, international organizations, NGOs, not for profit organization, and the private sector). The ultimate goal of WIN is to build a global partnership to support international efforts to reduce the global burden of ABVs by 2030.
