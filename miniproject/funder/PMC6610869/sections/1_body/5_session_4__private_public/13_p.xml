<p id="Par53">Dr Samuel Rund (Notre Dame University, USA) described the PopBioMap by VectorBase.org, an online resource for insecticide resistance data that was developed by Notre Dame University, Imperial College London and EMBL-EBI with financial support from NIH (

The PopBioMap module has been created to respond to the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes of public health importance. The PopBioMap is a graphical, map based, online tool for visualizing available information on the prevalence and mechanisms of insecticide resistance in vectors as well as surveillance data such as species, abundance, pathogen infections, etc. Data are submitted directly by researchers or extracted from publications by the VectorBase curators. The module contains significant amounts of genotypic and phenotypic data for major mosquito taxa (i.e.
