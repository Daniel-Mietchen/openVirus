<p id="Par43">Mr Peter DeChant (Valent BioSciences LLC, USA) presented IVM programmes relying on the use of 
 <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis</italic> var. 
 <italic>israelensis</italic> (Bti) strain AM65-52. Bti AM65-52 (Sumitomo Chemicals) has a unique mode of action, producing several cry toxins which in combination have high potential for resistance management [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Mr DeChant provided an overview of three observational studies conducted in Cambodia, Malaysia and Florida Keys, USA showing a strong impact of wide area application of Bti AM65-52 on the reduction of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> abundance and both dengue and Zika transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Integration of Bti AM65-52 into operational programmes offer interesting prospects to prevent future outbreaks and to preserve the lifespan of current insecticidal chemistries, which are at-risk of operational failure due to resistance.
