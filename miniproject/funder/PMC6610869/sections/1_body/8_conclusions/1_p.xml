 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne viral diseases are rapidly spreading globally, causing increasing health and economic losses. Social, environmental, and demographic changes have facilitated the selection, spread and proliferation of viruses, vectors and resistant alleles into new areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and has probably driven an increased use of insecticides by both households and public health authorities. As a consequence, the number of countries that have reported insecticide resistance in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes have dramatically increased in the last decade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A striking example is the recent introduction of the V1016G kdr mutation conferring resistance to pyrethroids in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> in Europe for the first time in history [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Resistance is now recognized as a growing public health challenge threatening the global fight against vector borne diseases. Despite the development of a dengue vaccine, its limited efficacy and the lack of any vaccines or drugs for other ABVs such as Zika and chikungyunya means that insecticides will remain an essential part of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne disease control programmes and outbreak responses. It is critical to preserve as long as we can the “lifespan” of new and existing molecules. As such, incentives and regulatory frameworks to support the concept of insecticide susceptibility of vectors as a “public good” should be considered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Since 2016, the WIN has established a network of internationally recognized experts to improve the surveillance and control of insecticide resistance in vectors of emerging arboviruses. The missions are to raise awareness and mobilize resources for strengthening country capacity in resistance monitoring, stimulating research efforts, advise decision makers for resistance management, and strengthen public-private partnership to accelerate the deployment of integrated VCTs. The ultimate goal of WIN is to support international efforts to reduce the global burden of ABVs by 2030.
