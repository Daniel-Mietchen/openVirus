<p id="Par40">The session ended with an open discussion highlighting the promising results obtained in the development of new technologies and tools for mosquito control but acknowledging that evidence is still lacking to support their massive deployment by national control programmes. Questions were raised about the operational impact of gene drive technologies for controlling wild mosquito populations. Mr Kyros indicated that the potential of gene drive systems for field applications will be further evaluated as part of a phased approach in large confined spaces that mimic real ecological conditions more closely, in accordance with the recommendations of the USA American National Academy of Sciences.</p>
