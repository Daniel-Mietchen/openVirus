<p id="Par33">Dr Sebastian Boyer (Institut Pasteur du Cambodge, Cambodia) presented results of a cluster randomized controlled trial aiming at evaluating an integrated vector control strategy (IVCS) targeting schools to prevent dengue and dengue-like syndrome (DLS). The trial was implemented in Kampong Cham Province, Cambodia with 24 clusters, 12 under integrated vector control and 12 without. Each cluster included one school, with an active surveillance of DLS in neighbouring villages (~15,000 children aged 5–15 years-old). The IVCS implied the removal of breeding sites in and around the school, the use of the bacterial insecticide 
 <italic>Bti</italic> in permanent domestic water containers, deployment of In2care® traps for the dissemination of pyriproxyfen and spores of 
 <italic>Beauveria bassiana</italic> and education and sensitization of children. Entomological preliminary data during the second year, following interventions, showed a 50% decrease in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> relative abundance in treated clusters compared to untreated clusters. Similarly, except for one school, there was a strong decrease in positive containers in all houses around the schools. Although epidemiological data acquisition is still in progress, first serological surveys showed fewer DLS in the treated (
 <italic>n</italic> = 485) than in the control cluster (
 <italic>n</italic> = 165), suggesting that IVM for dengue prevention worked well in schools.
