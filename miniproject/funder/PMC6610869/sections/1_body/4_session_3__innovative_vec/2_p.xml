<p id="Par30">Professor Dina Fonseca (Rutgers University, USA) opened this session by presenting a “success story” for the control of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes through a “Citizen Action through Science” (Citizen AcTS) approach that engages community members to perform mosquito control in their yards. This approach was tested in a NE US town of approximately 1000 residential yards infested with the invasive Asian tiger mosquito, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. After consulting with Rutgers entomologists, members of the community purchased, deployed and maintained 1032 Gravid 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> Traps (GATs) two per yard out of 954 potential yards (46%) starting in June of 2017. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention during August and September a team from Rutgers deployed BG Sentinel traps in 19 yards across the town. They found that a GAT coverage higher than 80% in neighborhood clusters resulted in significant decreases in host-seeking female 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. This community-based approach works through respectful exchanges among scientists and residents that lead to trust and individual ‘buy-in’. Results of the surveys were quickly provided to the residents at the end of the season and have helped maintain the interest and enthusiasm.
