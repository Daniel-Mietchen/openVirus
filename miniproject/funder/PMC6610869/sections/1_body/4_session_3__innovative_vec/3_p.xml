<p id="Par31">The development of a new gravid trap for mosquito surveillance and control in Singapore was the central topic of the presentation by Dr Chee-Seng Chong (Environmental Health Institute, National Environment Agency (NEA), Singapore &amp; Nanyang Technological University, Singapore). The Gravitrap is a black cylindrical contraption that contains aged hay infusion as a lure to attract female 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes that are seeking water containers to lay their eggs. Gravitraps were placed in 2013 in 580 residential blocks within 34 sentinel locations to address the spatial dynamics of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. After 5 years, 50,000 datapoints were recorded for resource prioritization. The results show that 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes were heterogeneously distributed among blocks and among floors within the block. The abundance of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was positively associated with the age of the blocks. A before-after-control-impact (BACI) analysis to compare the dengue-case ratio between estates with and without Gravitraps indicated a 30% reduction in case burden in estates with Gravitraps. Beyond providing spatial and temporal data on vector risk, the direct removal of the adult females by Gravitraps deployed in public housing has shown to have an epidemiological impact.
