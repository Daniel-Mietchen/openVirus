<p id="Par37">Professor Gregor Devine (QIMR Berghofer, Australia) presented a talk on targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) for the control of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. TIRS consists of spraying walls below 1.5 m and dark areas under furniture that are the favorite resting places for 
 <italic>Ae aegypti</italic>. A retrospective study of public health GIS data from Cairns, Australia showed that contact tracing coupled with TIRS (lambdacyalothrin) around case residences and their potential exposure locations reduced the probability of future DENV transmission by 86â€“96%, compared to unsprayed premises [

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> strain was further evaluated in Merida, Mexico. A clustered randomized control trial showed that TIRS and Resting-Site-IRS took 31% and 82% less time to apply, respectively, and used 38% and 85% less insecticide, respectively, than conventional IRS. The mortality of pyrethroid-resistant 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> did not differ significantly among the three IRS application methods for up to two months post-application, and did not significantly differ between conventional IRS and TIRS up to four months post-application. These data illustrate that optimizing IRS to more efficiently target 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> can both reduce application time and insecticide volume without reducing entomological efficacy.
