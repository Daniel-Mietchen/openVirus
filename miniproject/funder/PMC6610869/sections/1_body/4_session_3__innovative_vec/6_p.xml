<p id="Par34">Dr David Roiz (IRD, MIVEGEC, France) presented a framework for the implementation of an integrated 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> management (IAM) for the control of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. IAM has been developed by the WIN network to provide national authorities with a comprehensive evidence-based guidance on how and when to implement 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> control measures. IAM consists of a portfolio of operational actions and priorities for the control of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>-borne viruses that are tailored to different epidemiological and entomological risk scenarios. The framework has four activity pillars: (i) integrated vector and disease surveillance, (ii) vector control, (iii) community mobilisation, and (iv) intra- and intersectoral collaboration; and four supporting activities: (i) capacity building, (ii) research, (iii) advocacy, and (iv) policies and laws (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). IAM supports the implementation of the WHO Global Vector Control Response that aims to devise and deliver sustainable, effective, integrated, community-based, locally adapted vector control strategies in order to reduce the burden of vector borne diseases worldwide.
