<p>More importantly, vaccination coverage was particularly low in children under 16 years in the municipalities of Saint-Laurent (40.1%, 95% CI: 21.6–61.9), Papaïchton (51.9%, 95% CI: 26.0–76.8) and Grand-Santi (52.7%, 95% CI: 25.1–78.7), while the coverage level was estimated at 97.1%, 95% CI: 94.5–98.5 in the other municipalities. More than 40% (N = 23/51) of unvaccinated children aged 3–16 years living in these municipalities were not enrolled in school. Most of them (91%) had parents born in Surinam or Guyana, and 72% of the children were born in French Guiana. Nearly 70% of the unvaccinated adults living in these municipalities were born outside of the country, and 30% had lived in French Guiana for less than 10 years.
