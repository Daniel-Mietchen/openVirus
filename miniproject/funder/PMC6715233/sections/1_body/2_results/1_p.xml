 <xref rid="pntd.0007661.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), representing 58% of eligible household members. The mean household size was 1.9 individuals [range: 1 to 11]. The mean age was 30.5, ranging from 2 to 75 years old. Comparison of the sociodemographic characteristics of the study sample with census data demonstrated an overrepresentation of women (58.9% vs. 50.0% in the general population of French Guiana) and adults over 25 years (64% vs. 53% in French Guiana). These differences were accounted for in the analyses of vaccination coverage and risk factors by allocating a poststratification weight to each participant. Vaccination coverage for YF (at least one dose) was estimated at 95.0% (95% CI: 93.2â€“96.3) throughout the entire region of French Guiana (

The number of booster doses received by vaccinated individuals ranged from 1 to 6. The mean age at vaccination was 1.7 years among children under 10 born in French Guiana.
