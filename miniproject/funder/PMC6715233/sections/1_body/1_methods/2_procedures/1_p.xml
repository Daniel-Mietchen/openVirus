<p>Publicity and information about the survey were provided through the media and contact with local and national authorities. Fieldworker teams were trained to visit all households, explain the project objectives, and, when allowed, collect participants’ signatures on a free and informed consent form and conduct the interviews. All household members of selected households who were 2–75 years of age were invited to take part in the study. For all participants under 18 years of age, one or two responsible adults signed the informed consent form. Data were collected through a standardized questionnaire installed on tablets to register demographic, socioeconomic and household characteristics. Vaccination cards or any other proof-of-vaccination documents were requested from all participants. Vaccination status was based on presented vaccination cards and verbal reports of vaccination when vaccination cards were not available.</p>
