Co-chaired by experts in both HIV and HBV fields, the Forum focused specifically on the intersection between the scientific efforts in hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HIV-1 cure research and sought to encourage interaction between these two disciplines to accelerate the pace of cure discovery in both fields.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0004">Despite significant differences in HIV-1 and HBV clinical disease course, there are many similarities and shared challenges facing the development of a cure for each of the two infections (summarised in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="JVEv5-fea-0001">Box 1</xref>). The Forum aimed to bring together specialists from the two research fields to foster an exchange of ideas and highlight the benefits of interdisciplinary research. Research in both a HIV-1 and HBV cure share many similarities that range from basic science, pathogenesis and persistence to innovative therapeutic approaches. Identifying and quantifying viral reservoirs are both key aims for both infections, and, since both viruses have a reverse transcription step, there may be common therapeutic approaches either to eliminate the virus or to redirect immune responses.</p><boxed-text id="JVEv5-fea-0001" position="float" content-type="general" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title id="JVEv5-title-0002">Similarities and differences in HIV-1 and HBV infections and shared barriers to finding a cure</title></caption><table-wrap id="JVEv5-tbl-0001" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" id="JVEv5-t-0001"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">HIV-1</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBV</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Differences</bold>

Re-purposing of existing pharmaceutical compounds as well as reverse and forward chemical genetics were proposed as methods to identify those that could lead to cccDNA inactivation.

New advances are keenly awaited to understand their therapeutic potential.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0037">The overview of the HBV replication cycle highlighted specific targets that may be considered for developing curative therapy. Efficient cccDNA disabling, which would eliminate the template for virus production is a focus of many HBV researchers, and, although achieving this crucial goal remains challenging, the field is poised to see significant progress in the near future.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0038">Alternative targets for novel directly-acting anti-HBV agents include entry inhibitors such as Myrcludex B, capsid assembly disruptors (see summary of closing lecture) and HBV secretion inhibitors <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

The advantage of these assays is their ability to simultaneously characterise other cellular and molecular features of primary infected cells. These include assay of surface receptor expression (HIV-Flow), gene expression (latency cell capture, HIV-1 SortSeq), integration site and HIV-1 splicing (HIV-1 SortSeq). However, these may have limitations related to the activation process, which may alter the cell phenotype.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0061">Dr Cohn provided updates on technical advancements in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) techniques, which now enable high-throughput analyses and have the potential to significantly advance the field of HIV-1 cure research. The Seq-Well is a portable, low-input massively parallel scRNA-Seq platform, which allows robust single cell transcriptional analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from clinically acquired specimens in the order of 10,000 cells/sample <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0016" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. This analytical approach was applied to samples from participants prior to and immediately after HIV-1 infection from the FRESH cohort and revealed important characteristics of the immune response dynamics in terms of cell types, status, interactions and associated drivers. Additionally, it has facilitated the critical understanding of cellular events associated with spontaneous control of infection in the absence of treatment. A potential challenge for using this approach is the sophisticated infrastructure and human capacity that are needed to deal with large datasets and the complexity of integrating sequencing data with available analytical techniques.</p></sec><sec id="JVEv5-sec-0004"><label>2.2&#x02002;</label><title id="JVEv5-title-0006">Seq-Well: portable, low-cost high-throughput RNA sequencing of single cells</title><p id="JVEv5-para-0062">Another challenge involves addressing the relevance of sequences of circulating virions found after rebound following treatment interruption to those found in infected cells. Prior work has suggested that intact proviruses identified from near full-length sequence analyses of circulating cells show approximately 40% overlap with viral sequences identified using viral outgrowth assays (VOAs), but no overlap with rebound viruses. The latter may, however, contribute to recombinant viruses found in 
blood <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0063">Measurement of CD4 T cells in blood as a biomarker for cure is also complicated as those present in circulation make up only a minority of the total number of CD4 T cells in the body <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The limitations of monitoring CD4 T cells in blood must be weighed against the risks and limitations of more invasive sampling strategies.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0064">The challenges in terms of biomarkers to monitor HIV-1 cure are comparable to those in HBV cure research where cccDNA is relatively inaccessible to sampling and the surface antigen (HBVsAg) expression does not confirm the presence of replication-competent virus. Researchers in both fields take into account that a reliable biomarker for cure will need to reflect true disease remission in tissue and not only in blood.</p></sec><sec id="JVEv5-sec-0005"><label>2.3&#x02002;</label><title id="JVEv5-title-0007">Clonal integration site expansion of infected cells is a main contributor of HIV-1 persistence in more differentiated T cell subsets during suppressive ART</title><p id="JVEv5-para-0065">Incomplete understanding of the drivers of viral persistence remains a major barrier in the field of HIV-1 cure. Numerous studies have reported that a large proportion of the viral reservoir is made of clonally expanded infected cells, which may arise from homeostatic proliferation, antigen-driven proliferation or survival advantage conferred from proviral integration at specific sites in the host genome <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0007" ref-type="bibr">[7,11,19]</xref>.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0066">Jori Symons (Peter Doherty Institute, Melbourne University, Australia) explored the contribution of clonal expansion to HIV-1 persistence in different CD4 T cell subsets. In a cross-sectional cohort of 24 participants receiving suppressive ART (median 3.8 years), integration site analysis was performed in CD4 T cells sorted into na&#x000ef;ve, stem cell memory, central memory, transitional memory, effector memory and terminally differentiated subsets. This analysis demonstrated that the contribution of clonal expansion to HIV-1 persistence increased with cell differentiation and that almost 60% of infected cells in the terminally differentiated subset were clonally expanded. Identical ISs were also found in multiple CD4 T cell subsets within a participant, implying that HIV-1 infected cells can differentiate while on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Additionally, larger clones were found more frequently in differentiated cells. Gene ontology and integrated pathway analysis showed evidence of a distinction between integrated genes and pathways in CD4 T cell subsets and single versus clonally expanded infected cells. In larger clones (&#x0003e;10%), HIV-1 ISs were found to be enriched in cancer genes, a result also consistent with the expansion resulting from homeostatic proliferation. This analysis also showed that HIV-1 integration in more differentiated cells frequently involved gene pathways associated with specific antigens, while single ISs more commonly involved chromatin structures that were inaccessible and in transcriptionally repressed genes. Collectively, this study suggests that mechanisms that maintain HIV-1 persistence in single and clonally expanded infected clones may differ.</p></sec><sec id="JVEv5-sec-0006"><label>2.4&#x02002;</label><title id="JVEv5-title-0008">Longitudinal proviral sequencing provides a window into selection pressures exerted on infected cells and provides an upper bound estimate of HIV-1 proviral half-lives which are influenced by expression and 
splicing potential</title><p id="JVEv5-para-0067">Work presented by Una O&#x02019;Doherty (University of Pennsylvania, USA) examined selection pressures driving the HIV-1 provirus decay dynamics in participants on long-term suppressive ART. Current estimates do not distinguish the relative contribution of cell death and clonal expansion to those dynamics. To clarify this question the approach used involved counting clonal proviruses as a single provirus when first detected in longitudinal sampling.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0068">The HIV-1 provirus sequences from four individuals receiving ART for over 10 years were analysed longitudinally. Consistent with previous studies, most were found to be defective with large deletions. Sequences were then divided into five categories based on the deletion or preservation of D1 and D4 donor splice sequence, which in a recent study were shown to play a critical role in positive and negative selection of intact and defective proviruses <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The D1<sup>+</sup> splicing was reported to enhance HIV-1 protein expression while D4<sup>+</sup> proviruses were associated with aberrant splicing. The abundance of each provirus category was then estimated over time and fitted into a first order decay model with either all clones counted or each clone counted only the first time it was detected. When all provirus clones were considered, sequences from the intact and nearly intact category declined faster compared to the 3&#x02019; deleted (D1<sup>+</sup>D4<sup>-</sup>) one which decayed faster than the 5&#x02019; deleted (D1<sup>-</sup>D4<sup>+</sup>) category and massively deleted (D1<sup>-</sup>D4<sup>-</sup>) proviruses. When clones were only counted once, 5&#x02019; deleted (D1<sup>-</sup>D4<sup>+</sup>) proviruses contracted as fast as 3&#x02019; deleted (D1<sup>+</sup>D4<sup>-</sup>) ones while massively deleted proviruses showed minimal turnover. This data suggested that 5&#x02019; deleted (D1<sup>-</sup>D4<sup>+</sup>) proviruses associated with aberrant splicing may exhibit a greater propensity for clonal expansion and viral persistence compared to other categories of proviruses. Additionally, proviral DNA decay appears to be most prominent in the initial 6 to 7 years after ART initiation before levels stabilise, reminiscent of the CD4 T cell reconstitution kinetics following ART-mediated viral 
suppression.</p></sec><sec id="JVEv5-sec-0007"><label>2.5&#x02002;</label><title id="JVEv5-title-0009">Immune activation markers associated with levels and diversity of intact HIV-1 proviruses during HIV/HBV co-infection</title><p id="JVEv5-para-0069">The final presentation of the session addressed how HBV may modulate characteristics of the HIV-1 reservoir in HIV/HBV co-infected individuals.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0070">Xiao Qian Wang (Westmead Institute for Medical Research, Westmead, Australia) presented data on the clinical correlates of intact HIV-1 provirus isolated from circulating CD4 T cells of ART-na&#x000ef;ve HIV/HBV co-infected (<italic>n</italic>=19) and HIV-1 mono-infected (<italic>n</italic>=4) individuals recruited in Thailand.

However, both groups had proviruses with comparable genetic diversity.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0071">Most participants had genetically unique HIV-1 proviruses and no associations were found between HBV markers (HBV DNA and HBsAg) and the frequency and diversity of intact proviruses in the co-infected individuals. However, higher levels of immune activation markers, specifically plasma CXCL10, sCD14 and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), were associated with increased frequency of intact proviruses while sCD14 and CXCL10 were significantly associated with enhanced genetic diversity of intact proviruses in the co-infected individuals. Similar associations were, however, not found in the mono-infected group. Studies are now ongoing to explore the impact of HBV on the HIV-1 reservoir 3 years post-ART initiation.

A functional HBV cure is a stable state after therapy with sustained loss of HBsAg from blood, with or without seroconversion with the presence of HBs antibodies, and the likely persistence of intrahepatic cccDNA but not in blood. This is thought to indicate sufficient viral immune control to prevent disease progression in the liver, although the virus may re-emerge in the presence of deficient immune control <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0022" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. A clinical definition of this state is, however, still lacking because of the lack of reliable HBV biomarkers.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0073">The major hurdle facing HBV cure is the reactivation of replication as a result of persistent cccDNA at undetectable levels, this may occur after viremia clearance during acute infection. The persistence of cccDNA is demonstrable by the resurgence of disease in the presence of immune suppression.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0074">Of note, HBV can also integrate into the host DNA and, although it cannot support viral replication, integrants may produce HBV proteins, including the surface antigen <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0023" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.

Crucially, there is presently no reliable method to detect cccDNA, the most important indicator of persistent HBV infection. There is, however, consensus that ideal biomarker characteristics for HBV cure should: 1. report on the presence of cccDNA; 2. be non-invasive, e.g. serum derived; 3. be amenable to point of care testing; and 4. be affordable <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0024" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><boxed-text id="JVEv5-fea-0003" position="float" content-type="general" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 3.</label><caption><title id="JVEv5-title-0011">Current biomarkers to measure HBV disease course</title></caption><table-wrap id="JVEv5-tbl-0003" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" id="JVEv5-t-0003"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Biomarker</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">What it is</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">What it means</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBsAg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Viral surface protein</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBV infection or transcriptionally active HBV integration</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBsAb or anti-HBs</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antibodies to HBsAg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Effective immune response following infection or HBV vaccination</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBcAg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Viral capsid (core) protein</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBV infection</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBcAb or anti-HBc</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antibodies to HBcAg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Past or present HBV infection</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBeAg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Secreted variant of HBcAg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">High HBV replication</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBeAb or anti-HBe</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antibodies to HBeAg</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low HBV replication</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">HBV DNA</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Viral genome in virus</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Active viral replication</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="JVEv5-fn-0004"><p id="JVEv5-para-0099">HBV: hepatitis B virus.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></boxed-text><p id="JVEv5-para-0100">The loss of HBsAg is currently the best indicator of HBV cure, although this marker may be unreliable for several reasons. First, a patient may eliminate cccDNA but produce HBsAg from integrated viral DNA. Second, HBsAg tests are not sensitive enough to detect trace levels of cccDNA. Finally, despite HBsAg loss, replication may be reactivated from residual cccDNA, if viral immunity is not established or weakened by immunosuppression.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0101">Other viral proteins including HBeAg, HBV core antigen (HBcAg), polymerase and X proteins are also poor candidates as biomarkers as they are either present at too low concentrations or may be lost as a result of mechanisms other than cccDNA clearance <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0102">Dr Tavis introduced potentially useful new HBV biomarkers during the Forum. The HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg) includes HBcAg, HBeAg and p22cr, a processing variant of HBcAg and is more readily detectable in blood. Data suggest a correlation with cccDNA function, but its detection is still limited by sensitivity issues and validation studies are still ongoing.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0103">Other potential markers include HBV RNAs which are secreted in virion particles. They are excellent biomarkers of functional cccDNA as they reflect production of essential HBV products such as pgRNA, HBcAg, polymerase and HBsAg. Early results from validation studies indicate a good correlation between HBV RNA and cccDNA.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0104">Although promising, these new potential biomarkers may be unreliable on their own and will need to be combined with others to assess HBV cure. A significant challenge in the field is understanding which combinations are most informative. Studies addressing this question are often hampered by a relatively small number of patients who have achieved functional cure on current treatment regimens.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0105">The immune system is also seen a critical component to achieving HBV cure. There are many lines of evidence that support this notion such as the protective effect conferred by anti-HBsAg, either through natural clearance or immunisation, and the potential to relaunch HBV infection from a single cccDNA copy when immunity wanes.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0106">Therefore, achieving an HBV cure will depend on the ability to establish immunity against the virus. Whether this can be achieved through enhancing innate or adaptive immune responses remains unknown and is discussed extensively in a later section (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="JVEv5-sec-0014">section 5.1</xref> Immunotherapy: vaccines and antibodies).

The importance of a multipronged approach was emphasised with the need to improve ARV tolerability and convenience, thus maximising adherence as well as optimising pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution. These features are key to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) effectiveness, a strategy known to prevent HIV-1 transmission that impacts on both its incidence and prevalence <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0108">Prolonged ARV half-life offers a way to improve adherence and is a focus in drug development (Annual Rev Med 2019). Data on MK-8591, a highly potent long-acting new ARV studied as a parenteral formulation in rats and non-human primates, were presented D Hazuda (Merck and Inc., USA). Studies have shown that when delivered with an implant, it is concentrated for over 180 days in the tissues associated with viral transmission and replication, such as the gastrointestinal tract. Dr Hazuda discussed how p24 detection in tissue could be a much more sensitive marker than the p24 assay in blood and used for treatment monitoring. The drug could be available orally as a daily, weekly or monthly dose.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0109">Massimo Levrero (University of Lyon, France) discussed the difficulty of defining HBV cure. He noted that there are many barriers to HBV cure when using currently available drugs in the context of cccDNA stability, integrated HBV DNA and a defective immune response to the virus in chronic carriers, none of which are directly addressed with current therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0110">A functional HBV cure can be defined as an asymptomatic status and undetectable HBsAg and HBV DNA in blood but with the presence of cccDNA in liver. A complete cure would include unmeasurable cccDNA in the liver but with, potentially, the presence of integrated DNA. No evidence of HBV infection, including an absence of integrated viral DNA into hepatocyte genome, would be considered as a sterilising cure.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0111">To achieve HBV cure, cccDNA stability and defective antiviral immune responses need to be considered. Evidence suggests that cccDNA half-life is about 4 months and whether the pool is influenced by non-cytolytic elimination or hepatocyte turnover remains unclear. However, and as described above, there is no reliable way to measure cccDNA without carrying out a liver biopsy.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0112">New antiviral drugs are being developed to address these challenges and to eliminate cccDNA by preventing its synthesis or increasing its degradation. Many options were presented at the Forum, such as ccc_R08, a first-in-class orally available cccDNA destabiliser that has achieved sustained HBsAg and HBV DNA reduction in the HBV circle mouse model. Increasing hepatocyte turnover would also enhance cccDNA degradation but would be contraindicated in cirrhosis. Capsid inhibitors prevent virus assembly (see later) and could work as an intensification strategy, together with cccDNA destabilisers.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0113">The other options presented were inhibitors of HBsAg release or HBV gene silencers aimed at suppressing HBsAg expression or cccDNA transcription. A &#x02018;shock and degrade&#x02019; strategy for HBV cure similar to the &#x02018;shock and kill&#x02019; approach in HIV-1 cure strategies is also being explored, although it may be limited by the infection burden in hepatocytes. Agents would be initially used to reactivate the virus and followed by the administration of cytokines and other small molecules to induce degradation of cccDNA and other viral DNA. This has parallels to the approaches under investigation in HIV-1, but will require a thorough assessment as HBV infection in hepatocytes may be substantially higher than in HIV-1 latently infected T cells.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0114">Overall, there is a strong interest in cure research based on use of antivirals for both HIV-1 and HBV diseases. For HIV-1 this could involve using very long acting ARVs to achieve a functional cure and for HBV, a complete cure may be achieved by successfully disabling cccDNA.</p></sec><sec id="JVEv5-sec-0010"><label>4&#x02002;</label><title id="JVEv5-title-0013">Advancing gene therapy to treat patients infected with HIV-1 and chronic carriers of HBV</title><p id="JVEv5-para-0115">Currently available technology, particularly in the field of gene editing, now potentially provides the means for an HIV-1 and HBV infection cure.

Such interventions include hepatocyte-targeted interferon-&#x003b1; modifications, LTR&#x003b2;, RIG-I, LXR and TLR-7/8/9 agonists as well as the use of immunomodulatory cytokines like IL-12 (a cytokine able to rescue exhausted CD8 T cell responses <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0056" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>).</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0148">The generation of a complex repertoire of virus-specific B and T cells with helper or cytotoxic effects during HBV infection is considered of paramount importance and ultimately determines the outcome of infection <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0057" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. Therefore, CHB can be viewed as an immunological disorder <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0058" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, which leads to multiple humoral and cellular immunity defects. Dr Maini illustrated how studies have shown that in individuals with CHB a subset of regulatory B cells mediates anti-HBV CD8 T cell response suppression through IL-10 secretion <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0059" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Also, although HBsAg-specific B cells have been found to persist in blood and liver, they were found to have defective antibody production in patients with CHB <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0060" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0149">With an emerging role for humoral immunity in chronic HBV infection control, Dr Maini suggested that it is imperative to identify and target molecular constrains of B cell immunity as part of a functional cure. It is also well established that in CHB, virus-specific T cells are depleted and functionally defective and that this exhaustion state is a key determinant of viral persistence <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0150">Dr Maini elaborated how multiple mechanisms are at play to constrain HBV-specific T cells. These include the high quantity of antigenic peptides and duration of exposure to antigen load, the up-regulation of multiple co-inhibitory receptors (including PD-1, LAG-3, Tim-3 and CTLA-4), transcriptional, metabolic and epigenetic defects, negative regulation by NK cells and suppressive cytokines.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0151">Therefore, tailored therapeutic approaches are required to boost virus-specific T cell responses. These can include therapeutic vaccination, approaches to reduce HBV antigen production (e.g. by RNA interference), use of immuno-regulatory cytokines (e.g. IL-12, INF-&#x003b1;), checkpoint blockade alone or in combination with therapeutic vaccines, use of mitochondrial antioxidants to reverse T cell mitochondrial defects and careful timing and manipulation of liver NK cell immunity to block their pathogenic effects but enhance their protective functions <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0062" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0152">Other immunotherapeutic approaches entail &#x02018;replacement of the endogenous adaptive immunity&#x02019; by: 1. adoptive transfer of genetically engineered T cells that can either express a canonical HLA class I restricted T cell receptor (TCR); 2. administering chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T cells) <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0061" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>; and 3. using therapeutic monoclonal or bi-specific antibodies.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0153">Lastly, Dr Maini discussed how optimising the immunogenicity of therapeutic vaccines can be achieved by careful selection of the patients and strategic and rational vaccine design. Boosting HBV immunity will be a trade-off between immunity and immunopathology since the liver injury is immune-mediated. Because CD8 T cells mediate both protection and liver injury, hepatic flares are likely to be an inevitable result of immune boosting. A question that arises is whether the promotion of non-cytolytic responses together with controlled hepatocyte lysis to eliminate integrated DNA can be achieved. Dr Maini concluded by stating that efficacy of HBV-directed immunotherapy will require rational combinations of immunological and virological approaches for the various patient groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="JVEv5-sec-0019"><label>5.2&#x02002;</label><title id="JVEv5-title-0022">Immunomodifying agents</title><sec id="JVEv5-sec-0020"><label>5.2.1&#x02002;</label><title id="JVEv5-title-0023">Engineered immune-mobilising monoclonal T cell receptors against viruses</title><p id="JVEv5-para-0154">The session focusing on therapies aimed at the direct modification of immune responses to mediate virus eradication was opened by Dr Lucy Dorrell (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK). She reviewed the challenges facing curative HIV-1 immunotherapy including minimal expression of viral antigens, immune evasion, inefficiency of methods to induce viral transcription, immune epitope escape, inaccessibility of sanctuary sites to cytolytic effectors, and cells that may be resistant to CD8 T cell-mediated killing. She then presented data on engineered immune-mobilising monoclonal T cell receptors (TCRs) against viruses (ImmTAVs). Researchers have sought to redirect immune responses with soluble mediators such as bi-specific antibodies and chimeric-antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells) <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0063" ref-type="bibr">[63&#x02013;65]</xref>. The ImmTAV molecules are an alternative approach, engineered from a T cell receptor with specificity for an HIV-1 target antigen in soluble form linked by a CD3 activating antibody fragment (anti-CD3 scFv). When an antigen is processed and presented on the appropriate type of HLA molecule, the ImmTAV will bind the free anti-CD3 scFv and engage nearby cytolytic T cells, irrespective of specificity, to activate full effector function. The TCRs are antigen selected, cloned, affinity matured to reach high levels of binding efficiency and stabilised with interchain disulphide bonds. The approach seeks to leverage the convenience of soluble molecule manufacturing with the full range of intracellular antigens and efficient killing offered by T cell recognition. The platform has been developed for cancer immunotherapy <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0066" ref-type="bibr">[66,67]</xref> and has multiple infectious disease applications in development.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0155">Promising proof of concept from the first HIV-1 <italic>gag</italic>-specific ImmTAV was presented showing activity at low effector-to-target ratios when tested <italic>ex vivo</italic> with CD4 T cells from HIV-1 positive patients on ART <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0068" ref-type="bibr">[68,69]</xref>.

Extending their recent work on FX1, an inhibitor of the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0070" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, Dr Yanhui Cai (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, USA) presented data on the effects of FX1 on germinal centre (GC) formation. In prior studies, they had demonstrated that inhibiting BCL6, a transcription factor critical for T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and function of other activated T cells, led to reduced HIV-1 infection <italic>ex vivo</italic>
<xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0070" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. FX1 has been demonstrated to reduce GC formation in mice <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0071" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, thereby highlighting its potential use to limit privileged sanctuary sites harbouring HIV-1. In a rhesus macaque model, FX1 treatment reduced lymphoid hyperplasia, Tfh CD4 T cells and their precursors, markers of proliferation and BCL6 expression in GCs. The authors suggested that this type of approach may be useful for combination interventions that include recently described heterodimeric interleukin-15 (hetIL-15) agents. These compounds have been reported to enhance the activation and localisation of CD8 T cells in B cell follicles in LN <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0072" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, which addresses one of the challenges of directing potent effectors to sanctuary sites.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0157">Maria Pino (Yerkes Primate Center, Emory University, Atlanta, USA) presented a study on the use of fingolimod at the time of ART initiation. This compound is a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator used in multiple sclerosis <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0073" ref-type="bibr">[73,74]</xref> that promotes the retention of several types of lymphocytes within lymphoid tissue. Authors used this agent to address whether retaining lymphocytes in LN would enhance contact between infected cells of the reservoirs and cytolytic effectors, and whether they could provide insights into the relative contribution of different sites (peripheral blood versus LN) to the reservoir. Twenty-two rhesus macaques were infected with SIV and started ART 6 weeks later to allow reservoir seeding. Fingolimod was then administered along with ART for more than 8 weeks. In eight of the animals, ART was continued for an additional 10 months when it was interrupted and animals followed to determine time to viral rebound. As expected, fingolimod induced peripheral lymphopenia. Interestingly, this did not influence plasma viremia decay kinetics, suggesting that it is not dependent on CD4 T cell recirculation. A SIV DNA and SIV RNA decline was noted using DNAscope and RNAscope in LN of both fingolimod-treated and ART alone groups. A subset of animals treated with Fingolimod had a slight delay in viral load rebound and lower viral set-point. These findings were associated with lower amounts of SIV DNA in follicular T helper cells. Work to define why there are differences in cell phenotypes is ongoing. These studies may help to identify which features associated with sanctuaries such as tissue localisation, cell type preference and(or) cell subset programming are the most critical barriers to HIV-1 eradication.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0158">Lucy Dorrell also presented data of the initial studies working towards the development of ImmTAV molecules with HBV antigen-specificity. These have identified a potent and specific molecule for an HBV-specific ImmTAV cell with <italic>in vitro</italic> results showing elimination of targets expressing HBV antigens.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0159">The features of immune dysfunction in CHB provide distinct challenges. Dr Garg from Gilead Sciences offered a broad overview of challenges facing immunomodulatory therapy. Specifically, current treatments block viral replication in CHB but do not inhibit HBV surface antigen production. As discussed elsewhere in this article, numerous features of the immune response are dysfunctional in CHB with a low frequency of antigen specific T cells, high rate of exhaustion of HBV-specific T cell responses and dysfunctional B cell responses. Some of these features are likely to be directly linked to chronic exposure to high antigen levels and specific tolerogenic liver environment <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0075" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>. While ImmTAV offers one type of approach to addressing these issues, another possibility to consider is immunomodulation directed at boosting endogenous responses. In order to do so, Dr. Garg presented data on the use of an agonist of the innate immune sensor, TLR8. This immune sensor has a broad distribution of expression and is found in monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils and regulatory T cells. Stimulation induces IL-12p70 but not IFN&#x003b3; and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies shows induction of IFN&#x003b3;, reduced PD-1 expression on CD8 T cells and lower levels of regulatory T cells. These observations suggest a profile of increased effector capacity in response to TLR8 activation. Small animal models are limited as TLR8 is nonfunctional in mice and rats, but testing in the woodchuck hepatitis model achieved lower levels of HBV surface antigen associated with IL-12 induction, without a type-1 IFN response. Direct TLR stimulation to enhance immune responses has also targeted TLR7 in the past. Data at the meeting supported this approach in HIV-1 cure efforts.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0160">Sharon Riddler (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA) presented a Phase 1B randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study on the safety and biological activity of GS-9620 (vesatolimod), a TLR7 agonist. In the context of HIV-1, activation of innate immunity has been suggested as a pathway to stimulate viral expression and to enhance control of stimulated virus. The TLR7 agonists were shown to activate multiple immune cells and stimulate virus expression in SIV-infected rhesus macaques on ART <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0076" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. In these studies, declines in measures of HIV-1 reservoir and sustained viral control after interruption of ART were observed in a subset of monkeys <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0076" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. The TLR7 agonism in combination with therapeutic vaccination were associated with lower viral DNA levels, improved virological control and delays in rebound in SIV-infected rhesus macaques. In addition, combination with bNAb infusion in a SHIV-1 infection model led to delayed viral rebound and absence of detectable virus after treatment in a subset of monkeys <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">[51,77]</xref>.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0161">Earlier studies on healthy volunteers had demonstrated the safety of the agent at doses ranging up to 12 mg with detectable induction of interferon-stimulated genes at doses above 2 mg <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0078" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. The current study enrolled 48 HIV-1 positive individuals who were randomised to receive vesatolimod at escalating doses (peak of 10mg x 3 plus 12mg x 7). There were no grade 3 or above adverse events related to the study drug or drug discontinuations as a result of adverse events. Vesatolimod induced CD69 expression on NK cells along with increases in interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) and circulating cytokines (interferon gamma-induced protein 10 [IP-10], interferon-inducible T cell-&#x003b1; chemoattractant [ITAC], and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist [IL-1RA]) in some participants at doses above 6 mg. There were no consistent increases in plasma viral load above 20 copies/mL or evidence of changes in HIV-1 RNA by single copy assay or in cell-associated HIV-1 DNA and HIV-1 RNA. Further studies will be necessary to define the reasons for the differences between these results and the NHP studies. The authors reported that ongoing trials are evaluating the efficacy of vesatolimod alone or in combination with other therapeutic agents.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0162">In another intersection between efforts aimed at HIV-1 and HBV cure, Dr Garg presented data on the use of checkpoint inhibitor blockade to counter HBV infection. Given the high rates of PD-1 expression among HBV-specific T cells <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0079" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, checkpoint inhibitors offer means to achieve functional responses. Enthusiasm for this approach has been somewhat tempered by the potential risk of activating T cell responses against a highly expressed antigenic target, but results from a dose escalation cohort in individuals with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma offer some insight <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0080" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. Overall, these results showed that anti-PD-1 therapy was generally safe and well tolerated with significant virological responses in a subset of participants, including one who showed HBsAg loss. These data provide some support for boosting endogenous immunity as a means of achieving an HBV cure.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0163">For both HIV-1 and HBV infections, immunomodulatory therapies continue to be a balance between harnessing highly effective responses and limiting significant toxicities. Novel approaches to achieve these goals offer both the opportunity to move closer to a cure and the chance to define critical pathways that maintain chronic infection.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="JVEv5-sec-0022"><label>6&#x02002;</label><title id="JVEv5-title-0025">Achieving a cure: the science and beyond</title><p id="JVEv5-para-0164">The panel discussion was opened with an impassioned speech delivered by Moses &#x02018;Supercharger&#x02019; Nsubuga (&#x02018;Stigmaless&#x02019;, Uganda) who has been living with HIV-1 since 1994.

A concerted effort to work together and facilitate cross-talk and exchange of knowledge and ideas will be vital.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0192">It is important to acknowledge the context in which a cure is being developed. Relationships with potential clinical consequences such as hepatocellular carcinoma in HBV carriers need to be taken into consideration. Effective cure therapies will need to be measured against the ever-improving ARVs and an existing vaccine. A major barrier to finding an HBV cure is that research remains heavily underfunded. Despite progress in treatment and the availability of a prophylactic vaccine, increasing global mortality from chronic HBV infection, currently approximately at 800,000 individuals per annum, more than supports the belief that a cure is indeed necessary.</p><p id="JVEv5-para-0193">A cure for either HIV and(or) HBV infections is unlikely to be a magic bullet and will require a combination of approaches involving new therapies.

These include packaging of pregenomic viral RNA, viral particle budding from the endoplasmic reticulum and maintaining the all-important cccDNA. The CAEs thus potentially disrupt many steps in HBV replication. More than 175 compounds have been synthesised and tested in various models of HBV replication. Lead compounds were selected from those that most effectively inhibited production of markers of HBV replication in cultured cells and led to the identification of GLP-26. Secretion of HBeAg, a surrogate marker for cccDNA function, was also reduced in cultured HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cells. Moreover, a cccDNA decreased concentration confirmed that the compound had an effect on this replication intermediate.

Good efficacy was also demonstrated using the model of HBV-infected immunocompromised mice that had been xenografted with human hepatocytes.
