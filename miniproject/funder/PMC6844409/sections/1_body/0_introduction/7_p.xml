<p id="JVEv5-para-0036">Strategies to inactivate cccDNA include inhibiting host factors required for its formation such as TDP2 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, disabling the HBx protein that affects the degradation of host restriction factors such as SMC5/6 that normally participate in cccDNA elimination 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0002" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and the induction of APOBEC3A to degrade cccDNA 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Re-purposing of existing pharmaceutical compounds as well as reverse and forward chemical genetics were proposed as methods to identify those that could lead to cccDNA inactivation. Such strategies would entail high throughput screening of small molecule libraries to recognise candidate drugs. Candidates with such capabilities are currently at an early stage of development. New advances are keenly awaited to understand their therapeutic potential.
