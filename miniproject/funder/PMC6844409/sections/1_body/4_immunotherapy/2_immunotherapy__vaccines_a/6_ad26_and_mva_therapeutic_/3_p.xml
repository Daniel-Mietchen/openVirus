<p id="JVEv5-para-0145">Although the vaccine proved to be safe and immunogenic in terms of humoral, ADCC, CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, it failed to lead to ART-free viremic control. The median time to viral load rebounds (&gt;20 HIV-1 copies/ml) was 20 days, with no occurrence of an acute retroviral syndrome or new resistance mutations. Data analysis to characterise biomarkers that could predict viremic rebound are ongoing. Dr Colby concluded by suggesting that a TLR7 agonist in conjunction with the vaccine may be more successful. In future trials it may be more informative to allow for longer ARV interruption to accurately assess the post peak viral load set-point.</p>
