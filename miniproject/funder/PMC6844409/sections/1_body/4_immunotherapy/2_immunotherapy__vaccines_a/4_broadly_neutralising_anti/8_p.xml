<p id="JVEv5-para-0138">Finally, a passive infusion of a bNAb (PGT121) together with vesatolimod, a latency reversal agent, toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist were administered to SHIV-infected rhesus macaques that had received ARVs during acute infection. A subset of treated monkeys (5/11) 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0051" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> did not show viral rebound following ART cessation. These animals had undetectable viral DNA in PBMCs and lymph nodes and failed to transfer infection to na√Øve hosts following adoptive transfer of PBMCs and lymph node mononuclear cells. Furthermore, viral loads remained undetectable following CD8 T and NK cell depletion. Although this study makes a convincing argument for the efficacy of bNAb administration combined with innate immune stimulation, a caveat is that it represents an idealised system of hyper-acute ART in non-human primates.
