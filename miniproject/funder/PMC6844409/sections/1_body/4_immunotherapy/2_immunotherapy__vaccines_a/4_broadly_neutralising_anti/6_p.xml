<p id="JVEv5-para-0136">Three infusions of two bNAbs (3BNC117 and 10-1074) and pre-screening for viral sensitivity 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0048" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> showed a more prolonged viral suppression (median of 21 weeks) after ART interruption in antibody-sensitive individuals. Antibody-resistant viruses did not emerge and two individuals showed viral suppression long after both bNAbs had been cleared (&gt;30 months).
