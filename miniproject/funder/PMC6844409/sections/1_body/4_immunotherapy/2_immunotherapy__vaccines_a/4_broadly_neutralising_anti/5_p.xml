 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0047" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref> in separate trials. Although both studies reported only a modest increase in time to rebound following ART interruption, the chronic ART-initiation trial resulted in a significant increase in VRC01-resistance, whereas no change in sensitivity was observed in the acute ART initiation one. No prior testing for virus sensitivity to VRC01 was undertaken in either of these trials.
