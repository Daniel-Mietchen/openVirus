These can include therapeutic vaccination, approaches to reduce HBV antigen production (e.g. by RNA interference), use of immuno-regulatory cytokines (e.g. IL-12, INF-Î±), checkpoint blockade alone or in combination with therapeutic vaccines, use of mitochondrial antioxidants to reverse T cell mitochondrial defects and careful timing and manipulation of liver NK cell immunity to block their pathogenic effects but enhance their protective functions
