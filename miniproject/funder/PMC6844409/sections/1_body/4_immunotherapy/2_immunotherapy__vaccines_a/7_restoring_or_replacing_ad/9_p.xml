<p id="JVEv5-para-0153">Lastly, Dr Maini discussed how optimising the immunogenicity of therapeutic vaccines can be achieved by careful selection of the patients and strategic and rational vaccine design. Boosting HBV immunity will be a trade-off between immunity and immunopathology since the liver injury is immune-mediated. Because CD8 T cells mediate both protection and liver injury, hepatic flares are likely to be an inevitable result of immune boosting. A question that arises is whether the promotion of non-cytolytic responses together with controlled hepatocyte lysis to eliminate integrated DNA can be achieved. Dr Maini concluded by stating that efficacy of HBV-directed immunotherapy will require rational combinations of immunological and virological approaches for the various patient groups.</p>
