Also, even when HBV is chronically established, it remains susceptible to immune control. Although the focus of Dr Maini's presentation was on the restoration of the anti-HBV adaptive immunity, she mentioned the importance of intrinsic/innate immunity as a key stage where therapeutic interventions may be applied. Such interventions include hepatocyte-targeted interferon-α modifications, LTRβ, RIG-I, LXR and TLR-7/8/9 agonists as well as the use of immunomodulatory cytokines like IL-12 (a cytokine able to rescue exhausted CD8 T cell responses
