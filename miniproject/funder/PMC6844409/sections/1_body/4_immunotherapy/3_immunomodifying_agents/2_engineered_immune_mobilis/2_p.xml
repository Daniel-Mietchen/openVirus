<p id="JVEv5-para-0154">The session focusing on therapies aimed at the direct modification of immune responses to mediate virus eradication was opened by Dr Lucy Dorrell (University of Oxford, Oxford, UK). She reviewed the challenges facing curative HIV-1 immunotherapy including minimal expression of viral antigens, immune evasion, inefficiency of methods to induce viral transcription, immune epitope escape, inaccessibility of sanctuary sites to cytolytic effectors, and cells that may be resistant to CD8 T cell-mediated killing. She then presented data on engineered immune-mobilising monoclonal T cell receptors (TCRs) against viruses (ImmTAVs). Researchers have sought to redirect immune responses with soluble mediators such as bi-specific antibodies and chimeric-antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells)

The ImmTAV molecules are an alternative approach, engineered from a T cell receptor with specificity for an HIV-1 target antigen in soluble form linked by a CD3 activating antibody fragment (anti-CD3 scFv). When an antigen is processed and presented on the appropriate type of HLA molecule, the ImmTAV will bind the free anti-CD3 scFv and engage nearby cytolytic T cells, irrespective of specificity, to activate full effector function. The TCRs are antigen selected, cloned, affinity matured to reach high levels of binding efficiency and stabilised with interchain disulphide bonds. The approach seeks to leverage the convenience of soluble molecule manufacturing with the full range of intracellular antigens and efficient killing offered by T cell recognition. The platform has been developed for cancer immunotherapy
