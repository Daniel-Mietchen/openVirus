<p id="JVEv5-para-0162">In another intersection between efforts aimed at HIV-1 and HBV cure, Dr Garg presented data on the use of checkpoint inhibitor blockade to counter HBV infection. Given the high rates of PD-1 expression among HBV-specific T cells 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0079" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>, checkpoint inhibitors offer means to achieve functional responses. Enthusiasm for this approach has been somewhat tempered by the potential risk of activating T cell responses against a highly expressed antigenic target, but results from a dose escalation cohort in individuals with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma offer some insight 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0080" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. Overall, these results showed that anti-PD-1 therapy was generally safe and well tolerated with significant virological responses in a subset of participants, including one who showed HBsAg loss. These data provide some support for boosting endogenous immunity as a means of achieving an HBV cure.
