<p id="JVEv5-para-0160">Sharon Riddler (University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA) presented a Phase 1B randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study on the safety and biological activity of GS-9620 (vesatolimod), a TLR7 agonist. In the context of HIV-1, activation of innate immunity has been suggested as a pathway to stimulate viral expression and to enhance control of stimulated virus. The TLR7 agonists were shown to activate multiple immune cells and stimulate virus expression in SIV-infected rhesus macaques on ART

The TLR7 agonism in combination with therapeutic vaccination were associated with lower viral DNA levels, improved virological control and delays in rebound in SIV-infected rhesus macaques. In addition, combination with bNAb infusion in a SHIV-1 infection model led to delayed viral rebound and absence of detectable virus after treatment in a subset of monkeys
