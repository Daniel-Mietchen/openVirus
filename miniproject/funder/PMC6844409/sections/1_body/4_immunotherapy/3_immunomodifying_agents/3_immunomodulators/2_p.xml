<p id="JVEv5-para-0156">Two brief presentations highlighted attempts to target HIV-1 reservoirs within lymph nodes (LN). Extending their recent work on FX1, an inhibitor of the transcription factor B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0070" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, Dr Yanhui Cai (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, USA) presented data on the effects of FX1 on germinal centre (GC) formation. In prior studies, they had demonstrated that inhibiting BCL6, a transcription factor critical for T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and function of other activated T cells, led to reduced HIV-1 infection

 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0070" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. FX1 has been demonstrated to reduce GC formation in mice 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0071" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, thereby highlighting its potential use to limit privileged sanctuary sites harbouring HIV-1. In a rhesus macaque model, FX1 treatment reduced lymphoid hyperplasia, Tfh CD4 T cells and their precursors, markers of proliferation and BCL6 expression in GCs. The authors suggested that this type of approach may be useful for combination interventions that include recently described heterodimeric interleukin-15 (hetIL-15) agents. These compounds have been reported to enhance the activation and localisation of CD8 T cells in B cell follicles in LN 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0072" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, which addresses one of the challenges of directing potent effectors to sanctuary sites.
