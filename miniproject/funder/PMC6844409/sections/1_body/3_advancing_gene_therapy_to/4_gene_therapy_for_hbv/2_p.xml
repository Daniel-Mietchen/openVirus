<p id="JVEv5-para-0123">Man-Fung Yuen (University of Hong Kong and Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, USA) presented a study involving clinical evaluation of gene silencing as a mode of HBV treatment. The candidate drug, ARC-520, comprises HBV-targeting short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and a hepatotropic peptide that facilitates delivery and endosomal escape of the siRNA in liver cells 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0035" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Clinical trial data have shown a reduction of HBsAg in viral carriers, with a particularly impressive effect in HBeAg-positive patients. Multiple ARC-520 administrations produced several log reductions in many of the markers of HBV replication, especially HBV DNA. Flexibility of the approach was confirmed by design of alternative siRNAs that are effective when the target site is disrupted in integrated DNA. It remains to be established whether the siRNA-based approach will be curative and possibly synergistic with other treatment modalities.
