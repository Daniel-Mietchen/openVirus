<p id="JVEv5-para-0129">Another approach that shows promise involves TALEN-derived silencers to induce epigenetic changes of HBV sequences without causing cleavage of DNA. Despite evidence indicating that gene editing provides the means to disable cccDNA permanently, evaluation in preclinical models that closely simulate HBV replication will be an important precursor to clinical evaluation. Specificity of action, efficient hepatotropic delivery of the therapeutic nucleic acids and scalable drug production will be vital for the successful implementation of gene editing to treat HBV infection.</p>
