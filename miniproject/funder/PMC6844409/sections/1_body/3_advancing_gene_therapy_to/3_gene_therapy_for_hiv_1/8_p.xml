<p id="JVEv5-para-0122">An indirect benefit to gene therapy has been derived from decades of intense research on the biology of HIV-1 replication. Resulting information provided the detailed understanding needed to develop the now widely used replication-defective and safe recombinant lentiviruses. These vectors retain the property of integrating proviral sequences into infected cells, which may be harnessed to achieve sustained expression of therapeutic transgenes. Lentiviral transduction has been particularly important for advancing CAR-T cell therapy, which has rapidly gained popularity in cancer
