<p id="JVEv5-para-0108">Prolonged ARV half-life offers a way to improve adherence and is a focus in drug development (Annual Rev Med 2019). Data on MK-8591, a highly potent long-acting new ARV studied as a parenteral formulation in rats and non-human primates, were presented D Hazuda (Merck and Inc., USA). Studies have shown that when delivered with an implant, it is concentrated for over 180 days in the tissues associated with viral transmission and replication, such as the gastrointestinal tract. Dr Hazuda discussed how p24 detection in tissue could be a much more sensitive marker than the p24 assay in blood and used for treatment monitoring. The drug could be available orally as a daily, weekly or monthly dose.</p>
