<p id="JVEv5-para-0110">A functional HBV cure can be defined as an asymptomatic status and undetectable HBsAg and HBV DNA in blood but with the presence of cccDNA in liver. A complete cure would include unmeasurable cccDNA in the liver but with, potentially, the presence of integrated DNA. No evidence of HBV infection, including an absence of integrated viral DNA into hepatocyte genome, would be considered as a sterilising cure.</p>
