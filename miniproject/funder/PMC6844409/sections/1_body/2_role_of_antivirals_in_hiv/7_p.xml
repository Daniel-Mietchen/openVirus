<p id="JVEv5-para-0112">New antiviral drugs are being developed to address these challenges and to eliminate cccDNA by preventing its synthesis or increasing its degradation. Many options were presented at the Forum, such as ccc_R08, a first-in-class orally available cccDNA destabiliser that has achieved sustained HBsAg and HBV DNA reduction in the HBV circle mouse model. Increasing hepatocyte turnover would also enhance cccDNA degradation but would be contraindicated in cirrhosis. Capsid inhibitors prevent virus assembly (see later) and could work as an intensification strategy, together with cccDNA destabilisers.</p>
