<p id="JVEv5-para-0192">It is important to acknowledge the context in which a cure is being developed. Relationships with potential clinical consequences such as hepatocellular carcinoma in HBV carriers need to be taken into consideration. Effective cure therapies will need to be measured against the ever-improving ARVs and an existing vaccine. A major barrier to finding an HBV cure is that research remains heavily underfunded. Despite progress in treatment and the availability of a prophylactic vaccine, increasing global mortality from chronic HBV infection, currently approximately at 800,000 individuals per annum, more than supports the belief that a cure is indeed necessary.</p>
