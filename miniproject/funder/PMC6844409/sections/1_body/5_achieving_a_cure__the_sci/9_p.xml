<p id="JVEv5-para-0193">A cure for either HIV and(or) HBV infections is unlikely to be a magic bullet and will require a combination of approaches involving new therapies. Given the available technologies, we can explore human immunology with precision using small amounts of clinical material. This opportunity should be leveraged. Clinical research ought to be shifted from the much studied white males to include groups such as natural and post-treatment controllers, and more women in cure trials as well as communities generally underrepresented in clinical trials such as those of African descent in order to be able to assess efficacy in all populations. Given that many cure therapies will involve unknown risks, there will be obstacles in communicating the risks to study participants and community engagement will be key to cure development.</p>
