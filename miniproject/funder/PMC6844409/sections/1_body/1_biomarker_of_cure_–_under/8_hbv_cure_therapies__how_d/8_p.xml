<p id="JVEv5-para-0102">Dr Tavis introduced potentially useful new HBV biomarkers during the Forum. The HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg) includes HBcAg, HBeAg and p22cr, a processing variant of HBcAg and is more readily detectable in blood. Data suggest a correlation with cccDNA function, but its detection is still limited by sensitivity issues and validation studies are still ongoing.</p>
