<p id="JVEv5-para-0062">Another challenge involves addressing the relevance of sequences of circulating virions found after rebound following treatment interruption to those found in infected cells. Prior work has suggested that intact proviruses identified from near full-length sequence analyses of circulating cells show approximately 40% overlap with viral sequences identified using viral outgrowth assays (VOAs), but no overlap with rebound viruses. The latter may, however, contribute to recombinant viruses found in blood
