<p id="JVEv5-para-0060">Dr Cohn also presented an overview of cell-based assays, which help characterise infected primary cells: the HIV-1 Flow 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, HIV-1 SortSeq (Ho YC lab, unpublished) and the latency capture assays 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These use primary cells which are activated and then sorted for HIV-1 RNA (HIV-1 SortSeq) or cells expressing p24 (HIV-Flow) or HIV-1 
 <italic>env </italic>(latency cell capture, LURE) and characterised by flow cytometry. The advantage of these assays is their ability to simultaneously characterise other cellular and molecular features of primary infected cells. These include assay of surface receptor expression (HIV-Flow), gene expression (latency cell capture, HIV-1 SortSeq), integration site and HIV-1 splicing (HIV-1 SortSeq). However, these may have limitations related to the activation process, which may alter the cell phenotype.
