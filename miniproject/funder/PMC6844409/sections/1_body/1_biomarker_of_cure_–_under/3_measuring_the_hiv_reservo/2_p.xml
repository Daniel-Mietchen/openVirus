<p id="JVEv5-para-0040">Lilian Cohn (Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, San Francisco, USA) provided a comprehensive overview of recent advances in measuring HIV-1 latent reservoirs using single cell analysis. Strategies to characterise the viral reservoir and infected cells can be divided into two types: 1. nucleic acid-based assays which facilitate the analysis of viral/proviral sequences and HIV-1 integration sites, and 2. cell-based assays which characterise host transcriptome and protein expression of infected cells.</p>
