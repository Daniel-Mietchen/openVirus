<p id="JVEv5-para-0061">Dr Cohn provided updates on technical advancements in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) techniques, which now enable high-throughput analyses and have the potential to significantly advance the field of HIV-1 cure research. The Seq-Well is a portable, low-input massively parallel scRNA-Seq platform, which allows robust single cell transcriptional analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from clinically acquired specimens in the order of 10,000 cells/sample

This analytical approach was applied to samples from participants prior to and immediately after HIV-1 infection from the FRESH cohort and revealed important characteristics of the immune response dynamics in terms of cell types, status, interactions and associated drivers. Additionally, it has facilitated the critical understanding of cellular events associated with spontaneous control of infection in the absence of treatment. A potential challenge for using this approach is the sophisticated infrastructure and human capacity that are needed to deal with large datasets and the complexity of integrating sequencing data with available analytical techniques.
