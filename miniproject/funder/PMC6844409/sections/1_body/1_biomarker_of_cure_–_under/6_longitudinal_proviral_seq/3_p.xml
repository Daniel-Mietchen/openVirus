<p id="JVEv5-para-0068">The HIV-1 provirus sequences from four individuals receiving ART for over 10 years were analysed longitudinally. Consistent with previous studies, most were found to be defective with large deletions. Sequences were then divided into five categories based on the deletion or preservation of D1 and D4 donor splice sequence, which in a recent study were shown to play a critical role in positive and negative selection of intact and defective proviruses 
 <xref rid="JVEv5-bib-0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The D1
 <sup>+</sup> splicing was reported to enhance HIV-1 protein expression while D4
 <sup>+</sup> proviruses were associated with aberrant splicing. The abundance of each provirus category was then estimated over time and fitted into a first order decay model with either all clones counted or each clone counted only the first time it was detected. When all provirus clones were considered, sequences from the intact and nearly intact category declined faster compared to the 3’ deleted (D1
 <sup>+</sup>D4
 <sup>-</sup>) one which decayed faster than the 5’ deleted (D1
 <sup>-</sup>D4
 <sup>+</sup>) category and massively deleted (D1
 <sup>-</sup>D4
 <sup>-</sup>) proviruses. When clones were only counted once, 5’ deleted (D1
 <sup>-</sup>D4
 <sup>+</sup>) proviruses contracted as fast as 3’ deleted (D1
 <sup>+</sup>D4
 <sup>-</sup>) ones while massively deleted proviruses showed minimal turnover. This data suggested that 5’ deleted (D1
 <sup>-</sup>D4
 <sup>+</sup>) proviruses associated with aberrant splicing may exhibit a greater propensity for clonal expansion and viral persistence compared to other categories of proviruses. Additionally, proviral DNA decay appears to be most prominent in the initial 6 to 7 years after ART initiation before levels stabilise, reminiscent of the CD4 T cell reconstitution kinetics following ART-mediated viral suppression.
