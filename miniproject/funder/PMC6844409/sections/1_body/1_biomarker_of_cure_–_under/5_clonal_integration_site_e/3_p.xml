<p id="JVEv5-para-0066">Jori Symons (Peter Doherty Institute, Melbourne University, Australia) explored the contribution of clonal expansion to HIV-1 persistence in different CD4 T cell subsets. In a cross-sectional cohort of 24 participants receiving suppressive ART (median 3.8 years), integration site analysis was performed in CD4 T cells sorted into na√Øve, stem cell memory, central memory, transitional memory, effector memory and terminally differentiated subsets. This analysis demonstrated that the contribution of clonal expansion to HIV-1 persistence increased with cell differentiation and that almost 60% of infected cells in the terminally differentiated subset were clonally expanded. Identical ISs were also found in multiple CD4 T cell subsets within a participant, implying that HIV-1 infected cells can differentiate while on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Additionally, larger clones were found more frequently in differentiated cells. Gene ontology and integrated pathway analysis showed evidence of a distinction between integrated genes and pathways in CD4 T cell subsets and single versus clonally expanded infected cells. In larger clones (&gt;10%), HIV-1 ISs were found to be enriched in cancer genes, a result also consistent with the expansion resulting from homeostatic proliferation. This analysis also showed that HIV-1 integration in more differentiated cells frequently involved gene pathways associated with specific antigens, while single ISs more commonly involved chromatin structures that were inaccessible and in transcriptionally repressed genes. Collectively, this study suggests that mechanisms that maintain HIV-1 persistence in single and clonally expanded infected clones may differ.</p>
