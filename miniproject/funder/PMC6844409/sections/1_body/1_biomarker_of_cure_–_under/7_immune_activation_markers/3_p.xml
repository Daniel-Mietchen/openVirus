<p id="JVEv5-para-0070">Xiao Qian Wang (Westmead Institute for Medical Research, Westmead, Australia) presented data on the clinical correlates of intact HIV-1 provirus isolated from circulating CD4 T cells of ART-naïve HIV/HBV co-infected (

 <italic>n</italic>=4) individuals recruited in Thailand. A higher level of intact HIV-1 proviruses, analysed using the full-length individual proviral sequencing, FLIP assay,
