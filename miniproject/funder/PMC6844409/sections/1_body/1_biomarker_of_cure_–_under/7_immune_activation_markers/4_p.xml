<p id="JVEv5-para-0071">Most participants had genetically unique HIV-1 proviruses and no associations were found between HBV markers (HBV DNA and HBsAg) and the frequency and diversity of intact proviruses in the co-infected individuals. However, higher levels of immune activation markers, specifically plasma CXCL10, sCD14 and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), were associated with increased frequency of intact proviruses while sCD14 and CXCL10 were significantly associated with enhanced genetic diversity of intact proviruses in the co-infected individuals. Similar associations were, however, not found in the mono-infected group. Studies are now ongoing to explore the impact of HBV on the HIV-1 reservoir 3 years post-ART initiation. Understanding how HBV interacts with the establishment and persistence of HIV-1 following ART is critical given their overlapping epidemics.</p>
