<p id="JVEv5-para-0197">An update from the Sunnylands Summit, ‘The Path Towards ending HIV’ was presented by Sharon Lewin (Doherty Institute, Melbourne, Australia). The meeting, jointly hosted by the IAS and the Annenberg Trust at Sunnylands, aimed to define a target product profile (TPP) for an HIV-1 cure applicable in low and lower-middle income settings, taking into account the expected technological, delivery and funding landscape of HIV-1 interventions, such as the future use of long-acting ART, bNAbs and various treatment modalities. Following this summit, two key outputs were determined: the creation of the HIV Cure Africa Acceleration Partnership (HCAAP), a public-private partnership focusing on low and lower-middle income countries in Africa and the establishment of a working group to develop TPPs for an HIV cure.</p>
