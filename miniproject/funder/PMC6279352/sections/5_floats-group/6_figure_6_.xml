  <title>ZIKV infection increases expression of FXR2.</title>
  <p>HeLa cells were infected with WT (MOI of 3) or ∆10 ZIKV (MOI of 4.5) or left non-infected (NI). At 24 hr post-infection, cells were harvested and analyzed for FXR2 expression. (

   <bold>B</bold>) Normalized expression levels of FXR2 from panel A are shown. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Flow cytometry for FXR2 and ZIKV E protein. E protein was stained using the 4G2 antibody and Alexa fluor 488-labeled secondary antibody. FXR2 protein was stained with anti-FXR2 and Alexa fluor 647-labeled secondary antibody. Scatter plots indicate the distribution of ZIKV positive cells in the NI cells (black, top left panel), WT ZIKV (blue, top right panel) and ∆10 ZIKV (red, bottom left panel) infected cells. Histograms (bottom right panel) indicate FXR2 expression as Alexa fluor 647 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). (

   <bold>E</bold>) Representative immunofluorescence images from two independent experiments indicate the accumulation of FXR2 (red) in cells infected with WT and ∆10 ZIKV (green). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342. White scale bar = 20 µm.

    <title>FMRP knockdown increases protein levels of known FMRP targets.</title>
    <p>HeLa cells were transfected with control siRNA (siControl) and FMR1 siRNA (siFMR1 pool) and relative protein expression of FXR2, BRD4 and TLN1 was evaluated by WB assays (
     <bold>A</bold>) and densitometry analysis (normalized to GAPDH expression as loading control) after 24 (
     <bold>B</bold>), 48 (
     <bold>C</bold>) and 72 (
     <bold>D</bold>) hours post-transfection (hpt). Data represents the mean ±SEM of three biological replicates (*p&lt;0.05).

    <title>Differential expression of TLN1 and BRD4 during infection with WT ZIKV and ∆10 ZIKV.</title>
    <p>HeLa cells were infected with WT (MOI of 3) and ∆10 ZIKV (MOI of 4.5) or left non-infected (NI) as control. After 24 hr post-infection cells were harvested and analyzed for expression of validated FMRP targets TLN1 and BRD4. WB assays indicate the expression of TLN1 (
     <bold>A</bold>) and BRD4 (
     <bold>C</bold>), GAPDH (loading control) and viral protein NS4B. (
     <bold>B</bold>) Relative expression of TLN1 in WT and ∆10 ZIKV infected cells was analyzed by densitometry, adjusted to loading control and normalized to non-infected cells (NI). An additional 175 kDa band reactive to the anti-BRD4 shows up only in ZIKV infected cells. (
     <bold>D</bold>) Densitometry values corresponding to both immunoreactive bands, 204 and 175 kDa, were summed, adjusted to GAPDH and normalized to non-infected cells (NI). Data indicates the mean ±SEM of two independent experiments (*p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.005, ***p&lt;0.001).
