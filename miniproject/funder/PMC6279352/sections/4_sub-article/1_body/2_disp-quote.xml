 <p>1b) Figure 5. shows that Δ10 ZIKV is disproportionately enhanced by FMRP KD. While WT virus was enhanced 3.5 fold, the infection rate of the Δ10 ZIKV rose near 5 fold. However, in Figure 3C silencing of FMRP increases the infection rate of the WT about 6 fold. Are these experiments comparable?</p>
