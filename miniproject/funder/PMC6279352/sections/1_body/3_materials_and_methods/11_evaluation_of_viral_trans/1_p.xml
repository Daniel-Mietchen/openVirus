 <sup>4</sup> HeLa cells were plated in 24-well plates. Next day, cells were transfected with control siRNA or FMR1_2 siRNA. After 46 hr of knockdown, cells were treated with 0.05% DMSO or 20 µM NITD008 for 2 hr before infection with the ZIKV reporter at an MOI of 3. NITD008 or DMSO were retained in media during the infection. After 1 hr of incubation, inoculum was retired and replaced with fresh media containing DMSO or NITD008. 2.5 hr later, cells were washed five times with 1 × PBS and lysed with 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> lysis buffer (Promega). Additionally, cycloheximide (CHX) treatment (200 µM) was used as a background control in absence or presence of NITD008. For this condition, cells were pretreated with CHX (in absence or presence of NITD008) for 2 hr before ZIKV reporter infection and CHX was retained during infection until cell lysis. Luciferase assays were performed using the High-Affinity NanoBit evaluation system (Promega) and the Enspire plate reader (Perkin Elmer).
