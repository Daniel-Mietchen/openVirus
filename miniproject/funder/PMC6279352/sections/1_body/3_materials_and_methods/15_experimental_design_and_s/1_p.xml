<p>The independent experiments were performed with three biological replicates except for 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>. For 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> two infected mice, each with three technical replicates, were processed separately. Differences between treatments and control groups were evaluated using the SigmaPlot/Stat package 11. In all cases, parametric or nonparametric tests and the appropriate post-hoc test were applied. If data met with assumptions of normality (Shapiro-Wilk test) and equal variance test, a 
 <italic>t</italic>-test (parametric) was conducted. Data that did not meet with either normality test or equal variance test were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test.
