<p>To determine percentage of infection, 3 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> HeLa cells per well were plated in 24-well plates. 24 hr later, cells were transfected with control siRNA or FMR1 siRNA (pool). After 48 hr of knockdown, cells were infected with ZIKV-Dakar for 48 hr, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized and blocked for 20 min (1 × PBS, 0.1% tween 20, 1% FBS), and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with mouse 4G2 mouse (E protein) and 1 hr with Goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa fluor 647. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich). Image acquisition and infection rates were calculated using a high-content imaging microscope (Opera Phenix, Perkin Elmer). To visualize the accumulation of FXR2 protein in infected cells, glass slides with non-infected or ZIKV infected cells (WT or Δ10 ZIKV) for 24 hr were fixed, permeabilized and blocked as described above. Viral protein was detected using 4G2 antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa fluor 488. FXR2 protein was stained using rabbit anti-FXR2 and goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa fluor 647. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma-Aldrich) and images were acquired using an Olympus fluorescence microscope.
