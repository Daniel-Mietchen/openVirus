<p>JEG3 (human choriocarcinoma), HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma) and Vero cells were maintained in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 × penicillin/streptomycin (pen-strep) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. C6/36 cells (Aedes albopictus) were grown in RPMI medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS (GenDEPOT) and 1 × pen strep and incubated at 28°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination every three months. HeLa and JEG3 cells were authenticated by STR analysis at the UTMB Molecular Genomics Core. Dakar 41525 (ZIKV-Dakar), Cambodia FSS13025 (ZIKV-Cambodia) and PRVABC59 (ZIKV-Puerto Rico) strains were kindly provided by Scott Weaver (UTMB) and Nikos Vasilakis (UTMB) and propagated in C6/36 cells. DENV-2-NGC (New Guinea C strain) was propagated as previously described (

 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2016</xref>). Δ10 ZIKV and its WT version (ZIKV-Cambodia) were derived from infectious clones and propagated in Vero cells as described in (
 <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Shan et al., 2017b</xref>). Viral infections were performed in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS. After 1 hr of incubation, media was replaced with complete DMEM media. MOIs and post-infection times are specified in the figures.
