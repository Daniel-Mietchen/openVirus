<p>We further assayed the expression of BRD4 in ZIKV-infected cells. Although the anti-BRD4 antibody used recognizes the largest known BRD4 isoform, we observed a second and faster migrating band of ~175 kDa that appeared only in ZIKV-infected cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Since there are no annotated isoforms of this predicted mass, the data suggest that BRD4 is cleaved during ZIKV infection. We analyzed the sum of signals for both 204 kDa and 175 kDa BRD4 species and observed a 1.6-fold increase of BRD4 expression only in WT ZIKV infected cells (
