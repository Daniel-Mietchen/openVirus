<p>We chose to focus on FMRP due to its strong association with ZIKV RNA in binding experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), well-established association with human neurodevelopmental disease, and high level of expression in tissues relevant to ZIKV, such as brain and reproductive tract (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Devys et al., 1993</xref>). To validate the interaction of FMRP with ZIKV 3′ UTR in the context of ZIKV infection, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) with anti-FMRP antibody or isotype control and detected ZIKV RNAs using northern blot (NB) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). HeLa cells were infected with Dakar 41525 (ZIKV-Dakar), Cambodia FSS13025 (ZIKV-Cambodia) or PRVABC59 (ZIKV-Puerto Rico) strains, cell lysates were collected and FMRP was immunoprecipitated. Total RNA interacting with FMRP was isolated and the presence of ZIKV RNAs was detected by NB using a DNA probe that hybridizes to the ZIKV 3′ UTR. Both ZIKV sfRNA and viral genome co-precipitated with anti-FMRP but not control IgG (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) for all three virus strains. Interestingly, quantification of sfRNA and genomic RNA signals indicated that FMRP preferentially interacts with the ZIKV sfRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We additionally performed RIP with anti-PTB and isotype control antibodies and showed that viral genomes and sfRNA minimally co-precipitated with PTB and enrichment was much weaker than that for FMRP RIP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We also analyzed the integrity of unbound viral RNAs present in supernatants after RIP. This analysis revealed that viral RNAs did not degrade during the RIP procedure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).We determined whether or not the interaction of FMRP with ZIKV RNA occurs in testes of infected mice. We selected testes for analysis because this tissue exhibits relatively high viral load in the A129 mouse model (IFNAR1 knockout) of ZIKV infection (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Dowall et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Rossi et al., 2016</xref>). FMRP was subjected to IP from testes lysates of mice infected with ZIKV-Cambodia for 6 days and RT-qPCR was used to measure co-precipitating viral RNA using qPCR assays targeting the viral genome exclusively or both the genome and sfRNA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We observed enrichment of viral genomes by ~2 fold for FMRP IP compared to the negative control. Importantly, the enrichment was nearly twice as robust when using a qPCR assay that detects both genomes and the sfRNA. These results validate the interaction of FMRP with ZIKV RNA in vivo and, as observed in infected cultured cells, indicate preferential binding of FMRP to the ZIKV sfRNA.
