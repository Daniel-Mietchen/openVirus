<p>Before this work, there was no knowledge of host proteins that bind and are modulated by ZIKV sfRNA. We previously used RNA affinity chromatography coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry (RAC-MS) to identify proteins that interact with DENV-2 sfRNA (

Here, we used a similar approach with lysates from JEG3 (choriocarcinoma) cells, which are permissive for ZIKV infection, to identify host proteins that interact with full-length ZIKV 3′ UTRs of the pandemic Asian lineage strain PRVABC59 and the African strain MR766. This analysis revealed 27 proteins that preferentially interacted with the ZIKV RNAs compared to an RNA derived from the coding sequence of DENV (

We did not detect major differences in the protein-binding profiles of PRVABC59 and MR766 ZIKV sequences. Eight proteins that were identified by ≥2 unique peptides and were ≥2 times as abundant in both the ZIKV sequences relative to the control RNA were considered as high-confidence ZIKV 3′ UTR binding proteins (
