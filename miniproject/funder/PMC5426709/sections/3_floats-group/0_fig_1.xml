  <title>Diagram of model flows.</title>
  <p>This figure shows a graphical representation of the model pathways. The model has a layer for each set of dynamics (PWID, HIV, HCV), and each layer is composed of compartments with flows between them. For example, in the PWID layer, individuals in the active user compartment move into the ex-PWID and Methadone Maintenance compartments at different rates. Each PWID compartment in turn is broken up into compartments for each disease stage, so the total number of compartments is number of PWID compartments multiplied by the number of HIV compartments multiplied by the number of HCV compartments. Full equations and descriptions can be found in Section 5 of
