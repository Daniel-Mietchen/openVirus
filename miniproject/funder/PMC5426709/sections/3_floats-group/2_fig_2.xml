  <title>Model fit to HIV and HCV prevalence.</title>
  <p>This figure shows the range of model estimates for HIV (blue) and HCV (green) prevalence among PWID in the shaded regions, with the estimate from the best-fit parameter set represented by the dashed line. Data estimates and corresponding confidence intervals to which the model was calibrated are represented by circles and error bars.</p>
