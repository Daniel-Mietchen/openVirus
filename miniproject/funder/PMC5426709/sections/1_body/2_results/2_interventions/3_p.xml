<p>Looking another 10 years forward to when high-efficacy DAA therapy for HCV is more affordable, it can be seen that implementing HCV treatment rollout in conjunction with ART and MMT scale-ups over the period from 2027-2037 can provide substantial reductions in deaths in this population. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177195.g006">Fig 6</xref> demonstrates that including HCV treatment coverage on top of MMT and ART scale-ups can double or triple gains in reductions in deaths, indicating that the marginal benefit of rolling out HCV treatment is large. Even when ART and MMT have been scaled up at high levels, there are still many deaths not averted.
