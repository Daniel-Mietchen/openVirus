<p>Interventions were each scaled up to their final coverage levels over a five-year period from 2017–2022 and run at that level for a further five years 2022–2027. The plots in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177195.g003">3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177195.g004">4</xref> represent the reductions in HIV and HCV incidence, prevalence, and deaths under each type of intervention. HIV incidence and deaths are impacted by both ART scale-up and MMT scale-up. For HCV, MMT scale-up has a much more pronounced effect on incidence than ART scale-up. MMT has the strongest impact on incidence reduction because it stops exposure, targeting both infected and susceptible PWID. It has a greater impact even than ART on reducing HIV incidence, though ART has a more direct effect reducing HIV deaths. The impact of MMT on deaths from HIV and HCV is indirect: while MMT does have an impact on overall deaths from overdose, it only impacts deaths from infection by preventing future infections. With these prevention effects, reductions in deaths from HIV will follow within 10 to 20 years; but reductions in HCV deaths will not appear until longer after scale-up because of the longer duration of HCV infection. ART, however, will afford a small impact on HCV deaths due its reduction of the extent to which HIV speeds HCV progression. Combinations of ART and MMT scale-up have an additive effect on total deaths in the population, with MMT scale-up contributing to reductions in deaths of otherwise-healthy PWID.
