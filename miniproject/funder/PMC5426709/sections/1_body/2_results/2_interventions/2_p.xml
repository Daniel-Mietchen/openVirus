<p>As can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177195.g005">Fig 5</xref>, however, even with ART and MMT scale-up, the total number of deaths per year drops after 10 years of intervention, but the number of deaths due to HCV per year remains almost constant across interventions. This result suggests that including an HCV-specific intervention is necessary and may have significant marginal impacts.
