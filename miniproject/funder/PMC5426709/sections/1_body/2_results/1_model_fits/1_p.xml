<p>Our model is able to reproduce the following observed trends in HIV and HCV prevalence: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0177195.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows the range of model estimates of prevalence (light-colored swathes) as well as the best-fitting parameter set output (dashed line) of the model to data. The parameters varied in the fitting process were coefficients in HIV and HCV hazard functions for incidence (coefficients changed after advent of ART), initial HIV prevalence, and impact of needle and syringe programs on the force of infection. Specifically, the 
 <italic>β</italic> terms represent the density-dependent transmission probability of each infection. The hazard of infection is proportional to number of people already infected, and the proportionality constant is given by each 
 <italic>β</italic>. 
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> shows the maximum-likelihood estimates for each fitted parameter along with the 95% univariate bounds for each individual parameter estimate.
