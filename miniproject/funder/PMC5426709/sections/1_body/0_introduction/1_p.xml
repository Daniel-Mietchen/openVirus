<p>Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) afflicts 150 million people globally, the majority of whom are people who inject drugs (PWID) living in Asia and Africa [

 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Coinfection dynamics are complex at within- and between-host levels, as the two pathogens share a transmission route and each pathogen can speed the disease progression of the other [

 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Due to the challenges of navigating two chronic infections and their complex interactions, very few models thus far have looked at modeling HIV-HCV co-epidemics explicitly [

 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). HIV modeling studies that focus on PWID have explored the impact of harm reduction strategies such as needle-and-syringe programs (NSP) and methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) on the HIV epidemic among PWID, and found that gains in terms of infections and deaths averted can be substantial with adequate scale-up [

The HIV and HCV co-epidemics around the globe are fueled by the underlying problem of injection drug use, so our study builds on previous work by incorporating a specific dynamical model in PWID to explore the potential of both HIV and HCV treatment interventions alongside harm-reduction interventions to assess gains in the HIV and HCV co-epidemic in a specific at-risk community [
