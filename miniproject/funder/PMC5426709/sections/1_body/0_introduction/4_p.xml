<p>Estimates of HCV prevalence among PWID in Vietnam have ranged up to 75% since the 1990’s [

 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Coinfection with HIV and HCV is very common in PWID, with some estimates of the percentage of HIV-infected PWID coinfected with HCV at 100% [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Coinfection introduces a series of complications, e.g. HIV speeds the progression rate of HCV, and HCV can complicate administration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) due to increased risk of hepatotoxicity [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Recent estimates suggest that nearly ∼90% of HIV-infected individuals in Vietnam have a CD4 count of &lt;200 cells/
 <italic>μ</italic>L upon ART initiation [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This delayed access can mean that for coinfected individuals, chronic HCV may have progressed to chronic liver disease (CLD) (due to increased HCV progression rates in coinfected individuals), which can compromise gains in life expectancy conferred by ART initiation to an even greater extent than late ART initiation does in mono-infected patients [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In the pre-ART era, AIDS-related mortality was high enough to mask the effect of liver disease, as HCV-related cirrhosis and cancer deaths would come later than an HIV-related death. However, as studies in other populations have shown (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]), the scale-up of ART and subsequent reduction in AIDS-related mortality have revealed the mortality impact of escalated liver disease progression, with liver disease accounting for 14-18% of non-AIDS deaths in the HIV-infected population around the globe [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Currently, treatment for HCV is not widely available or publicly funded in Vietnam, though its impact could be substantial [
