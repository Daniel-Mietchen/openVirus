<p>Assessing HCV treatment in such models is particularly timely and important with the advent of new, direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs). These new drugs have good safety profiles, low risks of drug interactions, high tolerability, and can be administered in 12-24 week courses, in addition to being very potent with &gt;90% cure rates; this makes them better options than interferon-ribavirin (IFN-RBV) combination therapies that have been in use up until now [

In low- and middle-income countries, where even the $15,000â€“$20,000 cost of IFN-RBV is too high for most patients, the DAAs as they are currently priced will not be an implementable solution. However, Gilead Sciences, the company that manufactures the DAAs sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, has already implemented reduced-cost treatment in Egypt, offering the 12-week course for $900 [
