<p>Tackling the underlying problem of injection drug use is a third puzzle piece to addressing the HIV-HCV epidemics in Vietnam. Since the 1990s, one of of the main methods of injection drug use control has been detention of PWID in rehabilitation centers (known as 06 centers) [

A 2011 evaluation report on harm reduction efforts indicated a substantial but heterogeneous increase in NSP coverage across the country between 2005 and 2009. In HCMC, the number of clean needles per IDU per year (16 needles) remained well below the national target of 200 per PWID per year [
