<p>The course of an injecting drug user’s life was modeled using three stages (only current and ex-PWID were included in the model). Persons enter the PWID community at a certain rate and remain there for the average duration that PWID inject in Vietnam. The rate of entry into the PWID community is time-dependent and constructed so as to reproduce the estimated change in the total number of PWID in this setting. During this time, PWID have an increased death rate due to overdose [

 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], as well as PWID who temporarily stop using but then relapse. The Ex-PWID compartment includes only those who have permanently stopped injecting. From the community, PWID can be recruited into MMT, or can cease injecting (and thus exit the community) spontaneously. PWID in MMT programs decrease their rates of injecting. However, retention is imperfect and relapse is common. Assumptions are that MMT increases life expectancy because excess risk of death due to drug-related complications is ameliorated, and also increases flow into ART programs. The latter assumption is based on the criterion for MMT initiation that PWIDs should be on ART (though not all are) or that ART should be started with MMT [
