<p>After the initial interventions are run for 10 years, HCV treatment coverage is implemented at varying levels and projected out a further 10 years from 2027–2037 on top of maximum previous scale up of ART and MMT coverage (80% and 50%). This 10-year delay was chosen in relation to when the patents on new DAAs are likely to expire (2026–2029) rendering the drugs more affordable [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The coverage percentage indicates the proportion of chronic HCV patients who receive treatment by the end of each chronic stage. If treatment is successful, the patient will move back into the HCV-negative Susceptible state. There is little known about whether patients treated with DAAs acquire any protection from reinfection, so we do not assume that treated individuals acquire any immunity [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. We do not, however, assume that patients who have progressed through all stages of fibrosis to CLD recover. There is some evidence that CLD patients treated with DAAs have similar death rates to those left untreated [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], so we assume similar death rates for treated and untreated CLD patients. The same coverage of treatment is provided to all chronically HCV-infected patients (not restricted to those with chronic liver disease). It is assumed that treatment efficacy is high (around 90%) in line with estimates of the efficacy of the DAA combinations [
