<p>The initial interventions to be implemented in this model involve planned scale-up of MMT coverage and ART coverage. Each scale-up is implemented at varying coverage levels and rates, individually and in tandem. The ART and MMT percentages represent percentage of PWID newly initiated on the intervention each year. These initial interventions are projected out for a 10-year period from 2017 to 2027, and then incidence of each infection and deaths are compared, to assess relative impact.</p>
