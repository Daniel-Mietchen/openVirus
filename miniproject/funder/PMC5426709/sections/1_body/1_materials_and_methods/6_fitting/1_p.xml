<p>The model was calibrated to data on HIV and HCV prevalence using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) with a binomial likelihood function. We varied the parameters governing the hazard functions for HIV and HCV acquisition, initial HIV prevalence, and risk-reduction due to NSP so the model outputs reproduced the HIV and HCV prevalence trends observed in the data. Parameters governing the hazard functions were allowed to vary between the pre- and post-ART availability time periods, with the impact of ART availability beginning between 2005 and 2007. Initial seeds were drawn from estimates for the range of each parameter, and the parameter space was explored using the Nelder-Mead algorithm with MATLAB 2015bâ€™s fminsearch function (See Sections 5.1.1, 5.3.1 and 6 in
