<p>HCV progression and transmission were similarly modeled using acute and chronic stages of infection. Susceptible individuals become acutely infected via a similar hazard function that is based on an estimate of HCV prevalence weighted for stage of infection and treatment status, and either clear infection (with or without protective immunity) [

 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]) have contradictory results, but on the whole they indicate that some individuals have protection against reinfection after spontaneous clearance, so we have chosen to include protection in the model. There are four stages of chronic infection, aligning with an Erlang distribution fit to data on HCV progression in PWID with and without HIV [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and roughly corresponding to the four stages of fibrosis progression [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. As noted studies including in Di Martino et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] HCV progression is faster in HIV coinfected individuals. The last stage is all-cause chronic liver disease, encompassing compensated and decompensated cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
