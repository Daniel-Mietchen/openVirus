<p>Estimates for HCV prevalence among PWID in Vietnam are uniformly high, approaching 90% in major cities [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In northern Vietnam, a prospective cohort study in 200 young male active heroin users showed that HCV anti-body prevalence increased linearly from ∼30%
 <italic>to</italic> ∼ 70% as duration of injection use increased from 10 months to 30 months [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while another study in Bac Ninh province found that 229 out of 309 PWID (74%) tested positive for HCV [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], and a cross-sectional study in Northern Vietnam on PWID entering 06 drug treatment centers reported positive HCV tests among 350 of 455 PWID (77%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In southern Vietnam, an earlier study reported 58 out of 67 PWID examined (87%) were positive for anti-HCV [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and HCV prevalence in HCMC among PWID recruited into MMT pilot study in 2008 was 69.7% (n = 498) [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Lastly, HCV prevalence estimates among men who actively inject drugs in HCMC according to sentinel surveillance reports of the Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) from 2006 to 2009 were 71% (63.6-78.4%, n = 310) [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. HIV prevalence estimates are from sentinel surveillance reports compiled from the 2006 and 2009 IBBS [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. IBBS is community-based systematic surveillance purposed for collecting information on health status and risk behaviors among high-HIV risk populations (MSM, commercial sex-workers and PWID). Recruitment was done by respondent-driven sampling, and information was obtained by one-on-one interviews and collection of biological samples.
