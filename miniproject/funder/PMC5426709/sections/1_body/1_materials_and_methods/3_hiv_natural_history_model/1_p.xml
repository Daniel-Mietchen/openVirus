<p>HIV progression and transmission were modeled using acute, asymptomatic and AIDS (CD4&lt;200 cells/
 <italic>μ</italic>L) stages of infection. Susceptible individuals flow into the acute infection state via a hazard function that is based on a weighted estimate of HIV prevalence. Asymptomatic infection is distributed over three stages of equal duration, reflecting an Erlang distribution [
