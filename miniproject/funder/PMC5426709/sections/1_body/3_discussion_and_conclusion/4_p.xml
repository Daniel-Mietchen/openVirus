<p>Currently, interferon and ribavirin treatment is prohibitively expensive in Vietnam, has limited efficacy, and is associated with side effects that can be severe [

 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. However, the real costs of manufacturing these drugs are lower. In the future, it may be possible to produce 12-week regimens for $100–$250 [

However, the political will to expand treatment options for chronic hepatitis C infection exists: the Vietnamese Ministry of Health recently updated its national guidelines in September 2016 and added DAAs as alternative options to interferon-based regimens as alternative options [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. Generically-made DAA-based regimens such as sofosbuvir and ledipasvir are now available in the clinics for patients who can afford the treatment and cost approximately $700 to $900 a month for patients [

National scaling up of DAA therapy will require a political investment, leverage of the country’s extensive infrastructure and skilled healthcare workforce in HIV, continued scaling up of harm reduction programs for PWID, and continued efforts to reduce the drug price. This modeling study can provide the data for which cost-effective analyses can be conducted to guide the national treatment strategies. An analysis of cost shown in Section 3 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0177195.s001">S1 File</xref> indicates that cost-per-life-year saved may decrease with increased HCV treatment coverage. However, unlike the predictions about cases and deaths averted, this particular result is very sensitive to model structure. We present cost analyses under three different model structures; when we assume that some proportion of treated individuals acquire protection from reinfection after treatment, the cost-per-life-year saved decreases with increasing treatment coverage. However, if we assume treated individuals can get reinfected at the same rate as susceptible individuals, the number of deaths averted over a longer period of time goes down and the cost-per-life year saved ends up increasing, as more people get treated for HCV. This sensitivity indicates that it is important to ascertain reinfection rates for treated individuals in order to conduct accurate cost-effectiveness analyses.
