<p>MMT scale-up is becoming a reality in Vietnam, with a proposed 20 new clinics opening in 2016, and a goal of reaching 80,000 PWID across the country by the end of 2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Studies thus far have indicated that MMT has good acceptability among PWID, and that retention rates are high (âˆ¼90% after 1 year) [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. MMT has the potential to offer longer life expectancy to PWID with and without HIV and HCV, and as can be seen in the simulations, the potential to reduce incidence and deaths significantly.
