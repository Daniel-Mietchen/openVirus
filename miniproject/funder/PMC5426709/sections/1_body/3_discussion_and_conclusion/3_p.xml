<p>Our results confirm predictions by Durier et. al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Martin et. al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] that show very optimistic results for reductions in prevalence and incidence of HCV after roll-out of HCV treatment. In addition to extending healthy life expectancy for newly-cured HCV patients, HCV treatment coverage of coinfected patients insures the gains in life expectancy given by ART by protecting those patients from liver disease deaths. Our model indicates that ART and MMT scale-ups, while effective, still leave many deaths not averted unless HCV treatment is rolled out in tandem. This result holds across varying levels of ART and MMT scale-ups, suggesting that HCV treatment roll-out need not wait until ART and MMT hit optimal levels.
