<p>In this study, we use a mathematical model of the HIV and HCV co-epidemics in HCMC, Vietnam to analyze the effect of various interventions on future disease burden and cost-effectiveness of these infections. Our results indicate that scale-up of ART coverage can have an impact on HIV burden, though very little impact on HCV burden. MMT scale-up, however, can have an impact on both HIV and HCV incidence levels even at below-optimal coverage. We examine the impact of DAA therapy for HCV, and we conclude that HCV treatment roll-out in combination with MMT/ART scale-up has the potential to yield a multi-fold increase in the total number of deaths averted, compared to MMT/ART scale-up alone. While there has been extensive modeling work done on HIV and HCV monoinfection, only a small number of other studies have modeled coinfection. Monoinfection models can provide much insight into impacts of interventions on each infection e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0177195.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] even in highly coinfected populations, but there are details that they will necessarily miss. For example, only with a coinfection model is it possible to measure the collateral impact on HCV of treating HIV. Because there are potentiating effects between the infections, only a model that takes into account both infections will be able to assess the impact of interventions for one on the other, and assess fully the impact of interventions such as MMT that target both infections. Additionally, though there has been little evidence of drug resistance to the new DAAs, its emergence is likely and it probably will not be independent from HIV status.
