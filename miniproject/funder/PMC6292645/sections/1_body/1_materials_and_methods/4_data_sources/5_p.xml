<p>We estimated the degree of structural deprivation in a 
 <italic>bairro</italic> using two data sources. First, we obtained information for subnormal agglomerations (AS, 
 <italic>aglomerados subnormais</italic>) by census tract from the 2010 Demographic Census. AS is a habitation class characterized by tenuous legal claim and poor structural development. An AS is constituted by, at minimum, 51 inhabited units on illegally occupied land or land obtained within the prior ten years; constructed haphazardly or outside preexisting structural standards; and lacking access to essential public services such as electricity, garbage collection, water grids, and sewage systems [

 <italic>Instituto de Planejamento de Fortaleza</italic>) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], we obtained data on precarious settlements (AP, 
 <italic>assentamentos precários</italic>). AP is an exclusively urban classification introduced by the National Housing Secretariat (
 <italic>Secretaria Nacional de Habitação</italic>) that extends the AS definition to include settlement types that are structurally insecure, neglected, or unplanned, even if legally occupied [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The spatial boundaries of AP and AS were merged, then overlaid on the 
 <italic>bairro</italic> boundaries to estimate the intersecting areal proportion for each 
 <italic>bairro</italic>. We refer to this aggregate class as subnormal settlements (SS).
