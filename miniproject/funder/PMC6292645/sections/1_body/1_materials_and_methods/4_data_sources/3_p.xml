<p>We obtained annual population data by 
 <italic>bairro</italic> from the 2010 Demographic Census [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and estimated 
 <italic>bairro</italic> population growth from 2011â€“2015 using estimates of population growth for the city of Fortaleza from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). Using dengue cases and population, we calculated incidence rates per 100,000 people for each 
 <italic>bairro</italic>, and created a binary variable to indicate low and high transmission months in each year: (i) high corresponds to months with more than 9% of annual transmission (or more than one would expect if cases were uniformly distributed over the year), or more than 1,000 total reported cases citywide, and (ii) low corresponds to the remaining months.
