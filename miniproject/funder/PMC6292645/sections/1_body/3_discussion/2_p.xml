<p>While the contribution of non-residential sites (such as the SPs) to vector propagation has been discussed [

Although special surveillance of SPs is mandatory in Brazil, the absence of rigorous examination of the importance of SP infestation for dengue virus transmission limits the capacity of municipal actors to take evidence-based steps to improve their routine control activities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to use fine scale information on SP inspection.
