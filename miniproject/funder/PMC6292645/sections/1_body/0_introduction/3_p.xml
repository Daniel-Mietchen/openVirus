<p>A variety of vector control strategies are available, targeting different stages of the mosquito [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], as well as educational campaigns aimed at promoting behaviors that minimize the proliferation of breeding habitats [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) endorses an integrated approach to vector control [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], including an ecological, biological, social (‘Eco-bio-social’) dengue transmission model emphasizing community participation, as well as identification of local sources of dengue exposure [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A primary challenge to interventions, however, is implementation at scale in a manner that can be sustained across periods of epidemic and interepidemic transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Insecticide treated bednets are inadequate to rebuff diurnal, endophilic 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, and large-scale adulticide fogging has been characterized as a cosmetic measure [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. There is evidence that treatment of curtains and screens with insecticide reduces 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> density [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] with communal spillover effects [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and that indoor residual [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and space [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] spraying reduce both vector density and dengue incidence.
