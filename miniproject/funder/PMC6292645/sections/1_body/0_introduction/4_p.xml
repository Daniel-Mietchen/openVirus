<p>Determining the time, place, and combination of control interventions requires proper knowledge of dengue epidemiology, which is influenced not only by the characteristics of the vector, but also by many biological (e.g., serotype), social (e.g., education), behavioral (e.g., storage of water), economic (e.g., income), and environmental (e.g., climate) factors [

First, a cyclical inter-annual pattern of epidemic and lower-level interepidemic transmission exists, with as much as a tenfold difference in observed cases year-to-year [
