<p>Dengue is transmitted primarily by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and secondarily by 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], in predominantly urban human transmission cycles [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> prefers human blood [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; is more likely to oviposit in water storage containers than natural depressions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]; and its eggs withstand desiccation for more than four months, on average, in high humidity settings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Common breeding habitats include containers for water storage; domestic and cookware receptacles; flower pots; and discarded objects, including tires and trash [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As a result, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> flourishes in crowded human settlements lacking access to piped water, waste collection, and adequate health and vector control systems. Such areas typify expansive and unplanned urban peripheries in tropical and subtropical latitudes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In those settings, even when access to piped water is prevalent, intermittent and unreliable provision may compel populations to store water in containers, introducing 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> oviposition sites [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. High population density (and thus easy availability of a blood meal or breeding site) and anthropogenic constraints on urban low-level flight (such as highways, railroads, and buildings), likely limit mean 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> flight range to &lt; 200m in urban settings [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Notwithstanding average and maximum flight distances, adult 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> remain in close proximity to the site of their larval/pupal development [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], predominantly concentrating and transmitting DENV indoors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], such that a substantial share of viral circulation is believed attributable to the socially structured movement of human hosts through areas where they are exposed to DENV-infected mosquitoes [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006990.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
