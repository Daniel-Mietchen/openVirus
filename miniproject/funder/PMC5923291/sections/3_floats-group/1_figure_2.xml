  <p>HIV peak prevalence versus the geometric mean (taken due to similarity) of male and female (
   <bold>A</bold>) HIV transmission rates and (
   <bold>B</bold>) extra-couple contact coefficients, and versus (
   <bold>C</bold>) male and (
   <bold>D</bold>) female pre-couple contact coefficients. Colors indicate SDP. Solid and dashed lines show the weighted linear regression line and 95% confidence intervals, respectively, for the best model as chosen via AICc (models with 
   <italic>Δ</italic>AICc &gt; 2 compared to the best model are rejected). Univariate models (not shown) corresponding to panels (
   <bold>B</bold>–
   <bold>D</bold>) yielded 
   <italic>Δ</italic>AICc = 9.39, 5.19, and 4.27, respectively, while the full multivariate model including all predictors yielded 
   <italic>Δ</italic>AICc = 5.8 (see Table 
   <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> for further detail on each model’s results). The range of SDPs shown here reflects only those couples included in the model analysis (i.e. excluding those with missing relationship data) and thus differs slightly from that given in the main text.
