<p id="Par31">If in fact regional variation in transmission rates drives a large proportion of the observed variation in HIV prevalence, this has important implications for the prospects of various interventions. For instance, this would suggest that the level of effort allocated to known effective interventions (e.g., ART coverage, medical male circumcision coverage) necessary to reduce incidence below a given threshold could differ dramatically between two communities, even if they exhibit similar sexual network dynamics.</p>
