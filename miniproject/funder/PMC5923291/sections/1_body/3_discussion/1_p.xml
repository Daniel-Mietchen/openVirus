<p id="Par26">For decades, the HIV community has struggled to explain the variation in epidemic prevalence across SSA. Efforts to disentangle the epidemiological significance of biological and behavioral factors have been criticized as too reliant on mathematical transmission models

However, the divergent methods and populations used to estimate model parameters and the scarcity of empirically derived sexual networks have precluded a systematic partitioning of the relative influence of each factor on epidemic prevalence. Other, cross-sectional analyses of empirical data have found correlations between prevalence and biological or self-reported behavioral risk factors
