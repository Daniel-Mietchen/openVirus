<p id="Par27">We suggest that the ideal approach to address this question would interpret data using mechanistic models capable of distinguishing distinct causal pathways from each other by identifying nonlinear patterns in data that can be causally explained by some pathways and not others. To that end, we fit a mechanistic couples transmission model to representative samples from 15 SSA countries (and one region) and simultaneously estimated multiple components of transmission. Due to computational challenges, we were only able to fit homogenous models that do not account for individual heterogeneity or assortativity in infection risk. We found that when interpreted through the lens of these homogeneous models, couple serostatus patterns strongly suggest that the principal driver of between-country variation in both HIV prevalence and SDP is between-country variation in the transmission rate (Fig.
