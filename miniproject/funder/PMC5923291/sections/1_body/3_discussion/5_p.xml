 </sup>, we have also made several advances. First and foremost, here and previously
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup> we leverage individual-level relationship history and serostatus data to understand couple serostatus dynamics, rather than relying on population-level statistics. Without individual-level data on relationship duration, an analysis cannot accurately represent the denominator of time at risk when estimating transmission between serodiscordant partners. We believe this explains why our transmission rate estimates (ranging 2.1–20 per 100 person-years) were about half of those of Chemaitelly 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (ranging 4.4–41 per 100 person-years
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>) for each country, though the country-order of transmission rates compares closely between the two analyses (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). The other main advances of our analysis comprise the explicit estimation of pre-couple and extra-couple contact rates for each country; the systematic assessment of which of several factors best explain between-country variation in prevalence; and examination of how individual heterogeneity in infection risk and between-partner assortativity in infection risk alter serostatus dynamics.
