 </sup> (compared to other couples) could increase SDP by dissolving serodiscordant couples before they become concordant positive. Given the scarcity of data, we were unable to assess whether this might explain between-country variation in SDP, though a preliminary analysis suggests it is unlikely (Supplementary Text Section A7, FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). Indeed, we believe it is unlikely that such dissolution would explain significant variation, given the relatively low levels of partner serostatus awareness during the period of study

 </sup> and lack of evidence that awareness differed substantially between countries during the period considered.
