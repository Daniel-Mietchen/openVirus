<p id="Par34">Most HIV modeling studies in Africa have relied on a single transmission rate for the continent, estimated from one or more serodiscordant couple cohort studies. We estimate transmission rates and contact coefficients at the country-level to provide greater spatial resolution into HIV transmission rates than previously available. Nonetheless, recent work has highlighted the substantial

 </sup>, suggesting that biological and behavioral factors vary greatly at even smaller scales. We did not aim to estimate subnational variation in transmission rates both due to computational challenges and due to the smaller sample sizes available within the DHS when considering subnational levels. However, we do believe that subnational studies of variation in transmission rates are warranted in future work.
