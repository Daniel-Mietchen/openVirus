<p id="Par33">While we estimated country-specific transmission rates and sexual contact coefficients, we did not explicitly estimate the drivers underlying the observed between-country variation in these parameters. Such drivers could include between-country variation in male circumcision, interacting co-infections, or host and viral genetics. Data at the individual level were not available on these factors from the DHS (of these factors, male circumcision status was available for some but not all of the DHS analyzed) and so we were unable to include them. Importantly, it is highly likely that not all risk factors for HIV susceptibility or infectivity have been characterized. Thus, there may be many unknown factors that explain geographic variation in transmission rates. Furthermore, even if we had individual data on some of the known risk factors, it remains poorly understood how the myriad factors known to affect HIV transmission interact with each other (i.e. are relative risks simply multiplicative or are there interactions between known risk factors that further amplify or mitigate risk). Thus, rather than try to tease apart the all the constituent factors affecting transmission, we aim only to characterize the average transmission rate at the country level.</p>
