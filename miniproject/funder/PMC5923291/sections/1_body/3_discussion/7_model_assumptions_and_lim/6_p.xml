<p id="Par37">With recent increases in ART coverage, however, we expect the relationship between SDP and HIV transmission rates to have become increasingly complex because—depending on who receives ART and when they receive it in their course of disease—ART can either act to reduce SDP (by increasing the life expectancy of concordant positive partners

 </sup>) or to increase SDP (by reducing infectiousness

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>
 </sup> and thus increasing the time couples spend serodiscordant).
