<p id="Par36">Our model includes the treatment as prevention effect of ART on reducing transmission rates by modeling the risk of infection from casual partners as a function of the proportion of the population that is HIV-infected and not on ART. But, because treatment status was not ascertained in these DHS surveys, we could not model the effects of ART on within-couple transmission or on survival times of infected partners. In a previous sensitivity analysis

 </sup>, most treated individuals would have become eligible for ART only after a long period of exposing their partner to infection. This holds true even considering prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs, which expanded ART coverage for pregnant and postpartum women. WHO guidelines pre-2010 offered ART to pregnant women starting 28 weeks into pregnancy and lasting up until 7 days postpartum. WHOâ€™s 2010 guidelines added option B, in which women are given the opportunity to stay on ART until the end of breastfeeding. Thus, for the period considered PMTCT would have only led to ephemeral reductions in transmission from women to their male partners, and would have had a limited impact on survival.
