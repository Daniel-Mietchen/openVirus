<p id="Par38">For a subset of the countries analyzed, the DHS conducted surveys at multiple years within the period of analysis. For each of these countries, we chose to pool all DHS surveys across years for analysis. We made this choice for two reasons. First, SDP was relatively stable over time across surveys (FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). Second, we did not believe we would have sufficient sample size to pick up evidence of temporal variation in transmission rates or contact coefficients, particularly since cross-sectional couple serostatus patterns observed in a survey reflect transmission dynamics occurring over the preceding decade. In estimating a single set of parameters for each country, we implicitly assumed that HIV transmission rates and sexual contact coefficients were constant over time. Declining HIV prevalence in several countries, however, has been attributed to behavioral changes in response to interventions or overall HIV awareness

 </sup>. Decreasing pre- or extra-couple transmission in recent years, while holding transmission rates constant, could temporarily decrease the SDP (by reducing the creation of new serodiscordant couples from concordant negative couples, while pre-existing serodiscordant couples continue to become positive concordant)

 </sup>. A decreasing transmission rate over time would cause a more direct and permanent increase in SDP. Neither of these patterns, however, appears likely to explain the tight empirical relationship between SDP and peak prevalence. On the other hand, this pattern is parsimoniously explained by between-country variation in transmission rates.
