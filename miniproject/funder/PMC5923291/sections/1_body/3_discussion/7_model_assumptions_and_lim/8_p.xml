<p id="Par39">Finally, in view of the range of the DHS and the scope of our study, we necessarily excluded many couples because of missing or inconsistent data. A notable exclusion was that of all polygamous couples (given the couple-centric nature of our model), which represented a third of all couples in West Africa. Nonetheless, the low prevalence, low transmission rates and high serodiscordant proportion observed in the included (non-polygamous) couples from West African are consistent with our main findings. Previous sensitivity analyses also suggest that our results are robust to the exclusion of couples with missing data

 </sup> and are roughly generalizable to the couples population sampled by DHS. Furthermore, these population samples are likely to be more representative of the general population than are the intervention or cohort studies most frequently used to understand HIV transmission rates, given their narrow selection criteria and the effects of intensive study on participant behavior.
