<p id="Par28">In a sensitivity analysis, however, we show that this conclusion may not be robust to heterogeneity in infection risk or between-partner assortativity therein. These processes also affect couple serostatus patterns, and it is possible that they could vary between countries in ways that would weaken the above results. Future work that can estimate between-country differences in heterogeneity and assortativity will be necessary to more robustly determine which mechanisms can plausibly explain between-country variation in couple serostatus patterns and epidemic prevalence. It is important to keep in mind that such methods may reveal that it is not possible to distinguish these hypotheses with the available survey data.</p>
