 </sup> (in particular, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and the Discussion), we gave intuition for why estimation of these six parameters is possible through the model fitting procedure described above. Here, we briefly provide two complementary ways to understand why these parameters are estimable from these data. For the first way, consider how each parameter affects couple serostatus patterns. For instance, if male-to-female transmission rates are higher, we should see fewer male-positive serodiscordant partnerships, especially amongst couples that have been together for a long time. Similarly, if men have high pre-couple contact rates (lots of risky casual sex before entering into a stable couple), this would increase the proportion of recently formed couples that are male-positive serodiscordant, particularly amongst men who had long periods of sexual activity prior to couple formation. For the second way, consider how two partners’ relationship history can inform when an infected partner is likely to have been infected. Importantly, the data we analyze are before ART was available in these countries or when ART coverage was extremely low (e.g. Fig. 1 in
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>
 </sup>). Thus, any infected individuals sampled in these DHS surveys were likely to have been infected in the previous decade; otherwise they would have died before the survey. So for serodiscordant couples that formed 15 years ago, the infected partner was extremely likely to have been infected extra-couply, not pre-couply (because they would likely already be dead if infected that long ago) or within-couply (because their partner is uninfected).
