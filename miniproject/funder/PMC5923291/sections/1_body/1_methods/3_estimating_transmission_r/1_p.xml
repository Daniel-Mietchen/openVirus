<p id="Par11">To formally estimate these six parameters (two transmission rates and four sexual contact coefficients) we fit the above model to the DHS data sets. To do so requires calculating the likelihood of the observed data for given parameters. We did this by iteratively calculating the probability of each partner’s serostatus and survival for each month of sexual activity from their sexual debuts until their DHS interview date. This yields a likelihood for each couple–i.e. given a couple’s relationship history and values for the six parameters, the probability that the couple exhibited the serostatus that they actually exhibited in the DHS. We used Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo to fit this model to the data from each country, yielding the transmission rates and sexual contact coefficients that maximized the joint probability of all observed couples being alive and exhibiting their observed serostatus on their DHS survey date. The ten West African countries analyzed exhibited very few HIV-positive individuals in their sampled populations. This made it difficult to fit our model. We thus pooled these countries together for analysis.</p>
