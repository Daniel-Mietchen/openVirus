<p id="Par12">Our method does not estimate when (seroconversion times) or how (transmission route) each infected individual was infected. Rather, fitted transmission rates and contact coefficients reflect the estimates that are most consistent with observed data while integrating uncertainty in all infected individualsâ€™ seroconversion times and routes of infection. All results shown are medians of posterior distributions with 95% credible intervals. We assessed the accuracy and precision with which we could estimate these six parameters by fitting this model to data simulated in a separately coded model in which the true underlying parameters were known.</p>
