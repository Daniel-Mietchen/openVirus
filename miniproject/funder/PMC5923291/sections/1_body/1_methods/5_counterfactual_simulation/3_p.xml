<p id="Par18">We also used these counterfactual simulations to explore the effects of between-individual heterogeneity in infection risk, and of between-partner assortativity in risk of infection. We modeled heterogeneity as each individual having a lognormally distributed risk factor that elevated or reduced their risk of transmission through any route. We modeled assortativity as between-partner correlation in these risk factors.</p>
