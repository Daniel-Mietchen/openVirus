<p id="Par16">To better understand the estimates resulting from our model fitting procedure and their regression against prevalence, we conducted simulations to elucidate how each parameter affects couple serostatus dynamics. In these simulations, we generated 100,000 couple relationship histories (i.e., sexual debuts, couple formation dates, and ages) simulated to represent the relationship histories actually observed for each country’s DHS (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Using the transmission parameters estimated for each country above, we simulated transmission and mortality events starting from each couples’ sexual debuts up until their interview date. This allowed us to create trajectories of couple serostatus states for each couple over calendar time (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). We summarized the evolution of couple serostatus patterns over the course of the epidemic by plotting SDP over calendar time.
