<p id="Par19">We neither considered heterogeneity nor assortativity in our fitted model because doing so is computationally challenging since it would require presuming each observed individual exhibits some unobserved risk factor that may or may not be correlated with their partnerâ€™s unobserved risk factor. In contrast, simulating (versus fitting) heterogeneity and assortativity is relatively straightforward, since we can simulate partners with higher or lower risk with or without between-partner correlation, and then explore the subsequent effects on couple serostatus dynamics. Assortativity could be induced by host genetic factors that vary between sub-populations, by partners exhibiting similar co-infections that affect HIV infectivity or susceptibility, or simply by variation in prevalence between subpopulations such that individuals in geographic proximity, or similar social circles, both exhibit more similar infection risk and are more likely to form partnerships.</p>
