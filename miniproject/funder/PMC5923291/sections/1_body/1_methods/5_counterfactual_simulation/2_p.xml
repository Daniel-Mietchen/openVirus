<p id="Par17">We then conducted counterfactual simulations, in which we varied one parameter at a time and simulated transmission and mortality for those same relationship histories, plotting the effect on the SDP trajectory for each country. Specifically, holding all other parameters constant, we varied male and female transmission rates, and pre- and extra-couple contact coefficients from zero to ten times their estimated values for each country.</p>
