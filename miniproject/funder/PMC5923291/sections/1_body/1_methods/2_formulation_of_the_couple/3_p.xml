 </inline-formula> as a sexual contact coefficient rather than a contact rate because it incorporates both the rate of contact with casual partners and also those partnersâ€™ probability of being infectious relative to the average population (where average population infectious prevalence is represented by 
 <italic>P</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>)). Although we do not model sexual network structure explicitly, our estimated sexual contact coefficients reflect risk associated with network structure: any increased risk from non-stable partners due to network characteristics (e.g., partner acquisition rates, concurrency, age-disparate relationships, other sexual network characteristics) would lead to greater rates of pre-couple or extra-couple transmission and, thus be reflected by greater fitted contact coefficients. Section 3a of the Supplementary Information provides a more in-depth discussion of the assumptions underlying this conceptualization of the transmission process.
