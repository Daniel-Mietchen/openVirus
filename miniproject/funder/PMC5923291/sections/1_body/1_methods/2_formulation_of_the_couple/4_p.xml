 </sup>. We assumed that all individuals were infected at the same gender-route specific rates and with the same sexual contact coefficients (homogeneity assumption) due to computational obstacles to fitting a heterogeneous model. However, in a sensitivity analysis, we assessed the robustness of our results to this assumption by simulating models that included individual-level heterogeneity and between-partner assortativity therein.
