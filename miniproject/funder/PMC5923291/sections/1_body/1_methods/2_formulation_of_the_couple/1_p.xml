<p id="Par7">We investigated the processes governing the relationship between couple serostatus patterns and HIV prevalence by fitting a model of HIV transmission in stable, cohabiting couples to DHS data for 2003–2012, from 45,041 couples for all 25 countries in SSA for which the DHS included HIV testing (Tables

 </sup>. Generally, unlike cohort data, cross-sectional data cannot be analyzed via survival-like analyses because individuals are only sampled once. In this framework, we are able to analyze cross-sectional survey data as cohort data because, by assuming that surveyed individuals were seronegative at their sexual debut, we have two observation time points per individual. The model used to analyze these data is analogous to a survival analysis for infection data with couples (versus individuals) as the unit of analysis. This model combines characteristics of survival analysis with those from mathematical transmission modeling.
