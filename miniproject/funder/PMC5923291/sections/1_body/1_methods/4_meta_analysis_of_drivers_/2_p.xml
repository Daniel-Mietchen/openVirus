<p id="Par15">Because it is a proportion, prevalence was modeled on log-odds scale; the explanatory variables (the six parameters) are all rates, and were consequently modeled on a log scale. Because estimated male and female transmission rates and extra-couple contact coefficients were similar within each country, we used the geometric means of male and female estimates for each country as explanatory variables to reduce collinearity. Pre-couple contact coefficients differed more between genders, so we included them as separate predictors. We then selected the best from among these models using Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc)

 </sup>. Since the predictors are estimated parameters each with their own uncertainty, we weighted each country in the regressions by the inverse variance of the predictor (for the multivariate model, by the geometric average variance across predictors).
