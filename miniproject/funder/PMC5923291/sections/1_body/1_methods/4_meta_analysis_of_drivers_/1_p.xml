<p id="Par14">Our estimated transmission and sexual contact parameters varied significantly among countries (see Results). This implies that some parameters must vary between countries in ways that explain their distinctive couple serostatus patterns and prevalences. To explicitly assess which parameters drive differences in prevalence, we performed a meta-analysis of the estimated parameters from each of our fitted country-specific transmission models. We regressed peak HIV prevalence (estimated by UNAIDS

We also conducted a sensitivity analysis in which the dependent variable was HIV prevalence from the analyzed DHS data instead of UNAIDS-estimated peak prevalence.
