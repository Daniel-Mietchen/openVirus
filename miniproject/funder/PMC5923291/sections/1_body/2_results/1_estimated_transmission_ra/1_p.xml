 </sup> and vary substantially across countries. Between-country variation in these estimated transmission rates may reflect variation in the prevalence of risk factors that affect transmission. These include male circumcision, interacting co-infections, host and viral genetics, and likely many other known or unknown factors that affect HIV infectivity or susceptibility. We also found substantial differences between genders within a few countries. Variation in the ratio of transmission to males versus to females and its inconsistency across regions has been observed in previous studies

 </sup> and could be due to, for instance, variation in circumcision prevalence between sites (which reduces male but not female susceptibility). Our estimates of the pre- and extra-couple contact coefficients for each country and gender (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>) also varied widely, which likely reflects differences in sexual network characteristics between countries.
