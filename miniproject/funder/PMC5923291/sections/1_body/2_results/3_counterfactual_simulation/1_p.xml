<p id="Par24">Our counterfactual simulations further clarified the above results, by showing that SDP is substantially affected by some parameters while negligibly affected by others. Some parameters, if varying between countries would in theory cause between-country variation in prevalence; but because they minimally affect SDP, they would not induce the covariation between SDP and prevalence that is observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and thus are not viable explanations for the observed prevalence variation (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Specifically and as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, SDP was elevated by AIDS mortality, slower transmission rates, higher inter-individual heterogeneity in risk to infection, or less between-partner assortativity in risk of infection. SDP was minimally affected by pre-couple or extra-couple sexual contact coefficients.
