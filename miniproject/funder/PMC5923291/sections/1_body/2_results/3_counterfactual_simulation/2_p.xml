<p id="Par25">To understand the results in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, consider that the factors that affect SDP are those that modify the duration that a couple spends serodiscordant or concordant positive. Slow transmission rates cause couples to spend long periods serodiscordant. Heterogeneity in infection risk leads to the accumulation of low-risk couples that stay serodiscordant for very long times, and increases SDP. Assortativity in infection risk, in which higher infection-risk individuals are more likely to partner with each other, decreases SDP because it increases the rate at which couples form already concordant positive (skipping the serodiscordant state entirely) or the rate at which couples transition from serodiscordant to concordant positive (since infected individuals are likely to have partners highly susceptible to infection). Death of one partner also causes the cessation of a couple serostate. By the time a partner is dying of AIDS (approximately a decade post-infection), it is likely they have exposed their partner for a long time. This means that SDP will be lower in couples with than those without an AIDS-stage partner. Thus, AIDS mortality disproportionately removes concordant positive couples and, consequently, increases SDP. Finally, the reason sexual contact coefficients minimally affect SDP is because they play a relatively small role in determining how long a couple stays serodiscordant. This is because within-couple transmission is the dominant means through which a serodiscordant couple becomes concordant positive; and so change in the contact coefficients only minimally change the duration of the serodiscordancy state.
