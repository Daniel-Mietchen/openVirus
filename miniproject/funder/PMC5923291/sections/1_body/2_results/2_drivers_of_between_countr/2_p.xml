<p id="Par23">We examined whether this finding might be modulated by how infectious we assumed the acute phase to be relative to the chronic phase. Our results were quite robust to the assumed acute phase relative infectivity, with greater values leading to lower estimated chronic phase transmission rates (consistently across countries such that between-country patterns were not affected) but negligibly affecting estimates of contact coefficients (Figure
