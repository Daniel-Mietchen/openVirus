<p id="Par22">In our meta-analysis of peak HIV prevalence against these estimated parameters, we determined that the best model (according to AICc selection; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>) was a univariate model in which the transmission rate was the only explanatory variable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We found that the transmission rate explained the majority of the between-country variation in peak HIV prevalence (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 59%) and remained significant in the full multivariate model (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In contrast, all models containing pre-couple and extra-couple contact coefficients were far inferior and these explanatory variables were not statistically significant predictors of peak HIV prevalence in the multivariate model. This means that countries with higher estimated extra-couple or pre-couple contact coefficients did not necessarily have higher HIV prevalence. In contrast, countries in which we estimated higher transmission rates did consistently exhibit higher prevalence. These findings were similar in a sensitivity analysis with DHS prevalence (averaged for each country) used as the dependent variable instead of UNAIDS-estimated peak prevalence (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).
