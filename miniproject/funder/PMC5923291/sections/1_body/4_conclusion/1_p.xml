<p id="Par40">Couple serostatus patterns in combination with relationship history patterns can provide insight into between-country variation in HIV epidemic prevalence across sub-Saharan Africa. That greater HIV transmission rates underlie more severe epidemics is a parsimonious explanation for the inverse correlation between the serodiscordant proportion and peak epidemic prevalence. However, heterogeneity in infection risk, and between-partner assortativity therein, may also partially explain this pattern and future work is warranted to distinguish between these hypotheses.</p>
