<p id="Par5">Here, we fit mechanistic models of HIV transmission to Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data on stable cohabiting couples to investigate what processes could explain between-country variation in HIV prevalence and couple serostatus patterns. We evaluate common explanations for between-country variation in epidemic prevalence and exclude those that are inconsistent with individual-level data. The models we are able to fit assume homogeneity, i.e. that, given exposure to an infected individual, all individuals exhibit the same risk of infection. However, we used simulation-based sensitivity analyses to investigate the robustness of our conclusions to heterogeneity in the risk of infection and assortativity therein (whether individuals with higher risk of infection are more likely to form partnerships with each other).</p>
