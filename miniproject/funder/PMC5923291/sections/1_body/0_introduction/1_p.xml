<p id="Par2">HIV epidemic severity varies extensively across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where prevalence has peaked at under 1% in some countries and surpassed 30% in others
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. Studies examining the cause of this between-country variation generally fall into one of two camps
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. The first proposes a central role of biological cofactors which affect HIV infectivity (circumcision, STI or other coinfections, viral load, pathogen or host genetics)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>, while the second focuses on sexual network characteristics (in particular, the prevalence of concurrent partnerships, but also partner turnover rates, migration, and age-disparate relationships)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>
 </sup>. Cohort and intervention studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between biological cofactors and transmission efficiency
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup> but, because of their limited geographic expanse, are insufficient for understanding how geographic differences in these cofactors drive regional variation in epidemic prevalence. Ecologic studies modeling correlations between known cofactors and prevalence are useful for hypothesis generation, but are highly susceptible to confounding
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, mathematical modeling studies have shown that certain sexual network characteristics (particularly concurrency) should exacerbate HIV epidemics. But ecologic studies examining whether these same network characteristics drive differences between countries provide mixed results, possibly because they suffer from susceptibility to confounding and from methodological difficulties associated with measuring sexual-network characteristics
