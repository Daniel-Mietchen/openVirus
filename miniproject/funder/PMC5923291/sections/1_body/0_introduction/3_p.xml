<p id="Par4">We investigated drivers of between-country variation in epidemic severity in SSA by using couple serostatus data to disentangle the components of transmission. Couple serostatus patterns vary widely across SSA. This can be most clearly seen by examining summary indices, such as the serodiscordant proportion (SDP; the proportion of couples with at least one HIV seropositive partner that are serodiscordant). SDP varies considerably across SSA, ranging from 37% to 85%, in inverse correlation with prevalence
