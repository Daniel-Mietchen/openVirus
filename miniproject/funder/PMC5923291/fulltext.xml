The extent to which this variation is driven by biological factors influencing the HIV transmission rate or by variation in sexual network characteristics remains widely debated. Here, we leverage couple serostatus patterns to address this question. HIV prevalence is strongly correlated with couple serostatus patterns across the continent; in particular, high prevalence countries tend to have a lower ratio of serodiscordancy to concordant positivity. To investigate the drivers of this continental pattern, we fit an HIV transmission model to Demographic and Health Survey data from 45,041 cohabiting couples in 25 countries. In doing so, we estimated country-specific HIV transmission rates and sexual network characteristics reflective of pre-couple and extra-couple sexual contact patterns. We found that variation in the transmission rate could parsimoniously explain between-country variation in both couple serostatus patterns and prevalence. In contrast, between-country variation in pre-couple or extra-couple sexual contact rates could not explain the observed patterns. Sensitivity analyses suggest that future work should examine the robustness of this result to between-country variation in how heterogeneous infection risk is within a country, or to assortativity, i.e. the extent to which individuals at higher risk are likely to partner with each other.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">HIV epidemic severity varies extensively across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where prevalence has peaked at under 1% in some countries and surpassed 30% in others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

Cohort and intervention studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between biological cofactors and transmission efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> but, because of their limited geographic expanse, are insufficient for understanding how geographic differences in these cofactors drive regional variation in epidemic prevalence.

Similarly, mathematical modeling studies have shown that certain sexual network characteristics (particularly concurrency) should exacerbate HIV epidemics. But ecologic studies examining whether these same network characteristics drive differences between countries provide mixed results, possibly because they suffer from susceptibility to confounding and from methodological difficulties associated with measuring sexual-network characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Most researchers agree that both biological cofactors and sexual network structure <italic>can</italic> affect HIV transmission dynamics.

This debate has practical relevance because the various explanations for what drives between-country variation in HIV prevalence may have important implications for intervention implementation and effectiveness.</p><p id="Par4">We investigated drivers of between-country variation in epidemic severity in SSA by using couple serostatus data to disentangle the components of transmission. Couple serostatus patterns vary widely across SSA. This can be most clearly seen by examining summary indices, such as the serodiscordant proportion (SDP; the proportion of couples with at least one HIV seropositive partner that are serodiscordant). SDP varies considerably across SSA, ranging from 37% to 85%, in inverse correlation with prevalence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. There is a common perception that these SDPs are larger than expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, given the intuitive argument that intercourse between stable serodiscordant partners should rapidly produce positive concordance. Heuristic arguments have attributed large SDPs to high extramarital transmission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, heterogeneity in HIV infectiousness or susceptibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, population-level HIV prevalence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and AIDS-related mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, the relative impacts of these factors on SDP remain poorly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we fit mechanistic models of HIV transmission to Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data on stable cohabiting couples to investigate what processes could explain between-country variation in HIV prevalence and couple serostatus patterns. We evaluate common explanations for between-country variation in epidemic prevalence and exclude those that are inconsistent with individual-level data. The models we are able to fit assume homogeneity, i.e. that, given exposure to an infected individual, all individuals exhibit the same risk of infection. However, we used simulation-based sensitivity analyses to investigate the robustness of our conclusions to heterogeneity in the risk of infection and assortativity therein (whether individuals with higher risk of infection are more likely to form partnerships with each other).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par6">The appendix provides a complete model description and all material needed to reproduce our analyses.

This model extends our previously described framework for analyzing cross-sectional couples data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Generally, unlike cohort data, cross-sectional data cannot be analyzed via survival-like analyses because individuals are only sampled once. In this framework, we are able to analyze cross-sectional survey data as cohort data because, by assuming that surveyed individuals were seronegative at their sexual debut, we have two observation time points per individual. The model used to analyze these data is analogous to a survival analysis for infection data with couples (versus individuals) as the unit of analysis. This model combines characteristics of survival analysis with those from mathematical transmission modeling.</p><p id="Par8">Specifically, we allowed for three hazard rates for each gender, corresponding to pre-couple, extra-couple, and within-couple routes of infection.

Although we do not model sexual network structure explicitly, our estimated sexual contact coefficients reflect risk associated with network structure: any increased risk from non-stable partners due to network characteristics (e.g., partner acquisition rates, concurrency, age-disparate relationships, other sexual network characteristics) would lead to greater rates of pre-couple or extra-couple transmission and, thus be reflected by greater fitted contact coefficients. Section 3a of the Supplementary Information provides a more in-depth discussion of the assumptions underlying this conceptualization of the transmission process.</p><p id="Par10">Further model assumptions include that infected individuals die of AIDS according to empirically derived survival distributions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. This accounts for an important survival bias&#x02014;couples observed during a survey are only those in which both partners survive up to the survey date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

We assumed that all individuals were infected at the same gender-route specific rates and with the same sexual contact coefficients (homogeneity assumption) due to computational obstacles to fitting a heterogeneous model. However, in a sensitivity analysis, we assessed the robustness of our results to this assumption by simulating models that included individual-level heterogeneity and between-partner assortativity therein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Estimating Transmission Rates and Sexual Contact Coefficients by Fitting the Model to Data</title><p id="Par11">To formally estimate these six parameters (two transmission rates and four sexual contact coefficients) we fit the above model to the DHS data sets. To do so requires calculating the likelihood of the observed data for given parameters. We did this by iteratively calculating the probability of each partner&#x02019;s serostatus and survival for each month of sexual activity from their sexual debuts until their DHS interview date. This yields a likelihood for each couple&#x02013;i.e. given a couple&#x02019;s relationship history and values for the six parameters, the probability that the couple exhibited the serostatus that they actually exhibited in the DHS. We used Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo to fit this model to the data from each country, yielding the transmission rates and sexual contact coefficients that maximized the joint probability of all observed couples being alive and exhibiting their observed serostatus on their DHS survey date. The ten West African countries analyzed exhibited very few HIV-positive individuals in their sampled populations. This made it difficult to fit our model. We thus pooled these countries together for analysis.</p><p id="Par12">Our method does not estimate when (seroconversion times) or how (transmission route) each infected individual was infected. Rather, fitted transmission rates and contact coefficients reflect the estimates that are most consistent with observed data while integrating uncertainty in all infected individuals&#x02019; seroconversion times and routes of infection. All results shown are medians of posterior distributions with 95% credible intervals. We assessed the accuracy and precision with which we could estimate these six parameters by fitting this model to data simulated in a separately coded model in which the true underlying parameters were known.</p><p id="Par13">In our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> (in particular, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and the Discussion), we gave intuition for why estimation of these six parameters is possible through the model fitting procedure described above. Here, we briefly provide two complementary ways to understand why these parameters are estimable from these data. For the first way, consider how each parameter affects couple serostatus patterns. For instance, if male-to-female transmission rates are higher, we should see fewer male-positive serodiscordant partnerships, especially amongst couples that have been together for a long time. Similarly, if men have high pre-couple contact rates (lots of risky casual sex before entering into a stable couple), this would increase the proportion of recently formed couples that are male-positive serodiscordant, particularly amongst men who had long periods of sexual activity prior to couple formation. For the second way, consider how two partners&#x02019; relationship history can inform when an infected partner is likely to have been infected. Importantly, the data we analyze are before ART was available in these countries or when ART coverage was extremely low (e.g. Fig.&#x000a0;1 in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>). Thus, any infected individuals sampled in these DHS surveys were likely to have been infected in the previous decade; otherwise they would have died before the survey. So for serodiscordant couples that formed 15 years ago, the infected partner was extremely likely to have been infected extra-couply, not pre-couply (because they would likely already be dead if infected that long ago) or within-couply (because their partner is uninfected).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>HIV peak prevalence versus the geometric mean (taken due to similarity) of male and female (<bold>A</bold>) HIV transmission rates and (<bold>B</bold>) extra-couple contact coefficients, and versus (<bold>C</bold>) male and (<bold>D</bold>) female pre-couple contact coefficients.

This implies that some parameters must vary between countries in ways that explain their distinctive couple serostatus patterns and prevalences. To explicitly assess which parameters drive differences in prevalence, we performed a meta-analysis of the estimated parameters from each of our fitted country-specific transmission models. We regressed peak HIV prevalence (estimated by UNAIDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>) against our estimates of transmission and sexual contact parameters in weighted univariate regressions and in a weighted multivariate regression including all predictors. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis in which the dependent variable was HIV prevalence from the analyzed DHS data instead of UNAIDS-estimated peak prevalence.</p><p id="Par15">Because it is a proportion, prevalence was modeled on log-odds scale; the explanatory variables (the six parameters) are all rates, and were consequently modeled on a log scale. Because estimated male and female transmission rates and extra-couple contact coefficients were similar within each country, we used the geometric means of male and female estimates for each country as explanatory variables to reduce collinearity. Pre-couple contact coefficients differed more between genders, so we included them as separate predictors. We then selected the best from among these models using Akaike&#x02019;s Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Since the predictors are estimated parameters each with their own uncertainty, we weighted each country in the regressions by the inverse variance of the predictor (for the multivariate model, by the geometric average variance across predictors).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Counterfactual Simulations of Couple Serostatus Dynamics</title><p id="Par16">To better understand the estimates resulting from our model fitting procedure and their regression against prevalence, we conducted simulations to elucidate how each parameter affects couple serostatus dynamics. In these simulations, we generated 100,000 couple relationship histories (i.e., sexual debuts, couple formation dates, and ages) simulated to represent the relationship histories actually observed for each country&#x02019;s DHS (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Using the transmission parameters estimated for each country above, we simulated transmission and mortality events starting from each couples&#x02019; sexual debuts up until their interview date. This allowed us to create trajectories of couple serostatus states for each couple over calendar time (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). We summarized the evolution of couple serostatus patterns over the course of the epidemic by plotting SDP over calendar time.</p><p id="Par17">We then conducted counterfactual simulations, in which we varied one parameter at a time and simulated transmission and mortality for those same relationship histories, plotting the effect on the SDP trajectory for each country. Specifically, holding all other parameters constant, we varied male and female transmission rates, and pre- and extra-couple contact coefficients from zero to ten times their estimated values for each country.</p><p id="Par18">We also used these counterfactual simulations to explore the effects of between-individual heterogeneity in infection risk, and of between-partner assortativity in risk of infection. We modeled heterogeneity as each individual having a lognormally distributed risk factor that elevated or reduced their risk of transmission through any route. We modeled assortativity as between-partner correlation in these risk factors.</p><p id="Par19">We neither considered heterogeneity nor assortativity in our fitted model because doing so is computationally challenging since it would require presuming each observed individual exhibits some unobserved risk factor that may or may not be correlated with their partner&#x02019;s unobserved risk factor. In contrast, simulating (versus fitting) heterogeneity and assortativity is relatively straightforward, since we can simulate partners with higher or lower risk with or without between-partner correlation, and then explore the subsequent effects on couple serostatus dynamics. Assortativity could be induced by host genetic factors that vary between sub-populations, by partners exhibiting similar co-infections that affect HIV infectivity or susceptibility, or simply by variation in prevalence between subpopulations such that individuals in geographic proximity, or similar social circles, both exhibit more similar infection risk and are more likely to form partnerships.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data Availability</title><p id="Par20">The <italic>raw</italic> data that support the findings of this study are available from the Demographic and Health Surveys (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.measuredhs.com">www.measuredhs.com</ext-link>) upon request.

Slow transmission rates cause couples to spend long periods serodiscordant. Heterogeneity in infection risk leads to the accumulation of low-risk couples that stay serodiscordant for very long times, and increases SDP. Assortativity in infection risk, in which higher infection-risk individuals are more likely to partner with each other, decreases SDP because it increases the rate at which couples form already concordant positive (skipping the serodiscordant state entirely) or the rate at which couples transition from serodiscordant to concordant positive (since infected individuals are likely to have partners highly susceptible to infection). Death of one partner also causes the cessation of a couple serostate. By the time a partner is dying of AIDS (approximately a decade post-infection), it is likely they have exposed their partner for a long time. This means that SDP will be lower in couples with than those without an AIDS-stage partner. Thus, AIDS mortality disproportionately removes concordant positive couples and, consequently, increases SDP. Finally, the reason sexual contact coefficients minimally affect SDP is because they play a relatively small role in determining how long a couple stays serodiscordant. This is because within-couple transmission is the dominant means through which a serodiscordant couple becomes concordant positive; and so change in the contact coefficients only minimally change the duration of the serodiscordancy state.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par26">For decades, the HIV community has struggled to explain the variation in epidemic prevalence across SSA.

Chemaitelly <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> estimated transmission rates in several countries with DHS data similar to that considered here by fitting a compartmental transmission model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>; but their results&#x02019; reliance on fitting to population-level metrics instead of individual-level data allows for a highly susceptibility to confounding.</p><p id="Par27">We suggest that the ideal approach to address this question would interpret data using mechanistic models capable of distinguishing distinct causal pathways from each other by identifying nonlinear patterns in data that can be causally explained by some pathways and not others. To that end, we fit a mechanistic couples transmission model to representative samples from 15 SSA countries (and one region) and simultaneously estimated multiple components of transmission. Due to computational challenges, we were only able to fit homogenous models that do not account for individual heterogeneity or assortativity in infection risk. We found that when interpreted through the lens of these homogeneous models, couple serostatus patterns strongly suggest that the principal driver of between-country variation in both HIV prevalence and SDP is between-country variation in the transmission rate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), and not between-country variation in sexual contact patterns as previously suggested by other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">In a sensitivity analysis, however, we show that this conclusion may not be robust to heterogeneity in infection risk or between-partner assortativity therein. These processes also affect couple serostatus patterns, and it is possible that they could vary between countries in ways that would weaken the above results. Future work that can estimate between-country differences in heterogeneity and assortativity will be necessary to more robustly determine which mechanisms can plausibly explain between-country variation in couple serostatus patterns and epidemic prevalence. It is important to keep in mind that such methods may reveal that it is not possible to distinguish these hypotheses with the available survey data.</p><p id="Par29">In an earlier study fitting the same models to the DHS, we previously demonstrated that risky network characteristics (such as concurrent partnerships, partner acquisition rates, age-disparate relationships) drive the majority of HIV incidence <italic>within</italic> all countries analyzed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. This may be true for most or all sexually transmitted infections, as sexual contacts with numerous non-stable partners fuels transmission far more than the same number of contacts between stable partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, we point out a nuanced distinction; even if risky sexual network characteristics are responsible for the majority of transmission within each country, it still is plausible that differences <italic>between</italic> countries are not explained by differences in network characteristics, but instead by differences in underlying transmission rates. Future work examining between-country differences in epidemic severity should pay careful attention to this distinction.</p><p id="Par30">While our analysis and results exhibits some similarity to that of Chemaitelly <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, we have also made several advances. First and foremost, here and previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> we leverage individual-level relationship history and serostatus data to understand couple serostatus dynamics, rather than relying on population-level statistics. Without individual-level data on relationship duration, an analysis cannot accurately represent the denominator of time at risk when estimating transmission between serodiscordant partners. We believe this explains why our transmission rate estimates (ranging 2.1&#x02013;20 per 100 person-years) were about half of those of Chemaitelly <italic>et al</italic>. (ranging 4.4&#x02013;41 per 100 person-years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>) for each country, though the country-order of transmission rates compares closely between the two analyses (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>). The other main advances of our analysis comprise the explicit estimation of pre-couple and extra-couple contact rates for each country; the systematic assessment of which of several factors best explain between-country variation in prevalence; and examination of how individual heterogeneity in infection risk and between-partner assortativity in infection risk alter serostatus dynamics.</p><p id="Par31">If in fact regional variation in transmission rates drives a large proportion of the observed variation in HIV prevalence, this has important implications for the prospects of various interventions. For instance, this would suggest that the level of effort allocated to known effective interventions (e.g., ART coverage, medical male circumcision coverage) necessary to reduce incidence below a given threshold could differ dramatically between two communities, even if they exhibit similar sexual network dynamics.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Model assumptions and limitations</title><p id="Par32">Our model was designed to capture observed couple serostatus patterns, given limitations of the available data. We made many simplifying assumptions and omissions. In addition to the main sensitivity analyses highlighted above, we additionally assess the robustness of our conclusions to other simplifications below.</p><p id="Par33">While we estimated country-specific transmission rates and sexual contact coefficients, we did not explicitly estimate the drivers underlying the observed between-country variation in these parameters. Such drivers could include between-country variation in male circumcision, interacting co-infections, or host and viral genetics. Data at the individual level were not available on these factors from the DHS (of these factors, male circumcision status was available for some but not all of the DHS analyzed) and so we were unable to include them. Importantly, it is highly likely that not all risk factors for HIV susceptibility or infectivity have been characterized. Thus, there may be many unknown factors that explain geographic variation in transmission rates. Furthermore, even if we had individual data on some of the known risk factors, it remains poorly understood how the myriad factors known to affect HIV transmission interact with each other (i.e. are relative risks simply multiplicative or are there interactions between known risk factors that further amplify or mitigate risk). Thus, rather than try to tease apart the all the constituent factors affecting transmission, we aim only to characterize the average transmission rate at the country level.</p><p id="Par34">Most HIV modeling studies in Africa have relied on a single transmission rate for the continent, estimated from one or more serodiscordant couple cohort studies. We estimate transmission rates and contact coefficients at the country-level to provide greater spatial resolution into HIV transmission rates than previously available. Nonetheless, recent work has highlighted the substantial <italic>subnational</italic> variation in HIV prevalence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, suggesting that biological and behavioral factors vary greatly at even smaller scales. We did not aim to estimate subnational variation in transmission rates both due to computational challenges and due to the smaller sample sizes available within the DHS when considering subnational levels. However, we do believe that subnational studies of variation in transmission rates are warranted in future work.</p><p id="Par35">Higher dissolution rates in HIV-status aware serodiscordant couples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> (compared to other couples) could increase SDP by dissolving serodiscordant couples before they become concordant positive. Given the scarcity of data, we were unable to assess whether this might explain between-country variation in SDP, though a preliminary analysis suggests it is unlikely (Supplementary Text Section A7, Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). Indeed, we believe it is unlikely that such dissolution would explain significant variation, given the relatively low levels of partner serostatus awareness during the period of study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> and lack of evidence that awareness differed substantially between countries during the period considered.</p><p id="Par36">Our model includes the treatment as prevention effect of ART on reducing transmission rates by modeling the risk of infection from casual partners as a function of the proportion of the population that is HIV-infected and not on ART. But, because treatment status was not ascertained in these DHS surveys, we could not model the effects of ART on within-couple transmission or on survival times of infected partners. In a previous sensitivity analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, we showed our results are nonetheless robust, since, for the period of study and until recent policy changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, most treated individuals would have become eligible for ART only after a long period of exposing their partner to infection. This holds true even considering prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs, which expanded ART coverage for pregnant and postpartum women. WHO guidelines pre-2010 offered ART to pregnant women starting 28 weeks into pregnancy and lasting up until 7 days postpartum. WHO&#x02019;s 2010 guidelines added option B, in which women are given the opportunity to stay on ART until the end of breastfeeding. Thus, for the period considered PMTCT would have only led to ephemeral reductions in transmission from women to their male partners, and would have had a limited impact on survival.</p><p id="Par37">With recent increases in ART coverage, however, we expect the relationship between SDP and HIV transmission rates to have become increasingly complex because&#x02014;depending on who receives ART and when they receive it in their course of disease&#x02014;ART can either act to reduce SDP (by increasing the life expectancy of concordant positive partners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>) or to increase SDP (by reducing infectiousness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and thus increasing the time couples spend serodiscordant).</p><p id="Par38">For a subset of the countries analyzed, the DHS conducted surveys at multiple years within the period of analysis. For each of these countries, we chose to pool all DHS surveys across years for analysis. We made this choice for two reasons. First, SDP was relatively stable over time across surveys (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S8</xref>). Second, we did not believe we would have sufficient sample size to pick up evidence of temporal variation in transmission rates or contact coefficients, particularly since cross-sectional couple serostatus patterns observed in a survey reflect transmission dynamics occurring over the preceding decade. In estimating a single set of parameters for each country, we implicitly assumed that HIV transmission rates and sexual contact coefficients were constant over time. Declining HIV prevalence in several countries, however, has been attributed to behavioral changes in response to interventions or overall HIV awareness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Decreasing pre- or extra-couple transmission in recent years, while holding transmission rates constant, could temporarily decrease the SDP (by reducing the creation of new serodiscordant couples from concordant negative couples, while pre-existing serodiscordant couples continue to become positive concordant)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. A decreasing transmission rate over time would cause a more direct and permanent increase in SDP. Neither of these patterns, however, appears likely to explain the tight empirical relationship between SDP and peak prevalence. On the other hand, this pattern is parsimoniously explained by between-country variation in transmission rates.</p><p id="Par39">Finally, in view of the range of the DHS and the scope of our study, we necessarily excluded many couples because of missing or inconsistent data. A notable exclusion was that of all polygamous couples (given the couple-centric nature of our model), which represented a third of all couples in West Africa. Nonetheless, the low prevalence, low transmission rates and high serodiscordant proportion observed in the included (non-polygamous) couples from West African are consistent with our main findings. Previous sensitivity analyses also suggest that our results are robust to the exclusion of couples with missing data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and are roughly generalizable to the couples population sampled by DHS. Furthermore, these population samples are likely to be more representative of the general population than are the intervention or cohort studies most frequently used to understand HIV transmission rates, given their narrow selection criteria and the effects of intensive study on participant behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par40">Couple serostatus patterns in combination with relationship history patterns can provide insight into between-country variation in HIV epidemic prevalence across sub-Saharan Africa. That greater HIV transmission rates underlie more severe epidemics is a parsimonious explanation for the inverse correlation between the serodiscordant proportion and peak epidemic prevalence. However, heterogeneity in infection risk, and between-partner assortativity therein, may also partially explain this pattern and future work is warranted to distinguish between these hypotheses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
