<p>We downloaded all HIV-1 subtype B 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from Brazil with information about sampling state and that covered the entire protease and partial reverse transcriptase (PR/RT) regions (nucleotides 2253–3260 relative to HXB2 clone), available at the Los Alamos HIV Database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov</ext-link>) by September 2015. Only one sequence per subject was selected and those sequences with incorrect subtype assignment were removed. These sequences were combined with Brazilian HIV-1 subtype B 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from the Northern region recently published (
 <italic>n</italic> = 318) [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and others that were newly generated (
 <italic>n</italic> = 71). New HIV-1 subtype B 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were obtained from HIV-1-infected persons that attended the Public Health Central Laboratory from Roraima (LACEN-RR) in 2013. Blood samples were transported to the Instituto Leônidas e Maria Deane (FIOCRUZ) in Manaus for HIV amplification and subtyping as described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. All patients were informed of the procedures and signed the informed consent. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the "Universidade Federal de Roraima" (CAAE 15629013.8.0000.5302). This resulted in a final data set of 2,682 subtype B 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences isolated from 21 Brazilian states distributed across the five country regions (
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The subtype assignment of all sequences was confirmed using the REGA HIV subtyping tool v.2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and by performing phylogenetic analyses (see below) with HIV-1 group M subtype reference sequences.
