<p>The evolutionary rate, the age of the most recent common ancestor (
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>MRCA</sub>) and the spatial diffusion pattern of HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> clades circulating in Brazil were jointly estimated using the Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach as implemented in BEAST v1.8 [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] with BEAGLE to improve run-time [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Analyses were performed using the GTR+I+Γ
 <sub>4</sub> nucleotide substitution model, a relaxed uncorrelated lognormal molecular clock model [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and a Bayesian Skyline coalescent tree prior [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The mean evolutionary rates previously estimated for the subtype B 
 <italic>pol</italic> gene (2.0–3.0 x 10
 <sup>−3</sup> subst./site/year) [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] were incorporated as an informative prior interval. Migration events throughout the phylogenetic history and the most relevant migration pathways were reconstructed using a reversible discrete phylogeography model and the Bayesian stochastic search variable selection (BSSVS) approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], with a CTMC rate reference prior [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Three MCMC chains were run for 500 x 10
 <sup>6</sup> generations and then combined using LogCombiner v1.8. Convergence and uncertainty of parameter estimates were assessed by calculating the Effective Sample Size (ESS) and 95% Highest Probability Density (HPD) values, respectively, after excluding the initial 10% of each run with Tracer v1.6 [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was summarized with TreeAnnotator v1.8 and visualized with FigTree v1.4.0. Migratory events and Bayes factor rates were summarized using the cross-platform SPREAD application [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].
