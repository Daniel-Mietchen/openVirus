<p>HIV-1 Brazilian sequences were aligned with subtype B 
 <italic>pol</italic> (PR/RT) sequences from the US (
 <italic>n</italic> = 165), France (
 <italic>n</italic> = 135) and the Caribbean (
 <italic>n</italic> = 279) representative of the B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> and the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> clades described previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Sequences were aligned using the Clustal W program [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and all sites associated with major antiretroviral drug resistance in PR and RT were excluded. Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were inferred under the GTR+I+Î“ nucleotide substitution model selected using the jModeltest program [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The ML trees were reconstructed with the PhyML program [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] using an online web server [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Heuristic tree search was performed using the SPR branch-swapping algorithm and the reliability of the obtained topology was estimated with the approximate likelihood-ratio test (
 <italic>aLRT</italic>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] based on the Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. The ML trees were visualized using the FigTree v1.4.0 program [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].
