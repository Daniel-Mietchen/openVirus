<p>The HIV-1 B

 <italic>pol</italic> sequences with known sampling date from Brazil here identified (

 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences were combined with B

 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from the most widely sampled Caribbean islands (Hispaniola, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago) previously identified [

 <italic>pol</italic> sequences from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10) that was pointed as the most probable source location of subtype B strain introduced in the Americas [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and subsequently subjected to Bayesian phylogeographic reconstructions. The root location of the HIV-1 subtype B ancestor was most probably placed in the island of Hispaniola (Dominican Republic/Haiti) (posterior state probability [
 <italic>PSP</italic>] = 0.92) during the 1960s (

 <xref rid="pone.0162112.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), consistent with previous findings [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The subtype B was then independently disseminated from Hispaniola to Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica around the early 1970s, where seeded secondary outbreaks that resulted in the origin of the non-pandemic subclades B
 <sub>CAR-TT</sub> and B
 <sub>CAR-JM</sub> previously described [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This Bayesian analysis also indicates that B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains were disseminated at multiple times from Hispaniola (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11) and Trinidad and Tobago (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3) to Brazil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162112.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Direct disseminations of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains from Hispaniola to Brazilian states of the Southern (Rio Grande do Sul), Southeastern (Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo), Central-Western (Mato Grosso do Sul), Northeastern (Maranh√£o) and Northern (Acre, Roraima and Tocantins) regions were detected, as well as dissemination of the B
 <sub>CAR-TT</sub> clade from Trinidad and Tobago to Roraima and Sao Paulo states. The Bayes factor tests for significant nonzero rates, however, support epidemiological linkage between Hispaniola and only a few Brazilian states (Acre, Tocantins and Sao Paulo) as well as between Trinidad and Tobago and Roraima (
