<p>A total of 2,682 HIV-1 subtype B 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences isolated from 21 Brazilian states from the Southeastern (
 <italic>n</italic> = 1,512), Northern (
 <italic>n</italic> = 457), Northeastern (
 <italic>n</italic> = 253), Central-Western (
 <italic>n</italic> = 252) and Southern (
 <italic>n</italic> = 208) regions were analyzed in this study (
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Brazilian HIV-1 subtype B 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences were divided in three subsets and each subset was combined with a reference dataset containing 500 B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> sequences from the US and France and 200 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences from the Caribbean, selected from a previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162112.s001">S1 Table</xref>). The ML analyses of all three subsets confirmed that B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> reference sequences branched in a highly supported (aLRT &gt; 0.90) monophyletic clade nested within basal B
 <sub>CAR</sub> reference sequences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162112.g001">Fig 1</xref>). These analyses also showed that B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences were detected in 16 out 21 Brazilian states here analyzed, although with highly variable prevalence across locations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162112.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences account for a very large proportion (41%) of HIV-1 subtype B infections in the state of Roraima, a relative large/moderate proportion (14%) in the states of Amazonas and Maranh√£o, and a low proportion (&lt;5%) in the remaining Brazilian states. When analyzed by Brazilian region, the highest proportion of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences was observed in the Northern (17%), followed by the Northeastern (4%), Central-Western (1%), Southeastern (1%) and Southern (1%) regions. Analysis of the epidemiological characteristics of the HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub>-infected patients reveals that most individuals were male (58%), and that the heterosexual mode of transmission was the predominant one (65%), followed by men having sex with men (MSM, 23%). Diagnosis of HIV-1 infection ranged between 1995 and 2013 and the country of origin of all individuals was Brazil, with exception of one individual from Guyana that attended the Public Health Central Laboratory from Roraima.
