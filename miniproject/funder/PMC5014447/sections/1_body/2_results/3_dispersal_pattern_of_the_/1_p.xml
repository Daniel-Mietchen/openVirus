<p>Among the 14 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains introduced into Brazil, four established onward transmission and originated the Brazilian clades here denominated B
 <sub>CAR-BR-I</sub>, B
 <sub>CAR-BR-II</sub>, B
 <sub>CAR-BR-III</sub> and B
 <sub>CAR-BR-IV</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162112.g003">Fig 3A</xref>)
 <sub>,</sub> that comprise 51%, 16%, 10% and 8% of the Brazilian B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences used in this analysis, respectively. All Brazilian non-pandemic subtype B clades displayed a high support (
 <italic>PP</italic> &gt; 0.80) with exception of B
 <sub>CAR-BR-III</sub> (
 <italic>PP</italic> = 0.35). The clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-I</sub> comprises most B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences detected in Roraima (79%) and all sequences detected in Amazonas. This clade seems to have arisen by the introduction of a B
 <sub>CAR-TT</sub> strain into Roraima at around 1978 (
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), with later dissemination from Roraima to: Amazonas, Amapá, Piauí and Sao Paulo (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162112.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-II</sub> comprises all B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences detected in the state of Maranhão. This clade seems to have arisen by the introduction of a B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strain from the Hispaniola into Maranhão at around 1978 (
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and the subsequent dissemination from Maranhão to: Pará, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao Paulo and Espírito Santo (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162112.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-III</sub> probably arose by the introduction of a B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strain from Hispaniola into the state of Sao Paulo at around 1979 (
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and from Sao Paulo it was disseminated to: Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Rio Grande do Sul and Pará (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162112.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-IV</sub> probably arose by the introduction of a B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strain from Hispaniola into the state of Roraima at around 1982 (
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and from Roraima it was disseminated to Sao Paulo and Espírito Santo (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162112.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The Bayes factor tests for significant nonzero rates supports epidemiological linkage between most Brazilian locations pairs previously described (

 <sub>CAR</sub> strains here identified, five branched within the clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-I</sub>, three within the clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-II</sub>, one within the clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-IV</sub>, and the remaining one branched outside the major Brazilian clades.
