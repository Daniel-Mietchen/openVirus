<p>A previous study conducted by our group, estimated that B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains only explain 1.7% of subtype B infections in Brazil [
 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Most Brazilian subtype B sequences used in that previous study, however, were from the Southeastern, Southern and Central-Western country regions. The objective of this study was to estimate the relative prevalence of the B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> and B
 <sub>CAR</sub> clades in all Brazilian regions and to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of dissemination of the HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> clades circulating in the country. For this, we used a comprehensive dataset of HIV-1 subtype B 
 <italic>pol</italic> sequences (
 <italic>n</italic> = 2,682) isolated from 21 different Brazilian states from the five country regions between 1998 and 2012. Brazilian HIV-1 subtype B sequences were combined with reference sequences of the B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> and the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> clades and then subjected to Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogeographic analyses.
