<p>This study demonstrates that B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains have been introduced at multiples times into Brazil and circulate in at least 16 out 21 Brazilian states here analyzed. Although subtype B epidemic in most Brazilian states is clearly dominated by the B
 <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> clade, the non-pandemic B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains reach a significant prevalence in a few states from the Northern (Roraima = 41% and Amazonas = 14%) and Northeastern (Maranh√£o = 14%) regions. The prevalence of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains detected in Roraima is comparable to that described in some northern South American countries (Suriname and French Guyana), and much higher than that estimated for other continental countries of the Americas [
