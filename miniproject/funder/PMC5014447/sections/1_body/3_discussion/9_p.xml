<p>In summary, this study demonstrates that non-pandemic HIV-1 B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains have been introduced at multiple times from the Caribbean into Brazil and reach a significant prevalence in some states from Northern (Roraima and Amazonas) and Northeastern (Maranhão) regions. Several Brazilian states from all country regions acted as an entry point of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains, but only a few B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains, particularly those introduced into Roraima and Maranhão, established local outbreaks of relative large size. The molecular epidemiological surveillance of HIV-infected individuals from Guyana, French Guiana, and Suriname as well as of mobile populations migrating between Brazil and those neighboring countries will be of paramount importance to reconstruct the precise dissemination routes of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains in the northernmost region of South America.
