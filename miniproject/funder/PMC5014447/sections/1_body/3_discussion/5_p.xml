<p>The estimated median T
 <sub>MRCA</sub> of clades B
 <sub>CAR-BR-I</sub> (1978) B
 <sub>CAR-BR-IV</sub> (1982) coincides with a period of fast population growth and increasing geographical accessibility in Roraima. The population in Roraima increased from 41.000 to nearly 220.000 inhabitants between 1970 and 1990 [
