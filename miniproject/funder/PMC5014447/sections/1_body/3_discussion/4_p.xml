<p>Roraima not only display the highest prevalence of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains among all Brazilian states, but was also pointed as the most probable source location of B
 <sub>CAR-BR-I</sub> and B
 <sub>CAR-BR-IV</sub> clades. The clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-I</sub> probably evolved from the clade B
 <sub>CAR-TT</sub> circulating in Trinidad and Tobago, while the clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-IV</sub> was more closely related to B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains from the Hispaniola. The clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-I</sub> was successfully spread within Roraima and disseminated to Amazonas at multiple times, and also to Amapá, Piauí and Sao Paulo. The pervasive dissemination of the clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-I</sub> from Roraima into Amazonas is expected considering that these two neighboring states maintain a very intense population flux through the BR-174 highway that connects both states and is the only accession route by land to Roraima from Brazil. The clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-IV</sub> displayed a more restricted spread in Roraima, but was also disseminated over long distances reaching Sao Paulo and Espírito Santo.
