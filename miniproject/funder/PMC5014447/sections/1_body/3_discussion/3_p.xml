<p>Irrespective of the precise location of the source, our phylogeographic analysis clearly showed that several Brazilian states from the Northern (Roraima, Acre and Tocantins), Northeastern (Maranh√£o), Southeastern (Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo), Central-Western (Mato Grosso do Sul) and Southern (Rio Grande do Sul) regions acted as an entry point of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains. Most Brazilian individuals infected with B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains were heterosexual (65%), although the proportion of individuals infected by heterosexual (44%) and homosexual/bisexual (40%) contacts was roughly similar among men caring B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains. These results revealed that the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains are being introduced into both heterosexual and MSM networks from different Brazilian states. Most introductions seem to have resulted in dead-end infections that were not further disseminated in the Brazilian population. Four B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains, however, established onward transmission in the Brazilian population and originated local non-pandemic subtype B clades here designated from B
 <sub>CAR-BR-I</sub> to B
 <sub>CAR-BR-IV,</sub> according to their relative prevalence.
