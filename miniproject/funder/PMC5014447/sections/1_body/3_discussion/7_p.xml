<p>The high prevalence of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains detected in Roraima and Maranhão correlates with an intense migratory flux to Northern South American countries, but that association was not observed in other Brazilian states. Many individuals from the Northern Brazilian states of Amapá and Pará have migrated to the French Guyana since the middle 1960s and the social conditions in the border region between Amapá and French Guyana are certainly favorable for the spread of HIV [

 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Despite this, we detected a low proportion (3–4%) of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains and no evidence of direct viral migrations from the Caribbean into Amapá or Pará. The B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences detected in Amapá branched within the clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-I</sub>, and the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> sequences detected in Pará branched within clades B
 <sub>CAR-BR-II</sub> and B
 <sub>CAR-BR-III</sub>. Thus, the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains circulating in Amapá and Pará probably originated from other Brazilian states, rather than from neighboring Caribbean countries.
