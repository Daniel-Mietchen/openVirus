<p>Maranhão display the highest prevalence of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains outside the Northern Brazilian region and was pointed as the most probable source location of clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-II</sub> at around 1978. This clade was disseminated within Maranhão and from this state to Pará, Goiás, Mato Grosso do Sul, Sao Paulo and Espírito Santo. Most people that migrate to Roraima during the 1970s and 1980s were from Maranhão [

 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which creates a potential link for the direct dissemination of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains from Roraima to Maranhão. The clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-II</sub>, however, is not closely related to the clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-I</sub>, supporting an independent origin. We propose that the clade B
 <sub>CAR-BR-II</sub> probably arose by the introduction of a B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strain from Suriname or French Guiana that host about 15.000 and 20.000 Brazilian immigrants, particularly from Maranhão, Amapá and Pará states [

 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Many of those immigrants are female sex workers and gold-diggers (populations typically associated with a high risk of acquisition of HIV) that come back to Brazil from time to time and may thus introduce new B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains in the Northern and Northeastern regions.
