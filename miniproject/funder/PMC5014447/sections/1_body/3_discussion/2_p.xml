<p>Our phylogeographic analysis indicates that the islands of Hispaniola and Trinidad and Tobago were probably the major sources of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> lineages introduced into Brazil, although direct epidemiological linkages between the Caribbean islands and several Brazilian states were not significantly supported. It is highly probable that Suriname, French Guyana and Guyana may have also played a crucial role in such dissemination process, acting as a staging post between the Caribbean islands and Brazil. Those South American countries displayed a high prevalence of B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains [

 <xref rid="pone.0162112.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Of note, one of the B
 <sub>CAR</sub> strains detected in Roraima was isolated from an individual from the Guianese city of Lethem, located at border with Roraima. Unfortunately, the number of subtype B 
 <italic>pol</italic> (PR/RT) sequences from those South American countries currently available in public database is too small to obtain robust phylogeographic reconstructions of the viral migrations pathways in the northernmost South American region.
