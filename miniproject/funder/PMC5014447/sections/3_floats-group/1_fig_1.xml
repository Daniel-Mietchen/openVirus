  <title>ML phylogenetic tree of HIV-1 subtype B 
   <italic>pol</italic> PR/RT sequences (~1,000 nt) circulating in Brazil (
   <italic>n =</italic> 2,682) and representative sequences of the B
   <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> (
   <italic>n</italic> = 300) and the B
   <sub>CAR</sub> (
   <italic>n</italic> = 200) clades.
  </title>
  <p>Brazilian subtype B 
   <italic>pol</italic> sequences were subdivided in three subsets according to their geographic origin: A) sequences from Sao Paulo, B) sequences from the Central-Western/Southern/Southeastern (except Sao Paulo) regions, and C) sequences from the Northern/Northeastern regions. Branches are colored according to the geographic origin/clade classification of each sequence as indicated at the legend at bottom. The B
   <sub>PANDEMIC</sub> clade was collapsed for visual clarity. The a
   <italic>LRT</italic> support values are indicated at key nodes. Trees were rooted using HIV-1 subtype D reference sequences. The branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions/site.
