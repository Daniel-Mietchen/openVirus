<p>The dynamics of dengue transmission depends on the interactions among hosts, viruses, vectors and environmental factors. Given the restricted range of mosquito flying distance [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], population movement may play a critical role for dengue transmission. At broad spatial scales (e.g., national, international), human movements may make dengue virus being introduced and reintroduced into a region with lower herd immunity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition to sporadic cases, dengue outbreak also occurred in Europe. For example, an outbreak with more than 2,000 cases happened in Madeira, Portugal in 2012, which was most probable origin of Venezuela [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and house-to-house human movements may shape spatial patterns of dengue incidence, causing significant heterogeneity in dengue incidence [
