<p>Our previous study has proven that dengue was still an imported disease in China [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the epidemics were probable to be originated from overseas. Three individual studies have reported the dengue outbreaks occurred in Yunnan and Henan Provinces in 2013 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, no study tried to explore the transmission dynamics between locations. The purpose of the study is to describe the 2013 epidemiological characteristics and to explore the possible origins of the epidemics, and the dynamics of dengue viruses between epidemic focus, which are important to dengue control and prevention.
