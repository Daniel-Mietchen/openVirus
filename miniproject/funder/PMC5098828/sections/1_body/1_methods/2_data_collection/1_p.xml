<p>Records of notified dengue cases of 2013 were obtained from the China Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, including age, gender, occupation, date of onset, type of diagnosis, local case or not. At the study areas, a dengue case is defined as an imported case for which the patient had traveling history to a dengue affected area and reported being bitten by mosquitoes within 15 days of the onset of illness.

Otherwise, the dengue case is considered to be a local case [
