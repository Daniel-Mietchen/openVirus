<p>The spatial diffusion of each genotype was jointly estimated using the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) statistical framework implemented in the BEAST v1.8.2 package [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The phylogeographic diffusion process between state variables was identified using the Bayesian stochastic variable search selection (BSSVS). Analyses were carried out with a constant size tree prior [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], under strict or relaxed (uncorrelated log-normal) clock model. The nucleotide substitution model for every genotype was selected by jModelTest [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The MCMC analysis was run for 30 million generations and the convergence of parameters (ESS&gt;200) was assessed with TRACER v1.5 program (

Uncertainty in parameter estimates was reflected in the 95% highest probability density (HPD) intervals. The programs TreeAnnotator v1.8.2 and Figtree (
