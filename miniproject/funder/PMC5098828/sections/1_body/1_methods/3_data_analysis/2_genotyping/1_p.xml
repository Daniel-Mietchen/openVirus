<p>All the sequences were aligned using MAFFT [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Maximum Likelihood (ML) trees of each serotype were constructed using PhyML [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and the best-fit model of nucleotide substitutions was selected on the basis of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) conducted by jModelTest [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The reliability of branching pattern was tested through 1,000 bootstrap sampling.
