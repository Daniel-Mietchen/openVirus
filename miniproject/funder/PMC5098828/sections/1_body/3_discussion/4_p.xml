<p>Xishuangbanna prefecture, Yunnan Province, neighboring to Myanmar and Laos, had its first dengue outbreak in 2013. The phylogenetic results showed genotype II of DENV 3 caused the outbreak (Clade 13). As mentioned before, the same genotype was prevalent in Laos in 2012â€“2013. The epidemiological field investigation showed that there were imported cases from Laos and Myanmar at the beginning of the epidemic, and some businessmen has travel history to Laos. The phylogeographical analysis indicated that the viruses detected in Xishuangbanna were probably introduced from Laos. Therefore, because of the repeated introductions and lack of local herd immunity, the viruses imported from Laos probably contributed to the dengue outbreak in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province in 2013.</p>
