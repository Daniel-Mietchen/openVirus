<p>In Guangdong Province, local dengue cases occurred in Pearl River Delta of Guangdong (PRD) in 2013, where is one of the most densely urbanized regions in the world [

The area is one of the homelands of overseas Chinese, especially to the those live in Southeast Asia, which brings about many travels from there each year. Dengue is endemic in Southeast Asia, with severe dengue outbreaks in Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia in 2013 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These countries are tourism resorts and there have been intensive trade activities between these countries and the PRD. The dengue viruses may have imported to PRD frequently from these endemic areas because of the frequent population movement and probably contributed to the dengue outbreaks in these PRD areas. The phylogenetic and phylogeographical results indicated that the strains detected in the PRD areas, especially in Guangzhou showed diversity, and most strains were probably introduced from Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Cambodia and Laos (
