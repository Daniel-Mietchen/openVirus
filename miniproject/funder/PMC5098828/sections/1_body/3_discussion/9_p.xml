<p>Because of the multiple introductions, dengue outbreaks occurred in epidemic seasons in Southern China in the context of suitable weather conditions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Population movement at finer spatial scales contributed to the epidemic foci expansion, and may contribute dengue transmission from one epidemic city to another one within China [
 <xref rid="pntd.0005095.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The phylogenetic analyses indicated that the dengue epidemic transmitted to neighboring Foshan city southwestward and Zhongshan city southward from Guangzhou city, and then to Jiangmen city from Zhongshan city (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Given the increased economic link and population movement, there existed the probability dengue virus dispersion to Foshan from Guangzhou, because the outbreak in Guangzhou was earlier than that in Foshan. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the outbreak in Zhongshan was caused by two serotypes, with epidemic two peaks. The cases in Zhongshan were located on the border with Guangzhou and the dengue outbreak in Zhongshan was earlier than that in Guangzhou. Therefore, there existed the probability that the first peak occurring earlier than that in Guangzhou was caused by introduced viruses from Singapore (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g008">Fig 8B</xref>; Clade 16) and the second was probably attributed to the viruses transmitted from Guangzhou. The cases in Jiangmen city mainly occurred in the districts adjacent to Zhongshan cityâ€”this could be because that some of the residents working in Zhongshan while living in Jiangmen due to cheaper property price in Jiangmen and higher salary in Zhongshan, which made the dengue viruses transmitted to Jiangmen from Zhongshan feasible.
