<p>This is the first study exploring the dengue dynamics in China, which is critical to understand dengue transmission and will be helpful to prevent and control dengue occurrence in China. Because the E-gene data were downloaded from GenBank, we are unable to obtain the exact epidemiological information of each single sequence. Among the three Provinces with dengue outbreaks in 2013, we tried to assess whether the cases in Yunnan Province were local cases or not from published papers regarding its outbreak [
