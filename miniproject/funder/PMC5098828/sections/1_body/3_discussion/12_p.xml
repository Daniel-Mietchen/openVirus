<p>Dengue is still an imported disease in China. Because of population movement and the close connections between Southern China and Southeast Asia, Southeast Asia is still the main sources of dengue viruses introduced to China. At the background of climate change and the existence of dengue vector, dengue epidemic is not restricted in Southern China any more. The Pearl River Delta of Guangdong are merging more and more close in recent years,which makes dengue virus disperse easily. Therefore, population movement plays a critical role in dengue dynamic transmission, which introduces dengue viruses to non-epidemic areas at broad or finer spatial scales. Apparently relevant dengue control and prevention strategies should be updated.</p>
