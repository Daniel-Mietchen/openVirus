<p>The phylogeographical analyses showed that Guangzhou not only transmitted viruses to adjacent areas, but also received from other area nationally. The result showed that there existed the probability that dengue virus transmitted to Guangzhou from Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province. The ML tree and MCC tree both showed the Guangzhou strain was embraced in Xishuangbanna clade. Being the centre for industry, finance, transportation and trade in southern China, there are many migrant workers in Guangzhou, nationally and internationally. Xishuangbanna is a tourism resort, which attracted many people including these from Guangzhou. Given dengue outbreak occurred earlier in Xishaungbanna than that in Guangzhou, the dengue virus in Xishuangbanna probably contributed to dengue transmission in Guangzhou.</p>
