<p>The dengue viruses detected in Guangdong Province in Clade 1 showed that Thailand strains were introduced to Guangzhou first, and then transmitted into its neighboring cities: Foshan and Zhongshan, and were then transmitted to Jiangmen from Zhongshan (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g006">6A</xref>). The phylogeographical results indicated that dengue viruses detected in Guangzhou, located in Clade 2, 3, 11, 12, were probably imported from Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g006">6A and 6B</xref>), while Clade 13 showed that some Guangzhou strain was transmitted from Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g006">6C</xref>). Dengue viruses detected in Dehong, Yunnan Province (Clade 4, 9) were probably introduced from its neighbor, Myanmar (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g006">6A and 6B</xref>). Some strains detected in Jiangmen, the strain in Dongguan and some strains in Zhongshan, Guangdong Province, were probably imported from Singapore (Clade 5, 7, 16; Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g005">5A, 5B</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g006">6A and 6C</xref>). The outbreak occurred in Zhuhai, Guangdong Province was probably caused by introduced viruses from Thailand (Clade 6, Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g005">5A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g006">6A</xref>). The results indicated that some strains detected in Foshan, Guangdong Province were introduced from India, Cambodia and Laos (Clade 8, 10, 14; Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g008">Fig 8A</xref> indicated that the dengue viruses in Xishuangbanna were probably introduced from Laos (Clade 13; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0005095.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). In addition, the viruses detected in Henan Province were also probably imported from Laos (Clade 15; Figs
