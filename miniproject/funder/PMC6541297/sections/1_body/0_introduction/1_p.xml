<p>Canine morbillivirus (previously known as canine distemper virus (CDV)) is one of the major pathogens in canine populations, as it causes one of the most contagious and fatal diseases for domestic dogs (

 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CDV is enveloped with single-stranded, negative sense and nonsegmented RNA genetic material, belonging to the genus

 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>) [

 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Despite the existence of a vaccine, several reports highlight CDV, calling attention to the increased activity, genetic diversity and reemergence of other infections in the world [
