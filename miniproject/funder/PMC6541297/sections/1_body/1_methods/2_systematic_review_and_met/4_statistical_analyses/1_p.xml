<p>Data collection required for analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes were initially extracted using Microsoft Excel (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217594.s003">S3 File</xref>). Several tables were generated containing dichotomous data (occurrence or not of an event of interest) for the relative and cumulative calculation of the frequencies of the outcomes of interest, and a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used whenever possible. For all of the meta-analysis procedures, STATA IC/64 version 13.1 software was used (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). In STATA, the metaprop, metafunnel and metaninf commands were used for data analysis and the generation of forest and funnel plots. The relative frequency was determined by the number of cases (CDV positivity) divided by the total number of animals screened, and the results were expressed as percentages. The variance of each frequency estimate (known as ES (Effect Sizes)) was calculated as pq/n, where p is the frequency, q is 1 –p, and n is the total number of animals screened [

To ensure proportionate weight distribution to studies presenting extreme frequency (near 0 or 1), we applied the Freeman-Tukey arcsine methodology [

 <sup>2</sup> test was also used to assess the existence of heterogeneity between studies (I
 <sup>2</sup> = 75–100%, p&lt;0.05) [
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Due to the nature of the studies, the existence of heterogeneity was expected; therefore, we chose to use the random effects model for the meta-analysis as proposed by DerSimonian-Laird [
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. We performed a sensitivity analysis to test the effect of the individual influence of each study on the overall estimate, and a subgroup analysis was also performed to reduce the existence of heterogeneity. In addition, we evaluated the existence of publication bias by visual inspection of Begg’s funnel plot as well as by Egger’s test calculations [
