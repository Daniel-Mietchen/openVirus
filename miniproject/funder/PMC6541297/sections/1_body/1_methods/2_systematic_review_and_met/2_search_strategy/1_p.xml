<p>After defining the research protocol, we performed a systematic search in the PubMed, SciELO and ScienceDirect databases. Articles in the English, Spanish and Portuguese languages that were screened from July to October 2018 were selected. At this stage, to refine the studies of interest, a combination of descriptors was used (“
 <italic>canine distemper virus</italic>,” “
 <italic>canine distemper</italic>,” “
 <italic>viruses in dogs</italic>,” “
 <italic>dogs</italic>,” “
 <italic>domestic dogs</italic>,” “
 <italic>canis familiaris</italic>,” and “
 <italic>canis lupus familiaris</italic>”). We also sought additional studies through screening the references of selected articles and highly cited reviews of the topic of interest.
