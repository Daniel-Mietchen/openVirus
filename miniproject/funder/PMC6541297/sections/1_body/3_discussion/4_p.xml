<p>As briefly mentioned, regional epidemiological variations of CDV may be based on study design, detection methodologies and epidemiological aspects, which include differences in the populations studied. All of these factors contribute to the variations in CDV frequency; there have been individual studies with positivity rates varying from 0 to 100% in regions of Italy [

 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and Uganda [
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], respectively. However, most of the articles reported a frequency of positivity between 30 and 50% (
