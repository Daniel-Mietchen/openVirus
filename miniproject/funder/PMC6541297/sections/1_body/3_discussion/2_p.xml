<p>Among the viruses that affect dogs, CD is the most relevant disease after rabies due to its considerable dissemination and severity potential [
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. However, it has been shown that half of the CDV infections are subclinical or so mild that they do not require veterinary care [
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. However, mild disease may develop into severe disease in dogs, and in this case, the initial clinical condition, which is often restricted to fever, respiratory, ocular signs, apathy and inappetence, may result in severe impairment of the gastrointestinal tract (vomiting and diarrhea) and central nervous system (paraparesis or tetraparesis with sensitive ataxia and myoclonus) [

 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref080" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref083" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Thus, neurological signs may be progressive, and the onset of sequelae tends to generate an expectation of poor prognosis, which reflects a reduced survival rate. In this context, few studies have described the outcome of CDV-positive dogs [
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Here, we observed a fatality rate of 55% (95% CI: 47â€“64, I
 <sup>2</sup>: 0%) for animals with predominantly neurological signs, demonstrating how dangerous CD is.
