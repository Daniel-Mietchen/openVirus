<p>Domestic dogs are a source of CDV transmission for wildlife. This is because dogs acting as major reservoirs can infect and cause disease in wildlife [

 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. This issue highlights the impact of dog diseases on wildlife conservation, as they enter these habitats and have contributed to the emergence of fatal CD outbreaks. Examples include CD epidemics in dogs and other wild species that have threatened populations of African lions (
 <italic>Panthera leo</italic>) in the Serengeti ecosystem and Ethiopian wolves (
 <italic>Canis simensis</italic>) [

 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Additionally, the diversity of animals susceptible to CDV infection is broad as shown in a systematic review by Martinez-Gutierrez [
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>] who did not include domestic dogs in their analysis. Interestingly, in that analysis, the taxonomic families with the largest number of existing studies were 
 <italic>Canidae</italic> followed by 
 <italic>Felidae</italic> and 
 <italic>Mustelidae</italic>. The median seropositivity of CDV was 35.6%, 34.1% and 41.1% for 
 <italic>Canidae</italic>, 
 <italic>Felidae</italic> and 
 <italic>Mustelidae</italic>, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. These data, as well as our data, show how common the circulation of CDV is in these groups of animals.
