<p>For the purpose of testing potential risk factors associated with CDV positivity, the following variables were analyzed: gender; breed; age; free-ranging; vaccine status; and coinfection. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217594.g006">Fig 6</xref>, the results of the ORs for these variables are shown. In summary, a positive association with CDV positivity was observed in relation to the following variables: free-ranging dogs (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.05–1.97); age of dogs &gt;24 months (OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.10–3.05); and unvaccinated dogs (OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.26–6.77). In contrast, there was a negative association with vaccinated dogs (OR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05–0.59), dogs &lt;12 months old (OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.20–0.64) and dogs that were coinfected with canine parvovirus (OR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.13–0.33). The other variables, such as gender, breed and incomplete vaccination status, had no association.
