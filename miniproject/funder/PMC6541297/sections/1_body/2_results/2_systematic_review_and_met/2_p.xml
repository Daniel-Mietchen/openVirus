<p>The 53 articles selected in addition to the data from our study produced a total sample of 11,527 domestic dogs included in the CDV infection analysis (

 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Regarding the general age profile of the animals, only a few authors specified this profile in detail. In this context, there was an approximate ratio of 2.5:1:2.4 in relation to the number of dogs included in the classification of &lt;12 months of age, 12–24 months and &gt;24 months of age, respectively. Thus, the majority of the animals included in the risk analysis were pups (&lt;12 months, n = 2581) and adults (&gt;24 months, n = 2497). In contrast to the cross-sectional study, there was a higher proportion of males than females (1.4:1).
