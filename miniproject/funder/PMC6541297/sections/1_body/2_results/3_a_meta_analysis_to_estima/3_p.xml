<p>Another study question was related to the determination of the levels of CDV infection according to the type of biological sample analyzed in the laboratory. As a result, greater positivity was observed for samples from ocular fluids (54%, 95% CI: 37–72), urine (51%, 95% CI: 40–62) and blood (46%, 95% CI: 36–57 (serological assays)). For the other types of biological samples, reduced positive frequency rates were found in blood lymphocytes (38%, 95% CI: 29–48), blood (37%, 95% CI: 24–50 (molecular assays)) and nasal fluids (33%, 95% CI: 0–81) (

A lower frequency of viral infection was observed in fecal samples (18%, 95% CI: 5–35) and mucous fluid (11%, 95% CI: 4–21), which refers to the mixing of biological samples composed of nasal, ocular, oropharyngeal, oronasal and genital tract swabs.
