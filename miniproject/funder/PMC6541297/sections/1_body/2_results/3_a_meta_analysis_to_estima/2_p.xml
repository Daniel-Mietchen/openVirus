<p>To better understand the picture of current studies in relation the frequency of CDV infection versus clinical signs of animals, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217594.g003">Fig 3B</xref> was generated. Consequently, a higher viral positivity was observed when systemic clinical signs were present (75%, 95% CI: 34–100), followed by systemic and neurological (56%, 95% CI: 36–76), ocular (55%, 95% CI: 22–85), neurological (41%, 95% CI: 30–52), gastrointestinal (29%, 95% CI: 19–40) and respiratory signs (25%, 95% CI: 4–53).
