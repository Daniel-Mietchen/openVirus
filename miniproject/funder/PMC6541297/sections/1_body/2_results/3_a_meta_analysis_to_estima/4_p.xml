<p>In the forest plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0217594.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), the proportion of CDV positivity is shown, and the data are related to the diagnostic method used in conjunction with the type of biological sample. Of note, a higher proportion of positivity occurred when using the ELISA assays (62%, 95% CI: 47–77), IC (46%, 95% CI: 28–64), RT-PCR (41%, 95% CI: 33–50), nested PCR (38%, 95% CI: 28–49) and SN (38%, 95% CI: 26–50). However, a lower proportion of positive CDVs occurred when using quantitative PCR assays (8%, 95% CI: 0–23) and IFA (26%, 95% CI: 17–36).
