 <xref rid="pone.0217594.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] provided the necessary data for the calculation of the proportions. The common viral pathogens involved in CDV coinfection were canine parvovirus (35%, 95% CI: 21–49), canine adenovirus (4%, 95% CI: 1–10) and canine coronavirus (24%, 95% CI 15–34) (
