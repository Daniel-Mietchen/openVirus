  <title>Concordance of ELISA for maternal blood vs cord blood.</title>
  <p>Results of ZIKV IgG ELISA are tightly correlated between serum from maternal peripheral blood (y-axis) and umbilical cord blood (x-axis). Serum at 1:100 dilution were run on a ZIKV capture ELISA. Matched maternal and cord blood specimens from the same subject were run side-by-side on the same ELISA plate. Results were graphed and statistical calculations for correlation (shown in figure inset) were performed in Prism GraphPad. OD, optical density at 405nm.</p>
