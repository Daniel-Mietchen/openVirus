<p>The diagnosis of symptomatic Zika is effectively achieved with molecular tests early after infection, but the sensitivity of these methods declines within days to weeks after infection as viremia wanes. Molecular diagnostics are thus not optimal for monitoring ZIKV infection at the population level because the majority of ZIKV infections are asymptomatic. Serologic assays are the mainstay for identifying remote and recent infections for clinical or surveillance purposes. The serodiagnosis of ZIKV is complicated because DENV and ZIKV elicit cross-reactive antibody responses that reduce the specificity of traditional serologic assays.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230692.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Our recent work demonstrates that neutralizing antibody assays can discriminate DENV and ZIKV infections, particularly after the early convalescent period.[
