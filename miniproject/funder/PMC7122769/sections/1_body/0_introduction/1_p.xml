<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) spread rapidly throughout Latin America and the Caribbean in 2015â€“2016.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230692.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] ZIKV is an enveloped, positive-sense RNA virus primarily transmitted by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, which is also the vector of dengue (DENV), yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses. Thus, ZIKV has primarily circulated in DENV-endemic areas. Most ZIKV infections are inapparent, but a minority manifest as a nonspecific, self-limiting, acute illness characterized by fever, rash, joint pain, and/or conjunctivitis.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230692.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Incident ZIKV infections have markedly declined, but there is concern that ZIKV will continue to circulate and spread to susceptible populations.[
