<p>In Le√≥n, Nicaragua, we established a prospective surveillance cohort of 253 women who were pregnant during the 2016 ZIKV epidemic. We leveraged the existing health infrastructure for prenatal care and serology to detect ZIKV infections that occurred during pregnancy. We further analyzed the laboratory, demographic and clinical data collected from this population with the objective of defining the relationship between maternal ZIKV infection inferred by serology and fetal outcome.</p>
