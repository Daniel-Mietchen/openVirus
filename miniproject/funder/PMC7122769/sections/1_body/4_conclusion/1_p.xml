<p>ZIKV poses unique challenges to maternal-child health globally and highlights shortcomings in public health surveillance systems that must be addressed to combat known and unknown emerging infectious diseases. Considering distinct aspects of ZIKV biology, such as asymptomatic infection and cross-reactivity with DENV, we implemented an algorithm assigning ZIKV infection status within a population of pregnant women in Nicaragua that paralleled national epidemiologic data. This study provides a model for improving approaches to serologic diagnosis and surveillance of infectious diseases by superimposing testing strategies on existing public health infrastructure[

Our approach could be applied to track and respond to a broad range of infectious disease challenges. Investments to strengthen surveillance systems worldwide could yield major dividends in many domains of public health.
