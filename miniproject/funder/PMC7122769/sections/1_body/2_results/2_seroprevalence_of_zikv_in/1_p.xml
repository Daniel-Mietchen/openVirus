<p>To determine the seroprevalence and incidence of ZIKV infection during pregnancy, we used a step-wise screening approach (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230692.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The first assays defined seroprevalence of ZIKV, the latter assays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230692.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) were performed to estimate the timing of infection in relation to pregnancy. Of 187 women, 176 (94%) were ZIKV IgG ELISA positive (

 <xref rid="pone.0230692.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] We found concordance between the two methods to be 89.4%. The eFRNT identified as positive 94% of samples that tested positive by NS1 BOB, further suggesting that eFRNT50 is a reliable screen for ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies (
