<p>We developed a serologic testing strategy for inferring ZIKV infection status in relation to pregnancy (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002">Methods</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230692.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Data for this analysis were available for 187 women. Of the 110 (59%) women who were ZIKV+ at delivery, 40 (36%) had strong evidence of ZIKV infection during their pregnancies (Probable Incident ZIKV), 41 (37%) were likely infected prior to the current pregnancy (ZIKV immune), and the timing of infection was difficult to approximate for 29 (26%) (ZIKV of Unknown Timing), mostly due to lack of a prenatal sample for monitoring changes in specific antibody levels over the course of the pregnancy (
