<p>To corroborate our approach, we compared our results to Nicaraguan Ministry of Health data from the Zika epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230692.g003">Fig 3</xref>), hypothesizing that most of the infections in our cohort would have occurred during the relatively narrow peak of Zika incidence in Nicaragua (July–September, 2016). LMP defined the pregnant period and ranged May–December, 2016. Eighty-three percent (33/40) of the women who met criteria for Incident ZIKV infection during their pregnancy were pregnant during the peak of the epidemic. In contrast, most (66%, 27/41) of the women classified as ZIKV Pre-Immune had LMP that indicated a pregnancy after the peak of the epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230692.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Thus, our context-agnostic designation of ZIKV infection status for pregnant women matched risk predicted by timing of pregnancy relative to peak ZIKV transmission in Nicaragua.
