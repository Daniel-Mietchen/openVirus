<p>Of the 194 infants who were delivered at HEODRA, median gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks (IQR: 38–40) and median birthweight was 3050 grams (IQR: 2750–3400). Of the total, 4.1% spent time in the NICU, and 16.8% experienced at least one adverse birth outcome (

 <xref rid="pone.0230692.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). There was no significant correlation between any categories of adverse fetal outcomes and report of symptoms, obstetric history, timing of LMP, or prior clinical diagnosis of ZIKV. Comparing risk for any adverse birth outcome across serologic groups yielded no significant differences. The proportion of infants with clinical findings consistent with CZS was 3.4% and 2.5% in the Unknown Timing and Incident ZIKV groups, as compared to 1.3% and 0% in the Naive and Pre-Immune groups; however, the differences between groups for this rare event were not significant in our small sample size. All three infants with clinical findings consistent with CZS were born to mothers whose pregnancy overlapped with the peak period of ZIKV transmission.
