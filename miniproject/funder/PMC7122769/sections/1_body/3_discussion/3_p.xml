<p>There are limitations of this study worth mentioning. Samples were not available for all women at all time points due to our use of convenience sampling from a single health sector in León. Ultrasound and computerized tomography were not available to thoroughly assess for intracranial abnormalities such as calcifications, which may have decreased our sensitivity for suspected CZS cases. Another important limitation is that we did not have sufficient specimens and resources to complete matched DENV neutralization and IgM testing for comparison to ZIKV serology results. It is less likely that this limitation substantially confounded the results because ZIKV transmission was epidemic and DENV transmission minimal at the time of sampling. Future studies will need to address more completely the specificity of this algorithm to confirm its applicability in settings of lower ZIKV incidence and co-circulation of ZIKV and DENV. On the other hand, a unique asset of our study in comparison to other reports[

This is critical as identifying research subjects by confirmed Zika cases or by neonatal anomalies may bias against balanced study of inapparent maternal ZIKV infections.[
