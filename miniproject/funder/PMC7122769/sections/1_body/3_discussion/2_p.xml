<p>Screening populations by ZIKV IgG where DENV is highly endemic has little utility due to antibody cross-reactivity between these two related flaviviruses.[

 <xref rid="pone.0230692.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] IgM testing was used to define recent ZIKV infection, though it is no longer recommended for clinical testing due to the potential for IgM persistence. However, longitudinal cohort studies have shown that most ZIKV-infected individuals sero-revert to IgM-negative by 3â€“4 months[

 <xref rid="pone.0230692.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Given that human gestation is approximately 40 weeks, a ZIKV IgM-positive result indicates a substantially elevated risk for ZIKV infection during the current pregnancy, particularly when the tested specimen is obtained beyond 20 weeks of gestation. IgM from a neonatal or cord blood specimen would be strong evidence of congenital ZIKV infection (because maternal IgM does not cross the placenta).
