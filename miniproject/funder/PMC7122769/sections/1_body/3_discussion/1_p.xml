<p>Here, we developed and evaluated an algorithm for serologically assigning ZIKV infection and risk status to pregnant women in a ZIKV-endemic region. Our approach was viable, and assignments for seroprevalence and for timing of infection were valid when comparing to other serodiagnostic assays such as the Zika NS1 BOB and with epidemiologic findings in Nicaraguan populations from other sources. We assessed serologic evidence of ZIKV infection at the population level by iterative testing, advancing from sensitive to more specific assays. It is difficult to fully assess the performance of this approach, as there is no serologic gold standard for diagnosing Zika. However, our assigned ZIKV infection status was highly concordant with publicly available data from the Nicaraguan Zika epidemic. Thus, the majority of women designated ZIKV-infected during pregnancy by our blinded serologic testing were confirmed to be pregnant during the peak Zika epidemic. Furthermore, seroprevalence among pregnant women in our study was 59%, similar to the 56% seroprevalence found for adults in Managua during the same period.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230692.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] While applying our algorithm to a set of banked sera from pregnant women with RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection could be informative, the context and purpose of our study is different–to assess serologic risk among a population of pregnant women with unknown infection status and independent of clinical manifestations. To the latter point, our data indicate that ZIKV serostatus does not correlate with a women’s recollection of symptoms such as fever, rash, or conjunctivitis, which is not surprising since many acute viral illnesses present with theses non-specific clinical manifestations. Excluding previous ZIKV infection is at least as important as diagnosing current ZIKV infection, as that result provides reassurance and decreased need further testing and resource utilization dedicated to those pregnancies. Approximately 40% of tested women were classified as having no prior ZIKV infection; however, a much larger portion of women would be assigned a ZIKV Naïve status in a population not currently or recently experiencing a ZIKV epidemic, making this approach even more efficient.
