<p>CZS is a rare event, with even peak case rates from the Brazilian epidemic of 50 per 10,000 live births.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230692.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Though we observed cases consistent with CZS, our sample size was not adequate to fully assess relationships between serologic status and adverse outcomes at birth. Interestingly, subject 1203, the only subject that was ZIKV IgM positive in the cord blood, was a case of microcephaly. This motherâ€™s serology also exhibited a high and rising FRNT50 (~9000 at delivery) and was NS1 BOB positive. Although we did not observe increased adverse events among infants born in our cohort, the long term neurologic outcomes of asymptomatic infants at birth remains to be elucidated and needs further investigation.
