<p>Demographic characteristics of participants who delivered at HEODRA were compared to those of women who delivered elsewhere using t-tests for continuous variables, chi-square tests for categorical variables, and Fisherâ€™s exact tests for categorical variables with sparse data. Adverse birth outcomes were cross-tabulated with various potential exposures and characteristics. Finally, risk ratios and 95% Wald confidence intervals comparing risk of adverse birth outcomes and CZS-specific adverse birth outcomes for various characteristics were estimated by unconditional maximum likelihood with small sample adjustment whenever the corresponding contingency tables contained a cell with fewer than five subjects. Study data were managed with REDCap
