<p>IgG binding assays were followed by neutralization testing as the former is more sensitive and the latter more specific for detection of flavivirus infections.[

For probable prior ZIKV infection, paired pre-natal and birth blood samples were tested by FRNT and IgM ELISA to confirm the ZIKV infection and to estimate the timing of ZIKV infection in relation to pregnancy (
