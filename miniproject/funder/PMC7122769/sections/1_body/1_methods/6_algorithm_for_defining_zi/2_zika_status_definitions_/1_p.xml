<p>We defined 
 <underline>Probable Incident ZIKV</underline> infection (i.e., an infection occurring during pregnancy) in women in whom any of the following criteria were met: 1) high maternal serum titers (FRNT&gt;3000) at the time of birth; 2) a 4-fold or more increase in maternal serum FRNT50 value between the prenatal and delivery samples; 3) detection of anti-ZIKV IgM in any maternal or an umbilical cord blood serum sample. We categorized women as 
 <underline>ZIKV Pre-Immune</underline> (i.e., infected prior to pregnancy) if their FRNT50 levels were between 40 and 3000 and remained stable (less than 4 fold difference) over the course of the pregnancy. We characterized women as 
 <underline>ZIKV Naïve</underline> (i.e., never infected with Zika virus) if their ZIKV IgG ELISA result was negative or their ZIKV FRNT or eFRNT50 was ≤200. Finally, some women had evidence of ZIKV infection, but timing relative to pregnancy was uncertain. We categorized women as having 
 <underline>ZIKV of Unknown Timing</underline> if none of the above criteria were met (typically owing to inadequate sample availability from early pregnancy).
