<p>We established a prospective surveillance cohort of pregnant women in León, Nicaragua. All participants were recruited during prenatal care visits at Perla María Health Center from February to July 2017 and planned to deliver at Hospital Escuela Oscar Danilo Rosales Argüello (HEODRA). Questionnaires were filled regarding general health, obstetrical history, socioeconomic indices, and exposure risk and symptoms of mosquito-borne disease. Gestational ages were dated based on reported last menstrual period (LMP). Birth weight, sex, head circumference using a tape measure placed around the widest circumference of the infant’s head, complications such as birth defects or requirement for above average resuscitation were collected, and other clinical diagnoses were extracted from each woman’s medical record. A maternal blood specimen was obtained once each trimester during prenatal encounters and at delivery, at which time a cord blood specimen was also obtained. Cord specimens were used as a maternal specimen for IgG testing after confirming tight correlation between maternal peripheral blood and cord blood in relevant assays (

All clinical, epidemiologic and demographic data were entered into a secure, encrypted electronic database.
