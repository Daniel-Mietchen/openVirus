<p>Serum IgG binding to ZIKV was measured as described.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230692.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] ZIKV virions from infected C6/36 culture supernatants served as the antigen and were captured by the murine monoclonal antibody 4G2; sera were tested at 1:100 dilution. A positive and negative control serum were included on each plate. Assay cut-off was defined as the average optical density (OD) of the negative controls + 3 standard deviations.
