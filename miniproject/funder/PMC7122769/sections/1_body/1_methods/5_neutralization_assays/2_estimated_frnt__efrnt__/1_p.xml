<p>This assay was performed as above, but samples were run in singleton over four 4-fold dilutions. The eFRNT value is a discrete number corresponding to the dilution factor at which 50% maximum FFU are observed or the average of the two dilution factors between which 50% FFU is crossed. For both neutralization assays, 100% infection for each plate is determined by two controls: virus loading control (virus in media and no human serum) and NHS (a “normal human serum” that does not contain flavivirus-reactive antibodies, which is premixed with virus prior to infecting Vero cells as is done for test sera).</p>
