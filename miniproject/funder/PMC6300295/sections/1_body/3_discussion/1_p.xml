<p>A decade ago, the global distribution of the risk of DENV infection and its public health burden were poorly known with little information from Africa [

 <xref rid="pone.0208907.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as well as the forces of urbanization and globalization have facilitated the emergence of Dengue and other Arboviruses [

This study has therefore added to the body of knowledge and scientific data, the molecular evidence of the presence of the West African commonly found DENV-2 and DENV-3 serotypes in Ghana. This finding supports the co-circulation and concurrent infections by multiple DENV serotypes which has become a frequent occurrence in endemic countries [
