<p>ZIKV is an enveloped positive-strand RNA member of the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genus in the Flaviviridae family. Other flaviviruses include dengue, yellow fever, West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, many of which are associated with neurological disease. Like these viruses, ZIKV is principally transmitted by a mosquito bite and is thus described as an arthropod-borne virus or ‘arbovirus’. Its primary vector is the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito, which transmits the virus between humans and is widespread in tropical regions [
