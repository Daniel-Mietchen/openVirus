<p>The median global incidence rate (IR) of GBS was estimated at 1.10 per 100,000 person-years (range, 0.81–1.89) [

Prior to the 2015–2016 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), there were few published studies on the incidence of GBS in the region, with an exception among children. As part of polio eradication efforts, AFP in children under 15 years of age has been a notifiable event in all LAC countries since the 1980s [
