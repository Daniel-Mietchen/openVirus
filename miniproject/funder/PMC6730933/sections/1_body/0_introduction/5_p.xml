<p>Enhanced GBS surveillance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and increased research present a unique opportunity to assess the background IR of GBS in the LAC region in the aftermath of recent arboviral epidemics. This review aims to assess the background population-wide incidence of GBS in Latin America and the Caribbean through a synthesis of observational studies. For the purposes of this study, “background incidence” refers to the rates reported during time periods with no arboviral epidemic. To our knowledge this is the first systematic review on GBS in this region. A secondary aim of this review is to ascertain the incidence of GBS during arboviral disease outbreaks.
