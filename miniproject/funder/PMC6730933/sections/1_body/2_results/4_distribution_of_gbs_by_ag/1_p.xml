<p>GBS distribution by age in the general population did not follow a consistent pattern across countries. In Chile, the IR showed a bimodal distribution with a peak in the youngest ages (2.23 per 100,000 in 5−9 year-olds), and increased from 1.22 per 100,000 among 20−29 year-olds to 4.30 per 100,000 among 70−79 years-olds [
