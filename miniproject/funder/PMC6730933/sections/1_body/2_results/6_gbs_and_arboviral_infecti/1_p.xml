<p>We found that 17 studies reported the GBS IR during arboviral disease outbreaks in seven countries; 14 during the 2015–2016 ZIKV epidemic, one during the 2014 CHIKV outbreak in the French West Indies, and 1 during DENV, CHIKV and ZIKV outbreaks in Martinique (See 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007622.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The IR in the French West Indies during the 2014 CHIKV epidemic was 3.45 per 100,000 persons [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], representing a two-fold increase from 1.77 per 100,000 during 2011–2013 (p = 0.006) [

 <sub>(2016 vs. 2006–2015)</sub> = 4.52; 95% CI 2.80–7.64] [

 <sub>(2016 vs. 2012–2015)</sub> = 2.06; 95% CI 1.51–2.85] [
