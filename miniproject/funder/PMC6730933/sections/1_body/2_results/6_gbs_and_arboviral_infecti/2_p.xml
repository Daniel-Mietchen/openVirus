<p>In South America, there was substantial heterogeneity in the GBS IRs during the 2015−2016 ZIKV epidemic for the population as a whole, ranging from 7.63 per 100,000 in Barranquilla, Colombia [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], to 0.71 per 100,000 in the Brazilian state of Piauí [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In a multi-year study, Barcellos et al. reported a 2.7 (IRR 
 <sub>(2015–2016 vs. 2008–2015)</sub> = 2.7; 95% CI 2.38–3.07) increase in the rate of GBS hospitalizations in Brazil’s Northeast region during the peak of the ZIKV epidemic as compared to the mean rate in the eight years preceding the epidemic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In Colombia, Machado et al. reported over a two-fold increase in GBS diagnoses during the peak of the ZIKV epidemic as compared to baseline rates (IRR 
 <sub>(2016 vs. 2014–2015)</sub> = 2.29; 95% CI 1.69–3.14) [
