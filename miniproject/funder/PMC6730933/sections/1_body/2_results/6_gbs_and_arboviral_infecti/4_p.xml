<p>We performed sub-group analyses by case-ascertainment (i.e., administrative data based on ICD codes only versus both administrative data and medical record review) to assess if the IR heterogeneity was due to this factor. We found significant within-group heterogeneity but not between-group heterogeneity, indicating that case ascertainment did not significantly bias the IRs. This held true when we performed a region-wide analysis, and when we analyzed Latin American and the Caribbean sub-regions separately (See
