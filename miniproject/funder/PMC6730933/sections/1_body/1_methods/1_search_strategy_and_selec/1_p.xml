<p>Our protocol followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines and the Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) Checklist (see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007622.s002">S2</xref> Files) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We developed the search word criteria by reviewing PubMed MeSH and Embase Emtree subject headings and keywords. We searched nine electronic databases. Our full search terms are provided in the appendix. We conducted a grey literature search on OpenGrey and OAIster and hand-searched relevant journals and the bulletins of ministries of health cited in bibliographic references of the articles selected for full-text review (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007622.s003">S3 File</xref>). We also reviewed the references of all included articles. Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed and government publications that presented primary data on incident GBS cases in LAC within a well-defined population and timeframe and that were published in English, Spanish, Portuguese, or French between January 1, 1980 to October 1, 2018. The search timeframe was decided upon to update the worldwide review by McGrogan [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] from 1980 to 2008. Review papers were excluded. After removing duplicates, two authors (AC, DLV) independently screened articles by title and abstract based on the inclusion criteria and agreed on those for full-text review. A standard extraction form was developed and tested for reliability. Disagreements were resolved by these two reviewers.
