<p>The pooled background IR of GBS calculated in the Caribbean of 1.64 per 100,000 (95% CI 1.29–2.12,

 <sup>

 </sup> = 0.00, p = 0.44) was higher than the mean IR in North America and Europe but within the estimated range for those regions (0.80−1.90 per 100,000) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In LAC, background IRs of GBS ranged from 0.40 per 100,000 in Rio Grande do Norte [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and São Paulo [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] in Brazil to 2.12 per 100,000 in Chile [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These background IRs exceeded the upper and lower ranges calculated by the aforementioned meta-analysis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but were comparable to the range reported in a 2009 GBS literature review from 0.38/100,000/year in Finland to 2.53/100,000/year in Curaçao [
