<p>Data on GBS, both historical and current, are lacking for many countries in the region. With the exception of studies using AFP data, most are recent and from ZIKV-affected countries, and baseline data are often lacking. Publication bias in favor of significant results may have limited the availability of studies that found no association between arboviral epidemics and GBS. On the other hand, ZIKVâ€™s high public visibility most likely led to increased scientific research and publications on GBS as well as surveillance (i.e., detection) bias, particularly in countries affected by the emerging arbovirus. Few studies reported data from Central America and Mexico. Therefore, estimates for this sub-region have a high risk of bias. All but two studies reported effect sizes for the outcome of interest. However, we addressed this limitation by calculating 95% confidence intervals for all studies.</p>
