<p>A limitation of this review is that studies employed different methodologies to ascertain GBS cases. Diagnosing GBS is complex and based on clinical observation and electrophysiological studies. Specialists who can properly diagnose GBS may be unavailable in resource-limited settings. Natural annual variations in incidence may be masked or exacerbated by imperfect case identification.</p>
