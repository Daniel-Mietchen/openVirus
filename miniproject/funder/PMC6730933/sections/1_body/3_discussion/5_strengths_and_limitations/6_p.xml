<p>Since GBS is triggered by a variety of antecedent infections, baseline incidence of GBS is critical for detecting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks. The LAC region has been a pioneer in monitoring of GBS in children over the last 30 years [

Enhanced surveillance and increased research have provided us with new data to assess GBS incidence in this region. Because of its severity and lethality in the absence of adequate care, investments are needed to provide information on GBS to populations at-risk and to build healthcare providers’ capacity to diagnose GBS and follow appropriate care protocols [
