<p>Methodological differences in case finding limit comparability across studies. The specificity and sensitivity of administrative data varies by setting [

The high cost of capture-recapture methods to compare sensitivity of case identification and ascertainment methods of a rare syndrome limits the feasibility of such studies to assess GBS incidence nationwide. Several researchers have accepted the use of administrative data as a viable low-cost option to assess background GBS IRs [
