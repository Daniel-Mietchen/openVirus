<p>Some of the included studies were not carried out with the sole purpose of measuring GBS IRs. While the studies that focused on IR calculations tended to adjust the rates based on population age structures, others did not. This introduces a source of variability. Some studies reported incidence by person-years and others as annual incidence. We addressed this issue by calculating all IRs.</p>
