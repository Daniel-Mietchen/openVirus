<p>A strength of this research is that all included studies are population based. In addition, many of the studies are multi-year in duration, with a mean of 7.2 years for studies that analyzed background GBS IRs. This gives us a robust estimate of GBS incidence that balances out natural fluctuations in annual IRs. Another strength is the application of a thorough search methodology and inclusion of most languages spoken in LAC. Inclusion of ministry of health bulletins data served to balance publication bias.</p>
