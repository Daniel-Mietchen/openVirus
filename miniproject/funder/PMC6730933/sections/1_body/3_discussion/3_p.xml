<p>This review synthesizes GBS incidence data from CHIKV and ZIKV epidemic outbreaks. However, data on CHIKV infection and GBS are limited to the French West Indies. The association of DENV infection with GBS is not well established. One multi-year study in Aruba found a positive correlation between number of GBS cases and laboratory-confirmed DENV infections (p = 0.004, Kendall’s tau-b) [

In terms of ZIKV, most studies showed temporal associations of ZIKV infections with GBS rates. However, fewer studies reported GBS rates at baseline and during an outbreak, in part because of sparse historical data on GBS. Dos Santos et al. reported increases in IRs during the weeks of ZIKV transmission ranging from 100% in El Salvador (95% CI 55.7–156.9) to 877% in Venezuela (95% CI 664.1–1149.6) as compared to estimated pre-ZIKV baselines [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007622.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Consistent with Dos Santos et al., studies that reported rates of GBS at baseline and during epidemic weeks reported increases of 106% in Puerto Rico (IRR 
 <sub>(2016 vs. 2012–2015)</sub> = 2.06; 95% CI 1.51–2.85), 352% in Martinique (IRR 
 <sub>(2016 vs. 2006–2015)</sub> = 4.52; 95% CI 2.80–7.64), 171% in Brazil’s Northeastern region (IRR 
 <sub>(2015–2016 vs. 2008–2015)</sub> = 2.7; 95% CI 2.38–3.07), and 129% in Colombia (IRR 
 <sub>(2016 vs. 2014–2015)</sub> = 2.29; 95% CI 1.69–3.14). In summary, all studies that reported rates of GBS before and during the ZIKV outbreak showed significant temporal increases in IRs during the outbreak. However, this could be due to publication bias. Furthermore, heterogeneity coupled with limited data precludes us from drawing region-wide comparisons of these differences.
