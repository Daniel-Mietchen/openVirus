HFRS emerged in China among the early 1930s, and to date 29 of 31 provinces had reported the epidemics of this zoonotic disease.

Thanks to lots of comprehensive preventive measures, such as the national immunization programs, a dramatical decline of the incidence of HFRS among China was observed since the beginning of the new century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Moreover, sporadic cases of oriental-HFRS (induced by hantavirus of Asian serotype) were also irregularly reported in the Americas and Europe over the years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

All field rodents were detected as hantavirus free only except the rodents captured from Dingzhou City in 2010.

Totally, only 36 lung tissues of rodents captured from the northeastern cities of the province, Chengde, Tangshan and Qinhuangdao where were the current high-incidence area for HFRS, were detected for positive by RT-PCR of partial M segment (1934&#x02013;2353&#x02009;bp, total 420&#x02009;bp). The phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences showed that hantaviruses circulating in Hebei province evolved slowly and they all belonged to <italic>Seoul virus</italic> S3 genotype (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). It is shown that the hantaviruses identified in 1993 had an apparent genetic difference with the viruses identified in last decade. However, there was no significant genetic divergence between each hantaviruses identified during this ten-year period (2007&#x02013;2016), neither in different areas nor different years.

The most awful period is the second epidemic which occurred for 20&#x02009;years and effected almost all the cities of Hebei province. Thus, more attention need to be paid cause this zoonotic infectious disease has killed too many people and made severe adverse effects to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thanks to lots of comprehensive preventive measures, such as the national immunization programs, health promotion, environment improvement and deratization, the annual incidence of HFRS cases in Hebei province have been controled under 20 cases per million population in last decade. However the periodical recurrence of HFRS epidemic has warned us the surveillance of hantavirus infection in humans and rodents should be continuely enhanced.</p><p id="Par28">For the first time, we have detected that the age peak of HFRS patients is slightly getting older. It is assumed that more and more young people trend to migrate into urban cities resulting in low frequency of contact with virus-carrying rodents. While, adult male farmers are still the key population of HFRS disease promptting that these people should be primary objects for the immunization programs. So far, the inactivated vaccines yielded from cultured cells or rodent brain has been licensed for use in humans in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the immunization program was executed in northeastern cities, Tangshan and Qinhuangdao since 2008. While the immune protective efficiency of these vaccines was still unclear and needs some further observation. In addition, some other classical or advanced molecular vaccine approaches, including DNA vaccines and attenuated live vaccines are still in pre- or clinical stages for further evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">The bigger spring peaks of HFRS were obvious and consistent annually warning people to decrease the frequency of contaction with rodent populations at this time. While, it is hard to interpret that the smaller winter peaks are going to be unapparent. Previous epidemiological study has elucidated that the winter peak was generally associated with HTNV carried by striped field rat (<italic>A. agrarius</italic>) and the spring peak was mainly caused by SEOV carried by house rat (<italic>R. norvegicus</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The decline of winter peak potentially interprets the proportion of HFRS patients associated with HTNV is decreasing, which coincides with pathogenical surveillance of rodents that only SEOV were identified in Hebei province during latest decade. On the other hand, the previous apparent winter peaks especially during second epidemic demonstrated that HTNV might circulate in Hebei province once.</p><p id="Par30">Based on this long-term surveillance, we discovered that the high incidence region of HFRS has gradully shift. While, the principal factor of HFRS transmission dynamic is still unclear. It has been suggested that the climate variability may drive the dynamics of human HFRS infection, because the climate, such as temperature and rainfall can provide favorable conditions for both rodent population growth and virus transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Urbanization and other relative human activities may also affect the frequency of contact between human and rodent populations furtherly impacting HFRS transmission dynamic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, it seems to be unconvincing to consider urbanization playing key role in high incidence region shift cause urbanization of central or southern part of the province was comparable to northeastern part. In addition, it has been proven that there are some potential correlationship between incidence of HFRS and air pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Herein, we give a hypothesis that since 1980s the ecological environmental factors and human activities made a combined effection to local host species and virus genotype furtherly deciding the high incidence region shift.</p><p id="Par31">As a zoonotic disease, the incidence of HFRS has a close relationship with the local population of rodents, including host density and virus-carrying rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The annual host densities in Hebei province were drastically fluctuated indicating that the rodent habitted ecology environment was flimsy. While an apparent peak of virus-carrying rate was solely observed in Luan county, where was the high-incidence region of HFRS during the third epidemic phase indicating that virus-carrying rate play a more significant role to affect incidence of HFRS infection. Therefore, virus-carrying rate should be considered as a significant surveillance indicator to alert next HFRS epidemic. In addition, deratization especially in the residential area should be encouraged, cause the higher host density has made people under high exposure risk of rodent-borne pathogenic viruses including hantaviruses.</p><p id="Par32">Epidemiological characteristic and clinical manifestation of HFRS can be determined by virus genotypes which are further influenced by host speicies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In central China, HFRS has stronger relationship with HTNV carried by striped field mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It has been shown that HTNV and SEOV simutaneously circulated in most areas of China, such as eastern coastal city, Qingdao [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], central city beside Yangzi River, Wuhan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] as well as southwestern area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and northeastern area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Uniquely, we have never identified HTNV among rodents and correspondingly the field rat, <italic>A. agrarius</italic> the natural host for HTNV, was also seldom to be found even in the field areas of Hebei province since 2007. However, the house rat, <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> predominantly existed in both residential areas and field areas leading SEOV probably to be sole pathogen for HFRS infection in this northern China province. For the past few years, more and more evidences has proven that due to global warming or the usage of rodenticides the asian house rat, <italic>Rattus tanezumi</italic> which naturally exit in southern China has expanded their vivosphere northward and aggressively influenced local rodent population including <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Because so far <italic>R. tanezumi</italic> has not been proven to be a natural host for SEOV, this migration might incompletely explain the shift of HFRS high incidence region of Hebei province. Thus far, in order to comprehensively illustrate the transmission dynamic of HFRS, continuous surveillance of rodent population should be enhanced in the future.</p><p id="Par33">Based on phylogenetic analysis, we have known that hantaviruses circulated among high-incidence region of HFRS evolved slightly during the past decade and there was no apparent geographic segregation indentified. Here we modestly gave a hypothesis that there was no extraneous hantavirus invaded recently and only native strains of hantavirus were circulated throughout in Hebei province from 1990s to date. Meanwhile it has been shown that SEOV, probably the only hantavirus species which globally spread, has spread into west world owing to the omnipresence of its rodent host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The only valid explanation that why SEOV-HFRS epidemic situation of China was much more serious than that of western countries over past decades, is and remains a lower medical awareness in the West for detecting milder and sometimes atypical SEOV-HFRS cases, which are probably underreported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Most mutations of nucleotides of SEOV identified in this study were considered to be no significance and two sites with subtitutions of amino acids in separated strains were supposed to occur occasionally. However the amino acid mutation (V652I) simutaneously present in three strains should be gaven more attention. It has been proven that both Gn and Gc are transmembrane proteins playing significant roles in recognition, adhesion and invasion of target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, further surveillance and laboratory study should be done to figure out whether this mutation affects physiology and transmission dynamic of viruses and clinical manifestation of HFRS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par34">In conclusion, this long-term province-wide surveillance in northern China indicates that HFRS epidemic periodically occurred and the high-incidence region has shift. SEOV carried by house rat <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> probably is sole pathogen for HFRS in Hebei province and further molecular evidence elucidates that viruses circulated during past decade are homologous but they are still slightly evolving. Continued surveillance of hantavirus infection in both humans and host rodents is needed to fight against this infectious zoonotic disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>
