<p id="Par23">Since 2007, in total of 181,966 rattraps were set up with 2721 rodents, including 
 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, 
 <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, 
 <italic>Tscherskia triton</italic>, 
 <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic> and some other unrecognized species, were captured from the six surveillance points (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). While the annual rodent densities in each surveillance points had a great fluctuation, the residential area generally possess much higher rodent density than the field (U = 147.5, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). For the rodent species composition, no matter in residential area or the field 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> indisputably was the dominant rodent species and it accounted for 85 and 63% of all captured rodents, respectively. In addition, 
 <italic>M. musculus</italic> was the second largest rodent group inhabitting in the residential area.
