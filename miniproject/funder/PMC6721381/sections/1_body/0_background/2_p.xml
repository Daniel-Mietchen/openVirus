<p id="Par12">Hantaviruses now have been considered as a single family, 
 <italic>Hantaviridae</italic> belonging to the 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. So far, more than 50 hantavirus species divided into three phylogenetic clusters have been identifed from rodents, shrews, moles and bats, but only rodent-borne hantaviruses have been found to cause pathogenicity in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Due to the millions of years co-evolution with reservoir hosts, different hantaviruses possess various host specificities, geographical tropisms and pathologies in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It has been identified that HFRS in Asia is primarily caused by either 
 <italic>Hantaan virus</italic> (HTNV) or 
 <italic>Seoul virus</italic> (SEOV). HTNV usually causes more severe symptoms than SEOV and they were naturally carried by 
 <italic>Apodemus agrarius</italic> and 
 <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, it should be concerned that anthropogenic changes in host reservoir ecology and biodiversity have enhanced the risk of virus reassortment and host spill-over [
