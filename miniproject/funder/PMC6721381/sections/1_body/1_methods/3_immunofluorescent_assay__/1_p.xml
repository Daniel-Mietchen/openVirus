<p id="Par17">Lung tissues of rodents were conducted into frozen sections to detect hantavirus antigen by IFA with rabbit anti-SEOV/L99 and HTNV/76–118 hantavirus antibodies and FITC-labeled IgG according to the previous method [

Since 2012, total RNA were extracted from lung tissues of rodents that had been confirmed for virus-carrying positive by IFA using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Then, cDNAs were synthesized with AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Beijing, China) in the presence of primer P14 which was genus-specific segment for hantavirus [
