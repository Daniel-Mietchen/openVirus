  <p>Phylogenetic analysis of partial M segments of hantaviruses circulating in Hebei province. 
   <bold>a</bold> Phylogenetic tree of 36 SEOV identified from Hebei and other typical SEOV from different sub-genotypes (S1-S7, *S7 was considered as a result of natural reassortment between HTNV and SEOV [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]), based on partial M nucleotides sequences (1934–2353 bp, total 420 bp). A strain of HTNV was used to root the tree. Sequences marked with triangle (▲) were all extracted from GenBank. 
   <bold>b</bold> Three sites of mutation in amino acids sequences identified in 5 of 36 SEOV. The strain isolated from Qinhuangdao city, Hebei province in 1993 was used as a reference
