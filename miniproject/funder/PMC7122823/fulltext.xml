Gene-based approaches are considered as promising candidates for such flu vaccines. In our study, innate signalling molecules from the RIG-I and the NALP3 pathways were evaluated as genetic adjuvants in intramuscular DNA immunizations. Plasmids encoding a constitutive active form of RIG-I (cRIG-I), IPS-1, IL-1&#x003b2;, or IL-18 were co-administered with plasmids encoding the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein derived from H1N1/Puerto Rico/8/1934 via electroporation in BALB/c mice. Immunogenicity was analysed in detail and efficacy was demonstrated in homologous and heterologous influenza challenge experiments. Although the biological activities of the adjuvants have been confirmed by <italic>in vitro</italic> reporter assays, their single or combined inclusion in the vaccine did not result in superior vaccine efficacy. With the exception of significantly increased levels of antigen-specific IgG1 after the co-administration of IL-1&#x003b2;, there were only minor alterations concerning the immunogenicity. Since DNA electroporation alone induced substantial inflammation at the injection site, as demonstrated in this study using Mx2-Luc reporter mice, it might override the adjuvants&#x000b4; contribution to the inflammatory microenvironment and thereby minimizes the influence on the immunogenicity. Taken together, the DNA immunization was protective against subsequent challenge infections but could not be further improved by the genetic adjuvants analysed in this study.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTG1949/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tenbusch</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Intramural funding from the Ruhr-University Bochum</institution></funding-source><award-id>F787R2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tenbusch</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>M.T. was supported by grants from the German Research Foundation (RTG1949/ 1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dfg.de/">https://www.dfg.de/</ext-link>) and by intramural research funding from the Ruhr University Bochum (F787R2013; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medizin.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/forschung/foerderung.html.de">http://www.medizin.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/forschung/foerderung.html.de</ext-link>).

Groups most at risk for severe illness are young children, pregnant women, immunocompromised people, and the elderly. Currently, trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV/QIV) as well as live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV) are on the market as seasonal vaccines. TIV/QIV are aimed to induce neutralizing antibodies against the highly variable surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) but the efficacy is rather moderate especially in the elderly (50&#x02013;60%) [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, the induced antibody responses are highly strain-specific and do not lead to protection against mismatched viruses in seasons where unpredicted strains occur [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast, LAIV are able to induce cross-reactive T cell responses that provide some degree of immunity against heterologous influenza A Virus (IAV) strains [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but so far, they were only effective in children and even this efficacy varied substantially in recent years [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, alternative vaccines capable of inducing cellular and humoral immune responses that provide long-lasting protection against a broader range of IAV strains are highly desired.</p><p>The induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies able to prevent infections with multiple IAV strains is highly desirable. Unfortunately, these antibody responses are only rarely induced upon natural infection or classical vaccination approaches. Thus, more sophisticated strategies like the sequential immunization with chimeric HA variants [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or with headless HAs [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] were developed but are still under preclinical and clinical evaluation. In contrast to broadly neutralizing antibodies, cross-reactive T cell responses against conserved target proteins do not lead to a sterile immunity but can be easily induced and decrease morbidity and mortality upon an heterologous IAV infection in animal models [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Observational studies during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 have recapitulated the cross-protective potential of T cell immunity in humans [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We and others used genetic vaccines based on viral vectors or plasmid DNA to induce T cell responses against the conserved nucleoprotein (NP) [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although DNA immunizations showed promising results in these preclinical studies, they lacked immunogenicity in human individuals [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, delivery methods like the electroporation can increase the immunogenicity of naked DNA plasmids to a level suitable for use in clinical studies [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we hypothesized that the co-delivery of molecules from innate immune pathways might further increase the immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine. Specifically, the RIG-I (Retinoic acid inducible gene I) and the NALP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome axes were selected as targets because they are essential for the innate recognition of natural IAV infections and the instruction of adaptive immune responses (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). The RIG-I pathway starts with the activation of the cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I and the downstream oligomerization of its adaptor protein IPS1 (interferon-&#x003b2; promoter stimulator 1; also known as MAVS or VISA) leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN responses [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The overexpression of full-length IPS1 [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or a constitutive active variant of RIG-I (cRIG-I; [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) is sufficient to promote these responses. Several studies have shown that RIG-I pathway induction influences the initiation of T cell responses upon viral infection [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and that the efficacy of experimental IAV vaccines can be boosted by co-administration of RIG-I agonists [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The NALP3 inflammasome complex is assembled upon recognition of pathogen- or damage-associated signals. This leads to the activation of caspase-1, which in turn cleaves Interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) and Interleukin-18 (IL-18) from their inactive precursors into the bioactive forms and further facilitates their secretion (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). IL-1&#x003b2; is a highly bioactive cytokine involved in acute tissue inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Numerous studies have described the multifaceted functions of this cytokine in attracting innate and adaptive immune cells into inflamed tissues [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] as well as its direct T cell stimulatory effects [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

Therefore, pV-IPS1 was co-administered with pV-IL-1&#x003b2; and pV-IL-18, respectively, and this treatment was compared to single adjuvant treatments and to a pVax-empty control group. This time, the animals were immunized with a decreased dose of antigen-encoding vectors (pV-HA and pV-NP, 5 &#x003bc;g each) and 10 &#x003bc;g per adjuvant plasmid.

Most importantly, recent vaccines induce only strain-specific protection against IAV strains expected to circulate in the upcoming flu season. In case of a vaccine mismatch to the predominantly circulating strain in an epidemic or pandemic scenario, those vaccines do not provide any protection [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, novel vaccination strategies that establish a broad and long-lasting protection are urgently needed.</p><p>In the present study, we employed systemic DNA immunizations against IAV with genetic adjuvants derived from innate immune pathways. In particular, we tested IPS1 and constitutively active RIG-I from the RIG-I pathway and IL-1&#x003b2; as well as IL-18 from the NALP3 inflammasome pathway.</p><p>All adjuvant-encoding vaccine plasmids were tested <italic>in vitro</italic> and showed distinct bioactivity profiles. Unfortunately, the RIG-I related adjuvants did not improve the immunogenicity or protective efficacy of the DNA vaccination compared to a non-coding adjuvant plasmid. As described in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], the DNA vaccine protected mice efficiently against mortality during homologous and heterologous IAV infections <italic>per se</italic>, but no improvements were observed due to the adjuvant treatments. This was unexpected because other studies demonstrated activation of the RIG-I axis as a promising target to increase immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in BALB/c mice. In particular, Luo and colleagues co-immunized with IPS1-encoding DNA (without electroporation) and observed increased cellular but not humoral responses in mice [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, Luke et al. used DNA plasmids encoding for IAV antigens as well as encoding RIG-I agonists and reported increased humoral responses after naked DNA injection but not after additional electroporation [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These studies already indicate that activation of the RIG-I axis can potentially increase immunogenicity in naked DNA injections, but additional electroporation might provide a redundant inflammatory stimulus to the specific RIG-I axis activation. Indeed, our results demonstrate that electroporation without DNA induces Mx2 promoter activation <italic>in vivo</italic>, while electroporation with non-coding DNA further increases this inflammation, probably by activation of innate DNA sensors like AIM2 [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] or cGAS-STING [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, the addition of genetic adjuvants did not enhance the IFN-induced luciferase expression in these mice, although the signalling molecules were highly potent activators of type I IFN <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, we cautiously hypothesize that innate DNA recognition plus the electroporation-induced tissue damage might already provide a sufficient inflammation and therefore adjuvant-related inflammation could be redundant. This is in line with other studies that also reported incremental contributions of injection traumata, DNA sensing, and electroporation to tissue inflammation in the treated muscle characterized by rhabdomyolysis as well as infiltration of mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Interestingly, Liu and colleagues also tested genetic adjuvants, specifically DNA-encoded Flt3L and MIP-1&#x003b1;, and found that either electroporation or inclusion of genetic adjuvants can both increase immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine separately, but if electroporation was applied after the injection of the adjuvants, an additive effect was barely detectable [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, this might not rule out that adjuvants addressing other pathways might possess better immunostimulatory potentials in DNA electroporation [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] or that the adjuvants might have greater impact in immunizations with immunosuppressive antigens [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p>Similar to the RIG-I related adjuvants, neither IL-1&#x003b2; nor IL-18 increased the protective efficacy of our DNA vaccine. However, IL-1&#x003b2; increased antibody levels in low dose immunizations and in particular murine IgG1. As demonstrated by others, this might be the consequence of an increased CD4 T<sub>H</sub>2 expansion [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and the absence of IL-1 receptor 1 expression on T<sub>H</sub>1 cells [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. HA-specific antibody responses mostly play a role in infections with the homologous IAV strain by neutralizing the virus before cell entry. However, the increased IgG1 amount did not translate in elevated <italic>in vitro</italic> virus neutralization. In regard to secondary effector functions, murine IgG1 has a low capacity to engage activating Fc receptors and therefore should probably not enhance functions like ADCC <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In regard to the protection against heterologous IAV strains, T cell responses specific for conserved viral proteins can suppress viral replication and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality upon heterologous infection [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. NP is such a conserved viral antigen of IAV and therefore NP-specific T cell responses were evaluated in this study. However, there was no substantial influence of plasmid-encoded IL-1&#x003b2; observed and in line with that, the heterologous protection was not affected. In a former study, we used IL-1&#x003b2; as genetic adjuvant in intranasal immunizations with adenoviral vectors against IAV. There, IL-1&#x003b2; revealed strong adjuvant effects and induced an increased protection against several IAV strains [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In particular, it strongly increased the induction of tissue-resident memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the lung. Similar to the present study, intramuscular application of the viral vector encoding IL-1&#x003b2; did not enhance immunogenicity. Therefore, we claim that IL-1&#x003b2; is a strict mucosal adjuvant with only low adjuvant potential in intramuscular administrations.</p><p>In theory, IL-18 should activate a highly similar pathway to IL-1&#x003b2; signalling [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], but in our studies we could not observe any <italic>in vivo</italic> effects despite <italic>in vitro</italic> bioactivity. One explanation could be that the IL-18 receptor beta subunit is only expressed in some cell types and its absence in muscle tissue could thereby prevent <italic>in vivo</italic> activity [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Moreover, it is reported that the bioactivity of IL-18 requires synergy with IL-12 [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In addition, as argued above, the DNA injection and electroporation might activate innate pathways like AIM2, which initiate IL-1&#x003b2;/IL-18 expression as well, and thereby the additional expression of those cytokines might not provide an additional benefit. In contrast to our results, others observed adjuvant effects of IL-18 in DNA immunizations in different viral, bacterial, or malignant disease models [<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0231138.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In particular, almost all studies reported a moderate enhancement of T<sub>H</sub>1 responses. However, since electroporation was used in none of these studies as immunization technique, those results do not contradict our interpretation.</p><p>In conclusion, plasmid-encoded cRIG-I, IPS1, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-18 did not improve the immunogenicity or protective efficacy of a DNA vaccine against IAV in the context of electroporation. We suspect that the innate DNA sensing pathways in combination with the electroporation provide an almost optimal inflammation, at least in mice, which makes the adjuvants in our setting redundant. However, our study provides once again evidence that genetic vaccines can induce protective immunity against homologous and heterologous IAV strains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0231138.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Neutralization of pdm09 strain.</title><p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 &#x003bc;g pVax-HA, 10 &#x003bc;g pVax-NP, and 10 &#x003bc;g adjuvant DNA (or pVax-empty as control) via intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. 28 days after the immunization, serum samples were generated from peripheral blood and the humoral response was analysed.
