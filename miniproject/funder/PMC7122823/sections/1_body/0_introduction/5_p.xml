<p>Here, we evaluated the individual and combined use of components from the RIG-I (cRIG-I, IPS1) and NALP3 pathways (IL-1Î², IL-18) as genetic adjuvants in intramuscular DNA immunizations against influenza A virus infection. Our aim was to boost the immunogenicity in order to enhance homologous as well as heterologous immunity.</p>
