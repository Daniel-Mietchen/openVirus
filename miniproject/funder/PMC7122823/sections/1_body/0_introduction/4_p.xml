<p>In the present study, we hypothesized that the co-delivery of molecules from innate immune pathways might further increase the immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine. Specifically, the RIG-I (Retinoic acid inducible gene I) and the NALP3 (NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3) inflammasome axes were selected as targets because they are essential for the innate recognition of natural IAV infections and the instruction of adaptive immune responses (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]). The RIG-I pathway starts with the activation of the cytoplasmic RNA sensor RIG-I and the downstream oligomerization of its adaptor protein IPS1 (interferon-β promoter stimulator 1; also known as MAVS or VISA) leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I IFN responses [

 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]) is sufficient to promote these responses. Several studies have shown that RIG-I pathway induction influences the initiation of T cell responses upon viral infection [

 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and that the efficacy of experimental IAV vaccines can be boosted by co-administration of RIG-I agonists [

 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The NALP3 inflammasome complex is assembled upon recognition of pathogen- or damage-associated signals. This leads to the activation of caspase-1, which in turn cleaves Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and Interleukin-18 (IL-18) from their inactive precursors into the bioactive forms and further facilitates their secretion (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]). IL-1β is a highly bioactive cytokine involved in acute tissue inflammation [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Numerous studies have described the multifaceted functions of this cytokine in attracting innate and adaptive immune cells into inflamed tissues [

 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Similarly, IL-18 was shown to mediate the attraction of T cells [
