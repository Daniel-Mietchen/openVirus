<p>The induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies able to prevent infections with multiple IAV strains is highly desirable. Unfortunately, these antibody responses are only rarely induced upon natural infection or classical vaccination approaches. Thus, more sophisticated strategies like the sequential immunization with chimeric HA variants [

 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] were developed but are still under preclinical and clinical evaluation. In contrast to broadly neutralizing antibodies, cross-reactive T cell responses against conserved target proteins do not lead to a sterile immunity but can be easily induced and decrease morbidity and mortality upon an heterologous IAV infection in animal models [

 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Observational studies during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 have recapitulated the cross-protective potential of T cell immunity in humans [

 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We and others used genetic vaccines based on viral vectors or plasmid DNA to induce T cell responses against the conserved nucleoprotein (NP) [

 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Although DNA immunizations showed promising results in these preclinical studies, they lacked immunogenicity in human individuals [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, delivery methods like the electroporation can increase the immunogenicity of naked DNA plasmids to a level suitable for use in clinical studies [
