<p>In conclusion, plasmid-encoded cRIG-I, IPS1, IL-1Î², and IL-18 did not improve the immunogenicity or protective efficacy of a DNA vaccine against IAV in the context of electroporation. We suspect that the innate DNA sensing pathways in combination with the electroporation provide an almost optimal inflammation, at least in mice, which makes the adjuvants in our setting redundant. However, our study provides once again evidence that genetic vaccines can induce protective immunity against homologous and heterologous IAV strains.</p>
