<p>All adjuvant-encoding vaccine plasmids were tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and showed distinct bioactivity profiles. Unfortunately, the RIG-I related adjuvants did not improve the immunogenicity or protective efficacy of the DNA vaccination compared to a non-coding adjuvant plasmid. As described in previous studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], the DNA vaccine protected mice efficiently against mortality during homologous and heterologous IAV infections 
 <italic>per se</italic>, but no improvements were observed due to the adjuvant treatments. This was unexpected because other studies demonstrated activation of the RIG-I axis as a promising target to increase immunogenicity of DNA vaccines in BALB/c mice. In particular, Luo and colleagues co-immunized with IPS1-encoding DNA (without electroporation) and observed increased cellular but not humoral responses in mice [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Moreover, Luke et al. used DNA plasmids encoding for IAV antigens as well as encoding RIG-I agonists and reported increased humoral responses after naked DNA injection but not after additional electroporation [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These studies already indicate that activation of the RIG-I axis can potentially increase immunogenicity in naked DNA injections, but additional electroporation might provide a redundant inflammatory stimulus to the specific RIG-I axis activation. Indeed, our results demonstrate that electroporation without DNA induces Mx2 promoter activation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, while electroporation with non-coding DNA further increases this inflammation, probably by activation of innate DNA sensors like AIM2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] or cGAS-STING [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, the addition of genetic adjuvants did not enhance the IFN-induced luciferase expression in these mice, although the signalling molecules were highly potent activators of type I IFN 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Thus, we cautiously hypothesize that innate DNA recognition plus the electroporation-induced tissue damage might already provide a sufficient inflammation and therefore adjuvant-related inflammation could be redundant. This is in line with other studies that also reported incremental contributions of injection traumata, DNA sensing, and electroporation to tissue inflammation in the treated muscle characterized by rhabdomyolysis as well as infiltration of mast cells, eosinophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Interestingly, Liu and colleagues also tested genetic adjuvants, specifically DNA-encoded Flt3L and MIP-1Î±, and found that either electroporation or inclusion of genetic adjuvants can both increase immunogenicity of the DNA vaccine separately, but if electroporation was applied after the injection of the adjuvants, an additive effect was barely detectable [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, this might not rule out that adjuvants addressing other pathways might possess better immunostimulatory potentials in DNA electroporation [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] or that the adjuvants might have greater impact in immunizations with immunosuppressive antigens [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].
