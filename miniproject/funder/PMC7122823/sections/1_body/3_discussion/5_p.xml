<p>In theory, IL-18 should activate a highly similar pathway to IL-1β signalling [

 <italic>in vivo</italic> effects despite 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> bioactivity. One explanation could be that the IL-18 receptor beta subunit is only expressed in some cell types and its absence in muscle tissue could thereby prevent 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Moreover, it is reported that the bioactivity of IL-18 requires synergy with IL-12 [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In addition, as argued above, the DNA injection and electroporation might activate innate pathways like AIM2, which initiate IL-1β/IL-18 expression as well, and thereby the additional expression of those cytokines might not provide an additional benefit. In contrast to our results, others observed adjuvant effects of IL-18 in DNA immunizations in different viral, bacterial, or malignant disease models [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In particular, almost all studies reported a moderate enhancement of T
 <sub>H</sub>1 responses. However, since electroporation was used in none of these studies as immunization technique, those results do not contradict our interpretation.
