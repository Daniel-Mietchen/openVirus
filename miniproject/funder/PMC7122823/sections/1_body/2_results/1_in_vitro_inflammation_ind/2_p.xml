<p>As a second proof of bioactivity, we used Mx/RAGE7 reporter cells, which express the green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by the IFN-inducible Mx1 promoter [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, these cells can be used to detect type I IFNs in a quantitative manner. While IPS1 induced amounts comparable to the direct production from an IFN-α2-encoding plasmid, cRIG-I led to a somewhat lower type I IFN production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). Interestingly, cells transfected with pV-IL-18 but not pV-IL-1β produced moderate levels of type I IFNs compared to supernatants from cells transfected with a GFP-encoding plasmid as negative control. Thus, the DNA-encoded adjuvants induce specific patterns of inflammation.
