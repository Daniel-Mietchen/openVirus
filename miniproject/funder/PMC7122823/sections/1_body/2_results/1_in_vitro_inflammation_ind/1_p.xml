<p>First, we analysed whether the adjuvants show bioactivity in a murine B16 cell line. Therefore, the respective adjuvant plasmids pV-cRIG-I (constitutively active form of RIG-I), pV-IPS1 (interferon-beta promoter stimulator 1), pV-IL-1β (Interleukin-1β), or pV-IL-18 (Interleukin-18) were co-transfected with specific promoter reporter plasmids for inflammatory/apoptotic pathways and the luciferase signal, which correlates with promoter activity, was analysed. Normalized to the transfection with a control vector (indicated by the dotted line), transfection with pV-cRIG-I or pV-IPS1 strongly induced the type I IFN axis as indicated by the promoter activity for IRF3, IFN-β, and to some extent by the secondary activation of ISRE (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g001">Fig 1C and 1E</xref>) indicating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well. Regarding the NALP3 adjuvants, pV-IL-18 mainly activated the NFκB pathway but a slightly increased IFN-β and ISRE promoter activity was observed in addition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g001">Fig 1A, 1C and 1F</xref>). The expression of IL-1β induced a broader inflammation than IL-18. Beside an activation of the NFκB, IFN-β, and ISRE pathways it initiated AP-1, STAT3, and p53 signalling (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g001">Fig 1D, 1E and 1G</xref>). Although only moderately, the p53 promoter was solely affected by IL-1β but not by the other adjuvants, perhaps indicating the induction of apoptosis/pyroptosis by IL-1β.
