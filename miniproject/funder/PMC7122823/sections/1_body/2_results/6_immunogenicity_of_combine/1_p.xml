<p>Since the previous experiments did not expose an increased immunogenicity or enhanced protective efficacy by the separate inclusion of RIG-I- or NALP3-related adjuvants, we wanted to combine signalling molecules of both pathways to analyse whether any synergistic effects occur. Therefore, pV-IPS1 was co-administered with pV-IL-1β and pV-IL-18, respectively, and this treatment was compared to single adjuvant treatments and to a pVax-empty control group. This time, the animals were immunized with a decreased dose of antigen-encoding vectors (pV-HA and pV-NP, 5 μg each) and 10 μg per adjuvant plasmid. Single adjuvant groups got 10 μg pVax-empty instead of the second adjuvant. Antibody responses were analysed and displayed again an efficient induction of antibodies against the vaccine antigens NP (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) in all immunized animals. Interestingly, with the decreased antigen dose, antibody responses were slightly increased in mice that received pV-IL-1β, both as single adjuvant and in combination with pV-IPS1. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization assay did not reflect these findings (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The increase of HA-specific antibodies was probably too small to increase neutralization to the next titration step (at least 2-fold increase needed). An IgG subtype specific ELISA indicated that the increase of antigen-specific antibodies in the IL-1β-treated groups was most probably due to a specific increase of IgG1 and thereby yielded a decreased IgG2a/IgG1 ratio (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). However, synergistic effects by the combination of adjuvants were not observed with any of these methods.
