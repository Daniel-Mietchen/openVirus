<p>Next, the mice were infected with a lethal dose of the heterologous IAV strain pdm09 (5000 PFU; 10 LD
 <sub>50</sub>) to analyse the heterologous immunity. Again, the immunized mice showed an initial weight loss but started to recover around day five or six post-infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). The weight curves among the immunized groups showed no significant differences. Similarly, viral RNA copies were about 50- to 100-fold lower in immunized compared to naive mice, but there was no influence of single or combined adjuvant co-administrations on the virus replication (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). In addition, we assessed the presence of immune cells in BALF samples at day eight post-infection to get insights into the presence of adaptive and inflammatory cell types. Concerning the adaptive immune cells, there were no significant differences in the infiltration of T and B cells among the immunized groups but in general naive animals tended to show a more pronounced infiltration of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells and less CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells as well as B cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Similarly, high numbers of NK cells infiltrated the lungs of naive mice while found in substantial lower numbers in immunized animals but without quantitative differences among different adjuvant treatments. Inflammatory monocytes, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils were present in comparable numbers among naive and immunized groups, but the latter ones tended to be less frequent in the pVax and IL-1Î² treatment groups. Altogether, the experimental infection did not provide any evidence for an increased heterologous protection by the single or combined administration of genetic adjuvants.
