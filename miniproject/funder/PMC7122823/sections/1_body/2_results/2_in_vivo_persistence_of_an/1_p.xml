<p>Since the co-application of inflammatory adjuvants could potentially alter the antigen expression in terms of amount and duration, mice were immunized with 10 μg of a luciferase-encoding vector in combination with 10 μg of the adjuvant DNA (or pVax-empty). Between one and 28 days post-immunization, the luciferase activity was measured 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> by local injection of D-Luciferin. In general, the luciferase activity peaked between day three and seven after immunization and then started to decline slowly but was still detectable after 28 days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The cRIG-I group showed a significantly lower signal at the first time point but this was not recapitulated at other time points. Mice treated with IL-1β showed at seven and 14 days post treatment a lower luciferase activity but this trend did not reach statistical significance. Overall, there are no consistent differences in regard to the level and the duration of antigen expression between adjuvant-treated or control animals.
