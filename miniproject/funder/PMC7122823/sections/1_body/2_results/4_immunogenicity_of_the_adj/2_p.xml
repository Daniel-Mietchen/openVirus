<p>Next, we assessed the vaccine-induced CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses against the viral antigens. To this end, we isolated splenocytes two weeks after the immunization and restimulated them 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> with immunodominant MHC class I restricted peptides (NP
 <sub>147-155</sub> or HA
 <sub>518-526</sub>). The NP-specific response consisted predominantly of polyfunctional T cells showing production of IFN-γ and TNF-α as well as degranulation (indicated by CD107a staining) upon restimulation, while about half of those cells produced IL-2 in addition (

 <sup>+</sup> T cell response was also dominated by polyfunctional T cells and in addition significant proportions of CD107
 <sup>+</sup>IFN-γ
 <sup>+</sup> as well as CD107
 <sup>+</sup> cells were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Regarding the adjuvant treatments, no significant differences among the immunized groups could be observed. However, there was a trend to a decreased responsiveness of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells for both antigen-specificities when IL-1β was co-delivered as adjuvant. In addition, the CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses against a MHC class II restricted peptide derived from HA were analysed but showed only minor responses without significant improvements by the adjuvant treatments (
