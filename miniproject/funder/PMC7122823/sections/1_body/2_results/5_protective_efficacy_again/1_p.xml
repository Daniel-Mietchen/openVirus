<p>In order to evaluate the protective efficacy of the vaccination strategies, mice were infected with a lethal dose of H1N1 PR8 35 days after immunization (2500 PFU; 250 LD
 <sub>50</sub>). Probably due to the high neutralizing activity against PR8, the immunized animals did not experience any weight loss upon infection (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0231138.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Six-teen out of 28 immunized mice showed no detectable virus replication at all, while naive animals lost more than 20% weight and showed uncontrolled virus replication in the lung. Thus, the DNA vaccine provided rapid and efficient control against the homologous infection but from these data, we could not interpret any differences due to the adjuvant inclusion.
