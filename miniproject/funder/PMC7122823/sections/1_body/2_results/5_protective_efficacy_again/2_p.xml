<p>Next, the protective capacity against a heterologous IAV strain was investigated. 35 days post immunization, mice were challenged with a lethal dose of pdm09 (5000 PFU; 10 LD
 <sub>50</sub>). Naive animals lost almost 30% weight and reached the final end point criteria within seven days (

In contrast, morbidity was observable in all immunized groups as well but peaked at 5 days post-infection with around 10% weight loss before the mice started to recover. However, no positive effects of the adjuvant treatments were found. Similarly, virus replication was decreased by the factor of ten in the immunized mice compared to the naive group, but most of the animals showed highly similar viral loads in the lungs (

In conclusion, the intramuscular DNA vaccination against HA and NP provided efficient protection against infections with the homologous and a heterologous IAV strain but did not reveal any positive effect through the inclusion of the genetic adjuvants.
