<p>Antigen-specific antibody responses were analysed by an ELISA as described in our previous study [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In short, ELISA plates were coated with 5x10
 <sup>5</sup> PFU heat-inactivated influenza virus in 100 μl carbonate buffer (50 mM carbonate/bicarbonate, pH 9.6) per well over night at 4°C. After blocking free binding sites with 5% skimmed milk in PBS-T (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20) for one hour at RT, serum dilutions in 2% skimmed milk in PBS-T were added to the wells for one hour at RT. After three washing steps each with 200 μl PBS-T, specifically bound antibodies were detected by incubation with HRP-coupled antibodies against murine IgG1 and IgG2a, respectively, for one hour at RT (all 1:1000 dilution; clone X56 and clone R19-15; BD Biosciences). Subsequently, the plates were washed seven times with PBS-T and after the addition of ECL solution, the signal was measured on a microplate luminometer (Orion L, Titertek Berthold).
