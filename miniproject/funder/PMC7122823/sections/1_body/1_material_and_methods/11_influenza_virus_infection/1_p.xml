<p>Mice were experimentally infected with H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) or pH1N1 A/Hamburg/4/2009 (pdm09; infectious dose is indicated in the respective experimental part). Under anaesthesia (100 mg/kg ketamine and 15 mg/kg xylazine), mice got an intranasal instillation of the indicated infectious dose in a volume of 50 μl PBS. Weight loss and animal health was monitored daily until the end of the experiment, which was usually between six and eight days post-infection. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue were conducted with two times 1 ml PBS to analyse viral replication and cellular infiltration. The viral RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR as described elsewhere [
