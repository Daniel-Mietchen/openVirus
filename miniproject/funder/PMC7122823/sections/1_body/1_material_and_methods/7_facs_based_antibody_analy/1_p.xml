<p>A flow cytometric antibody analysis was performed to analyse antigen-specific antibody responses in sera [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Therefore, HEK 293T cells were transfected with plasmid DNA encoding the respective antigen of interest together with plasmids encoding a blue fluorescent protein (BFP; 5 μg BFP-encoding plasmid plus 20 μg antigen-encoding plasmid per 75 cm
 <sup>2</sup> flask). Two days later, the cells were incubated for 20 minutes at 4°C with serum samples diluted either in FACS-PBS (PBS with 0.5% BSA and 1 mM sodium azide) to bind to HA on the surface, or in permeabilization buffer (0.5% saponin in FACS-PBS) to bind to intracellular NP. After a washing step, antigen-specific antibodies were detected with polyclonal anti-mouse Ig-FITC (1:300, 4°C, 20 min incubation; BD Biosciences). The median FITC fluorescence intensity of transfected BFP
 <sup>+</sup> cells was measured on a BD FACSCanto II and analysed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.).
