<p>Antigen-encoding DNA plasmids were constructed by insertion of codon-optimized gene sequences for hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleoprotein (NP), both derived from H1N1 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8), into the pVax1 backbone (Invitrogen). Antigen expression is initiated from a CMV-immediate/early-1-promoter and a bovine BGH polyadenylation signal provides transcription termination. Similarly, murine DNA sequences encoding the adjuvants mature IL-1Î², mature IL-18 (in both constructs a TPA leader sequence was fused N-terminally to provide efficient secretion in the absence of Caspase-1-mediated processing), cRIG-I (only encoding the CARD domain from the first 284 amino acids of RIG-I), and IPS1 (full-length) were inserted into pVax1, respectively. A pVax1 backbone without insert was used as an empty vector control (pVax-empty or pVax is most figures). The integrity of the expression cassettes was confirmed by PCR and transgene expression was detected by Western blot. Plasmid DNA was prepared with the NucleoBond Xtra Maxi EF Kit (Macherey-Nagel). Endotoxin levels were measured by QCL-1000 Chromogenic LAL assay (Lonza; all preparations &lt;0.0001 endotoxin units/immunization dose).</p>
