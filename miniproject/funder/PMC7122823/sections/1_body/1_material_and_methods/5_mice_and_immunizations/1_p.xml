<p>Six to eight-weeks-old female BALB/cJRj mice were purchased from Janvier (Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) and Mx2-Luc mice were kindly provided by Mario Köster (HZI, Braunschweig, Germany). Mice were housed in individually ventilated cages in accordance with German law and institutional guidelines. The research staff was trained in animal care and handling in accordance to the FELASA and GV-SOLAS guidelines. The study was approved by an external ethics committee authorized by the North Rhine-Westphalia State Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (license 84–02.04.2013-A371). The duration of the experiments was between 7 and 43 days. A score sheet was used to recognize humane endpoints based on body weight changes, behaviour, and appearance. The most important criterion for a humane endpoint during the influenza infections was the weight loss; if an animal lost more than 30% of its weight relative the starting point of the infection or more than 25% of its weight and did not start to regain weight within 48h, the respective animal was euthanized immediately. None of the animals died during the infections before meeting these criteria.</p>
