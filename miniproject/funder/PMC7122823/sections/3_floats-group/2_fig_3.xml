  <title>Humoral responses after DNA vaccination.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 10 μg pVax-HA, 10 μg pVax-NP, and 10 μg adjuvant DNA (or pVax-empty as control) via intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. 28 days after the immunization, serum samples were generated from peripheral blood and the humoral response was analysed. (A-C) NP- and HA-expressing HEK 293T cells were incubated with serum dilutions (1:100 for NP and PR8 HA; 1:20 for pdm09 HA) and antigen-specific antibodies were measured with a FITC-conjugated detection antibody via flow cytometry. Values are depicted as mean + SEM for all groups and statistical significances were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test; #, p&lt;0.05 vs. naive; *, p&lt;0.05 vs. pVax-empty (n = 5–6 animals per group). (D) The neutralization capacity of serum samples was assessed by an 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> neutralization assay against H1N1 PR8. Depicted are individual data points for each animal and the group median. The dotted line represents the detection limit (1:10 dilution). Statistical significances were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test; #, p&lt;0.05 vs. naive; *, p&lt;0.05 vs. pVax-empty (n = 5–6 animals per group).
