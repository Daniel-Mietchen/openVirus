   <italic>In vitro</italic> bioactivity of genetic adjuvants.
  </title>
  <p>(A-G) Murine B16 cells were co-transfected with genetic adjuvants and the respective luciferase promoter reporter construct. 48 hours later, cells were lysed and the luciferase signal measured as a surrogate for respective promoter activity. Values are expressed as n-fold promoter activity relative to the co-transfection with a GFP-encoding plasmid as control. Depicted are means + SEM of triplicates. IFN-β, Interferon-β; IRF3, interferon regulatory factor 3; NFκB, nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activated B-cells; AP-1, activator protein 1; STAT3, Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3; ISRE, interferon-sensitive response element; p53, tumor protein 53. (H) HEK 293T cells were transfected with the genetic adjuvants, an IFN-α2-encoding plasmid as positive control, or a GFP-encoding plasmid as negative control. 48 hours later, supernatants were transferred on Mx/RAGE7 reporter cells. The type I IFN-induced GFP expression in the reporter cells was assessed by flow cytometry 72 h later. Depicted is the percentage of GFP+ cells (+ SEM) within the live cell compartment. Statistical significances were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test; *, p&lt;0.05 vs. GFP.</p>
