  <title>Antigen persistence and antigen-independent protection after adjuvant treatment.</title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 20 μg luciferase-encoding plasmid and 10 μg adjuvant DNA (or pVax-empty as control) via intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. (A) At the indicated time points after immunization, 200 μg D-luciferin were injected into both legs and the luciferase signal was measured. The values for individual mice (mean of both legs) are shown and the bars represent the median for the group. Statistical significances were analysed by non-parametric two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's multiple comparisons test; *, p&lt;0.05 vs. pVax-empty (n = 3–6 animals per group). (B-E) 35 days after the immunization, mice were infected with 250 PFU H1N1 PR8 and the weight loss was monitored daily (B+D). Six days post-infection, mice were euthanized, bronchoalveolar lavages were performed, and virus replication was analysed by qRT-PCR in those samples (C+E). Weight loss is depicted as mean ± SEM and the results of the qRT-PCR are displayed as individual data point for each animal and the group median (n = 3–4 animals per group).</p>
