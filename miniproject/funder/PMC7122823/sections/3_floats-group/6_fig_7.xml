  <title>CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell kinetic after DNA vaccination with combined adjuvants.
  </title>
  <p>BALB/c mice were immunized with 5 μg pVax-HA, 5 μg pVax-NP, and 10 μg of each adjuvant DNA via intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. At the indicated time points after immunization, peripheral blood was drawn to analyse the CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cell response. (A-B) Lymphocytes were restimulated with the immunodominant MHC I restricted peptides from NP (NP
   <sub>147-155</sub>; B+D) or HA (HA
   <sub>518-526</sub>; A+C) and antigen-specific CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells were identified by their secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α as well as by the staining of CD107
   <sup>+</sup> as degranulation marker. Depicted is the percentage of all CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells that express IFN-γ (independent of other cytokines; A+B) and the percentage of CD8
   <sup>+</sup> T cells that show a polyfunctional profile (CD107
   <sup>+</sup>IFN-γ
   <sup>+</sup>TNF-α
   <sup>+</sup>IL-2
   <sup>+</sup>; C+D). Mean values with standard error of the mean (SEM) represent data from four mice per group. #, p &lt; 0.05 vs. naive; *, p &lt; 0.05 vs. pVax-empty (Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn's post-test).
