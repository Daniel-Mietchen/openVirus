  <p>Frequency and Gaussian distribution of saliva volume in 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. The average saliva volume produced by 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, was determined by forcing mosquitoes to salivate into a calibrated capillary tube (0.2 mm inner diameter) filled with immersion oil type B. Twenty six mosquitoes were allowed to salivate into the oil at room temperature for 1 h. (
   <bold>A</bold>) An image of a capillary with saliva was captured after the mosquito expectorated. The height of saliva was measured using a digital fractional caliper (presicion: ±0.02 mm). The volume of saliva was calculated using the cylinder volume formula (V = π(r
   <sup>2</sup> × h) = 3.1416× 0.01 × h = mm
   <sup>3</sup> or µL). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Frequency distribution (histogram) and Gaussian distribution using GraphPad Prism software. The mean value at the center of the distribution and SD is a measure of the width of the distribution. 
   <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes salivated an average of 6.82 ± 2.88 nL. (
   <bold>C</bold>) R99659 titers were determined from a range of saliva volumes between 1.8 and 7 nL. We did not see a strong correlation between virus titers in salivary gland and the volume of saliva. Arrow indicates saliva descending volumes between 7.1 nL and 1.88 nL.
