  <p>Correlation between CHIKV titers of saliva and salivary glands. The presence of a salivary gland escape barrier (SGEB) was tested by correlating CHIKV titers in salivary glands with virus titers in saliva. Saliva was collected at 9 days post infection and then salivary glands were dissected from the same mosquitoes. Virus titers from salivary glands and saliva were determined by plaque assays. (
