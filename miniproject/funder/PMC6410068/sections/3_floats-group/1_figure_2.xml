  <p>Transmission efficiency rate (TER) assay of CHIKVs in four 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains. The TER (prevalence) and virus titer were determined for 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (three U.S. strains and the La Réunion strain) orally infected with either CHIKV R99659 (blood meal virus titer 5.6 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> pfu/mL) or CHIKV LR2006 OPY1 (blood meal virus titer 6.6 × 10
   <sup>7</sup> pfu/mL). Virus titers were determined 9 days later in saliva by plaque assay. Saliva for each female was collected using forced saliva capillary method. The number of mosquitoes assayed from each mosquito and CHIKV strain and the prevalence (% infection) are listed. Horizontal bars show mean titer values with SEM. 
   <italic>p</italic> value of virus titers among the 
   <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains infected with either R99659 or LR2006 OPY1 were 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.012 and 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.7544, respectively.
