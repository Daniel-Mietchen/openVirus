 <p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a medically important mosquito-borne virus transmitted to humans by infected 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> (
  <italic>Stegomyia</italic>) species. In 2013–2014, 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> transmitted CHIKV to humans in the Caribbean and in 2005–2006, 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> transmitted CHIKV on La Réunion Island (Indian Ocean basin). CHIKV LR2006 OPY1 from the La Réunion epidemic was associated with a mutation (E1:A226V) in the viral E1 glycoprotein that enhanced CHIKV transmission by 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. CHIKV R99659 from the Caribbean outbreak did not have the E1:A226V mutation. Here, we analyzed the salivary glands and saliva of 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains from New Jersey, Florida, Louisiana and La Réunion after infection with each virus to determine their transmission potential. We infected the 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains with blood meals containing 3–7 × 10
  <sup>7</sup> PFU/mL of each virus and analyzed the mosquitoes nine days later to maximize infection of their salivary glands. All four 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains were highly susceptible to LR2006 OPY1 and R99659 viruses and their CHIKV disseminated infection rates (DIR) were statistically similar (
  <italic>p</italic> = 0.3916). The transmission efficiency rate (TER) was significantly lower for R99659 virus compared to LR2006 OPY1 virus in all 
  <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains and 
  <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (Poza Rica) (
  <italic>p</italic> = 0.012) suggesting a salivary gland exit barrier to R99659 virus not seen with LR2006 OPY1 infections. If introduced, LR2006 OPY1 virus poses an increased risk of transmission by both 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> species in the western hemisphere.
