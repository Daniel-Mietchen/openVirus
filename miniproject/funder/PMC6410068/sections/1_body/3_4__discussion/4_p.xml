<p>We found no correlation between the virus titer in the salivary gland and virus titers in the saliva (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f004">Figure 4</xref>) and demonstrated in our 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> model that the volume of saliva does not influence virus titers in saliva (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-10-00039-f005">Figure 5</xref>). Although we have not measured saliva volume from 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> or correlated their saliva volume with virus titer, this will be a topic of future experiments. CHIKV provides evidence of how an arbovirus can acquire the capacity for efficient transmission by a new vector mosquito species with unfortunate medical outcomes. During the CHIKV’s emergence in the Indian Ocean basin, it acquired a mutation in the coding sequence of the envelope glycoprotein E1 that resulted in the substitution of a valine for an alanine at position 226 (A226V) of E1 [
 <xref rid="B12-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. CHIKV with this mutation increased the vector competence of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> for LR2006 OPY1 [
 <xref rid="B10-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Interestingly, the CHIKV that was introduced into the Caribbean in 2013 lacked the A226V mutation, and this mutation has not yet been detected in CHIKVs from the Americas [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Given that arboviruses are subject to antiviral pressures from the mosquito, arboviral genome diversity in infected mosquito vectors likely allowed selection of CHIKV-IOL that were better adapted to 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> to ensure the virus’ survival and transmission [
