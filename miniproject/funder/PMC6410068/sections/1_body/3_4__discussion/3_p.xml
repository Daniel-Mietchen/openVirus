<p>Although the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains had statistically similar DIRs for both CHIKVs, the TER for CHIKV R99659 virus was significantly lower in all mosquito strains (
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>) than the LR2006 OPY1 virus (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.012) suggesting the LR2006 OPY1 virus is more efficiently transmitted than R99659 virus. The New Jersey strain had lower TER values than the other 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> strains tested suggesting that population was less able to transmit CHIKV. Our results support earlier reports that noted similar DIR and TER outcomes for CHIKVs in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> populations originating in the Americas [
